abdozd,10,2018-12-31,"""Inheritance"" with ""rules"" attached",zanellaice,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/abdozd/inheritance_with_rules_attached/,"It isn't quite an inheritance, but I received $5,000 from my grandparents and can use it however I'd like, however, they'll give me 10% of what's left at the end of the year for up to 10 years (maximum $500 per year). So if I have a ""full"" balance every year for 10 years instead of spending it all, I'll net $10k instead of $5k. 

I'm trying to find the best use of this money. 

**Current Debt:** Student loans total just over $30k and with varying interest rates from 3.5% - 4.6% (every year was a different interest rate). The average interest rate is \~4%. No car payment or mortgage. 

**Current situation:** I bring home $3k per month, post taxes. I support my partner, since her parents recently abandoned her and she doesn't have a paying job because she's in her last year of school and needs to do an unpaid internship to graduate. My monthly expenses are around $2,800 and includes rent, utilities, groceries, car + renters insurance, student loan payments, cell phone, and dog expenses (all for both me and my partner). 

**My thoughts:** Since my company doesn't have a retirement plan yet (in the works and will be some time 2019), I've considered throwing it in an IRA. I've thought about how my loan interest over the next 10 years might accumulate more than $5k, so it might not be worth keeping a ""full"" balance every year. I also know I need to have at least a 3-month emergency fund, preferably 6 months though and right now I don't even have 1 month's worth (only about $1,500 in savings).

What do you think is the best use of the money? Throw it all into savings? Into an IRA? All at student loans? Some combination of the 3?

abeeou,4,2018-12-31,The ups and downs of a weight loss journey in progress,srac500_panther,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/abeeou/the_ups_and_downs_of_a_weight_loss_journey_in/,"Hey all, just wanted to put this out there to keep myself accountable. I have had a really long journey (much longer than it had to be lol) and its just getting started. In 2019, my resolution is to get down to 180 lbs with a much lower bf %

&amp;#x200B;

Original (July 2017): 6'1, 250 lbs, bf: unknown

Now (Dec 31 2018): 6'1 210 lbs, bf: 31%

&amp;#x200B;

I have been overweight or obese my entire life and coupled with horrific acne, my self esteem in freshman year went down to 0. During June of 2017, I went on a vacation with my extended family and I was treated as 'special' or 'different' from everyone else due to my weight. When I came back home, I had a tearful breakdown in front of my parents and decided to go on a weight loss journey. This would be my first successful weight loss endeavor. I lost 25 lbs from July to November of 2017 to a weight of 225 lbs. I was very happy at my transformation but still had an extremely low self esteem (I was still obese and looked like Jabba the Hutt lol). However, I got derailed by a plateau during the first half of November and then the Holiday Season where I didn't have the will to stick to my meal plan. I bubbled back up to 233 lbs.

&amp;#x200B;

From January to April, I steadily lost weight and went from 233 to 226 lbs. I wanted to then embark on a huge transformation. this was completely derailed by the AP exam, SAT subject test, and Final exam season which stressed me out so much because I was taking 5 AP tests, 2 Subject tests, and 4 Finals. During this time, I ate a lot of junk food to cope with my stress. I went from 226 lbs to 238 lbs within 2 months. I felt miserable at the end of the year because I felt like so much of my hard work was for naught. I was still made fun of for my appearance. I made a resolution to lose as much weight as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

This weight loss period from summer 2018 to about November 2018 was the most incredible transformation period I have had as I developed so much physically, mentally, and emotionally. On the physical side, I dropped from 238 lbs to 203 lbs ( - 35 lbs from June, -47 from beginning). My looks drastically improved and I built a lot of confidence in myself. I started weight training during mid October to start building muscle as well. However, since the beginning of November, I just completely lost most of my motivation for weight loss. I still really wanted to lose weight and build muscle but I started eating junk food again because I was simply missing it and craving it so much. I once again ballooned to a weight of 213 lbs over the course fo 2 months. Of this 3 lbs was water weight and as I am writing this, I weigh 210 lbs. 

&amp;#x200B;

This huge journey has been extremely tiring as a I have been yo yo ing my way down. I have huge cravings and it doesn't help that my family loves eating good food everyday. Next semester in school will be much harder for me (all APs) and I have a bunch of other things (clubs, extracurriculars, internships, exams season) going on as well. I DO NOT want to go back up more because then all of my work so far would have been in vain. I want to get into a habit of workout and strict diet at least 6 days of the week. I know that if this habit doesn't form, I will most definitely skyrocket back up to my initial weight or more, knowing my weakness to stress eat, bore eat, or just plain overeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

My goal for next year(2019) is to go down to 180 lbs coupled with a dramatic decrease in bf %. I really think I can carry this out if I try a -500 cal CICO and weight train coupled with Orange Theory Fitness as I have been trying to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will join the Pokemon Challenge in January and the (PLEASE BE GoT ) Spring challenge in April.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

abejeb,4,2018-12-31,I was just let go from my job on New Years Eve Day.,damnpixie,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/abejeb/i_was_just_let_go_from_my_job_on_new_years_eve_day/,"I just want to write and get stuff off my chest. I'm sorry if it's long. Warning: Long.

The last 2 years have been crazy. I left my narcissistic ex in early 2017 - he wasn't a bad guy, but I figured out he cared less about me and more about what I/others could do for him. It was like a slap in the face. But I met this guy who I honestly believe is the love of my life, shortly after we split up - it was so soon, and I had to get over some of my trust issues, but he's just this amazing guy. He's just gorgeous. He's sweet and selfless. He wants to work through all our problems and grow old together.  

And he asked me to move in with him and his 3 teenage kids earlier this year. He trusted me enough to do that. He has a civil servant job and doesn't make a lot of money, and I try to pitch in financially and with any housework that I can. I bought some nice gifts for the kids this Christmas, paid for with my credit card because I thought, hey, I'll make up the money in less than 2 weeks once I go back to work. The gifts weren't stupid extravagant things, but nice things like bedspreads that they can take to college, which they loved. They're still a little uncomfortable around me, but they're good kids, and we're making progress in getting to know each other. 


For the past few years, I'd been in this super toxic job. It was in the behavioral health field where most of the managers were just nasty crazy people. Not all, but the ones I had to deal with were. I got my PhD and the people at this place were like ""Nope, we're not going to honor our agreement to renegotiate your salary. You think you're pretty smart, and you kind of are, but we'll tell you how to do your job."" Infuriating, demeaning stuff like that, where if you fight back it just makes you look like a trouble-maker (and several people who did fight back got fired in some of the most messed up ways). I'm serious, these people were mean, racist, narcissistic, just... ugh. 

So two months ago, I was finally offered a contract position at a large financial institution. Contract work is risky, but oh my god I didn't have to put up with abuse anymore. I jumped on it. I spent the next two months bored out of my mind with constantly changing project objectives and supervisors who didn't seem to know exactly what they were talking about, but I was so happy not to have to deal with passive aggressive put-downs or my whiny, demanding, micromanaging supervisor from the prior job. It was so much better, and paid better. Until I just got notice that I was laid off.

My recruiter was unable to tell me why. She was so apologetic that she had to tell me tonight and vowed to work with me on Wednesday to find out why, and to find another job. From what I understood, I was doing great! She'd heard that too. So we think it was a budget decision. 

I'm scared and relieved. I want to find something where the workload is closer to my expertise and the pay is more commensurate with my level of education. My boyfriend, bless his soul, offered to carry me with what little he has. When it comes to my bills, I just can't let myself be a burden to him and I'll wait tables or do retail until I can find the right job. My bills are pretty light, but I'll run out of savings in a few months.  

If I had money, I'd start a non-profit. My dream is to create something that would benefit people - and I had planned to do that next year, while a full-time job paid the bills. I know exactly what I'd do.... it would be beautiful. 

I can also apply for jobs in academia. That may be more suitable for me than the corporate world. I messed up, though - I went to an online school for my degree - it's accredited - because I was able to maintain a full time job, support my ex, do internships, and go to school full time all at the same time. I didn't focus on publishing papers. However, I have a ton of company-based research and program evaluation under my belt...  I'm going to see if that will fly. 

Am I narcissistic myself for putting this out there and thinking someone is going to read it all the way through? This feels like one of those cheesy ""dear diary"" entries. ""Dear Diary, WTF am I supposed to do now?""

I've never been in love like this before, and I've never been let go, either. I think the universe is pushing me in a specific direction. 

Thank you for reading. I appreciate you, person that I haven't met.

abf3zk,45,2018-12-31,Head Coaching Candidates,TylerHans1,AZCardinals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AZCardinals/comments/abf3zk/head_coaching_candidates/,"Hey just wanted to make a thread of a few head coaching candidates that have been linked to us, other teams are interviewing, or guys we just like

-Dan Campbell- (42 years old, Saints TE Coach &amp; Assistant HC)

As a player Campbell was a tight end that most notably was a good mentor and leader under the locker room and played under Sean Payton and Bill Parcells. As a coach he started as a coaching intern in 2010 for the Miami Dolphins under Tony Sparano. He then became the tight ends coach for the Dolphins once they hired Joe Philbin. During the 2015 season he became the interim head coach once the dolphins fired Joe Philbin at week 4 where he went 5-7 for the rest of the season. He was highly praised for fixing a disfunctional locker room at Miami which was why Philbin was fired. After the season he was reunited with Sean Payton as the Saints Tight End and Assistant Coach where he is currently. He did have interest from the Dolphins and Colts previously for head coaching vaccancies. He is known as a leader, tough, and having a lot of energy. Currently he is drawing interest from the Browns, Packers, Cardinals, and Dolphins. 

-Zac Taylor- (35 years old, Rams QB Coach)

A former Quarterback who didn't really gain much traction in the pros, Taylor started coaching at Texas A&amp;M as a graduate assistant. He then was hired in Miami in 2012 under Joe Philbin where he started as an assistant QB coach and then the QB coach during the 2013 season until 2015 when Dan Campbell replaced Joe Phiblin as the Coach in week four where he was promoted to Offensive Coordinator and QB coach. In 2016 he went back to college as the OC and QB coach for Cincinnati. In 2017 he was hired as an assistant wide receiver coach for the Rams and then in 2018 he was promoted to QB coach. McVay has said Taylor is instrumental in their third down planning and Taylor is regarded as a rising assistant in the professionals. He is drawing interest from the Cardinals, Bengals, and Broncos.

-Eric Bieniemy- (49 years old, Chiefs OC)

A running back as a player his success in college didn't translate well into the pros. He started as a coach with his college team Colorado in 2001 as the teams running back coach where he finished his degree. In 2003 he went to UCLA where he took the same position. In 2006 he went to the Vikings as the running back coach where in 2010 he was promoted to Assistant Head coach for offense. At the end of the year in 2010 he returned to Colorado as the Offensive Coordinator where he stayed until 2013 where he went to Kansas City as the running backs coach under Andy Reid. In 2018 he was promoted to Offensive Coordinator. Mahomes has highly praised him for being an amazing coach. He is basically drawing interest from everyone but specifically the Cardinals, Jets, Dolphins, Bucs, and probably more. 

-Freddie Kitchens- (44 years old, Browns Interim OC)

A college QB, Kitchens has been to a lot of places coaching in a lot of different roles. Starting in Glenville St in 1999 as the running back and tight ends coach, he went to LSU in 2000 as a graduate assistant. Then to North Texas in 2001 as a running backs coach. In 2004 he went to Mississippi St as the tight ends coach and in 2005 he switched roles as Mississippi St as the running backs coach. Then in 2006 he was the Dallas Cowboys Tight end coach until he moved to the Cardinals in 2007 as the Tight Ends coach. In 2013 he changed roles to the Quarterback Coach for the Cardinals and then again in 2016 as the Running Back Coach. After Arians retired Kitchens went to Cleveland where he was hired as the running back and assistant coach but when Hue Jackson and Todd Haley were fired midseason he became the offensive coordinator. He has had great success as the OC in Cleveland and Mayfield really likes him plus he was with the Cardinals for quite a while. He is only drawing interest from the Browns for now.

-Adam Gase- (40 years old, Dolphins ex-HC)

Gase recently fired from the Dolphins is drawing interest in the league. Starting as an assistant to the coaching staff in Michigan State, he went to LSU as a graduate assistant and then a recruiting assistant in 2001. In 2003 he went to the Lions as a recruiting assistant then an offensive assistant in 2005 and then a QB coach in 2007. In 2008 he went to the 49ers as a Offensive assistant. Then in 2009 he went to the Broncos where he started as a WR coach the in 2010 he became the QB coach. 2013 he became the OC in Denver and in 2015 he took the same job for the Bears. Then he became the Head Coach for the Dolphins in 2016 where he had a record of 23-25 and one post season appearance that they lost. Peyton Manning is a huge fan of him and he is currently getting strong interest from the Browns along with a lot of other teams he has reportedly gotten calls from (no one specific to my knowledge).

-Mike McCarthy- (55 years old, Packers ex-HC)

For McCarthy I'm going to skip a few of his old coaching gigs. Just know before being a head coach for the Packers he was the QB coach for the Chiefs and Packers and the the OC for the Saints and 49ers. For for the Packers McCarthy has been 125-77-2, is 10-8 in the postseason, but the past two seasons have both been losing records. In 2007 he was the Head Coach of the year and oh yeah he one a super bowl. He was fired this year due to lack of innovation in offense and rumored that Rodgers wanted him out. However he is still regarded as a great coach in an Andy Reid situation where he could succeed in a new organization. McCarthy is getting interest from the Cardinals (even tough reports say he isn't), Broncos, Browns, and possibly the Jets.

I think that's good for now, feel free to mention other guys you'd like us to get but heres a list of other candidates that the Cardinals I don't think will be interested in or get but you guys may be interested in:

Jim Caldwell (ex Lions HC), Josh McDanials (Pats OC), and Chuck Pagano (ex Colts HC).

abfrg6,11,2019-01-01,Blackmailed to come out to my family.. scared to go back,KookyMood,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/abfrg6/blackmailed_to_come_out_to_my_family_scared_to_go/,"So I came out to my family at the end of the summer. A neighbor took a video of me kissing a guy on my balcony and told other neighbors about my sexual orientation. Now, I'm from a traditionally muslim country so you can see how this could be an issue. (Thankfully it hasn't been yet) I was told by one of my best friends who is the son of a neighbor that was told. He (and his father who had no problem with it) basically urged me to come out or otherwise my father would hear it from someone else and it would do a lot more damage. So I bit the bullet and told both my parents on the same night separately.  I've told my mother about 5-6 years ago but she was in denial this entire time. When I told her about why I had to come out now, lets say she was not pleased. (In the middle east we have that heavy 'what will the neighbors think/say' culture) She said if my father found out there was a video or that other people like his friends/neighbors knew about me, it would kill him. So I decided to omit this part and just come out to him without all the baggage. 

He took it well enough. I asked both of them if their love had changed for me and they said no which is good. I explained to them that I understood this is a process, that they have to come to terms with it like I have. 

Then my father asked me if anyone else knew and I told him my friend (the neighbors son that tipped me off from earlier) knew (even though basically all my friends know I'm gay and I had no issue with it) and he got very angry. How could I tell him? He would tell his dad and did I know what would people think etc.  Then he told me he acknowledges that I'm gay but if he hears about it again from anyone else I'm not welcome under his roof. 

This all happened at the end of summer and I basically escaped this whole situation by going back to med school and have been living with a friend  since then (I study in a European country, final year of med school which means I could have done my internships back home but chose to bounce)  I've been depressed for a long time but my depression had never been this bad. Suicidal ideation is something I constantly lived with until about a month ago. I started getting help. Started therapy and started talking to my friends again. My best friends have helped me get through this difficult time, literally on suicide watch. Even though I'm not back at 100% yet, I'm slowly getting there. 

So right now I'm in a weird place and I need advice. I'm going back home soon and have to live with my parents for a couple months. I'm an out gay man but this whole thing has kind of forced me back into the closet and its really kicking my depression to high gear. I'm scared my depression will get worse once I'm actually living with them and will not have my friends as a support network. I know I can always facetime them and text them but I'm scared of feeling isolated. 

And what if my father finds out about everything that went down? What will happen then? The anxiety of this question is what made me bounce to europe in the first place. "

It's 2019 now, and I'm planning my year and what I want to do with it. And one of the things I'm thinking about is following through on a plan to move to Utah this year to be closer to family. I've been living in Europe for years and it's been really great, but I lived in Utah years ago for school and loved that as well. Now I'm trying to find out about the job market, because it'd be terrible to come back and not be able to find employment.

I followed the rules and did a a search, which came up with some threads like this:

* [Salt Lake's Job Market is like living in the 90's again!](https://old.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/357edv/salt_lakes_job_market_is_like_living_in_the_90s/)
* [SLC area job market](https://old.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/22tecd/slc_area_job_market/)
* [Another 'moving to SLC' thread. But I did read up, I promise!](https://old.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1n09n3/another_moving_to_slc_thread_but_i_did_read_up/)
* [What's the analytics job market in Utah](https://old.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/8lndlv/whats_the_analytics_job_market_in_utah/)

So far so good, but the threads are all pretty old. I've also seen [sources](https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ut.htm) [indicate](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900044084/this-utah-city-has-the-most-diverse-job-market-in-the-us.html) that [employment](https://eu.thespectrum.com/story/news/2018/09/23/utah-ranks-high-job-growth-unemployment-rate/1405054002/) is [fairly](https://kutv.com/news/local/utahs-job-market-shows-significant-growth-by-adding-over-57000-jobs) [strong](https://www.ksl.com/article/46402085/in-utahs-robust-job-market-strong-education-or-specialized-training-needed), and I've also seen that a number of firms have moved to the area since I've been gone — Adobe, Intel/Micron, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Oracle, as well as Utah firms like Domo and Qualtrics.  So far so good. But how has *your* experience been?

I am a data science consultant in the professional services Big 4, and have some internships and work time under my belt doing IT and tech at a couple of Big N tech firms. If someone asked me how to tune parameters on a neural network, I'd be out of my element, but I have a fair amount of BI experience and writing in languages like R, and certs for software like Tableau.

So how's the job market there? Is it still awesome and I don't need to worry too much, or has it gotten more difficult since some of those older threads?

Happy new year!"

For the past ~4 years, my anxiety issues that have pretty much always been there have grown to now become truly crippling in some specific situations. I tried therapy twice over this course. Although it was going OK, it was simply too expensive for me at the time. Both therapists I have seen were 100% sure I have social anxiety (which now manifests in fewer situations, though it comes with much higher intensity). They have also said I might have borderline personality disorder (BPD), but I have not stayed in therapy long enough for them to be 100% sure of this diagnosis.  
Due to my worsening condition (and thanks to the fact I know have enough money for that), I have begun to take new steps towards getting help, and should start therapy+medication very soon.

  
A year and a half ago, I started working at my first job in my field of study. It is a small company (about 10 people). Everyone has been very welcoming and helpful during my internship (the first few months I spent here before getting actually hired). They are still very much friendly and helpful to this day, now that I have been part of the company as a fulltime employee for more than a year. Due to the isolation I have been facing these past few years, this has truly been a stroke of luck. As a result, and even though the times are not the best for the company, I have grown very attached to my coworkers.  

One of them in particular ([30F], we'll call her C), has done a lot for me. The company has one very demanding, strict and difficult customer. For the past two years or so, she was the only one with the appropriate training required to work for them. My internship period was the ideal opportunity for her and the company to train me so that we could form a duo able to work for this customer.  

This was a very difficult time in my life where I had begun to feel very suicidal. C was one of the few people who made me think ending it was not worth it. She was the perfect mentor and, while working for that particular customer has never really been fulfilling nor extremely interesting, I have always looked forward to it thanks to this great learning experience. The fact that I could laugh and feel good while finding fulfillment from work (which was 99% born from the working relationship rather than work itself) in such times was quite amazing.  

At the end of my internship, she was very happy with my work and with me as a coworker (personality-wise, which was pretty much the last thing I expected someone to ever say about me, especially at this time) and made it clear to the head of the company that I should definitely be hired as a fulltime employee.  

Now, my anxiety/borderline/whatever issues get a thousand times worse with people I like/respect/look up to. You may guess where this is going.  

My coworkers have all been welcoming and friendly despite the fact that the anxiety can make me seem aloof, unexpressive or completely indifferent. There have been days where I could not say anything more than my greetings and goodbyes. I can't help but think that striking my coworkers as being this indifferent and ungrateful towards them, and especially towards C, who has done so much, will inevitably destroy what little relationships we have. It is especially killing me since some of my coworkers even seem to inexplicably like me and want to make me feel welcome despite all that. I am 100% sure there have been times when I made C frustrated/tired of me due to the way I had been acting, only to have a genuine laugh with me a bit later as if no harm had been done.  

Very recently (in the last 1 or 2 months), my issues have gotten a lot worse. I speak less and less, I eat very little and I started having these situations where I vomit very hard (heart going insane, some blood pouring, crazy post-vomiting petechiae) after/before interacting with C in particular.  

I am wondering whether I should explain to C what is going on so that at least one coworker (the one I trust most and who has to deal most often with what my issues make me act/look like) understands me and does not think I am simply an ungrateful asshole who does not care one bit about people who are kind to him.  

tldr: My anxiety (mainly) issues have been getting worse and this will most certainly start taking a huge toll on my workplace relationships, which I care about a LOT. Should I tell coworker [30F] (who has done a lot for me and whom I trust) about this so that at least she knows I am very appreciative and not an actual jerk?"

Happy New Year, everyone. Hope your 2018 was wonderful, and that your 2019 will be more so!

Ah, 2018 has been a fun year for Subreddit Of the Day. It's has its [ups] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/8xax4q/july_9th_2018_rthanosdidnothingwrong_snap/) and its [downs] (https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/95w84p/august_9th_2018_ryiffinhell_the_human_resistance/), but overall, it's been an excellent year for us. We've had some changes to how the sub functions, we're likely going to have more in the near future; you may have noticed a few differences (they're fairly minor, in fairness).


## Writers


We took on approximately 33 interns this year (and we got an extra 2 just today!)  Out of those interns, we gained 8 Full Time Writers! They've been the ones primarily writing the features this year.

## The Discord

We decided to make a SRotD Discord. Isn't really much too it at the moment. You can join it [here] (https://discord.gg/bZYNRzC) if you want to chat about SROTD, talk to us mods, or rant about how stupid our sub is.

## Mission Statement

When this sub began, our mission statement was this: **""Bringing The Awesome""**. Our goal was to feature the best and most awesome subs we could, every damn day. In 2016 however, we changed that mission statement; we felt that many of the subs we featured weren't ""awesome"" in the traditional sense. Ones that many people would dislike, due to them being political subs, or LGBT subs, or just subs that would be fairly controversial to the masses.

But this year, we decided to change it back. Featuring a ton of controversial subs helped us grow. Substantially so. But we felt that SRotD wasn't made for that. SRotD was made to feature good subreddits that deserve the spotlight. We wanted to be the sub that people come to for cool subs and shit, not to see the latest controversy. We decided, once more, that we would Bring The Awesome, every single day. And hopefully, it'll stay that way, for years to come. Can we guarantee that we won't feature a controversial sub way in the future? Realistically, no, we'll probably end up featuring a sub that nobody likes at some point. That's just statistics. But I can guarantee that we will try our hardest to feature the best subs we possibly can, until ~~we get bored and quit~~ the end of time!

&amp;nbsp;

abis06,1,2019-01-01,Anxiety is making me want to quit my job.,cyberisms,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/abis06/anxiety_is_making_me_want_to_quit_my_job/,"I’ve never posted about mental health stuff before, so I am a little nervous.

I have generalised anxiety disorder but I’m an extremely socially awkward person. I overthink everything I say, I mess words up, I will think about conversations I had weeks ago just because I messed up once and it will really eat away at me although I know the other person probably long forgot it. I never went to college as I cried the second I walk through the door and just turned around and left every single day. I’ve been like this my entire life, at school I used to wait outside the door to my classroom then just hide in the toilet for the remainder of the lesson, I’d basically just try and avoid everything.

This has now passed into my daily work life. Every day I get on the bus to work I cry, I’ve had panic attacks at work but just played it off that I was feeling sick, I’m just constantly in panic mode and no matter what therapy I get and how much they tell me it’s just an overthinking issue and I need to think more rationally, it still doesn’t work. 

I work Monday - Friday 9am - 6pm, pretty standard work hours and I’m a social media executive (I worked really hard to get this job, lots of intern work while working in retail as I didn’t have any qualifications other than GCSE’s). For part of last year up until Christmas I went part time as I had surgery done and only done full days every other day and that worked so well for me, my anxiety wasn’t as consistent, I was sleeping enough as I have pretty bad sleeping issues and still finishing the work I had to do at work. Now they’re telling me they need me back full time and I have no option other than that, and I’m honestly terrified. They know I have quite bad anxiety and my social awkwardness is pretty obvious. But I just want to quit. I feel like I’m being lazy but every day exhausts me and I just don’t know what to do about it. I don’t want to hate going to work, I don’t want to hate doing things I need to do to survive. I’m always late because I wake up every day trying to put off the minute I have to leave, which they also get angry at me for.

I know I need to push myself to just do it, but the amount of energy I have to do it is literally zero. I just have days I want to lock myself in my room and stay in bed all day so I don’t exhaust myself from crying.

How do you deal with this? What motivates you? [i’m also 19F from the UK if this helps at all]"
abjeqp,48,2019-01-01,My Boss and Her Son (Part 4 of 4),pervertaccount1,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/abjeqp/my_boss_and_her_son_part_4_of_4/,"I thrust into her hand as far as I could, feeling the head of my cock pass through her grip and dip just inside the entrance of her pussy. I stopped and held there for a moment to regain composure. I relaxed my grip on her hips and slowly drug my hands across her ass. Either confused or frustrated, she started to stroke me with the same hand that had been preventing us from full penetration. I let her stroke my cock, but I didn't give in. I stopped thrusting and stood completely still. I refused to continue playing “just the tip” with her. For a brief moment she stopped making out with her son, and she questioned why I remained motionless with just the tip of my penis inside her. There was frustration in her voice.

“Why did you stop? Just keep going, *please!* Keep going more! Go back inside, please, just a little bit. I need this. I need you inside me!” I felt like torturing her the same way she tortured me.

Sophia continued kissing her son as she tried to tug the tip of my penis back into her, and I started to gently knead and massage her ass. However, I still refused to thrust inside her as long as her hand acted as a barrier. A moment passed and she seemingly forgot about me as her tongue entertained her son's. I carefully moved my hands off her ass and gently grabbed her by the wrist. Slowly, without any forcefulness at all, I peeled her hand away from my shaft to remove the barrier. I could finally look down and see the unobstructed view my cock just barely penetrating her. Sophia finished removing her hand using her own free will, then slipped it underneath her t-shirt. It looked like she was pinching and teasing her nipple, but I couldn't be sure.

With just the tip of my penis inside her, I placed my hands back on her ass and continued a gentle massage. The room was still silent except for the sound of a mother's lips greeting her son's. I gripped her ass firmly and squeezed, spreading apart her cheeks to expose all of her. I looked up and saw Sophia making out with her son while stroking him off. I looked back down and decided it was time.

I pushed forward an inch and I could feel her surrounding me. She all but stopped kissing her son – her tongue had stopped dancing around his mouth, and her lips were no longer working against his. She was frozen against his mouth as my dick slowly penetrated her for the first time. Her back started heaving with her deep, heavy breaths.

Another inch went in and Sophia whimpered into her son's mouth. Her hand left his erection and moved to cradle the back of his neck as she resumed their kiss. This time, however, she was kissing much more slowly than before, with more passion and care rather than animalistic hunger. Part of me believed she wished it was her son's cock that was losing its virginity inside of her, not mine.

I looked down and noticed half of my penis was inside her. This was the best feeling I'd experienced in my entire life, and yet I knew there was still more to come. Sophia's soft whimper was the only sound in the room as I slowly entered her from behind. I started to wonder what thoughts were going through her son's head as I lost my virginity to his mother. Was he letting his own hormones take over and disregarding the fact that she was his mother? Was he jealous of me as I pushed myself inside her? Did he wish he could be doing the same as I was? It's surprising how many thoughts were racing through my head as I was about to have sex for the very first time. From overhearing the kids at school you'd think that losing your virginity takes about 30 seconds with a healthy side of embarrassment, but I planned on making the most out of this ridiculous situation. I was determined to savor every second.

My cock slowly disappeared as I slid another inch of myself inside of her. Sophia once again froze in the middle of the kiss with her son. It seemed like every time I inched forward, she had to pause all of her movement in order to prevent a sensory overload. She was trying her hardest to hold completely still, but every once in a while there was an uncontrollable shudder throughout her body as she felt me slip further inside. Each time her body twitched I could hear her whimper loudly against her son's lips. Each time her body trembled I could see her spotless little asshole contract, and her hips quivered against her will.

It took incredible willpower to penetrate her as slowly as I could, so as I thrust the final portion of myself into her I let out a sigh of relief. My lower stomach pressed into her ass as I bottomed out. While fully buried inside her, I bent over and started kissing the middle of her back, just at the nape of her neck. Sophia peeled her lips off her son for the first time since I started inching into her. She looked into her son's eyes and he stared back at her.

“He's inside of me.” She pecked her son on the lips. “He's filling mommy's pussy.” She planted another small kiss. “Baby, this is a very special moment for us,” her delicate voice whimpered as she shared her thoughts with her son. A convulsion ripped through her body as she tried her hardest to kiss her son once more. Instead, a groan escaped her lips as they failed to meet their target. Her legs started to quiver against my own, and her fingers turned white as they dug into the carpet. While I remained motionless, her pussy still somehow managed to stimulate me as her body shook with ecstasy. She tried her hardest to speak, but it was impossible for her to finish a sentence without gasping for breath.

“Baby, I… His cock is filling… He’s so deep… Mommy just needs… I need to get… *Oh, fuck!* Jesus, baby… Will you… Will you let him fuck mommy? Will you please let him fuck mommy?” Her hand stopped cradling her son's neck and it returned to where it belonged, stroking him gently as she asked her son for permission. “Let mommy stroke you as he fucks me. Okay, Alex? Let mommy make you feel good, too.” Alex didn’t respond with words. Rather, he nodded his head for approval as he looked down at his mother’s hand.

I stopped kissing the back of her neck and reached my right hand around the side of her head, gently resting it on her jaw, then I turned her head to the left and back towards me. Her hand never stopped stroking her son as I leaned in and got close to her face. She was looking directly at me, with her gaze darting back and forth between my eyes and my lips. Her son watched the two of us as I crept forward some more. After officially losing my virginity, I closed my eyes and leaned in to kiss my very first girl. My lips contacted hers and pressed against her for a few seconds. I slightly parted my lips and kissed her again, and I could feel her tongue rub against my bottom lip. Before I went in for my third kiss, I pulled almost all of myself out of her pussy, so only my head was left inside. Sadness filled her eyes as I removed myself from her. She needed me back inside. I slowly pushed myself back into her and at the same time I leaned in for my third kiss, but now both of our lips parted and our tongues swirled around each other in a deep, passionate French kiss.

For a moment I forgot her son was staring at both of us. With my eyes closed and locked into a kiss, I began stroking in and out of her with long, smooth motions. I was worried the extreme sensation would make me cum early and ruin the moment. In order to limit the sensation I tried to slowly count to three for each inward stroke, and then count to three again as I pulled out. After a handful of strokes I was confident I could continue without orgasming too early, so I took both hands and reached for the bottom of her shirt and peeled it up her body. I stretched the fabric over her breasts while I slowly fucked her. It was painful to break the kiss, but we had to briefly interrupt the moment as I pulled the shirt over her head. Sophia was now fully naked and getting fucked right in front of her own son. The second her shirt was removed we immediately resumed kissing, and I continued my slow, methodical strokes into her pussy. My right hand reached around her and grabbed at her breast. I gently kneaded her with my hand at the same pace I was stroking into her, every once in a while getting greeted with a soft moan against my lips.

I decided it was time to let her son continue his fun. I broke up our kiss and straightened up behind her, placing my hands on her ass and admiring my view as I watched myself repeatedly disappear inside of her. The sight of my cock sliding into her pussy was almost as satisfying as watching it slide back out. Every time I pulled out, her lips tried to grab onto me, as if they were trying to grip me so I wouldn't leave her. I looked at her little pink asshole and my greedy thoughts wondered if anal sex felt just as good as this, but I suspected that would not be on the cards this evening. I started picking up the tempo as I got use to the feeling of her warmth, and eventually hard a barely audible 'clap' when my groin made contact with her ass. Each time I pulled out I could see my erection glistening with her juices. I could hear Sophia moaning, along with wet, kissing noises in between each of my thrusts. I looked up expecting to see her kissing her son, but I was gifted with a much more wonderful surprise.

Sophia's head was now facing downward, into her son's lap, bobbing up and down. I saw Alex staring down at his mother in awe. I moved my head to the side so I could get a good view. Sophia's lips were wrapped around her son's cock, introducing him to oral sex. Seeing this excited me even more and I decided to pick up my pace. Sophia's body began to jerk each time my groin pressed against her ass. Alex took his hand and brushed it through his mother's bangs, ensuring that his wonderful view wasn't spoiled. He cradled her head as her lips and tongue pleasured him. Meanwhile, Sophia's left hand was on the ground supporting her weight while her right hand reached for the base of her son's penis. She started to stroke and twist her hand at the base of his penis as her mouth sucked him off. Her hand and her mouth were sliding up and down his erection in harmony.

Alex's right hand reached around the back of his mother's neck as she bobbed up and down. He wasn't forcing her in any way, he was simply caressing her head as she pleasured him. He took his left hand, reached forward, and grabbed her breast. I couldn't see the details, but Sophia's moans changed pitch and she raised her head off his lap to say something.

“Yes, pinch mommy's nipples. That's it, baby.” After she instructed her son, Sophia lifted her head to make out with him some more. She never stopped stroking his cock.

I was nearing a sensory overload, but was determined to pick up the pace at the risk of orgasming and ending the moment. I squeezed down on her ass and hips and then started to fuck her with more force. Each time I humped forward my groin would smack into her ass, sending a small ripple across her toned backside. I began fucking with enough force that Sophia could barely maintain the kiss with her son, and her son’s mouth was no longer capable of muffling her loud moans. The pressure from Alex's hand continued to increase on the back of his mother's head, desperate to maintain control of the situation. Their kisses became deeper, faster, and more chaotic as my thrusts into his mother became stronger. Sophia started to lose control of her body as I fucked her, and she began to rock back and forth which prevented them from making out. She started to groan loudly.

“He's fucking me, Alex! I’m getting… fucked… Oh god, I can't believe he's fucking me,” she managed to say between her cute grunts. She was looking directly into her son's eyes. Her hand was still stroking his cock, and his hand was still groping her breast. “Your cock is so beautiful baby.” She licked his lips. “You are so beautiful. Mommy needs this, mommy needs this so much. I hope you don't mind he's doing this to me. He's doing such a good job for mommy. He's fucking mommy so good, baby. I want him to, I want to do this with you. Is mommy making you feel good?” Her thoughts rambled out loud as she guiltily fucked the two of us.

With both of my hands still on her ass, Sophia slowly reached backwards with her right hand. She traced it down her side, over her hip, and onto my right hand. I watched her slowly rub my hand as I gripped her, and my eyes darted back and forth between our hands and her asshole. I noticed she became a little quieter and I looked up to see her mouth had reunited with her son's cock. Sophia's gentle caress on my hand made me slow my pace a bit, and she naturally slowed down the rhythm on her son's cock in return. Her head raised up and down with smoother motions as she took all of her son's length inside of her mouth. Her eyes were closed as she worked her lips and tongue around him. His cock would nearly escape her mouth every time she raised her head, but her lips just barely managed to hold onto the tip. Each time she pulled her mouth up, and only her lips were wrapped around the head of his cock, I could tell her tongue was swirling around, dancing on top of the tip of his penis. As I watched her suck him off, I tried to match my slow thrusts with the motion of her head. When she sunk her mouth to the base of his penis, I'd simultaneously stroke forward and fully enter her. The image of her soft lips wrapped around his cock was mesmerizing, but I eventually snapped out of it to be greeted with yet another amazing view.

As I was distracted by the sight of her sucking off her son, I failed to realize that her right hand left my own and continued on its journey. Her arm was now resting down the middle of her back, with her wrist near her tailbone, and her middle finger was lying flat across the rim of her asshole. She used the pad of her fingertip to rub across her asshole at the same slow pace that we were moving. Every once in a while her asshole would pulse when my inward stroke timed up with her fingertip crossing over her forbidden entrance. It looked like she was trying to exert a slight inward pressure with her finger, but her ass resisted. Once again, she pressed into her ass but not with enough force to penetrate. I noticed that her finger was dry, so I gently grabbed her hand and brought it to my lips. I took a couple of her fingers into my mouth and swirled my tongue around them, getting them nice and wet for their return. After I let her hand go, she quickly resumed work on her pristine asshole. She continued to rub the outer rim of her ass as I slowly fucked her.

She drug her flattened fingers back and forth across her asshole as she raised and lowered her head in her son's lap. She pressed her fingers inward each time she lowered her mouth over his cock, but still not hard enough to penetrate herself. After a few minutes of fucking slowly like this, she curled her middle finger inward so the very tip of her finger was pressed into her asshole. This time her fingertip easily popped inside, and her middle finger disappeared to the first knuckle. It only remained inside for a few seconds before she plucked her finger back out and continued to circle and rub, then once again she penetrated herself to the first knuckle. She started to match the rhythm of her finger with my slow thrusts into her pussy. At a certain point she no longer removed her finger entirely, rather she wiggled it around while keeping it just barely inside. Sophia started to gently push and pull her finger as it was hooked into her ass, giving her just a little bit of extra stimulation that I couldn't provide. I slowly slid my right hand across her ass cheek and teased my fingers along the junction of where her finger dipped into her ass. I wanted her to allow me to take her place, but it seemed like she was lost in the moment. Her mouth began to hum on her son's cock.

I looked up to see Alex's face in a state of bliss - eyes closed, his right hand still cradling the back of his mother’s neck, his left hand still groping at her breast, and his mouth slightly opened as if he was about to tell his mother how amazing she felt. I leaned forward and used my left hand to palm her other breast. I took her nipple and pinched it lightly between my fingers. As I leaned forward I felt the back of her right hand press into my stomach, the same hand that she was using to finger her asshole. I felt her hand moving around with more intensity as I increased the pressure on her nipple. I took my right hand off her ass and placed it on the back of her head, helping guide her head as she worked her son in her mouth. I tweaked her nipple a little harder and she moaned loudly. I felt like I was starting to take control for the first time, but a part of me was still nervous she'd eventually object. I decided to let go of her head and just enjoy the view.

I leaned back and saw that she was still gently fingering her ass just as before, perhaps with a little more fervor. The intensity my thrusting had picked up only a little – I was still taking my time with each forward stroke. I stopped fucking her for a second and she stopped as well, taking her mouth of her son's cock and turning back to look at me. Here eyebrows raised slightly, as if she was waiting for me to ask her something. She started bucking backwards on my cock as she stared me in the eyes. I firmed by grip on her ass and brought her to a halt. While staring at her fingertip that was just barely penetrating her asshole, I had a simple request.

“Go deeper.”

She gave me a naughty smile as she bit her bottom lip. She knew what I wanted to see, and she wanted it as well. First, she pulled the tip of her middle finger out of her ass and then raised her hand up to offer it to me. I once again took it in my mouth to wet it, never breaking eye contact with her. While staring at me, she lowered her finger down to her ass and the expression on her face began to change. I looked down to see that her middle finger was back inside her ass, only now she was slowly pushing past her first knuckle. Bit by bit, more of her finger started to disappear into her asshole until she approached her second knuckle. She paused when her second knuckle reached the entrance. It was going to require a little extra force to break that barrier. While she hesitated to push in the last third of her finger, I pulled myself out of her until just the head of my cock was in the entrance of her pussy, and I humped forward with a bit of force. She let out a small *hmmph* and I felt her muscles contract around me. She was still stuck on her second knuckle. Again, I pulled myself out of her and firmly squeezed her ass. We locked eyes, and I pressed forward with purpose. Another *hmmph* escaped her throat, but her finger refused to budge.

I asked her again, “Just one more try, please?” I thought it was a simple request.

One final time, I pulled nearly all the way out of her and waited. We looked at each other, and after a brief moment she nodded her head. She was ready. I looked down to see her last knuckle being hugged by the rim of her ass. I plunged forward, and with a cute yelp she managed to sink the rest of her finger into her ass. I hoped the grin on my face served well enough as a 'thank you.'

Sophia turned her head back to her son and she kissed him deeply. I continued thrusting slowly inside her and watched her finger do the same to her ass. In between their kisses I could hear the both of them breathing heavily. Every once in a while Sophia would whisper into her son's ear, or perhaps she was just nibbling on his earlobe - it was hard to concentrate with all of the events taking place. Alex still remained quiet, hardly ever speaking at all, but he let out a few sighs of relief every now and then. His hands were still occupied, one groping his mother's breast and the other cradling her head. Finally, for seemingly the first time, Alex had to say something.

“Mom. Mom, I...” Sophia kissed him before he could share his thought. She encouraged him to continue.

“What is it, baby? Are you feeling good? Is mommy making you feel good?” She let out small grunts between each question. She kissed him on the cheek. “What can I do for you, baby?”

“Mom, this is feeling really good. I want to go faster.” It sounded like Alex was on the verge of orgasming. To be honest, I don't understand how either of one of us had lasted so long.

“That's good baby. You're doing great. Mommy will try to go faster.”

Sophia lowered her head and once again continued to suck her son's cock, stroking his shaft with her left hand at the same time. Her right hand was still being used to pleasure herself, with her entire middle finger plunged deep into her ass. Sophia had picked up the pace as her son requested, and I naturally started to fuck her harder as well. The sounds of our skin slapping together started to fill the room. As Sophia and I picked up our pace, I could tell Alex was starting to get into it as well. He was no longer just leaning back and relaxing as his mom sucked him off. Alex started to thrust his hips upward to meet his mother's mouth, fucking her mouth as I fucked her from behind. The slurping sounds emanating from her wet mouth started to overtake the sound of us fucking. Sophia's mouth was working extra hard to make Alex feel happy. She wanted to make her son cum.

Alex continued to buck upwards and into his mother's mouth, but it was getting difficult for all three of us to keep in sync. Sophia seemed to sense this as well, so she stopped sucking and instructed her son to get more comfortable.

“Alex, baby, get up on your knees.”

She took her finger out of her ass and nudged the bottom of his thigh upward, encouraging him to get up. As he slowly climbed to his knees, facing his mother, Sophia took her hand on the back of his thigh and pulled him closer to her face. I never stopped fucking her, so her body was shaking and he seemed confused as to what was happening. Sophia moved her hand up the back of his thigh and onto her son's ass, then pulled him closer to her. She maneuvered him until his cock was lined up with her mouth. In one swift movement, she took his entire length into her mouth and began sucking again.

Alex was starting to get a grasp of the situation. It was completely natural for him to want to buck his hips forward and into Sophia's mouth, and in this position the movement was much easier. He placed his right hand on his mom's shoulder to help keep balance, and his left hand was planted on his hip. Then he began to fuck his mother's mouth.

Sophia's body started squirming as she got penetrated from two sides. With my hands spread wide across her ass, I dug in just a little bit with my thumbs and started to inch them inward. Sophia's ass was still gently backing into my groin with each of my thrusts. I firmly squeezed each of her cheeks and spread them around, giving me a wide open view of the action below. I inched my thumbs inward some more, closer to their goal. Both of Sophia's hands were on the ground, supporting her body as her son and young protégé filled her up. I finally reached my thumb far enough to start rubbing along the rim of her ass.

I don't know what got into me. For some reason I was strongly attracted to her ass. I was never really into anal pornography before, but earlier when Sophia's hand coaxed me into licking both of her holes, something stirred inside of me. Hoping I wasn't overstepping my bounds with my perversion, I pressed my right thumb inward and her ass started to give way. I pressed some more until the tip of my thumb popped into her asshole. Sophia never stopped sucking on her son.

Although she didn't object, her right hand came up off the floor and started to reach its way backward. Her hand bumped into my arm, but instead of grabbing low on my wrist she raised her hand up my body and towards my face. I felt her fingers brush across my neck, onto my chin, and then rub across my lips. I nibbled her fingers as I dug my thumb further into her ass. She pressed her flattened fingers harder into my mouth, then pointed her fingertips inward so they split my lips. I took that as a signal and let her fingers enter my mouth once again. She offered me her middle and ring fingers this time, and they played around my tongue as I made sure they were well lubricated. She synced the motion of her fingers with my thumb as I pushed and pulled it from her ass. She slowly pulled her fingers from my mouth and traced them down my chest, past my belly button, and on top of my right hand. Her lubricated fingers felt their way around my buried thumb as I continued fucking her. She nudged my thumb out of the way and there was an audible 'pop' as it left her asshole. She placed her two fingers on the rim and started circling. My thumb had warmed her up, but now she was ready for more. I watched as she curled her two fingers inward, then started to make them disappear inside her.

Both fingers slipped in to the first knuckle quite easily, then there appeared to be a bit of resistance. I slowed down my thrusting to let her concentrate, and quite honestly, to appreciate the view as best I could. She inched further, slowly working her way to the second set of knuckles which acted like another barrier. I looked up and noticed she had stopped sucking her son's cock. Alex remained still on his knees, holding himself in his hand while slowly stroking. The slight look of confusion on his face told me he didn’t understand what his mother was doing. Sophia's head started to turn away from her son, looking down and to her right. She squinted her eyes and bit her lip. She was devoting all of her concentration to her fingers. I slowly pulled myself out of her so she could fight her new battle.

“I just need... a little bit more...I can fit them both inside, I just...” She was thinking out loud as she tried to slide the rest of her fingers into her ass. It was cute, watching her struggle like this. “I know I can do this,” she asserted. She backed her fingers all the way out, then quickly pushed them back in to the second knuckles. She looked up into her son's eyes and started to giggle. “Mommy's trying something she hasn't done in quite a while.”

“Okay, mom.” Sophia found the situation to be slightly humorous, but Alex didn't have much to say. I could tell by the expression on his face that he was simply eager to get back inside his mother's mouth. He just seemed too shy to do anything about it. He continued to stroke his cock as his mother looked up at him. His cock was just inches away from her face, which I couldn't see. Sophia winced between her giggles, detailing her struggle as her knuckles started to invade. I bent over and kissed down her back, onto her butt, and then hovered my mouth over her fingers which were partially buried inside her ass. I licked the exposed portion of her fingers and made sure to get as much lubrication on them as I could. I gently grabbed her right hand, then lined up my cock with her pussy. I started pressing downward on her hand, encouraging her to push her fingers inward with a little more force.

“*Ohh!* I don't think I can do it so fast. Wait, just *wait!*” She begged me to ease off.

Alex bent down and faced his mother directly. He kissed her softly on the cheek, and then pecked her on her lips.

“You can do it, mom,” Alex whispered. Aside from the ridiculous scenario of mother-son incest taking place, those were fairly sweet words of encouragement from her son.

Alex stood back up on his knees and started stroking his cock as he pointed it towards her mouth. I was still lined up behind her, so I once again pressed down on her hand and I watched her knuckles start to stretch past her asshole. From my angle it looked like Alex's cock may have been starting to part the lips of his mother's mouth. I moved my cock forward until just the tip had entered her pussy. As her knuckles finally sunk into her ass, I plunged forward my entire length into her cunt, and Alex shoved the rest of his cock into her mouth. She moaned loudly as all three of her holes were being filled at the same time.

It didn't take long for Alex and I to pick up the pace. We were too horny not to. There was no more caressing, no more being gentle. I reached forward to palm Sophia's breasts, giving her nipples a firm twist, then drug my hands down her stomach and into the crook of her hips. I dug my fingers into her flesh and forcefully pulled her into me with each thrust. Sophia's fingers dug deep into her own ass as I started fucking her with more aggression. The muscles in her hand tensed up as she pumped her middle and ring fingers into her ass. I could hear Alex's breathing intensify and his mother could be heard humming and groaning into his penis. He reached his hand around his mother's neck and pulled her towards him. My cock would nearly slip out of her dripping pussy each time he pulled her head forward, then I would return the favor as I yanked her back onto my cock. She squealed each time my groin sent a ripple across her ass. The only thing louder than her muffled screams of ecstasy were the sounds of my pelvis slamming into her. Every few pumps Sophia would have to take her mouth off her son's cock to breathe, filling the room with vulgar language. She was starting to get overwhelmed.

“God yes! Give me your cock, Alex! Fuck mommy's mouth. *Fuck it*, baby! Let mommy suck your cock!”

The more Alex got into it, the less his mother's head had to move. His strokes became shorter but much more rapid. His mother no longer seemed to be deep-throating him, rather she focused on the more sensitive tip if his cock. I, on the other hand, was still giving her my full length. Her body shuddered and quaked each time I pounded into her. With her right hand pleasuring her asshole, her left hand was left all alone trying to grip into the carpet to keep her balanced. Her dainty arms struggled to keep her stable. I looked down below her and saw the puzzle had been completely dismantled.

I removed my hand from her hip and licked my fingers, then reached below her to rub her clit. I guess there was no need to lick my fingers. My hand slid across the tip of her pussy, and I quickly wiggled my fingers back and forth across her clit as she bucked into me. She came back up for air.

“Keep rubbing! Rub my clit, baby. *Faster*. I'm almost there. I’m almost there. I’m almost there. Keep rubbing, keep rubbing my clit. I want to cum. *Fuck* me baby, keep fucking. Mommy's about to cum!”

Her hips continued to grind into me as she pumped her fingers in and out of her ass. Once again our movements started to become erratic as we were on the edge of orgasm. I took my hand off her clit and returned it to her ass, as I needed all the help I could get to remain stable and keep my rhythm. I looked up to see Alex with his eyes closed, his face scrunched up as if he was aching for some sort of release. He grit his teeth together as he fucked his mother’s face with more force. I wondered how his mother's muffled moans felt as they vibrated around his cock. Sophia’s body tensed up as she started to convulse uncontrollably. As her body trembled below me, I could hear her choke on her son's cock for just a brief moment. Sophia removed her mouth from his cock and let out a loud a piercing scream.

“I'm cumming! *Fuck*, I'm cumming!”

Her body shook uncontrollably. I looked down and saw her pluck her fingers from her ass. I could hear a small pop as they were removed, and her asshole started to close up but it couldn't quite shut all the way. She took her shaky hand from her ass and moved it to her son's cock, then started stroking it furiously as her body continued to undulate with her orgasm. She tried her hardest to keep her mouth wrapped around his cock, but her own pleasure took over and she filled the tent with her moans instead. This was too much. This was what put me over the edge.

As Sophia's body shook below me, I could feel my muscles start to tense up and I slowed down my thrusts. I started to pump slowly, deliberately, and with great purpose. I was filled with the sensation of being on the brink of orgasm. I've felt this before, typically when I was masturbating and trying to delay an orgasm, however I didn't want to delay this any longer. I was ready to have my first orgasm inside a girl. A wave of pleasure ripped through my body as I buried myself deep inside her one last time. I tried not to scream as I started to fill her with my own cum. I looked down to see my palms spreading her perfect ass, with her asshole still opened ever-so-slightly, however I couldn't see one inch of my buried cock as I started emptying my load inside of her.

“Fill me,” Sophia whispered, “fill my pussy, baby. I want your cum inside me.”

Another wave of the orgasm hit me and I continued to clumsily fuck her in timing with my contractions. Of the hundreds of orgasms I've had in the past, nothing ever felt like this. The muscles in my legs were on the verge of cramping from the intensity. I continued to pulsate a few more times inside of Sophia's pussy, then I pulled out and continued to stroke my cock as it was still aimed at her ass. One last load erupted from my cock and flew through the air and onto her ass. It landed on the edge of her little asshole, and the droplet of sperm started to drizzle into the void that her fingers left. I leaned forward and squeezed out one last droplet of cum from my penis, letting it land in her asshole. I rested the head of my cock at the entrance of her ass, then pushed forward just a little bit so I could help my cum drip inside her. I leaned forward a little too much and I started to slip inside.

“Oh god. *FUCK*, baby, that's my ass!” Sophia wasn't quite ready for the tip of my penis to replace her fingers. I could feel her muscles tighten up, then I noticed the load of semen I deposited in her pussy had started gushing out of her and onto the carpet below. The tight sensation that wrapped around my head was too much for my sensitive cock, so I pulled back out and started to catch my breath. I stared in awe as my cum dripped out of both of her holes.

I leaned back on my knees, trying to burn everything that happened into my memory so I would never forget. I wanted to remember the feeling of her warm pussy wrapped around my cock, and I wanted to remember the sight of her filled pussy as my semen leaked out of it. I wanted to remember her quivering in her post-orgasm bliss, and I wanted to remember her reaching up for her son to passionately kiss him after the three of us just finished fucking. I wanted to remember everything.

Reality sank in and Sophia quickly removed her lips from her son's. She looked down at the ground and I could see a look of confusion on her face. She leaned to the side and rotated off her hands and knees, letting her hip hit the carpet as she supported herself with an arm. She looked at me but didn't speak. Her eyes glimmered as tears welled up, and her lips silently uttered ‘oh my god.’ She didn't need to say anything to tell me what she was feeling. I could tell she was about to regret everything that just happened. There wasn't enough alcohol in the world to erase these events.

Sophia stood up and sauntered into the kitchen. She didn't bother to grab her clothes. I wasn't sure what to say or do, so I decided to leave her alone. Her son was left kneeling in the tent with a look of disbelief on his face. I still don't think he could comprehend what had just happened. I leaned over to grab my boxers, then slipped them on and looked back at Sophia. She was standing at the kitchen counter, staring off into space. She looked despondent. I heard my phone start to vibrate. It was my mother. I answered it.

“Hello?”

“Hey, darling, just letting you know that dad and I won't be making it back tonight. I know I told you we'd be late, but it looks like 'late' just turned into 'tomorrow' – is that okay?”

“Uhhh, yeah. Sure, mom. It's fine. I, uhh… I'm actually at a friend's house right now.” I looked up at Sophia and she seemed disinterested in what I was saying.

“Oh, that's great! Are his parents home? Maybe you could just eat dinner over there. That might be better than eating a bowl of cereal back home.”

“Uh, yeah mom, I can probably eat dinner over here. I doubt they would mind.” I thought if worse comes to worse, I could just eat a lousy dinner and be hungry tonight. It would totally be worth it after all that had happened.

“Oh that's great, sweety! Okay, dad and I have to go, but we'll see you tomorrow okay? Goodbye, love you!”

“I love you, too, mom.”

I set down my phone and noticed Sophia was still looking at me. Her expressionless face was making me feel anxious. I walked over to her and stood next to her at the kitchen counter. I could hear Alex walking up the stairs, back to his bedroom.

“Is everything okay, Sophia?”

“*Okay?* Come on. I can't believe this just happened.” The sound of defeat filled her voice. “This is... this was so wrong. No one can hear about this, you understand?”

“Yeah, of course I understand. I wouldn't tell anybody, not in a million years.”

She picked up both hands and ran her fingers through her scalp, still in disbelief that she just fucked her young intern while sucking off her son. As her arms were raised, her breasts stood perky and tall and I couldn't help but stare. She noticed and gave me 'the look'.

“Stop that. This is crazy, you know?”

“I know, Sophia. I'm sorry.”

“Yeah, sure. I bet you're real sorry after having sex with your first woman.” I was happy to hear a bit of sarcasm return to her voice, perhaps a little bit of dark humor would lighten up the situation. “So I heard you talk to your mom. Will you be okay tonight? Do you want me to get you some dinner or drive you home?”

“I think I'm okay. I don't want to bother you or anything. I’m really sorry this all happened.”

“Ah, come on. You have nothing to be sorry about. I'm the one who is sorry. I let all of this get carried away.” Sophia looked down at the ground, then realized it may be a good idea to put some clothes back on. She walked back over to the tent, and I stared at her ass one last time as she bent over to grab her panties off the floor. I continued to look at her as she clothed herself. She looked up at me multiple times as she dressed, but I didn't care if she saw me staring. She walked back over to me and I could sense her lips forming a faint smile.

“I think I should get going, now,” I moped. “I'll leave you two alone in case you need to talk or something.”


“Ugh, that's just what I want to do tonight. Sit here awkwardly with my son as I try to have a conversation with him about how it was wrong that I just sucked his cock while I got fucked by a stranger.” After a slight pause, she started to laugh in disbelief.

“Maybe it would help if I stayed,” I suggested. “I mean, I wouldn't mind having some company for a bit.”

Sophia pondered for a moment, then nodded her head in agreement.

“Okay, you can stay here for a while longer to get some dinner. Maybe you can stay a while after since you will be all alone at home. I really don't know.”

“Thanks, Sophia.”

“You're welcome. Now excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom to clean up your... mess... you left inside me.” There were no smirks or flirty undertones when she said that, but it still stirred something inside me. As Sophia walked away to the bathroom to clean herself, I started to reflect on the events that took place, and began to fantasize about what might happen later tonight."
abjl5p,15,2019-01-01,[M/S] My Boss and Her Son (Part 4 of 4),pervertaccount1,inceststories,https://www.reddit.com/r/inceststories/comments/abjl5p/ms_my_boss_and_her_son_part_4_of_4/,"I thrust into her hand as far as I could, feeling the head of my cock pass through her grip and dip just inside the entrance of her pussy. I stopped and held there for a moment to regain composure. I relaxed my grip on her hips and slowly drug my hands across her ass. Either confused or frustrated, she started to stroke me with the same hand that had been preventing us from full penetration. I let her stroke my cock, but I didn't give in. I stopped thrusting and stood completely still. I refused to continue playing “just the tip” with her. For a brief moment she stopped making out with her son, and she questioned why I remained motionless with just the tip of my penis inside her. There was frustration in her voice.

“Why did you stop? Just keep going, *please!* Keep going more! Go back inside, please, just a little bit. I need this. I need you inside me!” I felt like torturing her the same way she tortured me.

Sophia continued kissing her son as she tried to tug the tip of my penis back into her, and I started to gently knead and massage her ass. However, I still refused to thrust inside her as long as her hand acted as a barrier. A moment passed and she seemingly forgot about me as her tongue entertained her son's. I carefully moved my hands off her ass and gently grabbed her by the wrist. Slowly, without any forcefulness at all, I peeled her hand away from my shaft to remove the barrier. I could finally look down and see the unobstructed view my cock just barely penetrating her. Sophia finished removing her hand using her own free will, then slipped it underneath her t-shirt. It looked like she was pinching and teasing her nipple, but I couldn't be sure.

With just the tip of my penis inside her, I placed my hands back on her ass and continued a gentle massage. The room was still silent except for the sound of a mother's lips greeting her son's. I gripped her ass firmly and squeezed, spreading apart her cheeks to expose all of her. I looked up and saw Sophia making out with her son while stroking him off. I looked back down and decided it was time.

I pushed forward an inch and I could feel her surrounding me. She all but stopped kissing her son – her tongue had stopped dancing around his mouth, and her lips were no longer working against his. She was frozen against his mouth as my dick slowly penetrated her for the first time. Her back started heaving with her deep, heavy breaths.

Another inch went in and Sophia whimpered into her son's mouth. Her hand left his erection and moved to cradle the back of his neck as she resumed their kiss. This time, however, she was kissing much more slowly than before, with more passion and care rather than animalistic hunger. Part of me believed she wished it was her son's cock that was losing its virginity inside of her, not mine.

I looked down and noticed half of my penis was inside her. This was the best feeling I'd experienced in my entire life, and yet I knew there was still more to come. Sophia's soft whimper was the only sound in the room as I slowly entered her from behind. I started to wonder what thoughts were going through her son's head as I lost my virginity to his mother. Was he letting his own hormones take over and disregard the fact that she was his mother? Was he jealous of me as I pushed myself inside her? Did he wish he could be doing the same as I was? It's surprising how many thoughts were racing through my head as I was about to have sex for the very first time. From overhearing the kids at school you'd think that losing your virginity takes about 30 seconds with a healthy side of embarrassment, but I planned on making the most out of this ridiculous situation. I was determined to savor every second.

My cock slowly disappeared as I slid another inch of myself inside of her. Sophia once again froze in the middle of the kiss with her son. It seemed like every time I inched forward, she had to pause all of her movement in order to prevent a sensory overload. She was trying her hardest to hold completely still, but every once in a while there was an uncontrollable shudder throughout her body as she felt me slip further inside. Each time her body twitched I could hear her whimper loudly against her son's lips. Each time her body trembled I could see her spotless little asshole contract, and her hips quivered against her will.

It took incredible willpower to penetrate her as slowly as I could, so as I thrust the final portion of myself into her I let out a sigh of relief. My lower stomach pressed into her ass as I bottomed out. While fully buried inside her, I bent over and started kissing the middle of her back, just at the nape of her neck. Sophia peeled her lips off her son for the first time since I started inching into her. She looked into her son's eyes and he stared back at her.

“He's inside of me.” She pecked her son on the lips. “He's filling mommy's pussy.” She planted another small kiss. “Baby, this is a very special moment for us,” her delicate voice whimpered as she shared her thoughts with her son. A convulsion ripped through her body as she tried her hardest to kiss her son once more. Instead, a groan escaped her lips as they failed to meet their target. Her legs started to quiver against my own, and her fingers turned white as they dug into the carpet. While I remained motionless, her pussy still somehow managed to stimulate me as her body shook with ecstasy. She tried her hardest to speak, but it was impossible for her to finish a sentence without gasping for breath.

“Baby, I… His cock is filling… He’s so deep… Mommy just needs… I need to get… *Oh, fuck!* Jesus, baby… Will you… Will you let him fuck mommy? Will you *please* let him fuck mommy?” Her hand stopped cradling her son's neck and it returned to where it belonged, stroking him gently as she asked her son for permission. “Let mommy stroke you as he fucks me. Okay, Alex? Let mommy make you feel good, too.” Alex didn’t respond with words. Rather, he nodded his head for approval as he looked down at his mother’s hand.

I stopped kissing the back of her neck and reached my right hand around the side of her head, gently resting it on her jaw, then I turned her head to the left and back towards me. Her hand never stopped stroking her son as I leaned in and got close to her face. She was looking directly at me, with her gaze darting back and forth between my eyes and my lips. Her son watched the two of us as I crept forward some more. After officially losing my virginity, I closed my eyes and leaned in to kiss my very first girl. My lips contacted hers and pressed against her for a few seconds. I slightly parted my lips and kissed her again, and I could feel her tongue rub against my bottom lip. Before I went in for my third kiss, I pulled almost all of myself out of her pussy, so only my head was left inside. Sadness filled her eyes as I removed myself from her. She needed me back inside. I slowly pushed myself back into her and at the same time I leaned in for my third kiss, but now both of our lips parted and our tongues danced around in a deep, passionate French kiss.

For a moment I forgot her son was staring at both of us. With my eyes closed and locked into a kiss, I began stroking in and out of her with long, smooth motions. I was worried the extreme sensation would make me cum early and ruin the moment. In order to limit the sensation I tried to slowly count to three for each inward stroke, and then count to three again as I pulled out. After a handful of strokes I was confident I could continue without orgasming too early, so I took both hands and reached for the bottom hem of her shirt and peeled it up her body. I stretched the fabric over her breasts while I slowly fucked her. It was painful to break the kiss, but we had to briefly interrupt the moment as I pulled the shirt over her head. Sophia was now fully naked and getting fucked right in front of her own son. The second her shirt was removed we immediately resumed kissing, and I continued my slow, methodical strokes into her pussy. My right hand reached around her and grabbed at her breast. I gently kneaded her with my hand at the same pace I was stroking into her, every once in a while getting greeted with a soft moan against my lips.

I decided it was time to let her son continue his fun. I broke up our kiss and straightened up behind her, placing my hands on her ass and admiring my view as I watched myself repeatedly disappear inside of her. The sight of my cock sliding into her pussy was almost as satisfying as watching it slide back out. Every time I pulled out, her lips tried to grab onto me, as if they were trying to grip me so I wouldn't leave her. I looked at her little pink asshole and wondered if anal sex felt just as good as this, but I suspected that would not be on the cards this evening. I started picking up the tempo as I got use to the feeling of her warmth, and eventually hard a barely audible 'clap' when my groin made contact with her ass. Each time I pulled out I could see my erection glistening with her juices. I could hear Sophia moaning, along with wet, kissing noises in between each of my thrusts. I looked up expecting to see her kissing her son, but I was greeted with a much more wonderful surprise.

Sophia's head was now facing downward, into her son's lap, bobbing up and down. I saw Alex staring down at his mother in awe. I moved my head to the side so I could get a good view. Sophia's lips were wrapped around her son's cock, introducing him to oral sex. Seeing this excited me even more and I decided to pick up my pace. Sophia's body began to jerk each time my groin pressed against her ass. Alex took his hand and brushed it through his mom's hair, ensuring that his wonderful view wasn't spoiled. He cradled her head as her lips and tongue pleasured him. Meanwhile, Sophia's left hand was on the ground supporting her weight while her right hand reached for the base of her son's penis. She started to stroke and twist her hand at the base of his penis as her mouth sucked him off. Her hand and her mouth were sliding up and down his erection in harmony.

Alex's right hand reached around the back of his mother's neck as she bobbed up and down. He wasn't forcing her in any way, he was simply caressing her head as she pleasured him. He took his left hand, reached forward, and grabbed her breast. I couldn't see the details, but Sophia's moans changed pitch and she raised her head off his lap to say something.

“Yes, pinch mommy's nipples. That's it, baby.” After she instructed her son, Sophia lifted her head to make out with him some more. She never stopped stroking his cock.

I was nearing a sensory overload, but was determined to pick up the pace at the risk of orgasming and ending the moment. I squeezed down on her ass and hips and then started to fuck her with more force. Each time I humped forward my groin would smack into her ass, sending a small ripple across her toned backside. I began fucking with enough force that Sophia could barely maintain the kiss with her son, and her son’s mouth was no longer capable of muffling her loud moans. The pressure from Alex's hand continued to increase on the back of his mother's head, desperate to maintain control of the situation. Their kisses became deeper, faster, and more chaotic as my thrusts into his mother became stronger. Sophia started to lose control of her body as I fucked her, and she began to rock back and forth which prevented them from making out. She started to groan loudly.

“He's fucking me, Alex! I’m getting… fucked… Oh god, I can't believe he's fucking me,” she managed to say between her cute grunts. She was looking directly into her son's eyes. Her hand was still stroking his cock, and his hand was still groping her breast. “Your cock is so beautiful baby.” She licked his lips. “You are so beautiful. Mommy needs this, mommy needs this so much. I hope you don't mind he's doing this to me. He's doing such a good job for mommy. He's fucking mommy so good, baby. I want him to, I want to do this with you. Is mommy making you feel good?” Her thoughts rambled out loud as she guiltily fucked the two of us.

With both of my hands still on her ass, Sophia slowly reached backwards with her right hand. She traced it down her side, over her hip, and onto my right hand. I watched her slowly rub my hand as I gripped her, and my eyes darted back and forth between our hands and her asshole. I noticed she became a little quieter and I looked up to see her mouth had reunited with her son's cock. Sophia's gentle caress on my hand made me slow my pace a bit, and she naturally slowed down the rhythm on her son's cock in return. Her head raised up and down with smoother motions as she took all of her son's length inside of her mouth. Her eyes were closed as she worked her lips and tongue around her son's cock. His cock would nearly escape her mouth every time she raised her head, but her lips just barely managed to hold onto the tip. Each time she pulled her mouth up, and only her lips were wrapped around the head of his cock, I could tell her tongue was swirling around, dancing on top of the tip of his penis. As I watched her suck him off, I tried to match my slow thrusts with the motion of her head. When she sunk her mouth to the base of his penis, I'd simultaneously stroke forward and fully enter her. The image of her soft lips wrapped around his cock was mesmerizing, but I eventually snapped out of it to be greeted with yet another amazing view.

As I was distracted by the sight of her sucking off her son, I failed to realize that her right hand left my own and continued on its journey. Her arm was now resting down the middle of her back, with her wrist near her tailbone, and her middle finger was lying flat across the rim of her asshole. She used the pad of her fingertip to rub across her asshole at the same slow pace that we were moving. Every once in a while her asshole would pulse when my inward stroke timed up with her fingertip crossing over her forbidden entrance. It looked like she was trying to exert a slight inward pressure with her finger, but her ass resisted. Once again, she pressed into her ass but not with enough force to penetrate. I noticed that her finger was dry, so I gently grabbed her hand and brought it to my lips. I took a couple of her fingers into my mouth and swirled my tongue around them, getting them nice and wet for their return. After I let her hand go, she quickly resumed work on her pristine asshole. She continued to rub the outer rim of her ass as I slowly fucked her.

She drug her flattened fingers back and forth across her asshole as she raised and lowered her head in her son's lap. She pressed her fingers inward each time she lowered her mouth over his cock, but still not hard enough to penetrate herself. After a few minutes of fucking slowly like this, she curled her middle finger inward so the very tip of her finger was pressed into her asshole. This time her fingertip easily popped inside, and her middle finger disappeared to the first knuckle. It only remained inside for a few seconds before she plucked her finger back out and continued to circle and rub, then once again she penetrated herself to the first knuckle. She started to match the rhythm of her finger with my slow thrusts into her pussy. At a certain point she no longer removed her finger entirely, rather she wiggled it around while keeping it just barely inside. Sophia started to gently push and pull her finger as it was hooked into her ass, giving her just a little bit of extra stimulation that I couldn't provide. I slowly slid my right hand across her ass cheek and teased my fingers along the junction of where her finger dipped into her ass. I wanted her to allow me to take her place, but it seemed like she was lost in the moment. Her mouth began to hum on her son's cock.

I looked up to see Alex's face in a state of bliss - eyes closed, his right hand still cradling the back of his mother’s neck, his left hand still groping at her breast, and his mouth slightly opened as if he was about to tell his mother how amazing she felt. I leaned forward and used my left hand to palm her other breast. I took her nipple and pinched it lightly between my fingers. As I leaned forward I felt the back of her right hand press into my stomach, the same hand that she was using to finger her asshole. I felt her hand moving around with more intensity as I increased the pressure on her nipple. I took my right hand off her ass and placed it on the back of her head, helping guide her head as she worked her son in her mouth. I tweaked her nipple a little harder and she moaned loudly. I felt like I was starting to take control for the first time, but a part of me was still nervous she'd eventually object. I decided to let go of her head and just enjoy the view.

I leaned back and saw that she was still gently fingering her ass just as before, perhaps with a little more fervor. The intensity my thrusting had picked up only a little – I was still taking my time with each forward stroke. I stopped fucking her for a second and she stopped as well, taking her mouth of her son's cock and turning back to look at me. Here eyebrows raised slightly, as if she was waiting for me to ask her something. She started bucking backwards on my cock as she stared me in the eyes. I firmed by grip on her ass and brought her to a halt. While staring at her fingertip that was just barely penetrating her asshole, I had a simple request.

“Go deeper.”

She gave me a naughty smile as she bit her bottom lip. She knew what I wanted to see, and she wanted it as well. First, she pulled the tip of her middle finger out of her ass and then raised her hand up to offer it to me. I once again took it in my mouth to wet it, never breaking eye contact with her. While staring at me, she lowered her finger down to her ass and the expression on her face began to change. I looked down to see that her middle finger was back inside her ass, only now she was slowly pushing past her first knuckle. Bit by bit, more of her finger started to disappear into her asshole until she approached her second knuckle. She paused when her second knuckle reached the entrance. It was going to require a little extra force to break that barrier. While she hesitated to push in the last third of her finger, I pulled myself out of her until just the head of my cock was in the entrance of her pussy, and I humped forward with a bit of force. She let out a small *hmmph* and I felt her muscles contract around me. She was still stuck on her second knuckle. Again, I pulled myself out of her and firmly squeezed her ass. We locked eyes, and I pressed forward with purpose. Another *hmmph* escaped her throat, but her finger refused to budge.

I asked her again, “Just one more try, please?” I thought it was a simple request.

One final time, I pulled nearly all the way out of her and waited. We looked at each other, and after a brief moment she nodded her head. She was ready. I looked down to see her last knuckle being hugged by the rim of her ass. I plunged forward, and with a cute yelp she managed to sink the rest of her finger into her ass. I hoped the grin on my face served well enough as a 'thank you.'

Sophia turned her head back to her son and she kissed him deeply. I continued thrusting slowly inside her and watched her finger do the same to her ass. In between their kisses I could hear the both of them breathing heavily. Every once in a while Sophia would whisper into her son's ear, or perhaps she was just nibbling on his earlobe - it was hard to concentrate with all of the events taking place. Alex still remained quiet, hardly ever speaking at all, but he let out a few sighs of relief every now and then. His hands were still occupied, one groping his mother's breast and the other cradling her head. Finally, for seemingly the first time, Alex had to say something.

“Mom. Mom, I...” Sophia kissed him before he could share his thought. She encouraged him to continue.

“What is it, baby? Are you feeling good? Is mommy making you feel good?” She let out small grunts between each question. She kissed him on the cheek. “What can I do for you, baby?”

“Mom, this is feeling really good. I want to go faster.” It sounded like Alex was on the verge of orgasming. To be honest, I don't understand how either of one of us had lasted so long.

“That's good baby. You're doing great. Mommy will try to go faster.”

Sophia lowered her head and once again continued to suck her son's cock, stroking his shaft with her left hand at the same time. Her right hand was still being used to pleasure herself, with her entire middle finger plunged deep into her ass. Sophia had picked up the pace as her son requested, and I naturally started to fuck her harder as well. The sounds of our skin slapping together started to fill the room. As Sophia and I picked up our pace, I could tell Alex was starting to get into it as well. He was no longer just leaning back and relaxing as his mom sucked him off. Alex started to thrust his hips upward to meet his mother's mouth, fucking her mouth as I fucked her from behind. The slurping sounds emanating from her wet mouth started to overtake the sound of us fucking. Sophia's mouth was working extra hard to make Alex feel happy. She wanted to make her son cum.

Alex continued to buck upwards and into his mother's mouth, but it was getting difficult for all three of us to keep in sync. Sophia seemed to sense this as well, so she stopped sucking and instructed her son to get more comfortable.

“Alex, baby, get up on your knees.”

She took her finger out of her ass and nudged the bottom of his thigh upward, encouraging him to get up. As he slowly climbed to his knees, facing his mother, Sophia took her hand on the back of his thigh and pulled him closer to her face. I never stopped fucking her, so her body was shaking and he seemed confused as to what was happening. Sophia moved her hand up the back of his thigh and onto her son's ass, then pulled him closer to her. She maneuvered him until his cock was lined up with her mouth. In one swift movement, she took his entire length into her mouth and began sucking again.

Alex was starting to get a grasp of the situation. It was completely natural for him to want to buck his hips forward and into Sophia's mouth, and in this position the movement was much easier. He placed his right hand on his mom's shoulder to help keep balance, and his left hand was planted on his hip. Then he began to fuck his mother's mouth.

Sophia's body started squirming as she got penetrated from two sides. With my hands spread wide across her ass, I dug in just a little bit with my thumbs and started to inch them inward. Sophia's ass was still gently backing into my groin with each of my thrusts. I firmly squeezed each of her cheeks and spread them around, giving me a wide open view of the action below. I inched my thumbs inward some more, closer to their goal. Both of Sophia's hands were on the ground, supporting her body as her son and young protégé filled her up. I finally reached my thumb far enough to start rubbing along the rim of her ass.

I don't know what got into me. For some reason I was strongly attracted to her ass. I was never really into anal pornography before, but earlier when Sophia's hand coaxed me into licking both of her holes, something stirred inside of me. Hoping I wasn't overstepping my bounds with my perversion, I pressed my right thumb inward and her ass started to give way. I pressed some more until the tip of my thumb popped into her asshole. Sophia never stopped sucking on her son.

Although she didn't object, her right hand came up off the floor and started to reach its way backward. Her hand bumped into my arm, but instead of grabbing low on my wrist she raised her hand up my body and towards my face. I felt her fingers brush across my neck, onto my chin, and then rub across my lips. I nibbled her fingers as I dug my thumb further into her ass. She pressed her flattened fingers harder into my mouth, then pointed her fingertips inward so they split my lips. I took that as a signal and let her fingers enter my mouth once again. She offered me her middle and ring fingers this time, and they played around my tongue as I made sure they were well lubricated. She synced the motion of her fingers with my thumb as I pushed and pulled it from her ass. She slowly pulled her fingers from my mouth and traced them down my chest, past my belly button, and on top of my right hand. Her lubricated fingers felt their way around my buried thumb as I continued fucking her. She nudged my thumb out of the way and there was an audible 'pop' as it left her asshole. She placed her two fingers on the rim and started circling. My thumb had warmed her up, but now she was ready for more. I watched as she curled her two fingers inward, then started to make them disappear inside her.

Both fingers slipped in to the first knuckle quite easily, then there appeared to be a bit of resistance. I slowed down my thrusting to let her concentrate, and quite honestly, to appreciate the view as best I could. She inched further, slowly working her way to the second set of knuckles which acted like another barrier. I looked up and noticed she had stopped sucking her son's cock. Alex remained still on his knees, holding himself in his hand while slowly stroking. The slight look of confusion on his face told me he didn’t understand what his mother was doing. Sophia's head started to turn away from her son, looking down and to her right. She squint her eyes and bit her lip. She was devoting all of her concentration to her fingers. I slowly pulled myself out of her so she could fight her new battle.

“I just need... a little bit more...I can fit them both inside, I just...” She was thinking out loud as she tried to fit the rest of her fingers into her ass. It was cute, watching her struggle like this. “I know I can do this,” she asserted. She backed her fingers all the way out, then quickly back in to the second knuckles. She looked up into her son's eyes and started to giggle. “Mommy's trying something she hasn't done in quite a while.”

“Okay, mom.” Sophia found the situation to be slightly humorous, but Alex didn't have much to say. I could tell by the expression on his face that he was simply eager to get back inside his mother's mouth. He just seemed too shy to do anything about it. He continued to stroke his cock as his mother looked up at him. His cock was just inches away from her face, which I couldn't see, but between her giggles I could sense her wincing every now and then as her knuckles started to invade. I bent over and kissed down her back, to her butt, and then hovered my mouth over her fingers which were partially buried inside her ass. I licked the exposed portion of her fingers and made sure to get as much lubrication on them as I could. I gently grabbed her right hand, then lined up my cock with her pussy. I started pressing downward on her hand, encouraging her to push her fingers inward with a little more force.

“Ohh! I don't think I can do it so fast! Wait, just *wait!*” She begged me to ease off.

Alex bent down and faced his mother directly. He kissed her softly on the cheek, and then pecked her on her lips.

“You can do it, mom,” Alex whispered. Aside from the ridiculous scenario of mother-son incest taking place, those were fairly sweet words of encouragement from her son.

Alex stood back up on his knees and started stroking his cock as he pointed it towards her mouth. I was still lined up behind her, so I once again pressed down on her hand and I watched her knuckles start to stretch past her asshole. From my angle it looked like Alex's cock may have been starting to part the lips of his mother's mouth. I moved my cock forward until just the tip had entered her pussy. As her knuckles finally entered her ass, I plunged forward my entire length into her pussy, and Alex shoved the rest of his cock into her mouth. She moaned loudly as all three of her holes were being filled at the same time.

It didn't take long for Alex and I to pick up the pace. We were too horny not to. There was no more caressing, no more being gentle. I reached forward to palm Sophia's breasts, giving her nipples a firm twist, then drug my hands down her stomach and into the crook of her hips. I dug my fingers into her flesh and forcefully pulled her into me with each thrust. Sophia's fingers dug deep into her own ass as I started fucking her with more aggression. She pumped her middle and ring finger into her ass, and the muscles in her hand tensed up. I could hear Alex's breathing intensify and his mother could be heard humming and groaning into his penis. He reached his hand around his mother's neck and pulled her towards him. My cock would nearly slip out of her dripping pussy each time he pulled her head forward, then I would return the favor as I yanked her back onto my cock. She squealed each time my groin sent a ripple across her ass. The only thing louder than her muffled screams of ecstasy where the sounds of my pelvis slamming into her. Every few pumps Sophia would have to take her mouth of her son's cock to breathe, filling the room with vulgar language. She was starting to get overwhelmed.

“God yes! Give me your cock, Alex! Fuck mommy's mouth. Fuck it, baby! Let mommy suck your cock!”

The more Alex got into it, the less his mother's head had to move. His strokes became shorter but much more rapid. His mother no longer seemed to be deep-throating him, rather she focused on the more sensitive tip if his cock. I, on the other hand, was still giving her my full length. Her body shuddered and quaked each time I pounded into her. With her right hand pleasuring her asshole, her left hand was left all alone trying to grip into the carpet to keep her balanced. Her dainty arms struggled to keep her stable. I looked down below her and saw the puzzle had been completely dismantled.

I removed my hand from her hip and licked my fingers, then reached below her to rub her clit. I guess there was no need to lick my fingers. My hand slid across the tip of her pussy, and I quickly wiggled my fingers back and forth across her clit as she bucked into me. She came back up for air.

“Keep rubbing! Rub my clit, baby. *Faster*. I'm almost there. I’m almost there. I’m almost there. Keep rubbing, keep rubbing my clit. I want to cum. Fuck me baby, keep fucking. Mommy's about to cum!”

Her hips continued to grind into me as she pumped her fingers in and out of her ass. Once again our movements started to become erratic as we were on the edge of orgasm. I took my hand off her clit and returned it to her ass, as I needed all the help I could get to remain stable and keep my rhythm. I looked up to see Alex with his eyes closed, his face scrunched up as if he was aching for some sort of release. He grit his teeth together as he fucked his mother’s face with more force. I wondered how his mother's muffled moans felt as they vibrated around his cock. Sophia’s body tensed up as she started to convulse uncontrollably. As her body trembled below me, I could hear her choke on her son's cock for just a brief moment. Sophia removed her mouth from his cock and let out a loud a piercing scream.

“I'm cumming! *Fuck*, I'm cumming!”

Her body shook uncontrollably. I looked down and saw her pluck her fingers from her ass. I could hear a small pop as they were removed, and her asshole started to close up but it couldn't quite shut all the way. She took her shaky hand from her ass and moved it to her son's cock, then started stroking it furiously as her body continued to undulate with her orgasm. She tried her hardest to keep her mouth wrapped around his cock, but her own pleasure took over and she filled the tent with her moans instead. This was too much. This was what put me over the edge.

As Sophia's body shook below me, I could feel my muscles start to tense up and I slowed down my thrusts. I started to pump slowly, deliberately, and with great purpose. I was filled with the sensation of being on the brink of orgasm. I've felt this before, typically when I was masturbating and trying to delay an orgasm, however I didn't want to delay this any longer. I was ready to have my first orgasm inside a girl. A wave of pleasure ripped through my body as I buried myself deep inside her one last time. I tried not to scream as I started to fill her with my own cum. I looked down to see my palms spreading her perfect ass, with her asshole still opened ever-so-slightly, however I couldn't see one inch of my buried cock as I started emptying my load inside of her.

“Fill me,” Sophia whispered, “fill my pussy, baby. I want your cum inside me.”

Another wave of the orgasm hit me and I continued to clumsily fuck her in timing with my contractions. Of the hundreds of orgasms I've had in the past, nothing ever felt like this. The muscles in my legs were on the verge of cramping from the intensity. I continued to pulsate a few more times inside of Sophia's pussy, then I pulled out and continued to stroke my cock as it was still aimed at her ass. One last load erupted from my cock and flew through the air and onto her ass. It landed on the edge of her little asshole, and the droplet of sperm started to drizzle into the void that her fingers left. I leaned forward and squeezed out one last droplet of cum from my penis, letting it land in her asshole. I rested the head of my cock at the entrance of her ass, then pushed forward just a little bit so I could help my cum drip inside her. I leaned forward a little too much and I started to slip inside.

“Oh god. *FUCK*, baby, that's my ass!” Sophia wasn't quite ready for the tip of my penis to replace her fingers. I could feel her muscles tighten up, then I noticed the load of semen I deposited in her pussy had started gushing out of her and onto the carpet below. The tight sensation that wrapped around my head was too much for my sensitive cock, so I pulled back out and started to catch my breath. I stared in awe as my cum dripped out of both of her holes.

I leaned back on my knees, trying to burn everything that happened into my memory so I would never forget. I wanted to remember the feeling of her warm pussy wrapped around my cock, and I wanted to remember the sight of her filled pussy as my semen leaked out of it. I wanted to remember her quivering in her post-orgasm bliss, and I wanted to remember her reaching up for her son to passionately kiss him after the three of us just finished fucking. I wanted to remember everything.

Reality sank in and Sophia quickly removed her lips from her son's. She looked down at the ground and I could see a look of confusion on her face. She leaned to the side and rotated off her hands and knees, letting her hip hit the carpet as she supported herself with an arm. She looked at me but didn't speak. Her eyes glimmered as tears welled up, and her lips silently uttered ‘oh my god.’ She didn't need to say anything to tell me what she was feeling. I could tell she was about to regret everything that just happened. There wasn't enough alcohol in the world to erase these events.

Sophia stood up and sauntered into the kitchen. She didn't bother to grab her clothes. I wasn't sure what to say or do, so I decided to leave her alone. Her son was left kneeling in the tent with a look of disbelief on his face. I still don't think he could comprehend what had just happened. I leaned over to grab my boxers, then slipped them on and looked back at Sophia. She was standing at the kitchen counter, staring off into space. She looked despondent. I heard my phone start to vibrate. It was my mother. I answered it.

“Hello?”

“Hey, darling, just letting you know that dad and I won't be making it back tonight. I know I told you we'd be late, but it looks like 'late' just turned into 'tomorrow' – is that okay?”

“Uhhh, yeah. Sure, mom. It's fine. I, uhh… I'm actually at a friend's house right now.” I looked up at Sophia and she seemed disinterested in what I was saying.

“Oh, that's great! Are his parents home? Maybe you could just eat dinner over there. That might be better than eating a bowl of cereal back home.”

“Uh, yeah mom, I can probably eat dinner over here. I doubt they would mind.” I thought if worse comes to worse, I could just eat a lousy dinner and be hungry tonight. It would totally be worth it after all that had happened.

“Oh that's great, sweety! Okay, dad and I have to go, but we'll see you tomorrow okay? Goodbye, love you!”

“I love you, too, mom.”

I set down my phone and noticed Sophia was still looking at me. Her expressionless face was making me feel anxious. I walked over to her and stood next to her at the kitchen counter. I could hear Alex walking up the stairs, back to his bedroom.

“Is everything okay, Sophia?”

“Okay? Come on. I can't believe this just happened.” The sound of defeat filled her voice. “This is... this was so wrong. No one can hear about this, you understand?”

“Yeah, of course I understand. I wouldn't tell anybody, not in a million years.”

She picked up both hands and ran her fingers through her scalp, still in disbelief that she just fucked her young intern while sucking off her son. As her arms were raised, her breasts stood perky and tall and I couldn't help but stare. She noticed and gave me 'the look'.

“Stop that. This is crazy, you know?”

“I know, Sophia. I'm sorry.”

“Yeah, sure. I bet you're real sorry after having sex with your first woman.” I was happy to hear a bit of sarcasm return to her voice, perhaps a little bit of dark humor would lighten up the situation. “So I heard you talk to your mom. Will you be okay tonight? Do you want me to get you some dinner or drive you home?”

“I think I'm okay. I don't want to bother you or anything. I am really sorry this all happened.”

“Ah, come on. You have nothing to be sorry about. I'm the one who is sorry. I let all of this get carried away.” Sophia looked down at the ground, then realized it may be a good idea to put some clothes back on. She walked back over to the tent, and I stared at her ass one last time as she bent over to grab her panties off the floor. I continued to look at her as she clothed herself. She looked up at me multiple times as she dressed, but I didn't care if she saw me staring. She walked back over to me and I could sense her lips forming a faint smile.

“I think I should get going, now,” I moped. “I'll leave you two alone in case you need to talk or something.”


“Ugh, that's just what I want to do tonight. Sit here awkwardly with my son as I try to have a conversation with him about how it was wrong that I just sucked his cock while I got fucked by a stranger.” After a slight pause, she started to laugh in disbelief. This was indeed a crazy situation.

“Maybe it would help if I stayed,” I suggested. “I mean, I wouldn't mind having some company for a bit.”

Sophia pondered for a moment, then nodded her head in agreement.

“Okay, you can stay here for a while longer to get some dinner. Maybe you can stay a while after since you will be all alone at home. I really don't know.”

“Thanks, Sophia.”

“You're welcome. Now excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom to clean up your... mess... you left inside me.” There were no smirks or flirty undertones when she said that, but it still stirred something inside me. As Sophia walked away to the bathroom to clean herself, I started to reflect on the events that took place, and began to fantasize about what might happen later tonight."

## Student’s Coin &amp; Technology

bitJob’s technology merges the benefits of micro-gigs and freelancer-centric bidding sites with Ethereum Blockchain, creating the first Hybrid Blockchain Project that allows for peer-to-peer connection with employers and students.

## Welcome to the STU Ecosystem

## Student tokens, also known as STU, are based on Ethereum Blockchain and are used to Reward &amp; Make payments inside the bitJob app. STU tokens can be earned on the platform or purchased on exchanges.

 The purpose of this hybrid model was to speed up and improve the adoption of the idea during the initial crowdfunding phase and serve as a catalyst for user acquisition during the platform development phase. Although a decentralized paradigm is the ultimate goal, slow adoption of the blockchain technology should be temporarily substituted by solutions that are familiar to the average internet user. Internet users today expect online services to be fast, with intuitive interfaces that are accessible via mobile devices. This dictates our approach, which provides these two technologies, simultaneously. With the adoption of the platform and new developments in blockchain technology users can seamlessly switch to decentralized solutions. Once users show familiarity with the platform by way of satisfactory adoption, they will be encouraged to interact through the blockchain component, which will allow them to pay for services with cryptocurrency and earn income through the usage of the crypto economy 

 bitJob will facilitate the provision of freelancing services through an online platform. Participants who offer a service (most often one which can be delivered online) will register using the system (as ‘service providers’) and offer their availability to do work in a way which is categorized by the platform. Participants who seek certain services will register as ‘service consumers’ and will either contact ‘service providers’ through the search function or will enter a request for services. Bidding on services and setting requests for services will give participants the ability to interact and find mutual agreements regardless to what demand and supply are available. The platform will provide mechanisms to ensure that, upon agreement, sufficient money is kept in escrow, so that the service provider is always paid, unless, of course, there are issues with their provision of service, in which case the platform will offer conflict resolution methods. Users will be able to rate each other, so frivolous or unreasonable ratings will not have the ability to proliferate for any significant length of time. Users, on the ‘service providers’ end, who collect negative ratings, may be subjected to higher fees. The Company business model is based on generating revenue through fees applied to both service providers and service consumers (not including students). 

 bitJob HYBRID MarketPlace Flowchart bitJob User Signup &amp; Authenticity Process The following flowchart represents our vision for the bitJob HYBRID architecture for our marketplace, which will be handled both by centralized servers (using fiat traditional currency payment method) and decentralized infrastructure (infrastructure (registration &amp; identity, fees, distribution for affiliates, etc’). The Chart below shows bitJob’s formal Token (STU), and the allocation methods for the token holders &amp; affiliates. More explanation about the STU token and its utility can be found in Section 3 (STU). 

 Using the Ethereum protocol allowed us to build this great application, and to remove the need to “blindly trust” server administrators. Thanks to its transparent properties, we now have a strong authentication, identification, better verifiability and micro-transactions for our payments and affiliates fees distribution. In the sketch below, we have decided to clarify the user sign-up process which has different aspects of authentications.  bitJob Student (Identify Requester) - At this stage, the requester (student) will fill in the needed data at the bitJob UI application. The UI application will make sure the Student is a legitimate entity by analyzing the supplied data as a proof of ownership. bitJob User UI Application - a proof of identify will be sent from the UI Application to the student members list storage (this will be the student ID number). The storage will then return the UI Application an approval for the authenticated data. 

 We built a fantastic affiliate program that will strengthen the relationship between bitJob and the students: students’ unions will receive a commission from each transaction their students engage in. We have launched pilot agreements with leading student associations in Israel, in addition to a number of employers who were more than happy to participate. We are also negotiating with several leading job search engines to ensure a continuous flow of quality jobs. Student unions around the world constantly engage in programs for professional internships with leading employers. In order to get as many students as possible to our marketplace, we created the ultimate incentive with our affiliate program. It’s a win-win setup that will play a critical part in bitJob’s success. Our focus on small online student jobs will attract players in the field of employee recruitment who are in pursuit of the next generation. 

 In initial phase of this project, we were asked why we want to use blockchain technology for something that doesn’t obviously benefit from using the technology. Although the benefits are not instantly visible, they are quite convincing when they are spelled out.  

 When money is moved between accounts using traditional methods, it can cost anywhere between 2% to 10% of the transaction amount. The cost of moving money on the blockchain can be in the vicinity of 0.01%. If someone could capture the difference between the current cost of settling transactions and the blockchain cost, the transfer of $1 million in revenue would produce between $20,000 and $100,000 in savings just by switching to blockchain. In certain countries, those transaction fees might be even higher, and it can take several days to process them due to restrictions and local limitations—e.g., PayPal is not offered everywhere, and in some areas, transactions are held for many days before they appear in the recipient account. In the very near future, blockchain technologies will be replacing existing client server architectures. By having already incorporated blockchain into our platform, we can take advantage of new ideas and trends rapidly, while other providers will just be starting to look into solutions in that space. A cryptocurrency crowdfunding campaign is possible when building a decentralized system. Additional funding can be obtained through communities associated with cryptocurrencies. Although it’s not implemented in the STU Token model, the concept of mining is strictly related to the blockchain. Through the mining process, with either proof of stake or proof of work, new coins can be created and distributed to the contributing community. As mentioned, this is not part of the current STU token model but will be considered in the future and can be deployed upon additional token symbol creation. There is no need to create a legal entity if someone wants to reach markets in other countries. The platform can function in any country without a legal presence, as cryptocurrencies have no such regulations or requirements. There is no need for bitJob to spend money on hardware, infrastructure, or tech staff. Platforms such as Ethereum offer said infrastructure, which has minimal cost only when used. Any new technological advances within the Ethereum community will be available to the platform as soon as they are created. It would be impossible for a business that facilitates freelance  

 bitJob will partner up with certain external service providers to enable users to purchase their services with STU tokens. 

• Affiliates sending referrals will be offered commission in STU tokens. 

• Users will be able to form groups on the platform for collaboration and collective engagement. 

• Evangelists: Receive fees for introducing bitJob to new educational organizations. This is part of the Global ambassadors program the company will build for its first-year expansion. 

• A registration STU gift will be given to every new registrant on the platform, as a promotional registration bonus. 

• Developers: will be able to form groups on the platform for collaboration and collective engagement. 

 The bitJob (STU) Token is a token on the Ethereum platform. Its design follows widely adopted token implementation standards. This makes the token easy to manage using existing solutions, including the Ethereum Wallet. 

• Maximum number of tokens created during crowdfunding campaign: 200,000,000 (100%)

• Sending 1 Ether to the bitJob account will create Approx. 888 STU. (Based on Ether price during the preparation of this document). •

• Tokens will be transferable once the crowdfunding is successfully completed. 

• The amount of STU coins per 1 Ether might vary due to movement in Ether price. The final values will be determined at the beginning of Emission day and can also be modified during the sale. According to the Terms &amp; Agreements that will be published on our CrowdFund page. 

• The bitJob token (STU) crowdfunding campaign emission will be distributed in the following way: 

• Some of the reserved marketing tokens will be used for bounties paid for the following marketing campaigns: translation and forum, moderators, newsletter subscriptions, Bitcoin Talk signatures, Twitter campaigns, Facebook likes, and blog posts. 

• More details about our bounty campaign will be given on our social media or through our blog posts on Medium. 

• Our Presale &amp; ICO Terms &amp; Conditions will be published prior to the events through our channels "

I have recently moved out of an apartment with my significant other for two years. I thought we were perfect for each other because we both had our own individual issues with anxiety. We helped support and build each other. The last two months she has had episodes where she would become extremely angry at my silence or lack of answer if i hesitate too long to reply when im in deep thought. A sense of resentment has built on her part because of my actions which i have continued to try and change for her. She was extremely critical of everything I did. I began coping more and more by playing more computer games and then that was continuously used against me in arguments to which i gave short simple answers. Sometimes i would completely be able to articulate my anxiety in a great manner to why I have difficulty doing things but still get them done. I have an associates degree in electrical engineering technology and am about one semester away from getting my B.S. in Physics-Engineering (electrical). I have had the lucky opportunity to intern at NASA as well as a previous workshop at NASA wallops. I came from a 6 year relationship prior to this 2 year relationship and am now aware and addressing my weakness of being alone. It is becoming more obvious and easier to self cope. I have messed up many semesters in the past but keep getting back on track with whatever setbacks in life come up. For example my first panic attack i was 23 years old and had difficulty bouncing back and truly understanding everything for a solid year. I apologize for all the text and i will come back and edit the format later for easier reading. I thought i'd start with just getting these thoughts out of my head onto something because I NEVERRRRRRR write anything down. I love physics and love just solving problems and being part of a team. Its what makes me happy. how do i know that stepping away from this relationship is what is good for me? i had to take several videos of her not allowing me to leave the apartment and blocking the doorway. She would insult and berate me and say that she was getting angry because of how I would respond or not respond to her. Maybe ive begin to see everything from her perspective and am now very critical of myself. But i had to move out because i started to fear her anger episodes. hopefully ill feel better just having put this out there for others to see and not all stuck in my mind. I deleted all social media today ...am i seeing my problems from a bad perspective? I just want to get my life on track for my daughter and I.

tl;dr i think i just liberated myself from an emotionally abusive relationship with a girl who is bipolar but im so uncertain of what makes me happy and what to do because I have anxiety and depression of my own.

Thanks everyone Happy New Years 2019!"

They told me that they are still really interested in going with me, and want me to come in and meet the providers and the rest of the team. They also said it is informal. 

Question: do I wear scrubs? I wore scrubs for the first interview because I was coming from my internship job. Plus I’ve heard it’s the best thing to wear anyways. 

Also what should I expect from a second “informal” interview? "
ablaur,341,2019-01-01,CALL THE COPS! NOW!,supe3rnova,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/ablaur/call_the_cops_now/,"I've been working in front desk since I was 17, started with internship then student work all up to contract work and also working abroad for few months thus I have seen a lot, got many stories to share but today I will share  the one that welcomed me to a night shifts of a premium 5 star hotel.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to work for this hotel in 2017 for few months before I went for my student work abroad which was the reason they quickly took me back march 2018, this time on contract. I knew the hotel  system, the guests etc. At first I was working one week in a sister hotel with 3 starts, just to get me up to speed before I was relocated to a 5\*, night shift from the go. Hotel wasn't full, 10 room occupied out of 80. Now this is a 5 star premium hotel with casino attached to the hotel BUT its not owned by the hotel, different company and they don't  go hand in hand together aside from what is needed. This hotel is based on casino guests, 80% are regulars that come here every weekend or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was a boring night with heavy winds outside , good thing I had bellboy with me to help me with little work we had and company was good. It was almost 1am, we were browsing Netflix what to watch when all of the sudden we heard loud footsteps. ''CHIMATO POLIZIA, PRONTO!'' Call the cops, now! yelled this person in Italian. Now I don't speak Italian that well but luckily bellboy did (this was going on in Europe, any more info could give out the hotel name straight away and we don't want that, do we now?) The Italian was screaming, demeaning cops to be called immediately. Bellboy asked him slowly to calm down and explain why. ''Were you robbed? Did some one threaten you?'' all while Italian guest was still yelling. He was joined by his family shortly after and his friends. Friend calmed him down and explain to us what was going on. Like I said in the begging I've got plenty of stories  and some of those are when I had to call the cops. Stolen/missing item, some one bumped the car in the parking lot, missing person and even because of death. This however...

&amp;#x200B;

Casino had some event going on that night to which they invited selected few as VIP guests. They also organized a babysitting program which was for every one, not just VIP guests although VIP kids had more ''privileges'', mostly regarding food. They could eat, drink for free while other kids, well they could not, parents would have to pay for it. And of course our lovely Italian was not on the VIP list which meant his kid did not get the food which pissed the guest off. So much, he coursed out the casino manager and he was thrown out.  To which he stormed to the hotel front desk and wanted me to call the cops. When bellboy translated it to me I was looking at him with the ''dont be fucking around, tell me the real reason'' but he was serious. So I called the cops and told the dispatcher the following: ''Good evening, supe3rnova here from Hotel calling. I've got a guest here who DEMANDS police to show up here for the following reason and I am not kidding about it. He was thrown out of the casino because his kid did not get the food from the babysitting program and he got angry at the casino manager who kicked him out.'' After some long silence the cop told me not to fuck around.  I told him again I am not that I've got better work to do then to prank call the police. He replied that he will sent one unit to our hotel but if its a prank someone will have to pay for it to which I frankly replied ''I know, dont worry I've got he guest's contact if you'll needit''. Not the best  response on my end but I was really not having non of that bs.

&amp;#x200B;

Police sure enough did show up and after one hour of heated argument with the guest and even a word with the casino manager they filled the report and said ''they cant do anything as no law was broken and being kicked out is not their thing to solve. Casino and Hotel will resolve the issue with you. Good night'' and they left.

&amp;#x200B;

The following morning they wanted a 50% discount because of it. They did not get it. They said they will not return again. We said fair enough, you're on our black list since we had a similar issue with you few years ago (yelling at the staff for bs reasons). They are banned from the casino, not wanted in our hotel all because their kid did not get the food. Now we can argue it was a shitty move from who ever was serving food. Guest said it is not fair to give some kids food and not to others to which I agree. But that is not something to call cops for. Later we found out he was threatening the casino manager as in if he ever sees him in Napoli (which made a whole lots more sense, southern Italians are crazy) that they will skin him alive.

&amp;#x200B;

I heard stories that night shifts can get crazy in this hotel. I was sceptical but on my first night I got to experience it is real. I had so many guests causing so many problems I could write a book about it. But until I do I will post a story here every now and then."
abm1si,1,2019-01-01,"Not sure how much longer I can do this for [tw: emotional/verbal abuse, gaslighting]",petiterunner,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/abm1si/not_sure_how_much_longer_i_can_do_this_for_tw/,"I counted down the weeks I have until I leave for college. I have 33. I don’t know if I can make it until then. I started college online early when I was about 15/16 and so far I have a year done (and I got it for free!) So thankfully I won’t be too dependent on my grandparents for finances when I go. They have said they will pay, and I believe them, but I don’t want to be dependent on them, so I am always saving as much as I can. I already have two year’s worth saved, so I know I will be ok for at least 2 years if they don’t. 

I am referencing my gma here, who adopted me as a child. We have a very rocky relationship. Constantly love/hate, mainly due to her gaslighting. Just when I feel that everything is ok again she seems to sense that and starts being abusive again. There have been times in which I’ve literally felt my heart breaking and felt so dejected due to her. 

Living with her... it’s like a switch goes off. 0-60. We can be talking amongst ourselves and having a genuinely nice conversation, and then literally out of nowhere, she starts raising her voice and starts yelling at me about something incredibly minor. Every. little. thing. I do is a major issue or something isn’t right about it. I can’t do anything right. It doesn’t matter how much I’ve accomplished. 

She’s incredibly dramatic, as well. “YOU’RE TRYING TO KILL ME!! YOU WANT TO HURT ME! I KNOW YOU HATE ME!!” Because I left my shoes tucked neatly by the sofa where she literally walked over, looked at them, forced herself to step on them, and acted like that forced step was going to be the death of her. “I COULD HAVE ROLLED MY ANKLE AND DIED!!” ? The shoes weren’t even in a pathway, wtf are you talking about. I can barely write this because it’s so ridiculous to see in person. 

Oh yeah, and apparently because I’m a teen female who has discharge I am “nasty, disgusting” and have “serious issues”. I’ve had my own dirty underwear thrown in my face before. Sweet :) I’ve also been told that I’m ugly and that no man ever will want me. even though I’ve already had boyfriends and multiple men and women romantically interested in me. lol

She always says that I’m “fatalistic”, “spend too much time at the sheriff’s office and fire department” (I’m an intern), and “mean, cruel”. I always want to say, you know why I spend so much time at those places? Because I’m trying to get away from YOU! That’s how much I can’t stand you. As far as me being fatalistic goes, idek. And I’m definitely not mean or cruel, lol. I think I tolerate her abuse pretty well without retaliation 90% of the time tbh. 

There’s a lot more she does that I don’t have the energy to mention, lol. It makes me feel depressed to think about so I try not to. 

I feel as though I am trapped in a cycle where I have to keep returning to her, where I feel guilted into accepting her apologies because she has done so many good things for me. I also feel guilty when she apologizes because I think in a lot of areas of my life I have it really good, and I should appreciate her more. And then as soon as I accept her apology, she starts an argument again— sometimes she finds a way to argue about the apology! 

I didn’t know it was called this until I looked on the sidebar but I have been using the grey rock technique with her. I try not to talk to her often, and it works well, but she literally comes to me to seek out fights. 

I just hate living this way. I feel like I am probably the best person to deal with it, though. I’m very level headed, and I’ve figured out pretty good techniques to deal with her as peacefully as possible. It hasn’t come without a cost, though.

Having to live this way has made me fearful, a constant liar, and avoidant of my family. I lie to EVERYONE about things I shouldn’t even lie about, because I’m so used to lying to her so I don’t get screamed at. I can’t even tell people I’m going to a fast food restaurant because she discourages me from doing pleasure things, so I always just lie to people about how I have to go do something work-related or income-bringing so they don’t think I’m “selfish” for... going to get food? I understand how silly that sounds when written, but it’s a legitimate issue I now have. 

I’m still not fully accustomed to being around people who don’t sweat the little stuff as much as she does. When an innocent message pops up on my phone when one of the firefighters is holding it I’m like, oh shit I’m fucked, better prepare my 25 alternate lies for the questioning and start sweating and they’re just like ? Didn’t even notice it, none of our business and I’m like oh yeah that’s right, y’all are kind people, I’m not used to this. Forgive me lol. 

 I feel that if she got help for whatever illness she has she could be a nonabusive parent, but maybe I’m just telling myself that to make myself feel better. I don’t know. I’m just not sure if I can keep doing this every single day. I think a lot about how much I want a boyfriend/husband, and it’s not really because I feel ready to have one; it’s moreso that I want someone to show me love and take me out of this terrible situation. I’m worried that I’m going to jump into the wrong person’s arms thinking that they can save me from her, so I’m trying hard to keep good hopes up about this and just remain independent until I can think clearly out on my own. I also worry about future relationships/continuing to act oddly paranoid around others but I’m sure I’ll figure it out. "
abnk00,3,2019-01-01,I (21M) and close friend (22F) got into our first real fight and the relationship has gone terribly bad,SoggyYogurtcloset,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/abnk00/i_21m_and_close_friend_22f_got_into_our_first/,"Hi everyone, I read a lot of the posts here, always learning new things about relationships. I'd like to hear some advice about what I did wrong.

Sorry for the long post.

For some context, I only had very short relationships with girls in middle school so I'm very inexperienced. 

Now, I'm classmates with this girl for 2 years. We weren't actually close until recently. We were kind of playing, as I'm quite introverted, she was trying to make me more open or something. We were alternatively pushing the other back. Well, that never got us very close.

Recently, she broke up with a very toxic guy. That was very hard for her and I happened to be around. I began to lend my ear and try to understand what happened. That was a heck lot more complicated than I thought. She already did a lot of work on her own, reading books about it and all. I was quite impressed. 

We got closer and closer, hanging out very often, eating together at school whenever we could. We were having tons of fun, she taught me a lot as she had a lot more experience than me. And what was really a first for me, was having such a close female friend. I was eating with her at home, going to the zoo, buying gifts for her family, giving me advice on fashion, watching series together. 

We then secretly started to have feelings for each other. That was really... strange. It was quite heavy on me. I tried to hold it in and planned to never tell her to protect our friendship. But I couldn't. I had to tell her. 

Once I told her, I just wanted to be lighter and didn't expect anything back. Ready for a rejection, she then answered she also had feelings for me at some point but suppressed them as soon as she had them. Also, she didn't expect me at all to have feelings for her and that it was a shock that she couldn't have any male friends. However, she told me it was too soon anyways for another relationship and that we were too different (along with several faults she found in me) to be together for a long time and that our friendship was very important for her and too precious to risk. I said I understood and not to worry.  

Unexpectedly, things did not become weird. We kept on doing the usual things we did together. We then began to plan to become roommates for our internships. We had a concrete plan, she got her internship very quickly as she's very good at communication. She even helped me try to get my own internship, as I'm quite the opposite in communication. She found numbers, email addresses etc. That was very helpful from her. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, where she had a discussion with her father, telling her that if I'm to be roommates with her, I'd better hurry and find my internship. That stressed her a lot and made me feel it. She was angry at me for being too slow, too passive in front of my problems. She felt personnally attacked and interpreted that I wasn't taking our plans seriously. This one made her suffer a lot. 

Another one, is when she wondered what type of flat we could be renting. Her father advised her to take one with only one bedroom and one of us would have to sleep in the living room on a sofa bed (we would probably exchange it every two weeks or so if it really bothered me). She explained that to me and immediately said that she had to be the one with the bedroom. Now, I do think it's natural for women to have the bigger and/or comfier room but the way she rushed it was irritating. That really bothered me and asked her if she was going to go like this for every choice we would have to make. I think I overreacted. Especially since she's the really direct type of girl, not afraid of saying what she thinks. But that problem grew bigger and bigger. She told me that it was obvious she had to get the bedroom. I said that was not the problem. Several times. It seems as if she didn't understood my point. She said that I should have known better because I should know how she is. She was hurt that I didn't understand her. I really feel bad.   
Then she told me ""Fine, go ask what people around you think about that, your mom, your friends anyone"". Which I did, and told her my mom said that it was worrying she acted like that. My friend is really affected by others looks on her. So what my mother said hurt her so much she repeated several times that it was bothering her. She thought the way I explained it to my mom was to make her look bad. I really didn't. 

And today, she tells me she thought about it a lot. I thought she was talking about the roommate thing but no. She told me she could never go out with me. That I was not mature enough, to tell my mother everything (I think I don't), that I was too passive etc. That didn't feel so good. But still, we have to go forward so I asked her what she thought about our friendship and the roommate thing. She said the conflict definitely had an impact. Her esteem for me went down a notch. She then revealed I was making her suffer too much, every now and then, that everyone was hurting her. She felt she did so much with her and that I was unfair. She continued with a bunch of harsh comments and asked me to forget her. I told her we should leave it at that for tonight. 

I really like this girl. We had fun times together but I can't handle her overall negativity and hurtful comments about me. I try not to tell her everytime she hurts me, while she doesn't seem to hold back. However I still want to make her happy and feel it's worth it. 

What should I do to improve my behaviour? Where did I go wrong? Can this relationship be saved?

TL;DR: Had a big fight with a close friend, got several faults pointed out and don't know what I can do to improve or to save this relationship.

So I just got into the engineering program for Fall 2019, and was hoping I could get some advice about getting a high gpa, good extracurricular activities to pursue or even getting an early internship. 

Also, I am interested in software engineering, so is there any programming languages or skills i can learn now in high school to possibly get an internship after first or second year?"
abo9s8,0,2019-01-01,Help me [23 M] navigate open relationship complexities with [45F],dog_pls,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abo9s8/help_me_23_m_navigate_open_relationship/,"Alright reddit. Here we go. I am a 23 year old male. I love all beautiful women, but have had an affinity for older women for as far long as I can remember. 

So, this summer I had a tech internship  in Chicago. I stopped at a bar after work once and wound up meeting a beautiful, enthralling, mesmerizing woman about 20 years older than me. We wound up talking for around 3 hours and went on subsequent dates this summer. We never discussed each others’ work specifics (employer, etc.) but it became quickly clear, based on her educational background, work experience and various insinuations (more on that later) that she had a hand that carried a lot of power. As an individual far more concerned with the quality of a person than their titles, the latter statement was never that important to me, although I found it intriguing.
Our relationship did and has solely consisted of sex and is something I’d define as an “open relationship.” We’d go out to amazing dinners, have great sex, and even better conversations. She did buy me a few things (to my surprise) out of nowhere, but it was never a “sugar mama” situation as it’s not something I’m interested in or have ever yearned for (I like to earn my things). 

For as amazing as the times were, there were some initial flags that had me scratching my head. To my knowledge, she wasn’t married; however, she wouldn’t give me her phone number and we weren’t allowed (or maybe just never did?) to connect on social media (so I wouldn’t be “sleuthing”, as she stared). She never had a ring on when we met up, and there were even times we happened to run into each other (unintentionally) during the business day and I noticed she didn’t have a ring on. Now for the weirder... We communicated solely on an encrypted messaging app that burned messages immediately after they were read (yeah.. I know). I openly questioned this, and she responded eloquently back that she wanted to keep her life private. I respected that, and didn’t pry more. Additionally, anytime we would meet up, it would be at some extravagant hotel she paid for, never here apartment (again, privacy I understand). Final “weird” point - I don’t know her last name but I’m pretty sure she knows mine. I can’t find anything about her online, since I only have a first name to go off of. I will say, though, that she once invited me to a friend group together at a bar. At one point, she got up to go tot he bathroom. I asked one of her friends, “what’s the deal with [name]?” And they promised me that she just preferred an “extremely private life.”

At first I kind of questioned her “powerful” act. She’d namedrop random Chicagoan elite/socialites she’d hung out with or was friends/girlfriends with. I didn’t believe it until she showed me numerous pictures and stories that more or less confirmed. “Holy shit” was my reaction at this point.  Part of me was reluctant to believe her act because I didn’t have factual proof, but if she really was some “famous” person in the business world, I understood why she didn’t want me to expose her for banging a 23 year old or whatever. Still, I couldn’t help but feel like her “flexing” on me is a huge turn on for her and that I’m just some masturbatory object, some little toy to her. We had deep and existential conversations, and it seemed like she cared, but in retrospect, I’m not sure.  

We’ve maintained contact over the subsequent months and have seen each other several times. It’s become increasingly clear that I’m just a slam piece to her. Our conversations are pretty dry unless I make it about sex; then, she is much more responsive. Ive tested out whether she even cared on numerous occasions by ignoring her for a few days; sure enough, she always hits me up and asks me what’s going on. We aren’t dating, but it almost feels like it. She still texts me good morning everyday. Overall, She definitely is a sex addict. 

A few weeks back I got a bit fed up with the sex-obsessed nature of our conversations and called her out in a joking nature. I teased her for always instantly responding whenever I sexted her, and only sporadically responding to my general conversation texts. She got pretty upset; I assured her I was teasing but that it was something I had noticed and wanted to ask about. I clarified that I just wanted to make sure we had great conversations that didn’t only consist of sex, and that I thought, based on our prior conversations, that she could take a little “roasting.” She responded 15 minutes after with something along the lines of “just be careful you don’t enter territory you don’t know how to be in.”  That didn’t read or sit well, and I asked if it was a threat... she didn’t respond for about a day until I brought up a different subject. Not gonna lie, it shook me up a bit. 

I understand that our relationship is all sex/noncommittal, but I totally feel attached at this point and I hate it. It’s like it went from nothing to everything. I’m scared to cut off contact or do something wrong because I feel like she could just squash me as a bug and end my career if she felt like it. I have expressed high aspirations and motivations to her, which I almost regret at this point. I feel like a widows web has been spun around me and I’m trapped in it.

Am I over analyzing? Am I being naive? Have I been manipulated? Have I gotten myself twisted up with some powerful, sociopathic person? Should I believe anything she says? I don’t even know what to make of this, and want some perspective. No one in my life currently knows about this. 

TL;DR: All my 7th grade MILF fantasies came true but now I’m in Basic Instinct 3"
abom11,5,2019-01-01,"AITA for not getting a job during a year-long, unpaid student teaching internship?",throwawayaredditor,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/abom11/aita_for_not_getting_a_job_during_a_yearlong/,"My wife \[31\] and I \[30\] decided to move back to our home state this year because she wanted to change careers after ten years of trying to make it work. Without going into specifics here, her previous career required our family of 4 to be itinerate (we moved 4 times in the past ten years for her job). After a decade of hitting various walls, which were not her fault and completely ridiculous, she wanted to change careers. Luckily, she had a teaching license from her undergraduate degree that she could renew. We talked it over and, because my career pursuits had been at the beck and call of her itineracy, I thought it would be a great opportunity to finally get my career off the ground (side note for later: I have been in education for the past 5 years). So we decided to move back to our home state, (which was daunting), find her a teaching job, (which we did), and have me begin a year-long teaching licensure program (which I am half-way through at this point). Sucky politics and policies aside, the program I am doing requires a full year of unpaid student teaching (8 hour days as if I were a teacher of record) as well as completing the brand-new edTPA national portfolio, a master's thesis, and taking a full load of classes each semester (including two summers). I had hoped to hold down a part-time job before I realized how not possible that is in this program. And when I did realize that I would have no time for any kind of job, I talked it over with my wife and she agreed that I should focus on the program for the next year and worry about a job after this year. However, now that I am half-way through the program, I can feel the resentment from her. It doesn't help that her extended family thinks I am a lazy ass, or that she doesn't really tell them that I have zero time to do anything other than this program. I feel kind of helpless at this point because I have no opportunities to get paid for what I do. I even looked into some online tutoring programs, but adding in a few hours from 3-6AM before going to my student-teaching placement is all but impossible at this point. She drops consistent hints about me doing online surveys in my down-time to make a few extra bucks here or there, but honestly I don't have time for it. Right now, I am typing this at the end of a two-week break from school. I begin the second half of student-teaching this coming Tuesday, and I just cannot see how I am supposed to make any income over the next semester unless I use every bit of downtime to do $0.05 surveys or bing rewards. Yes, we are broke. But we also have a teeny-tiny emergency fund and there are numerous food pantries if we get that desperate over the next 6 months. My hope is to pickup some type of work during the coming summer months and either land a teaching job for the next year or get a factory job or something else if it comes to that. So my question is: am I the asshole who should be busting his ass even more than I already am for an extra twenty dollars a month?

EDIT (Clarity - below):

Basically, my program requires that I  student teach for two full semesters as if I were a full-time teacher  (that's like 7:30-3:30), then I have evening classes immediately after student teaching that usually end at like 6 but some days they don't end  until 9. On top of that, I am required to complete a thesis research  project. On top of that I have to do a teaching portfolio that requires video evidence and commentary. On top of all of that, I have to write  lesson plans for the student teaching placement. And finally, on top of  it all I have to do my homework for the classes I have to take.

By  the time I finish all of this, I have about 4-6 hours to sleep and then  do it all over again. The weekends are really the only time I have to  work on my research project and my portfolio. I had hoped to do online  tutoring, but I need those precious 2-4 hours to sleep.

It sucks, but my state (U.S.) requires second-career teachers to complete a masters degree in education if they do not already hold a bachelor's in education.

TL;DR: ""Working"" an un-paid student teaching internship to finish a 60hr masters degree in \~1 year, can really only do things like swagbucks and bing rewards here and there; should I try to earn minimal cash each month?"

abp2qz,8,2019-01-01,How to grow up in 1 year,SuperrCamel,gapyear,https://www.reddit.com/r/gapyear/comments/abp2qz/how_to_grow_up_in_1_year/,"Hello r/gapyear, I am a 23yo engineering student in Europe, seeking your advice: I wish to do a gap year between the last year of my bachelor's and the beginning of my Master's degree, which is in September 2019.

Following moving to a different country, a heartbreak and disputes between family members and friends which left me in sensitive spots, my social anxiety has grown worse, I developed symptoms of a mild depression and became a nihilist person with no inherent source of motivation. I shut myself in for the last 4 months and I have this feeling that I've been stagnating and not getting emotional or mental growth. While I will be lifting the unbearable weight of the lives I could have had, what is gone is gone, and I want to focus on what is yet to come. This is why I want to have an experience during at least 6 months in a gap year where I am thrown out of my comfort zone, gain more emotional maturity and improve myself, before diving in what seems to be a life of comfort.

My interests are sparse and far from each other: I am majoring in computer science and I mostly love music and traveling, but I did a 6 month internship as a street educator and animator. This was hard and challenging, but the moments where I could see the impact of my actions (mostly kids being happy/proud of themselves) were very rewarding, and I believe this was the time I got stronger emotionally. I am looking for a similar experience where I could take a break from my studies (maybe travel?), gain mental and emotional strength and maturity and have a positive impact. Could you think of any such activities?

Many thanks and have a great year !"
abp9r6,18,2019-01-01,Leslie and Adam (MF),funkytin,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/abp9r6/leslie_and_adam_mf/,"“Last call for alcohol!”

It wasn’t really that late, but it was clear the bartender was not amused with this crowd of traveling business barflies. Technically the bar closed at eleven, but Adam had been there past midnight on many occasions.

“Let’s go back to the room and finish our drinks. It’s just upstairs,” Adam whispered in her ear.

Leslie flashed him a look of desire, and followed Adam out of the bar. They walked down the hallway together, and made a right at the stairwell. He slapped her ass as she ascended the stairs in front of him, which was exactly when he learned she wasn’t wearing anything under her [backless red skater dress](https://www.lulus.com/products/believe-in-love-red-backless-skater-dress/595702.html). 

Adam traveled to this city for years, but he only met Leslie a month ago. She was finishing up her internship at a prominent consulting firm when he bumped into her (literally) wearing this [little black keyhole dress](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ee/70/ed/ee70edfff8d77da8bf983f924323177f.jpg). He was rounding the corner of the third floor bar in the Marriott Marquis open atrium at the same time she was coming from the other direction. Luckily, both of their glasses were (almost) empty, so he offered to refill hers as an act of contrition. After she smoothed herself out, she said, “Sure, handsome, I’ll take a Four Roses Single Barrel, two ice cubes.” She must have caught Adam’s eyebrows shooting up with that smirk and wink she shot him.

Leslie is one of those girls who was a self-made woman. She grew up in a tough situation raised only by her mother who was teetering between blackout drunk and high on meth. Leslie was not a stranger to the advances of men, and knew how to use her looks and body to get what she wanted. She gravitated towards older men, perhaps due to the absence of a father figure in her life, but she knew that she wanted out of government assistance and housing. As soon as she had her diploma in hand, she left her mom behind and worked her ass through college. 

Literally.

Given how quickly she read Adam and started catering to his needs, it was no surprise when he learned out she had professional experience.

That night they ended up hooking up in the hotel pool and almost got thrown out by security. The pervy fucker who busted them waited until Adam [came all over her tits](https://gfycat.com/CaringLoneKatydid) before lumbering down the hall and telling them to get out before he called the real cops.

Tonight was different though. Leslie was finishing her internship, had just turned 22, and was celebrating the full time offer she got from her job. Graduation was in two months, and she needed to cut loose. She texted Adam immediately after she got the offer, sending a pic of her pussy, saying, “I need Daddy to reward me for getting a job. Meet you at the usual place at 9.”

Adam was there at 8:30 and on his second drink when she waltzed into the bar in that red skater dress. Every single eye, male and female, was on her. With her heels she stood 5’10”, her blonde hair was curled and sat just below her shoulders, and her flawless skin was lightly bronzed without a hint of a tanline.

Every boy under 30 was stumped on why she sat down next to Adam, a 6’2”, sandy blonde hair, green eyed gentleman with a trimmed beard that showed his age more than his full head of hair. They were definitely not expecting her to kiss him deeply upon arrival either. 

After a few drinks and getting kicked out of the bar, all Adam wanted to do was to unwrap this gift and fall asleep in her folds. 
Adam already knew she wasn’t wearing a bra. She flashed him when she thought nobody was looking. Adam half expected that the bartender was doing him a solid by closing early as he definitely got the same show. 

Three flights of stairs, twenty steps more, and they arrived. Adam put the key in the door, got the green light, and opened it for her.

Leslie walked in ahead of him and pulled Adam close before the latch went click. He pulled the base of her dress up and put his free hand on her bare ass, pulling her into him. She moaned as he kissed her, walking her slowly backward toward the bed, gently setting her down as he moved their drinks to the nightstand. 

She quickly attacked Adam’s shirt, planting several kisses on his chest as she unbuttoned, eventually reaching his belt buckle. He ran both hands down her bare back while tugging on her shoulder straps. She quickly pulled those down over her arms while working on Adam’s zipper, exposing her C-cup breasts while her dress bunched up around her waist. He reached down and tweaked her nipples, causing her to moan again. She looked up at him with desire as she fished his cock out of his boxers and devoured it. 

Every man out there that has had his dick sucked more than once knows the difference between a good and bad blowjob. Every man has his preferences. Leslie wasn’t someone who had deep throat talents, or slobbered on it trying. She was perfect for Adam. She made up for a lack of deep throat skills by worshiping his cock. She spent time running her tongue around the head and down the frenulum with wide licks, like she was licking a large flat swirl pop. She added a light twist to her up and down motion with her left hand, while her right hand tugged on his balls just the way he likes it. Effort and technique only come with experience and coaching, and Adam was sure her mother’s string of dead-beat boyfriends had something to do with that.

Adam caressed her hair while she sucked him, switching from long, scalp-scratching strokes to hard grips of fistfuls of hair to guide her where he wanted her. Adam pulled her head off his cock, and pulled her up to standing position, her dress falling to her ankles. His erection was pressed between their bellies as they explored each other’s mouths. 

Leslie pulled him on to the bed, and he took this opportunity to admire her body. He planted kisses down her neck and shoulder and found her dripping pussy. Adam pushed one finger in with ease and drug it back up her lips to rest on her clit. She moaned and bucked against his fingers as he rubbed in a slow, circular motion. Adam could sense her getting close, so he kissed down her body until he reached her pussy. As he reached her button, he pushed two fingers into her pussy and caressed her G-spot while sucking gently on her clit. She writhed in pleasure, but it wasn’t until Adam started a low, barely audible hum that she came loudly, her walls squeezing around his fingers. 

As she came down from her orgasm, Adam kept his fingers in her pussy but gently licked her labia and planted kisses all around her clit, avoiding the sensitive nub to let her bask in the post orgasmic waves without over stimulation.

Leslie’s eyes fluttered open and she looked down at Adam with ravenous desire. She pulled Adam’s fingers from her pussy and put them in her mouth, tasting herself while keeping her eyes locked with his. Adam sat up while Leslie pivoted around his torso, sitting down facing him with his cock sticking straight up between them. She [ground her pussy against](https://gfycat.com/TornNaughtyGyrfalcon) the underside of Adam’s cock, slowly dragging her labia up and down along his shaft—each time getting closer to the tip.

“Adam, your tongue, your fingers. I… I can’t describe…” she trailed off while keeping her pelvic motions going. Adam raked his fingers up and down her spine as she kept her eyes locked on his, until she raised up just enough for his cock head to pop into her opening and she sat down all the way until she squeaked from her sensitive clit bumping against Adam’s pubic bone.

Adam’s eyes flew open wide as they had never fucked without a condom before. He’d been sterilized via vasectomy years ago, and he joked about it that night they met. “I’ve never had a man who had a vasectomy before,” Leslie playfully mused to which Adam replied with a smile, “CHECK PLEASE!”

Leslie rocked slowly on Adam’s cock, grinding into him as her pussy pulled his cock deep. He reveled at the sensation and gently sucked her nipples while she rocked. This was one of Leslie’s favorite positions and she was doing everything she could to get Adam to cum inside her. She was squeezing her pussy on his cock with impressive strength, but her pleasure outweighed his and she crested another orgasmic wave. Adam felt her rhythmic squeezing turn into a fast, then slow pulsing of her pelvic floor while she whimpered in pleasure and bit his shoulder. Her pussy gushed wetness with this orgasm, more than ever before. He could hear and feel the difference as her pulsing slowed to a random twitch here and there. 

Adam picked her up and flipped her back onto the bed, pulling her up onto all fours. She pushed her belly down, arching her back to present her pussy and asshole to him. Adam licked his lips and lined up his cock to part her delicate labia. He grabbed her hips and sunk all the way to the hilt. Doggy was Adam’s favorite position to fuck Leslie. Her pussy put extra pressure on the underside of his cock as he slowly fucked her which drove him wild. With a carnal sense of urgency, he began fucking her in earnest. His balls swung freely and slapped her clit with every plunge he took. Her squeaks turned into urging moans, coaxing Adam to finish.

Leslie turned around to look at him, met his eyes, and said, “Cum inside me daddy, I need your cum deep in my pussy!”
That was all it took for Adam to start that buildup to release. He felt it starting deep in his balls as they began to tense up and stop slapping her clit with every thrust. He bore down to hold it off as long as possible, building the intensity with each plunge. Once he couldn’t hold on any longer, he groaned as he buried his cock as deep as he could to unleash a [torrent of cum](https://gfycat.com/DifferentSeveralJapanesebeetle) inside her. He loosed five ropes of cum that had been building for days before things slowed down to a dribble. His cock filled her pussy so tightly that his cum started backing up around his shaft and leaking out while he was still buried in her.

After what felt like minutes, he started breathing again as Leslie was squeezing him with her pelvic muscles, each pulse pushing a little bit of cum out with it. He collapsed down on her back and she gently guided them both to the bed, rolling to the left. His cock audibly popped out along with a flood of semen as she let it run down her leg on to the bedspread. Leslie snuggled close to Adam, grabbing his cock in her hand and stroking it slowly.

She cooed softly to him as his breathing returned to normal. His still hard cock swelled slightly in her hand as she gripped him, never really deflating after orgasm. He kissed her lips lightly while pinching her nipple. She yelped and swatted at his hand playfully before asking…

Parking at my internship is $40 a day. 

I was wondering from experience, what is the better decision? Driving to Riverside buying a monthly parking pass and taking the Green line in? Or buying a monthly pass for the commuter rail? Riverside would be $50 cheaper a month for me with my calculations.

Now my question is, Do you think one is more reliable than the other? Do you suggest one over the other? 

If commuter rail is the best, do you suggest the pass or just buy individual passes on the train/app when you see them checking? Because I have rode the commuter rail a few times for free simply because they don't check the tickets. 


Thank you all in advance!!"

abpzk0,3,2019-01-01,[f4M] An extended layover and a charming older gentleman.,LasciviousTraveler,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/abpzk0/f4m_an_extended_layover_and_a_charming_older/,"**DISCLAIMER:** *This scenario is inspired by my actual flight plans, and so I may not get back to you right away. I also apologize for the fact this was a little rushed.*

&amp;#x200B;

The following scenario was something I'd like to play as a starting point for a longer-term roleplay, but I'm open to it being a standalone thing.

&amp;#x200B;

# Premise

I'm flying back out to school after visiting family. When I first left, I thought it would finally be a chance to break free of my conservative mother, spend less time trying to be a ""good girl,"" and grow up. Unfortunately years of repressed guilt, my own shyness, and a promises to my now long-distance high school sweetheart kept any of that from happening. That, and an unexpected upgrade to first class, is how I find myself sullenly seated next to you, awaiting what feels like an inevitable return to my failure to grow up, and subconsciously ready to explode at the opportunity to try something wrong.

You'll be exactly the medicine I need. Despite being old enough to be my father (or maybe even grandfather), you have a distinguished, trim, and powerful look about you. That's not what draws me in though, nor is it your sophistication and clearly earned self-confidence which borders on arrogance just enough to push my buttons. You're charming enough to patronizingly tell me I should smile more and get away with it, and to coax me out of my slump. You command my attention, and I'm happy end relieved to give it. I'm puzzled by my reaction to you even as we discuss mundane topics like what I might major in or your business trip in my city. I'm alarmed when it only seems to deepen as the topics of my boyfriend and your wife come up.

By the time we're about to land, I'm praying you don't notice the nervous fidgeting and flushness in my face and chest. Unfortunately, my attention is drawn to the news that, while we'll be able to land, our connecting flight is going to be delayed due to a blizzard (or maybe something else).

We disembark the plane, and while I frantically try to find a flight that will work before setting up camp in the nearby seats, you calmly make your arrangements, including a very nice hotel for the night. It's then that you, either because of a genuine connection and desire or being perceptive enough to know I'm the perfect target for your practiced routine, invite me to dinner (or perhaps directly ask if I want to share a room).

&amp;#x200B;

# What I'm looking for

*I'm flexible on where I want to pickup the roleplay, but I'm also not sure I want to roleplay a whole flight's worth of conversation. Also, I'm leaving a lot about your character up to you to decide, especially with regard to motivations. Maybe you're a great guy and we're two people that happen to connect and each fit a need the other has, or maybe I'm the latest target of what's become a practiced routine for you and I knowingly go along with it. I'm essentially looking for my character to get the chance to ""act out"" her desires in what will amount to an extended one-night stand with the charming older gentleman (yourself) in his hotel room. A torrid 24 hours of passionate, rough, eye-opening fucking. Lastly, I'm flexible on both our character's relationship statuses.*

**Some elements I want to include:**

* I'm relatively inexperienced, but eager to learn. Your character is happy to take charge.
* I'm not a Virgin, but have never really enjoyed sex before.
* I want you to be almost instructional at times, as my character is learning new things and having fun with it. I like the idea of you getting me to admit and then try some tamer fantasies.
* While I'm pretty kinky, I don't want the somewhat unbelievable scenario of suddenly pushing into full BDSM and M/s dynamics (Though those are possibilities long-term). Failing to use protection, roughness, degrading dirty talk, and maybe some light exhibitionism are more than enough experimentation.
* I like the idea of taking advantage of the hotel environment.
* You using a response title that gives me something to call you, (Seriously, I hate to do this but I'm using this as a sort of filter, and though it's not a dealbreaker it would be super helpful).

**Style:**

* Reddit PMs (don't try and chat me)
* Longer Exchanges, at least for the most part, about once a day
* First person, but open to third
* Significant, demarcated out of character communication to make sure we're hitting all the right notes for eachother
* Discussing direction and characters beforehand, rather than jumping right in

&amp;#x200B;

# Kinks

Kinks I like and which work well for this shorter term part of the roleplay:

*Light dominance (on your part), teaching/instruction, dirty talk, light manhandling, oral (giving/receiving), size difference (I'm pretty small, and my character will be also), age gaps, cheating (very optional, one or both of us), teasing, orgasm denial, light exhibitionism (think against the hotel window, or maybe the hotel hot tub is empty), unprotected sex/pregnancy risk, and others I'm probably not thinking of.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Long-Term

Now, ideally I'd like this to turn into a long-term roleplay, and their are several ways that could work depending on who you are and whether our characters stay in touch. We could stay in more vanilla territory, or we could move into a kinkier dynamic such as a sugar relationship, M/s or D/s, DD/lg, or your idea. The simplest way would be our characters staying in touch and your character getting in touch every time he travels for business, but I have a couple other ideas unless you want to propose something:

1. The Alumni Mentorship Program: We don't exchange information, originally intending it to be a one time thing that both of us feel guilty about. However, sometime in the future, we're surprised to bump into each other at an Alumni-Student Mixer that's part of the Alumni-Student mentorship program run by the school, and I, knowing what it would lead to, request you as a mentor, which you accept.
2. The Internship: I unwittingly apply for an internship at the company you work for, and find myself in the same building as you on a regular basis. Perhaps your status allows you a personal intern, and you request me.

&amp;#x200B;

# More Kinks

As far as kinks long-term: *Everything above + bondage, D/s, M/s, DD/lg, collars, humiliation, degradation, wearing lingerie, sneaking around, spanking, breath play, choking, discipline, training, petplay, fmf, ffm, self-degradation, the phrase ""good girl,"" power imbalances, and depending on the dynamic light raceplay/sexism.*

If there's something you're into that I didn't list, even if it's generally considered weird, I love to hear it and will at least consider accommodating it as long as it isn't surreal (I'm looking for realism with this one). Even if I'm not into it, I promise I won't criticize or judge.

&amp;#x200B;

# Edit: For Responses

I realized I didn't give much direction for responses. I'd love to hear your ideas, kinks, and your initial thoughts for your character. I love details and creativity."
abq5pt,60,2019-01-02,Modified/Updated Choices Chronology,C-Note01,Choices,https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/abq5pt/modifiedupdated_choices_chronology/,"Incoming wall of text. I apologize for nothing.

As there's been some talk about chronology in Choices books, I've created my own. I'd like to thank the people that laid the groundwork for me to go through all the Choices books [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoicesSYP/comments/70344a/choices_stories_chronology/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/91l7ob/overall_choices_chronology/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/9shbym/chronological_order_of_all_the_books/?utm_content=full_comments&amp;utm_medium=message&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage). After my play-through, I've tweaked a few things. I've used some of the typical things, but in cases of ambiguity I've used release dates and a few hc's which I will make sure to note. Also, I'm an F2P, unmodded player. So I'm not as privy with info in premium scenes. So without further ado...

**ACOR**

50 BCE Rome. Need I say more?

**TCTF 1**

This is a TV show in the Choices universe, but it is also a fictionalized version of Cordonian history. (Liam talks about how fantastical the original Cordonian legends are.)

**TCTF 2 -- ATV**

TCTF 2 is obvious.

At this point the only connection ATV has to the choices universe is the Krakken. At this point, it's really up to the player where it goes. It could be a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. It could be concurrent with current Choices books in a galaxy far, far away. Or it could be a distant future, and some of the races we're seeing are actually evolved humans. At this point, I hc that a Krakken from Lektra somehow got off the planet and got lost in the universe. It ended up Earth where Hex found it and imprisoned it for her experiments.

**TCTF 3**

Again, obvious

**DnD 1 &amp; 2**

These books take place in the early 19th century.

**BB**

This book has to take place before VoS due to the hint that &gt;!Grant will be running for Senator Vega's empty Senate seat!&lt;. I'll go over my placement of VoS when I get there.

Also, from a storytelling perspective, with all the flashbacks this book works really well as a bridge between the past and the present.

**RCD 1**

Since *Dirty Hollywood* is still running, this must take place before MW.

**RCD 2 -- AME -- VoS**

RCD 2: Since *Dirty Hollywood* is still running, we're still before MW.

AME: In the chapter where MC has to do the script read, it's mentioned that Thomas Hunt and Chris Winters are there fresh of their set from the new movie they're working on.

VoS: AME is a summer show, and VoS is clearly in the summer. When MC visits Kate in the hospital, Kate mentions catching up on the latest season of AME with her. While this could mean AME Season 2, I currently hc that it's happening concurrently with AME 10. Also, Judge Winters makes and appearance in TSe and mentions catching her flight back to Birchport with her wife. So this must take place before TSe.

**TF 1 -- MW**

In MW, Alyssa Griffin mentions that she's thinking of crossing over into singing. Clearly by TF 2, that's happened. So MW is either concurrent with or before TF 1

**TF 2 -- THoBM**

Hannah is a student of Hartfeld. It's also definitely winter. At the end of THoBM, she goes to the coffee shop and runs into Zack, Tyler, and Kaitlyn pre-haircut.

**TF 3 -- LH 1**

Due to all the cameos and the fact that LH 2 picks up right where LH 1 left off, the LH series was hard to place. When MC and Ben go to the ball game, they see Zack and Brandon there on the kiss cam. (They're clearly on a date.) I have LH 1 starting a few chapters into TF 3 so that very soon after Brandon gets back from Peru, they go on a date and soon after &gt;!break up!&lt;.

**RoE 1**

At the end of TF 3, Madison mentions going on a cruise. We then see her and Trip and/or Logan on the cruise in RoE.

**RoE 2 -- TF 4 -- LH 2**

Emily tells Zack that it's been a month since they've seen each other. I hc that each book of RoE encompasses about a month. Depending on when the school year at Hartfeld ends, TF 4 could be concurrent with either RoE 1 or RoE 2.

When Dani and Ben go to the convention, we see Paolo there advertising the same VR technology that he presented to get his internship for Mansingh Transglobal Tech. This is most likely after he got his internship. So I have this book starting at about the same time as RoE 2.

**RoE 3**

After RoE 2.

**HSS 1 -- TSo 1 -- ILitW**

Jumping ahead a little, in HSS 2, the gang goes to ClickIt, and the rival blog run my Dani and Leah is mentioned. This school year is taking place after LH.

TS 1 is a new year at Harfeld and actually runs a little into HSS 2.

Connections with ILitW and the rest of the choices universe are somewhat sparse. As it came out around the same time as HSS and TSo, I'm placing it here.

**HftH**

The only connection this book has to the Choices universe is that the mayor of Winter Haven is Horatio's uncle. Technically this could take place over any winter break, but as it was released around the time of TSo and HSS, I'm placing it here.

**HSS 2 &amp; 3 -- TSo 2**

TSo 2 actually starts a few chapters into HSS 2 and runs to the end of HSS 3.

**TRR 1**

We know that this has taken place in enough time after &gt;!Leo abdicated!&lt; for Liam to shut down. This book also takes place during the social season. The London social season (I know it's Cordonia, not London) takes place from April to August. This lines up with a comment Liam makes in TRR 2 about seeing the foliage.

**RoE: Newlyweds -- TJ -- HSS: CA -- TRR 2 &amp; 3**

Katie states in Newlyweds that it's been a year since she and your chosen husband have been married.

Another new year at Hartfeld.

HSS: CA is the following school year after HSS.

TRR 2 &amp; 3 following TRR 1.

**PM 1**

In PM2, when the gang sneaks into Eros' internship orientation day, we see Leila and Arjun. I tried to find a definitive answer on what year the two of them were, but I think it's implied they're the same year as the main characters from TF anthology. When I backtracked from there and assuming that the internships started after graduation, I had PM 1 starting some time in the summer before TSe. There are also tons of LH references in Book 2.

**TSe -- TE -- PM 2**

Final year at Hartfeld.

The only thing we know about TE is that it's enough time after Dopey Cat has become popular to actually make it into a book in Penderghast's library. As it came out about the same time as TSe, I'm placing it here.

I actually have PM 2 starting at about halfway through TSe and TE in order to allow for Leila and Arjun to be at orientation after graduation.

**ES 1 -- Hero -- ILB**

ES takes place during the summer between the cast's junior and senior years at Hartfeld. Going all the way back to TF 1, when Emily goes to Chris's football practice, Chris says that he and Darren are the only QB's. Therefore ES must take place either a few years before TF or sometime after. If Sean were to come in as a freshman during TSo, that would put him finishing his junior year at the end of TSe.

Iirc, Hero takes place in the summer heading into the fall, and given it's heavy tie-in to ES, I have it concurrent with that series.

ILB takes place during the summer between MC's junior and senior years of college. Tom mentions that it's been almost three years since the homecoming incident of ILitW. With my current placement, 3 years would put it in the fall after TSe.

**TH:M**

With only five chapters in, we currently have no connections to the Choices universe. The only thing we know is that it's at a time of the year when it's snowing in Canada and not in the other parts of the world the crew has visited. That puts it at either late October-early November or late March-early April. Currently, I'm putting it in the 6-month gap between ES 1 &amp; ES 2.

**ES 2 &amp; 3**

There's the six month gap between ES 1 &amp; ES 2.

**BSC**

This is another summer book. If you make some right choices, MC will make a joke about him/her being a robot to Juliette. Juliette will respond about being MC's perfect match. This means this book takes place after Eros was outed.

Wherever I go I seem to be very well liked because I’m very friendly and (so I’ve been told) bubbly and talkative and funny, and I’m nice to everyone and make them feel comfortable.  Not loud, just gregarious.  I often get accused of flirting when I’m just trying to be friendly.  I make friendly acquaintances pretty easily, people like to be around me, but I have such a hard time taking it past that point, to a deeper friendship.  I like people in general, like I see every person as sort of a chocolate with an unknown center and I like learning what makes them special and unique, so in my ideal world, I really would be friends with everyone, the more the merrier.  Needless to say, I found it quite odd when several people this year told me they hate or don’t like people and will do things to actively avoid them.  I thought they were lying.  Anyhow, I don’t know how to tell sometimes whether someone sees me as a real friend or not, so I don’t often reach out to them outside of whatever sphere I know them from (work, school, etc.).  I’m also afraid of looking needy or clingy.  Growing up I was not popular at all and had a significant amount of anxiety (including social anxiety/shyness) and depression due in large part to that experience.  I was kind of a loner back then, and very quiet, so it came as a shock to me that I tested as an extravert on every single version of Myers-Briggs this year.  I always thought I was an introvert.  Two years ago I finally got my anxiety under control, started going to school again, and worked at Starbucks for awhile.  I couldn’t believe how much happier I felt doing that and being around new people everyday, everywhere I went, and working with a lot of coworkers.  I would go home happy like my emotional bucket was full.  I think my anxiety had just been making it so that previously being around people had been exhausting and I would seek to be alone to recuperate from nearly having panic attacks.  Anyhow, do any of you have the experience that you’re very well liked at least on a superficial level and you get a lot of energy and fulfillment being around other people during the day, but then you go home and sometimes you feel sad because you don’t really have “that person” you can call at any time or just invite over on a whim?  I’m single and had gotten used to living alone and thought I liked it.  Then I went on an internship this summer with nine other students, and it was so nice having so many people around all the time.  If you wanted to do something, everyone was just down the hall or a group text away.  Once I moved back home, I decided to get a roommate after realizing how much I liked having people around.  She had told me she was an introvert, but I didn’t realize she would either never be around (she generally stays at her boyfriend’s) or that, if she were, she would spend most of her time in her bedroom with the door shut.  All this rambling to say - do any of you have such a craving for human interaction, but still have a hard time finding real, meaningful relationships that go beyond acquaintances?  I think it makes it harder, too, because I have this very childlike personality where I’m just fascinated by the world when most people my age are kind of jaded.  I’m 33 and easily get mistaken for someone ten years younger.  I’m returning to school as a science major, and it seems like the average person wants to talk about football or the Oscars or what so and so did at church on Sunday, and I’m over here dreaming about quantum mechanics.  I had really developed what I thought was a special work friendship with my chemistry instructor because he would let me talk to him about all these science-y things.  For once I felt like I could breathe because I had someone to get excited with me about these things and I would share articles and books and other things that I found with him.  Then after I wasn’t in his class anymore, he approached me romantically, which long story short ruined that relationship.  So now...ugh.  I’m trying to get a chemical engineering degree and am hoping I will feel better surrounded by other nerds that I might have more in common with.  But the loss of that relationship really bummed me out.  Do any of you relate to any of these experiences?"
abq8jw,46,2019-01-02,Internships for 1-A's Big 3 w/ Too Much Unnecessary Biology,crabapocalypse,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/abq8jw/internships_for_1as_big_3_w_too_much_unnecessary/,"This was originally a stupid-long comment I was gonna post in a thread, but a few friends told me to make it into a post, and now here we are. Blame them. Also it ended up going over the character limit for comments by a lot anyway (and I still feel like I'm missing a few things), so I'm sorry in advance.

The three I feel it's really worth talking about are Deku, Bakugo and Todoroki, as the latter two have yet to get their provisional licenses and Deku will likely be shifting agencies, since we don't know what's happening with Nighteye's, since Nighteye went goodnight eye. Since it's so lengthy, I'm essentially putting my tl;dr before all the writing.

* Deku - Someone who's creative with their quirk. Alternatively, I think Endeavor could be a really interesting choice.
* Bakugo - Mirko seems perfect, but otherwise anyone who would be able to beat him at his own game would be really good.
* Todoroki - Not Endeavor. Preferably someone who works really well in a team. I'm specifically thinking Kamui Woods.



**Deku**

I'm unsure who I'd like to see Deku intern with, to be honest. I can't think of any perfect candidates, though I can think of a few that could be really interesting. A lot of people jump to Mirko, but I feel like that's actually one of the least interesting routes to take. And so,  I'm going to spend most of Deku's section going over why I feel like interning under Mirko wouldn't be ideal for him, though I'll also touch on the specific qualities that I feel would suit him best and throw out some ideas for a couple of specific characters.

Fighting Style:

It's true that they both jump around and kick a lot, however, I'd still argue that their fighting styles are very different. Deku primarily makes contact with the shin and dorsal edge of his foot, as opposed to Mirko, who (from what little we've seen) seems to favour making contact with the sole of her foot (this is actually the same way Tsuyu kicks, which I feel is worth noting since they both have mutation quirks). This seems like a pretty minor difference, but it changes the primary muscles involved and the movement is completely different. Mirko's kicks seem to be all about that extension. Specifically, knee and hip extension. That's potentially one of the reasons why the combat stance she gets into after arriving at the scene in chapter 191 is a modified squat; her knees and hips are fully flexed that way. That said, the most likely reason she adopts that stance is because there's distance between them and she was getting ready to jump at him, which uses the same muscles. While all types of kicks use a *lot* of different muscles for a variety of purposes (balance, stablising joints, generating explosive force, etc.), Mirko's likely emphasise glute max, all the hams (barring biceps femoris' short head), and all the quadriceps. Deku's kicks, however, seem to be more hip-flexor dominant, so you're looking at muscles like rec fem (the other quads are important too, but they're being used more to prevent the knee from bending upon impact than to generate explosive force themselves) and the iliopsoas muscles. Beyond that, though, these internships aren't classes. Any actual fighting tips they get will likely be through small pieces of advice and observing them in the field. And even though Deku is good at learning by observation, would he want to adopt techniques in Mirko's style? She seems to have an incredibly leg-dominant style, while Deku's actually moving away from just using his legs and into a more balanced and well-rounded arsenal. Imo, he'd benefit much more from interning under someone who's good at using their quirk in creative and interesting ways, to help him further that. 

Personality stuff:

Personally, I think it'd likely be pretty uninteresting to see the kind of dynamic Deku and Mirko would have. Deku tends to be pretty easily overwhelmed by people with very loud and bombastic personalities. It's true that he's made leaps and bounds with Bakugo, but I'd argue that that's largely due to their shared history and a long build up, so I don't think it's particularly indicative of his ability to deal with those kinds of people having grown all too much. There's something to be said for him interning under someone who'll force him to become a little more assertive, but I don't think Mirko is a great choice for that (my actual choice is, I feel, a much better fit for that). I think he'd get overwhelmed and not know what to do and, because of Mirko's energy and such, I feel like he wouldn't have time to properly compose himself and stand up to her. On another note, I find it hard to imagine Mirko wanting someone like Deku interning under her to begin with. Hers and Deku's way of approaching hero work seem antithetical to each other. Hell, the first thing she ever says in the series is ""Joining a team is for weaklings"". It's hard to imagine Deku reconciling that with his own more friendly and positive outlook.

My choice for Deku:

To be honest, I'm not 100% sold on this. Going into writing this, I didn't have one picked out for Deku, but because this post has apparently reached critical mass, I've had a lot of time to think. And I think I'd like him to intern with Endeavor. Endeavor has demonstrated at least a decent level of creativity with his quirk, so Deku may be able to steal a few ideas from him. His fighting style is also surprisingly physical for someone who uses fire, so Deku could probably find something worth adapting into his own fighting style. Either way, that's not the main draw for me, here. I mentioned above that I felt Mirko could be used to force Deku to be more assertive, but would likely overwhelm him instead. I think Endeavor, especially as he's mellowed out lately, might be really great at getting Deku to be more assertive. For one thing, while Deku's bad at speaking up and challenging people, that doesn't seem to apply as much when the people he's talking to appear to him to be either morose and quiet (think his fight with Todoroki) or morally reprehensible (think Overhaul and Gentle), though it is worth pointing out that those all took place during fights, so he was super amped up and less likely to hold back anyway. That said, I think both ""morose and quiet"" and ""morally reprehensible"" could potentially be applied to Endeavor. Deku's one of the few people in the series to know about the whole Todoroki family stuff and so I don't imagine he has too high of opinion of Endeavor as a result. That combined with Endeavor being a man of few words (and so leaving a lot of room for argument) could lead to Deku pushing back and resisting him a fair bit. Someone like Deku would probably be good for Endeavor to spend time with, too. Deku's whole thing is that he's pure and amazing, and Endeavor has led a life that's tainted almost beyond belief. I actually think Endeavor could potentially be good for Deku's self-esteem too, though I'm not certain of it. Endeavor seems to be a pretty blunt and up-front person; he speaks his mind. That could be really beneficial for Deku, as praise or anything along those lines would most certainly be genuine. 

Something I'd really like to happen at some stage in the series is for Endeavor to find out about One for All. I think it'd be really interesting to see how he'd react to finding out that his attempt to create a genetic superbaby was all in an attempt to overtake someone who was not only given his power by someone else, but was given a power that's been steadily increasing in strength for decades. If you want to stretch real hard, you could even see it as a parallel, with All Might essentially being ""created"" by Nana (and by extension, Deku being ""created"" by All Might) and Endeavor's attempt to surpass All Might being to ""create"" the perfect hero. Most importantly, though, I think it'd be really nice to see the successor of All Might's power working under the successor to his title. Endeavor's still trying to figure out what kind of symbol of peace he's going to be, and Deku's even shown hints of questioning there for himself, in his fight with Overhaul (though he was questioning the symbol of peace he *could* be, as opposed to Endeavor's questioning of the symbol of peace he wants to be). It might be a bit cheesy, but I don't think there's anyone better suited to helping Endeavor ~~in that endeavor~~ than Deku.


**Now, on to Bakugo**

If anyone is to intern under Mirko, my pick is Bakugo. First off there's the obvious similarity in that they both seem to prefer operating alone, though Bakugo has been moving away from this throughout the series. To be honest, she doesn't seem like the type to want someone interning under her at all, with her opposition to teams, but I could see her making an exception for someone like Bakugo. Remember, Bakugo was on national tv demonstrating more or less the same stance towards his classmates that Mirko seems to have towards her fellow heroes. That coupled with him coming out on top would probably be pretty appealing to her. Additionally, I think she would be able to put Bakugo in his place in a way that most of the other characters struggle to. Also, both of their fighting styles seem to be heavily focused on mobility and instinct, trusting completely in their own abilities to get the job done, rather than planning everything out meticulously. Match 4 of the current arc actually demonstrated Bakugo's version of ""strategy"" quite well, with his idea being an approach, rather than a step-by-step plan. This works well for someone like Bakugo, since it allows any method of attack to be adapted to the situation. It's incredibly versatile, which allows his prowess as an instinctive combatant to shine through. There isn't heaps of evidence for it yet, but I'd hazard a guess that Mirko is very similar. I also just think it'd be cool to have Bakugo be potentially overwhelmed by someone who does what he does but better, and have to actually learn to play support, because Bakugo's actually incredibly well-suited to support in combat. He has great mobility and good battle sense.

**And finally, we reach Todoroki**

I'd quite like to see him diverge from Endeavor for a bit. There's still plenty he can learn from Endeavor to master his fire, but I think he has more fundamental flaws that will only be exacerbated by interning under Endeavor. While it's true that Endeavor doesn't seem to be opposed to working with other heroes, and he runs his own agency, I'd still say that I think he probably functions best with few team members, if any. At least for actual combat. One of the running themes for Todoroki has been his lack of people skills. It's a result of his, to put it mildly, harsh upbringing and it bleeds over into his fights. He managed to work well in a team against Stain (and in a confined space, no less), but that was largely due to Deku and Iida's extremely high mobility. In other situations, he seems to struggle to work around others. In the current arc, for example, his team's strategy was to send him in and have him basically just hit 1-B hard and hope they couldn't stand up to it. It was actually a big thing worth commenting on that his initial big ice boom was sculpted in a way that didn't obscure the vision of his teammates. Because of all this, I'm of the opinion that Todoroki should intern under people who function in a team. Coincidentally, it wasn't too long ago that we got a reveal that two of the current top 10, Kamui Woods and Edgeshot, are in a team (the same one, to boot!), and I think either of them could work really well for Todoroki to intern with. I lean more towards Kamui Woods here, because Todoroki's ice is vaguely similar to Kamui's wooden tendrils and Todoroki could probably pick up a couple of cool ideas from observing him in action. Additionally, I'd really like for either the hero Todoroki interns under or one of their teammates to have an intern who functions as a foil for him and could be viewed as more or less his equal. There was a post not too long ago discussing Inasa, and I had a lengthy exchange in there, discussing why I feel Inasa is a great character and functions as a perfect foil for Todoroki. I think, after building a little respect, trust and familiarity between them, they could be a powerhouse duo, and I feel this would be one of the best ways to bring back the Shiketsu students and integrate them into the regular goings-on in a cohesive manner.

Either that or Todoroki can intern under Wash, and give up on becoming the #1 hero in favour of being in advertisements as a mascot. That would be the true ""fuck you"" to his father.

Anyway, that's that. If you made it to the end, tell me what products you think Mr Icyhot is best-suited to be the mascot for ~~and why it's kettles~~ "

I am definitely a little mad at my ex, but almost all of my anger is directed at the dude. This fuckface was the one guy to whom I had confided in whenever I had personal problems or relationship problems for YEARS. I opened up like crazy to him as I don't have a lot of friends and he was always seemingly happy to listen. My ex and he were pretty close friends too, and the funny thing is that all three of us always joke about how it'd be pretty disgusting if my girlfriend started dating him.

I trusted him with my life. I actually encouraged her, on the nights that I was busy studying, to go to his place and smoke weed with him if she wanted to have fun and let loose for the weekend. I didn't have any reason to doubt any funny business back then. In retrospect, I don't know if I had too liberal a mindset or anything and that's what led to the current situation, but I definitely think that I'm gonna develop some trust issues as a result of this. I have no fucking clue when they actually started dating but by the looks of it it seems like it didn't take much longer after she dumped me. Fuck. Oddly, after a week or so after the breakup this moron started attacking me? Not physically, but all of a sudden he started attacking my very personality, my hobbies, and basically everything about me. He just blasted me as being a shitty human being and told me that that's what led to the breakup, which made me severely confused. To think I immediately went to him for comfort after breaking up, how blind I was.

Happy to say that it's been long enough that this bullshit doesn't torment every minute of my existence, but the fact that I'm still so angry means that I'm clearly not over it.

I don't think I fell into a hole after being dumped though. I started hitting the gym immediately after, gained 15lbs in 4 months, cut him out from my life entirely, secured an internship I really wanted for this upcoming summer, sorted out some other minor stuff in my life and honestly things are looking good for future. But still, oh how I would love to kick his fucking teeth in for the betrayal.

Before anyone comes at me with ""your ex is allowed to do anything she wants once she dumps you"", as I already mentioned I am not really that angry at my ex. I don't have any concrete reason to think that she was already emotionally cheating on me while we were together, even though I'm inclined to think this was already happening. I am simply very disgusted and shocked by the fact that my once-closest friend learned of many aspects of my relationship and somehow could find it in him to date my ex almost immediately after our breakup. Honestly, if he had asked me I probably would've been mad at first but would've given him my blessing, for deep inside I kinda always knew that he and my ex were probably a better match. But he chose to indirectly end our friendship ENTIRELY as though it meant nothing to him, which is what makes my blood boil."
abre9m,2,2019-01-02,"How do I hit the ""reset"" button?",JustinBalogna,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/abre9m/how_do_i_hit_the_reset_button/,"Quick backstory on me as a person: I am not good at change, nor am I good at telling people when I want to change.

With that being said, here is my situation. I have realized there are a lot of things in my life I am not entirely happy with. The two major parts: an organization on campus I participate in (which deals with working with real-life business clients, and me as project lead), and an internship for a marketing firm (that has four employees, and very rarely micromanages me - I haven't even come to work in a month. It is more of a work-when-I-want job).

Both of these have bored me. The first one doesn't even fit what I want to do with my life, as I switched majors from business to communications recently. The second one is fine, but again does not align exactly with what I want.

Now, here I am, procrastinating like all hell trying NOT to quit either of them. I even have things to do for both tomorrow, but my anxiety over this issue has gotten so bad that I am up at 3 in the morning thinking about it.

Part of me absolutely hates having to personally tell people I don't want to do something anymore. I feel like I'm being a quitter, and I don't want to ruin my chances elsewhere. Part of me is simply scared of changing where my life is going, though I know I am bound to go the right way.

In the end, I want to be a journalist of some sort. I began as a business student, aspiring to be a rich and successful marketing manager. I realize I hate the idea of that now.

Basically, I need advice on some sort of magical ""reset"" button. I know it doesn't exist. But what is the best way to go about quitting things I have invested lots of time into, and furthermore, going down this different path? Any other lifestyle tips would help too. Appearance, mental health, physical health, self-education, anything. I am not depressed, really, I am just stuck. Really, I am simply afraid of change, and keep pushing the change off. I notice it has affected my work performance in both of these jobs, and need some extra guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

I've (M, 20)  had a crush on my high school friend (F, 20) for awhile now. We're both in second year of university now, going to different schools about 2hrs apart. Although we live in the same hometown.

&amp;#x200B;

Before senior year we were just classmates, but at the end of senior year of high school I started to really like and develop a crush on her. At first it seemed like she reciprocated and liked me back, but a few months into the summer I realized that because we are going to different universities (2h apart), it would be best if I stop pursuing her.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the next time I would see her since senior year would be in the summer right before the start of my second year. We were both at an event, and we got around to talking with each other and catching up, which was pretty great. She told me she got an internship in my city that semester and that we could hang out again sometime.

&amp;#x200B;

We hung out once in the city of my university, which was pretty great. Because I was so busy with school, though, (and also because I thought pursuing her would be a bad idea due to the distance), we didn't hang out anymore than that. But over the winter holidays, I saw her once more just for coffee, and I thought it was really great seeing her again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout my first and even second year, there have been times where I've thought about her. Actually one time I saw a picture of her and a guy really close, and I thought that she got a boyfriend which really hurt me for awhile (turns out I was wrong and she's single).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, she has a lot of guy friends in university, who I speculate could make better conversation with her than I could (they're probably funnier, at least).

&amp;#x200B;

I think she sees me just as a friend. We had a good conversation over coffee, but it wasn't anything exciting. Mostly just catching up and talking like friends. Although we're both going back to school next semester (and will live 2h apart), I would still want to try something like a relationship with her, even if it might backfire due to the distance. In the summer, we would have more time to see each other as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I ultimately just think she sees me as a friend. Despite this, I probably will continue to keep thinking about her, even during the school year when I try to get over her. If I tell her how I feel, I think she will say that she just wants to stay friends. And part of me is okay with that. Maybe part of me just wants to stop thinking about her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I don't actually have to tell her how I feel to stop thinking about her.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure. What do you think, reddit?

First, I want to say clearly that I don't have ill-will towards step-parents in general. My stepfather was a far better parent than my father, and while that is a low bar, my stepmother was absolutely incredible, and was both my best and favorite parent.

So, it is with that in mind that I say to you all, I was excited when 10 years ago, my children were finally getting a step-mom. I saw it is a boon; their father was at the time, career military, and having a step-mom meant they could visit him out of state for longer stretches and actually develop a meaningful relationship with him.

When my ex came to visit the boys shortly before marrying her, our children were 5 and 4 years old, and I had 2 year old twins. My current husband worked full time, and I cared for the kids in addition to a full courseload at a top tier research university. When I opened the door, our 4 year old, looked at my ex and said, ""Are you my dad?"" It broke our hearts that he didn't recognize his own father, so we made arrangements for the boys to spend six months in the state my ex was stationed in. At that time, my ex was paying $925/month in child support, and in my situation, I could not afford to pay him. I released him from that obligation while they were with him, and additionally loaned them my van that I was making payments on, added them to my insurance, and made sure they had the ability to move my kids as well as their own kids around while covering all maintenance costs for the vehicle.

Upon their return, it all went sideways. My kids came home having developed a relationship with dad, and my van was in one piece. Then, one day I pulled my sun visor down while driving and had a folded, multi-page typed letter from her fall in my lap.

She said truly horrible things. Accused me of neglect, abuse, psychological trauma, came after me for non-payment of child support, and threatened me with legal action and getting CPS involved.

I internalized it, cried on my husband, but ultimately, I didn't do anything about it because I know I'm a good mom and that her threats, even if she followed through would amount to nothing but inconvenience.

Things were quiet-ish for a few years. The kids would fly out to see my ex once or twice a year, which I always paid for even though he was court ordered to because the alternative was them not seeing him. Their happiness is important to me.

In summer of 2013, I sent the kids via plane to dad for the summer, and my university sent me to Germany for a few months to complete a program on global/international public relations and communication ethics that had me in school in Erfurt while working an internship in Berlin. While I was there, my own step-mom suffered acute liver failure related to her years-long battle with breast cancer and while I was trying to figure out how to terminate my program early and get home, my ex's wife decided that it was time to start contacting me, demanding custody of my kids, saying that my academic work was detrimental to them, and so on. I was a wreck, and she said cruel things. I got messages from her each time I hit another destination on the leg home- train from Erfurt to Frankfurt, plane from Frankfurt to Copenhagen, then to Washington DC, then to Austin, TX, and upon landing there, immediately from Austin to San Antonio by car. My step-mom passed the day before I made it, and my father and I opted to postpone her funeral until the boys got home. Kids' stepmom objected to sending them home, saying that my religion's funerals were no place for them (I'm pagan; it's been an ongoing point of contention, but I've always been this and my ex knew it when he married me). I explained the court order, they came home, we had the funeral (it consisted of my step-mom's friends and family sharing stories about her and having a potluck).

The threats and the posturing continued from July through December of 2013. In December, I paid for the boys to visit my ex (again at my expense) and while they were there, ex and step-mom threatened again to not send them back.

So, as a piece of background, I will say that I was sexually abused by my father from the ages of 14-17. I confronted him when I was 17 and told my step-mom. My step-mom held him accountable and never let him touch me again. However, my ex and I started dating when I was 16. One day I stayed home sick from school, and my ex came over while my parents were at work, but my dad decided to come home to ""check on me"" (ie- assert his control), and assaulted me while my ex was hiding under the bed.

So, fast forward to December 2013, my ex's wife grabbed the phone while angry and tore into me about how my father had damaged me, made me a terrible parent, and berated me while proclaiming that I would never actually be a whole person because of it. She told me I severely need therapy (literally had been to ongoing therapy for years doing EMDR treatments for complex PTSD), and to date it is the only time that my husband has taken a phone away from me and shut a conversation down. At that time, I realized how actually dangerous that woman is.

I called their bluff regarding their threats of legal action and filed a suit with the courts to revisit visitation and conservatorship in January 2014. Going down with everything would take forever, so here's the bullet points:

- Sought modification for additional child support and modified visitation
- Ex left military to move back to Texas at the recommendation of his attorney
- Had an amicus attorney appointed by a judge to conduct thorough home studies
- Dealt with three fraudulent CPS reports filed by step-mom, none of which found anything she said to be true
- Ex and step mom both taunted me about the recurrent miscarriages I keep having during this timeframe, saying things like, ""How many are you up to now? We've lost track.""
- Ex brought step-mom to 504 meetings and parent/teacher conferences where step-mom actively tried to undermine me to teachers by reiterating same allegations made to CPS
- Step-mom then emailed kids' therapist with the same crazy allegations
- Amicus reviewed all evidence presented and determined that it was in the best interest that the boys stay with me, and also that my ex had been underlying child support, and as a result owed me an additional $7k
- Step-mom called amicus after that decision and berated her as both an attorney and a parent
- Amicus called me to recommend finding a way to protect myself against step-mom
- Amicus called ex's attorney to tell him to get a handle on his clients wife, instead, attorney dropped my ex as a client
- Ex did not show up to final hearing in May 2015; new orders were entered regardless and amicus reiterated protecting myself

After that, I waited a few months for things because I thought once everyone was calm, things could be reasonable. I reached out to step-mom to get lunch and she agreed. As we sat there, she tearfully apologized for her behavior and I told her that emotions were running high, and I get it. She then tried to blame the kids for all of it by saying they lied to her and that's why she was so crappy. I realized I could be friendly to her, but we'd never be ""friends.""

From May 2015 to May 2017 things were okay-ish in terms of getting along, but their house was struggling financially because they were ill-equipped for the transition from military to civilian living. Child support was not being paid, I would regularly by groceries for their house to make sure the kids had food when they were there, and about six months in I asked my ex how things were. He couldn't find work because they only had one car and they were getting nervous because Texas is aggressive about unpaid child support. I agreed to loan him my spare car on the condition that he cover registration, insurance, and tolls while it was in his possession. He agreed, got a job, but somehow still wasn't paying child support.

After a year and a half, his past due child support amount was over $23k, so the state started suspending his licenses. Our oldest started bisbahaving in school, because he has ADHD and my ex told him it was okay to cheek and spit out his meds. In March 2017, I arranged to have a difficult and rare surgery in another state to address my issues with pregnancy loss because ectopics are dangerous. I scheduled the surgery for May 2017 and told my ex I'd need extra help watching the kids in that timeframe.

May rolled around, I asked the ex to keep our oldest while I was out of town, and he refused, because he didn't agree with the surgery or me trying to have another kid. I made alternate arrangements with a trusted lifelong friend a few hours from my ex to watch my oldest, and I caught my flight out.

My ex threw an epic-level tantrum. He showed up at my house threatening my husband (he works the night shift which is why we needed a hand with the kids while I was gone) and refusing to leave the property until my husband called the police. He demanded that I come home and bring our son to him despite knowing where the kid was and knowing how to retrieve him. Then he and his wife left a voicemail for the old amicus telling her to ""explain the duties of parenting"" (she ignored them) and opened yet another fraudulent CPS case alleging that I drugged the kids, abandoned them, lived in squalor, let my father have unfettered access to them (my father lives very far from me, quite on purpose; they are never around him), and so on all FROM THE COMFORT OF MY OWN CAR THEY WERE DRIVING, REFUSING TO LEAVE MY DRIVEWAY. They eventually left in my running vehicle. CPS investigated while I was out of state, interviewed me by phone, and ultimately closed the case in my favor. When I got home at the end of May, I attempted to retrieve my oldest and my ex and step-mom refused access, citing that CPS told them not to because of an ""on-going investigation."" I explained that was false, they shut the door in my face. I tried to retrieve my car, but they had removed and locked up the battery.

I was served with a lawsuit two days later requesting that I be put on probation, that the kids be sent to my ex in emergency temporary orders as I was a danger to them, that I get only supervised visitation at my own expense, and that his child support obligation be removed and I be ordered to pay. For the sake of not going crazy in the details of the case again, here are the bulletpoints:

- Ex only pursued one kid, not both in the in-person medications, but did in paperwork
- CPS determined that investigation had been closed, but they opened a new one with the same allegation the very next day, which was also immediately closed
- CPS determined there was a pattern of harassment and noted my file accordingly allowing further investigations to be allocated directly to ""alternative response"" (no more official investigations)
- He was initially pro se and did not hire an attorney until June 2018
- He agreed to my attorney's face to return my car, and instead had it towed as ""abandoned"" 30 minutes later. I never got it back and it was sold in auction by the city
- A few months later I received a toll bill for $13k in unpaid toll violations threatening court action for all the usage while they had the car
- Ex became completely inflexible on visitation while I dealt with serious health issues during a high risk but viable (finally) pregnancy. Not minor health issues, major ones, like blood transfusions and fetal ascites
- Actively tried to alienate my oldest, and bought him a cell phone, an Xbox, a laptop, and a puppy to convince him to live there
- Tried to change the court-ordered therapist for the boys without telling me or getting approval from the court because his wife didn't like that the therapist wouldn't respond to her
- Coached the kids to tell the judge that they want to live with him, then filed the Motions to Confer (at the age of 12 a judge is supposed to talk to children in chambers to hear their preferences)
- When I let oldest try to live with his dad for a semester, ex refused to schedule and take him to 504 meetings, pediatricians office, pediatric neurologist, and court ordered therapist, while kid had countless unexcused absences, failed classes, and generally got no support
- In March 2018 we had the hearing on temporary orders and Motions to Confer. The judge denied all relief requested by ex, denied both Motions to Confer (unprecedented) based on evidence presented, then ordered ex to see therapist specializing in parental alienation, ordered both parents to read the book BIFF, which is about communicating with high-conflict people, and ordered mediation prior to a final hearing

Now, here is not the end of the story, but I want to paint a really important picture for you. I had told my ex on multiple occasions that his wife's behavior was a significant problem. He kept blowing me off, and saying I was out to get her and just didn't like her.

Step-mom spent the hearing sitting in the gallery of the court room. When it became apparent that the judge was going to rule against them on all issues across the board, she stormed out angrily and loudly. The judge continued to render her determination while step-mom stormed back in, marched up to the gate, interrupt the judge by yelling ""UM, EXCUSE ME!"" then proceeded to yell insults at me from the other side of the gate.

You could have heard a pin drop when it stopped. No one spoke. She literally stomped her feet in place and stormed back out. My ex was hiding his face in his hand. My attorney didn't know what was happening. The judge quietly said, ""Who was that?"" My ex explained that it was his wife, my attorney looked at me and silently mouthed the words, ""What the fuck?"" And the judge gave a twenty minute long speech about the roles of step-parents and how it is bio-parents responsibility to keep step-parents in line.

Within hours of the conclusion of that hearing, there was yet another CPS case opened against me. It was routed through alternative response and quickly closed as a collossal waste of time.

Here are some examples of things that my kids' step-mom had said to my kids that should never have been uttered:

- Your mom is a psycho and needs help.
- You should write an essay about the ways your mom has ruined the relationship you have with her.
- We are not paying for any part of you getting braces unless you're living with us.
- Your mom just wants other people to do all the work for her so she never has to pay for anything (when I had to buy a new car because they screwed me out of mine).
- The toll charges are your mom's problem now.
- When are we allowed to stop taking your mom's shit?
- We shouldn't have to pay past due child support. That amicus was corrupt.
- Ouch. I thought you gave a shit about us and wanted to spend time here (after my oldest said he wanted to spend Christmas with me).
- I hope your mom's baby dies of SIDS.
- Your half siblings should be evaluated for Down's syndrome.
- Your grandfather sexually abused your mom (graphic details).
- I'm disappointed that he didn't talk to us. I've never met a pedophile in person before (upon seeing my father at a faire in a town a few hours away).

At this point, there's been a final hearing.

The reason for this cautionary tale is to remind bio-parents that they have a responsibility to their children to maintain and enforce appropriate boundaries between exes and spouses. Otherwise this can (and did) happen:

- step-mom is court ordered to not contact bio-mom in any way, shape, or form, ever.
- children are not to be cared for step-mom for more than 12 hours unsupervised by bio-dad
- step-mom is barred from all school-related activities and is not permitted to be an emergency contact or to contact teachers or administration for any reason
- step-mom is not permitted to attend appointments with or even. contact any medical, dental, or mental health professional pertaining to any part of the children's care
- step-mom is not permitted on bio-mom's property, even to pick up or drop off kids
- step-mom is not permitted to discuss or comment on any members of bio-mom's household or family members
- step-mom is barred from creating false or legitimate social media accounts to gain access to bio-mom's personal life or from other activities under the umbrella of cyberstalking
- violating these means losing access to the children and reverting to supervised visits only

So, yeah. Boundaries. Have them. State them. Reinforce them. When bio-parent says something is a problem, be prepared to take them seriously. If you don't, judges may hit you hard.

Don't be the step-parent that messes up the relationship between your spouse and their kids. Do be the step-parent whose step-kid will move heaven and earth to be at your side and would give anything to tell you they love you in person."

He drove a taxi cab for a long time, and finally managed to get this job after hours of preparation for standardised tests and interviews, it was a very long interview process with multiple certifications. He really wanted this job because it's relatively stable and has good benefits. I'm a 20 year old engineering student who has about 2 years left in school and I am trying my best to get a great job after I graduate. I was reading through some documents in his desk when he asked me to find something there and I found documents regarding a compliant he filed against violent customers, and other abusive drivers. He once had a case where he slowed the bus down to get an old woman on the bus who couldn't want and was berated by another driver on the bus for ""being a dumbass"". Other situations, where customers throw coffee and feces. It just underscores the shitty environment he has to face just to put food on the table. My mom works as a cashier at walmart and I'd imagine the environment isn't any better. I haven't talked to them about it. I have a younger brother who's also a freshman engineering major and we talked about this together and it really hurts that our parents have to go through so much nonsense just so we could have a better future. I have a great internship lined up this summer with an engineering firm that'll pay well; last summer I interned in california and made some money which I used to treat everyone to dinner, buy clothes for everyone and get laptops for my brother and younger sister, that they'll need for school. I'm also able to fund my education through loans/internships/grants. It just sucks that I can't really take them out of this situation until I graduate and even if I do, I want both my parents to live with me when I get married, but I dunno how the wife will feel about that. I feel kind of helpless and just need advice on things I can do now to make my parents' condition better. I want to be wealthy one day so that we can live in the same house or even neighborhood and not have to deal with the crap that comes with blue collar jobs. My parents laid out their entire lives for me and my siblings and I think the least I can do is do something about this. I know my parents are people, and they had a life before me, I just want them to feel that I care and I'm doing everything in my power to make their lives comfortable. I just don't know what else I should be doing."

The reason I'm posting today is because she just told me, and I quote: *""You're so fat ControlRods, nobody will hire you!""*

I'm totally baffled and confused. I get it that everything she says has to revolve around her, but this is stretching it a bit too thin... (pardon the pun)."

I'm an IT student and will be doing an internship at KMITL for 3 months starting in March of this year !

I wanted to stay in the KMITL dorm for my accommodation because I thought it would be a great way to get to know some people and make friends. Apparently the dorm is only open to handicapped/people struggling financially.
Because of this i'm wondering what the best way is for me to tackle my accommodation issue. I could stay with fellow students from Belgium, but that just seems a bit too easy to me.

Another problem I have is with my Visa. I figured out that I should apply for an ED internship Visa. On the Belgian site of the Thai embassy it is stated that I need my flight tickets before I can apply for a Visa (https://www.thaiembassy.be/visa/ - scroll down to ED - internship). I find it quite difficult to order flight tickets if i'm unsure about my visa, am I wrong ?

Really looking forward to my time in Thailand not only to learn more about IT but to grow as a person. Thanks for taking the time to read my post, any tips, advice and suggestions are greatly appreciated !"

abtwgv,13,2019-01-02,He wasn’t even my boyfriend,revs592,AbuseInterrupted,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbuseInterrupted/comments/abtwgv/he_wasnt_even_my_boyfriend/,"When I was 19 I started workin at this really cool place. I came in after training and everyone had already grouped off. I was waiting in line and this guy (my roommate) came up to me and engaged me in conversation. He looked like a hipster with short hair and a long beard. He was older, 7 years older. 

We started hanging out. He was nice enough. Implosive and obviously damaged but not dangerous I thought. He took me to expensive places and bought me gifts. He fed me and checked in on me. When we slept together he focused on me, making me happy. 

Then he would get angry when I didn’t want to watch what he wanted to watch, he’d get snippy and harsh and cold. He’d get angry when I wanted to leave a place before he was gone. He never hit me, he’d just yell or ignore me. He’d sit me down and scream in my face or not say anything at all. So I told him I was going to leave if it didn’t get better. 
He let me walk out the door and didn’t talk to me for a week. When I didn’t come back and blocked him on Facebook he called to apologize. He stops yelling for a while. 

Then he makes a point to ask me what I want to watch on tv but he doesn’t believe me when I tell him I don’t want to do things. He stops spending time or money on me. He wants me around but we just sit and watch tv. He refuses to spend money or make plans. I ask for a change. He says I’m insatiable, I cannot be pleased. 

I break up with him. I tell him he can take some time.  He doesn’t seem to need it. He wants to know about my boyfriends. He wants to keep having sex. I tell him I don’t think we should, it’s too soon. He says it’s fine. 

He gets attached and we keep getting back together because he cries and says he can’t be a better person without me. I feel bad and go back. And we keep breaking up because he goes back to lying, telling me my memory is wrong, questioning everything I do and say, the people I’m with and where I go. 

I remind him that he’s not my boyfriend. He tells me we are gonna get married. I give him 100 reasons why we are not and he just disregards everything. But we stay friends cause I figure he’d let it go.

Then he wanted to pay my way through college. I asked him why, I told him I didn’t want his money. I wanted to take care of myself.  He said he wanted to because I was his friend and he loved me. I declined so he started buying me groceries, putting gas in my car, trying to pay for my medical bills. And he’d always say don’t worry about it, focus on getting through school. I always thought in the back of my mind that I owed him now. I hated that. When I didn’t do what he wanted he acted like I was a gold digger, he’d tell me about how all his friends said so too and he was the only one who knew the truth. Implying I make myself look bad by not cooperating and being ungrateful.

He doesn’t let it go. I’m in a situation with an abusive roommate and so he asks me to move in with him. I have nowhere else to go so I say yes after a lot of prodding. I told him I was done sleeping with him. No matter what I said, i didn’t want to have sex with him anymore. 

Then during my summer internship, I got a boyfriend. He tried to convince me that boy was using me for sex and he didn’t even really like me. That boy would forget about me after summer. 

When I broke up with that boy, I rebounded and not with my roommate. He didn’t appreciate that. The next morning he stormed about and said that I shouldn’t have had sex last night. Then he said he felt like I was punishing him by having sex in the home we shared. 

He did this all the time. He’d ask about my crushes or my boyfriends and then cry and talk about how much he loved me and missed me and how much it hurt him to see me with other men. He’d yell at me because I wouldn’t answer a question or I didn’t answer quickly enough. 

Then our lease was up, it only has his name on it. I couldn’t afford to sign the lease but he said I had to. I wouldn’t have had anywhere to go if I didn’t. He tried to get me to take out loans which would have destroyed my credit. He got super angry when I wouldn’t. Then he said that I should just sign it because he would pay for everything. He had been buying the food, paying utilities, I didn’t even have access. He preferred it that way. And I signed it. I didn’t know what else to do. 

I didn’t trust myself. I had panic attacks every day and I felt like I couldn’t breathe when he was home. I thought I was just going crazy. It wasn’t until a friend brought emotional and psychological abuse to my attention that I knew there was a problem. 

When I brought it to his attention, he said he thought he was being victimized. I lost it. He finally admitted to abusing me, knowingly, for almost four years so that I’d marry him...I don’t even believe in marriage. I told him I was done.
He told me he hopes we can get back to being best friends and he loves me. I tell him not to talk to me again but we live together.

He changes, he cuts his beard. When I talk to him his eyes are cold and dead. He’s not crying or blinking or sorry. He slams doors in my face and denies ever abusing me. He says that he loves me and now he has to walk on eggshells. I tell him I’m afraid of him and he gets angry, he raises his voice. He tells me his friend say there no way he could have abused me.

It’s only after I try to kill myself that he acts like he cares...says he’s always loved me. Son of a BITCH wanted me to come back when I was vulnerable. It almost worked. 

Now I fucking live with him and I constantly feel like it’s my fault. If I hadn’t said anything, at least one of us would be happy...I’m more alone now than I ever was

Hey there DPP,

So a fantasy for me has been thinking about which celebrity women are the kinkiest, what they do in private and how some lucky guy (or girl) is getting to do it to them. So what could be more fun then hearing about some of these filthy actions straight from the women involved?

I would love to play a BFF, an intern, a co-star or something along those lines that a celebrity woman plays around with on the side. They never actually fuck and it's usually very chill for them but she likes to tease him with her tales as she makes him jerk off, or jerks him off herself while making sure to commend him for his heavy balls and talking up how much she's looking forward to his load in the meantime. Even fingering herself and making sure that she gets off when he does or while she's telling her story before making sure her partner finishes too.

If it becomes a more long-term affair, we can introduce kinks going forward but I would like to at least begin with the set-up that she enjoys telling her stories in intricate details while teasing her partner. She can use her ass, thighs, hands, lips, face, panties, etc etc. How she does the teasing is up to you for sure as well as the tales! My guy will happily share his own, have requests/in-depth questions and have the biggest crush on your girl that you can imagine.

His race, age, height, dick-size and the like can be up to you if you have any specific wants and desires out of him so don't be afraid! As long as he is 18+ then I'm happy to oblige anything that would make him just a bit hotter for you!

I tend to like women 25+ but I am up for suggestions! Feel free to leave a small list or let me know if there is anyone specific that you would really like to play! Thanks for reading and looking forward to playing with anyone interested!"

And I probably have been looking over the internet for 2-3 days and I haven't been able to progress what so ever. I'm currently working with C# and HTML, CSS(razor).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm creating a system where users can log-in and change their own data. It should be really simple but I can't seem to make it work and the worst thing is, I don't even know where to start. I already made a fully functional log-in system with a tutorial, I tried understanding what the code does but I can only understand it partly, it does work however but it really doesn't help me understand it. I think if someone would help me with making my next function things might get easier to understand.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've been struggling with is creating an edit function(see link [https://imgur.com/7TamDah](https://imgur.com/7TamDah)).

Some of these words are dutch but it's just some data in a table. The user who is logged in should be able to edit their data(Firstname, lastname, etc.) as soon as they click the ""wijzigen"" button(which means Edit in dutch).

&amp;#x200B;

So to create this I'm using

A controller (GebruikerController):

[https://pastebin.com/NX4ehSZe](https://pastebin.com/NX4ehSZe)

&amp;#x200B;

A model (UserInfo.cs):

[https://pastebin.com/2sFcs2Vg](https://pastebin.com/2sFcs2Vg)

&amp;#x200B;

A view (EigenGegevens.cshtml):

[https://pastebin.com/i6JdBvKj](https://pastebin.com/i6JdBvKj)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see the controller has an Edit() function. I linked this Edit() function to the button in the view(even though I'm not sure if it works this way). Now I should make a function but I have no idea where to start. I would love some tips, guidance, whatever information would help me make and understand this.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm not sure if I provided enough information, if so, please ask. I'm also able to work with Teamviewer or share-screen but I don't expect someone to just make it all for me as I won't understand anything that way.

abvvcz,1,2019-01-02,What STEM career allows you to grind for the most lucrative lifestyle?,CoreyMage,Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/abvvcz/what_stem_career_allows_you_to_grind_for_the_most/,"To be brief, i'm a third year engineering student at a top 5 engineering university. I have been able to intern for a few of the largest tech corporations in the US (engineering, math). I also keep my options very open, and could really go into many STEM careers, engineering, finance, software, design, graduate school... etc. But im having trouble narrowing these down.

With this being said, whats a STEM career in which you can really grind to make the most money possible? What industry can you go into where your pay is strongly correlated to the amount of hours, work, and ability you put into your job?"

abwahn,1,2019-01-02,21 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,DirtyKIKRoleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyKIKRoleplay/comments/abwahn/21_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

A few things:

Be literate please! No text talk/bad grammar. I only rp in 3rd so please do 3rd person! I DO NOT TF! I am looking for a tfer, so please be okay doing that. You should also be okay with me playing as original characters. If you are not, this post isn't for you. Be an active rper. I understand life comes up, just please try to reply as much as humanly possible. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM or:

Thank you for reading, and hope to hear from you soon! And happy holidays!"
abwgsv,3,2019-01-02,[REQUEST] Raising money for service dog through etsy store,approachcautiously,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/abwgsv/request_raising_money_for_service_dog_through/,"My etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/shop/CinabunsDogBoutique

I recently learned that the summer I planned to get my next service dog prospect would not work for training a puppy. I'll have to take an internship to get my graduate degree and unfortunately won't have time to raise a puppy like I had planned. Instead of getting the puppy in the sumer of 2020 I'm having to bump it up to the summer of 2019. 

2020 was my initial plan as that year my current sd will turn 7. Meaning she will be 9 once the puppy is able to start taking her job. If I get the dog later I likely won't have time as I'll be starting a new job,  and I risk my current sd wanting to retire before the puppy can be trained. That also means I would not be able to have her help train the puppy which can speed up training tasks as well as allow the new dog to start working before he learns all the tasks she knows as I can work both of them together.

As such, I'm left with very little time to raise money to buy a puppy as well as all the puppy necessities. Instead of just trying to raise money through donations, I'm instead using a shop to save up the needed money. 

This will also allow me to continue making money for things like food after I can afford the puppy and all the beginning supplies. Which will be needed as I'll have to be paying for all expenses for the new dog. Currently, my parents still pay the vet bills for my dog but I can't expect them to do the same if I want a prospect. 

Currently, my shop is mainly over the collar bandannas and bows for dogs. However, I plan to continue adding new things as I'm able to afford the necessary materials and hardware as I already spent all of my Christmas gifts I can afford to use in order to buy materials to start with.  

If you're interested in well made dog accessories or know anyone that would be interested please check out my shop and consider buying something!  Currently I have a little promo where you can get 15% off all bandannas with the code: GRANDDOGOPENING   until the 3rd 

If there's nothing you like up currently, keep in mind I've got fabric to use that's not yet posted so check back in a few days. You can also send me a message if you're interested in helping out but don't like stuff too. I can make more than just what's up currently, and anything I make will be well made as I hold what I make to high standards. If you don't have a dog and just want to donate directly then send a pm. I don't want to plain out ask for money, but since I do legitimately need help with the costs I'm not going to turn down help. 


As a slight aside: I'd like to make it clear that until I get my refund for my student loan, a small amount of the profits will go towards buying food. Because almost all of my money is having to go to paying $300 for medicine since I have to meet my deductible before my insurance pays for it. However, once I get that refund all profits will go back to saving for the prospect or to covering any costs for my current sd if needed. 

Thank you for reading through this giant post! And if you even just check out my shop or just favorite it as every little bit helps and that can help it be seen by more people. 

Also if you're curious why I don't just get a normal job, it's because a part of my disability is severe fatigue and I can barely get all my school work done and study enough for tests. I don't have the energy to work a standard job while full time in school. As well as it being difficult to find a job with a sd in a state that doesn't have great worker protections. Once I have my degree I should be about to get a job and hold it with only a few issues."

abxlco,2,2019-01-02,Has anyone had to deal with nParent after realizing how messed up they are? Any advice?,kbennani,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/abxlco/has_anyone_had_to_deal_with_nparent_after/,"Hello all.

I've \[20f\] joined this sub a few months ago. I told a friend some stories about my nDad, and he immediately realized how wrong everything was. I always knew something wasn't right about my father or the way he treated me, but I didn't know other people went through similar things or that I could get better. In fact, I suffered major depression during my freshman year of college and still struggle with anxiety and PTSD. Now I am still recovering through journaling and diving into hobbies and spending time with friends. Considering therapy but it's very expensive where I live. I'm grateful to have found this page.

&amp;#x200B;

This might be a rant, but I feel like I need to get it out. Background: my mother works until 8pm so I rarely get to see her. My father is unemployed, lazy, and extremely rude. He yells over small things, is delusional, and a control freak (for example, this morning he saw that I was sitting on the ouch with my siblings and while he was making breakfast started talking loudly to himself about how everyone is lazy and the education system teaches children to disobey their parents, blah blah, even though he OFFERED TO COOK BREAKFAST. After we ate his nasty ass food (in silence), I started to clean up. He gets up quickly and goes NO don't clean, I can do it, there's a lot of dishes (there were like 4 plates). While he's doing the dishes, he starts talking to himself again, saying how he has ""no time to do anything"" even though he's UNEMPLOYED and has no friends or hobbies. Literally all he does it watch YouTube videos on conspiracy theories, prays, and looks at antique shit online to buy and sell for his ""business"". So he's bitching and whining by himself while I'm sweeping and my little sister is sitting next to him, and he proceeds to tell her the correct way to do the dishes, ""you need to put some time and effort on the grease, don't be lazy"", implying that \*I\* am lazy. She's 13 and has been doing them since she was 10, as have I. All of this is to prove a point that he's teaching her something valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the main story. Last semester ended Dec 12th. I stayed on campus until the very last day I could, then picked up work as a cashier for a week-long event. I've slept over my friend's place from the 20th up until a few days before new year's. I'd work from 9am-6pm on my feet and then walk around the city until he got home from drinking with his friends just to avoid going home. I started feeling bad for being at his place so often. He's in NY now, which means I have to stay home.  I have to tell my parents that I'm in a ""program"" for students studying in med school because they're against me getting a job and being financially independent. Anyways, on NYE I didn't have work, so I went to the library in the morning to enjoy some coffee and reading (AWAY FROM NDAD). I scrambled to make plans for midnight, afraid that I would have to return home. Luckily, one of my friends happened to be around, so I made plans to meet up with him and his friends later. My mother texts and is like ""WHERE ARE YOU?? COME HOME NOW! HE IS MAD!"". A week prior, I told her I'd be gone that night with friends. I told her I couldn't go home that night and would be home the next morning. Anyways, I had a really enjoyable night and didn't think about my family at all. I spent the night at my friend's place. The next day, I come home around 1pm and no one's there. I take a nap (hungover and sleep deprived) until around 5, and everyone gets home from eating lunch. They didn't invite me, which I thought was strange, but later realized it was because my dad was angry. I go downstairs to greet my mother, and she brings me to her room and starts giving me a speech. ""You have no right to disobey us, he's mad, I told you to come home, you are disrespectful"". All this while my dad is listening. Thing is, she doesn't actually care about where I was -- she just does whatever she can to please nDad. In fact, she pretends to pray while watching a movie and probably still cheats on him (long story, she's been cheating for years, they fought about it, almost divorced, they're still together but he is extremely manipulative and looks through her phone and they still argue about once a month about it). She's only with him because of my younger siblings, once my 13 y/o sister moves out, their relationship won't last. So I told my mom that I had a good night and I am depressed in that house since I have to be home with ndad all day while she's at work, and she fights back with the ""why aren't you just more honest with us"" card. I told her that I've never been able to do ANYTHING since high school (literally never hung out with friends once) and told her to name one friend of mine. She couldn't, because she's not concerned with my life because she's too busy appealing to my  imbecile of a father. And she goes ""whatever, just go apologize to your father, you owe him nothing but respect, that's how Muslims are"" and I told her there is SO much wrong with this, fuck religion and walked out. (If I told my dad this, he'd probably have a stroke. My mom isn't actually religious, but if I said this to my mom with my dad in the room, she'd FAKE being appalled. That's basically my mom in a nutshell). My dad ended up falling asleep. My mom started making dinner, and I sat in the kitchen because God forbid I go upstairs and ""hide"". He wakes up and gives me \*that\* face. Then he goes at it. 3 hours of talking about:

&amp;#x200B;

\- You're a whore, you paint your nails and dye your hair, you're just horny

\- You need to start thinking about marriage

\- You might be going to medical school but you're still a failure when it comes to real life

\- You're supposed to be a good Muslim, I see a very bad path down the road for you

\- I see you reading a thick book about nonsense (it was a book about Economics lol actually pretty interesting) and not reading the Holy book, shame on you (BITCH WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU GOING THROUGH MY BACKPACK???)

\- When you don't have school you wake up at noon here, are you DEPRESSED? That's bad. (1. stop projecting your dissatisfaction with your pathetic life onto your children 2. uh yeah, I am extremely depressed when I'm here because I hate you, can I make it more obvious for you?)

\- You're 20, you're getting OLD, you've lived out 25 percent of your life and completed nothing (LOL you're 55 and bullying your daughter who is a first gen at a top tier uni, get a fucking grip)

\- You're useless, worthless, etc etc 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and ALSO, my other sister is 18 and lives with her boyfriend and their baby. My dad is trying to instill these values in me that he did with my sister, except she didn't like school and was the found out she had a bf, so he physically abused her a lot.  She ended up knocked up and ran away. Soooo back to the story; the whole time hes giving this sermon, I sit there not saying anything, because every time I say something, he twists my words. Ie) ""You need to start thinking about marriage"" me \*cries out of frustration\* ""stop I don't want to hear this"" him: ""what? You don't want to hear this? You can keep crying until tomorrow. You're crying because you know I'm right and you're hurt. I'm telling you the truth, I don't sugarcoat because I CARE ABOUT YOU. Do you want to end up like a loner? That's what you're going to be"" So I stopped talking. He starts talking about God. And the whole time, I'm sitting there thinking, I don't believe in God, you are pathetic, you fat lazy piece of fucking shit, I need to GTFO after college.

&amp;#x200B;

This all happened within the span of NYE and today. I can't spend one day there. I feel bad for talking about this to anyone because I don't want to overwhelm them, and I'm trying to keep all this baggage away from people I just met, specifically the guy I'm seeing right now. A lot of people don't know anything about this fucked up side of my life, and it gets hard to look ""normal"" sometimes, but I am generally happy. I've considered getting an airbnb from now until I go back to school on the 18th. I'd rather save up for after college, though. For the time being, I'll pretty much just be picking up shifts at my old job and applying to internships. Keeping myself busy. I feel so much better writing this out. If anyone has advice about how to cope with this kind of abuse, please lend it. Or kind words. Anything, really. If you read this through, kudos to you. Thank you. "

abxu99,16,2019-01-02,Just want to share my story,greenteaenergy,vaginismus,https://www.reddit.com/r/vaginismus/comments/abxu99/just_want_to_share_my_story/,"Hi everyone &lt;3 I could've definitely used this thread 8 years ago when I was 18 and realized something was wrong with me but I am still glad I found it now.

I realize now that I have anxiety and have had it all my life, and am only now going to therapy regularly. I had a boyfriend in high school for two years and we never had sex. I literally had no desire to do PIV at all and since we were so young it didn't seem that unreasonable but I never really processed it. It was only after we broke up that I was invited to go boating one day and had my period. I tried a tampon for the first time and it got stuck, and I was in the bathroom for like 4+ hours trying to get it out and crying. I told my best friends about it and then went to Planned Parenthood so they could look at me and see if something was wrong. I was deathly afraid to tell my mom because the thing is, my parents are super catholic and sex was NEVER EVER EVER and I mean NEVER talked about which is why I think I was the way I was. So uncomfortable with it. So I didn't want to go to an actual gynecologist and them get a bill for it.

I went to college with this living fear that I'd never have sex. I put so much pressure on myself and had a pretty horrific freshman year of getting really drunk and spilling out all my fears and telling guys about it. It kind of died down a bit when I transferred schools, made new friends and one of them had a similar problem to me, so we talked about it often. I met my current boyfriend right before I was 21. He was so nice and I immediately felt comfortable with him and felt that he'd be the one I'd finally have sex with. After a few times together I confessed my issue because I didn't want him to be shocked. He was OK with it. Then we tried to do it one night because I figured if I felt comfortable and had some wine I'd be fine. Well it wasn't fine. He was still nice and understanding and I'd realized I rushed it. So that summer I went to an OBGYN and she referred me to a specialist in Boston. Big mistake because the urology specialist was an actual douche-bag who didn't even examine me and just told me that the problem was my birth control making me too dry.

I ended up studying abroad for a semester and when I came back school was really stressful. Tension eventually built up in the relationship because we were in college after all, and it also seemed like I wasn't ""doing anything about it"". My boyfriend also took the doctor's theory seriously which was awful. I finally did my own research and bought a set of dilators myself. At this point still, no doctor had really helped me. I tried the dilators for a while but still struggled. It was actually the day after I submitted an application for an internship I'd been working on for MONTHS and was really stressed about that I first had PIV sex! Which tells me that stress and anxiety is indeed the root cause. I pretty much diagnosed myself with vaginismus.

It still wasn't perfect (still isn't - far from it) - and then some girl from high school messaged me on Facebook. She was selling sex toys and was asking if I was interested. At first I was like ""absolutely not"" but she started to explain more. Since her and I used to be friends, I ended up telling her about my issue. She had just had a baby and said the same thing happened to her - sex was painful to impossible after giving birth. Using a vibrator was the only thing that helped her. So what do you know, I bought one. And that helped me SO MUCH. The vibration relaxes all my muscles. So if I plan to have sex, I use it before.

&amp;#x200B;

There's the issue though. We've been together for almost 6 years now and there's a lot of tension around sex. I do avoid it. I wish I could make myself dilate/use the vibrator every night or several times a week but I can't. And knowing I have to use it before is a mood killer because we can never do PIV spontaneously. We do other stuff but not as often as what others might consider healthy. It sucks, because my BF and I have friends we are close to and very open about their sex lives and every time we leave hanging out with him, I can tell how upset he is by the fact that we don't share the same experiences. He does always say he loves me and loves me for me and wants to be with me, but that is definitely a point of stress.

The hospital I used to work out has a pelvic pain program. I made an appointment 6 months ago and am going next week on Monday. I am going to be a pelvic pain WOMAN doctor, then do an exam, and then start pelvic floor physical therapy. I can't believe how many doctors rejected me (my current gyno also doesn't think I have anything and just thinks I am stressed - and said I should take Xanax) and how I did not know about these services sooner. I can't wait and hope it helps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Words of encouragement would be appreciated. Thanks!

I feel like I am not prepared for this internship, I have only taken up to managerial accounting. So I am looking for advice as how to help me get an offer come March. Also I have a few questions to help me get my head around how this will all go down. 

Thanks in advance guys! 

1. How much will they teach me in terms of how to do the job? They are flying me out to LA for orientation and I am not sure what to expect from the experience. 
2. Should I know how to do anything in particular before starting the internship?
3. Most likely what will I be doing? Will I be working on client sites or will I just be getting coffee. 
4. Are there any resources I should be aware of in order to effectively do my job?  
5. What is one thing that you wish you had done while you were in my position? 
6. How do I set myself apart to make sure I get an offer at the end? 

Once again, any advice you can give me would be massively appreciated. 

Thank you guys so much for all your advice. "

My boyfriend works for his brother as a sysadmin for an integrated dialer/CRM . His work day consists of fixing dialers and servers when they crash, and general IT work with those clients. (I'm not too much of a techie so I don't know how to put it) . He gets paid super well too! 3k plus some and since we live with his brother he has a shit ton of liquid income to spend on League and Steam and whatever he wants. 

During the work day I can't really talk to him because he's automatically pissed off at every little thing the clients, his brother and the intern do. He mentioned a couple of times about quitting and it scared me because I don't have the same kind of income he has. I make pennies compared to him. If I could I'd take his job because I grew up on hand-me-downs and dinner-less nights as a kid. Then we go to bed together and he's already pissed off because he thinks about the work he has to wake up to. "

So there I am having performed a nice and successful hyperdrive maneuver and about to head to the nearest space station in search of my much-needed scientist. I activate the pulse drive and can you guess what happened? I'll give you a clue my next words were [RECORD HAS BEEN CENSORED] for you see I am informed by my ship that we are being scanned and that my drive is currently interdicted. Ok, so my options were to afterburn it out of there until pirates give up or fight. BUT the three ships on rapid approach gave me a bit of fright, after all, I have no done space combat in ages. So I 'run' pedal to the metal as the ancients used to call it. Ship's thermals protested, the superstructure screeched as I pushed the engines to give me all they could offer. And after a good while the pursuing marauders broke off their engagement like a pack of wild beasts, preferring to go for an innocent and probably defenseless freighter flotilla that happened to jump in nearby.

After safely making it into the space station I learn that my dear scientist candidate is down on one of the nearby planets. with little joy I make my way to the first one on sight and fly to a trading hub, a dirty and seditious place for most species, it is in good fortune that the Korvax are about as interested in a quick copulation on the public restrooms as the nearby flora are in the intricacies of Vy'keen philosophy. So, I find an eager mathematician hoping to interact with me as it brings him much 'honor' and the pervert talks about scanning me in my sleep. Why don't we have interns? No, seriously I would kill for normal acolytes, you would think the grand library can part with a FEW research assistants. At any rate, the voyage home was not too bad, at least I did not have to stuff the Korvax on my cargo hold. 

Spent the better part of the day adding to the settlement, it is starting to resemble something I once researched, something called a longhouse. I had to cut down a patch of forest to build it, which gave me some carpal tunnel. And I've started to think if it would not be best if I just change to a more metal base for the building. But then again the rustic look is quite pleasing. I do need to start digging around more, see if I find some blueprint for a landing pad, cause making that take-off fuel, its a pain in the rear. I was asked to collect some materials by my newly acquired scientist, which then let me know he was gonna be waiting, cleaning the windows, ALL the windows, with the 'fervor of its core'. So I was glad to be away from that pervert and spent time digging holes, ended up collecting 11 Vortex cubes, (I would like a word with the librarian that named them thus.)

sometime during this fever dream of quasi-archaeology, I come up with a wondrous sight, a[ monolith!](https://i.imgur.com/xupLl7g.jpg) After doing a re-enactment of the archived holodocumentary of Dr. Henry Walton (minus the rolling boulder trap) I activated it and asked for the directions to the nearest [portal](https://i.imgur.com/G9Zbjop.jpg), as per knight protocol I went about the task to find such device, activate it and make sure no snake parasites were nearby, or anyone speaking ancient Egyptian. I obtained the [local address](https://i.imgur.com/tSGVbAe.jpg) included in this here report, so that any knights may locate my base of operations. I will be flying back and leaving a comms buoy after the report with any relevant data I can find. However, to my sadness I can't recall the address of any library world, I think I may have suffered either cognitive damage inhaling the toxic fumes of my original planet, or a severe contusion falling down a hill.

So a short time after having this portal active I received a mission from my resident **pervert** scientist-ish (I really should ask for a certificate of sorts.) In which he needed to go into some sort of trial, and he handed me his core. Then his body went all limp. (I swear, to whichever that scribe has to read this, if this is some weird kink of the Korvax I WILL MURDER HIM) So I took him to his trial, which declared him irreparably contaminated. I've returned the core to the body, but he is catatonic. Do korvax have reset buttons? At any rate, I've taken this brief lull in tasks to write up my report, best of luck librarians.

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

Favorite Celebs: Emma Watson, Emma Roberts, Scarlett Johannson, Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice, Emily VanCamp, Jennifer Lawrence, Alexa Bliss, Becky Lynch, Dakota Kai, Nadine Velasquez

I’m a 2018 graduate with a Bachelor’s in Business Marketing. I have yet to secure a job unfortunately, summing up most of my rejections as “not having enough experience” in the field. 
It seems that when I go through interviews, the employers always like me, and I’ve even made it to the second and third rounds in some interviews, but they always go with the more experienced candidate. It’s the classic “how am I supposed to get experience when no one will give me a chance to?” dilemma.

I did manage to obtain an unpaid internship for a startup in Colorado, I started out doing mostly administrative work, am a part of strategy meetings, and most recently took over their social media, although I’m not sure I am as successful as I should be in this position. 

Any advice out there from people in Marketing? How did you get started? How did you get an employer to take the chance on you?

ac0xlf,9,2019-01-02,I really need some Fi advice (ENTJ-T 3w4),Parang,entj,https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/ac0xlf/i_really_need_some_fi_advice_entjt_3w4/,"Hi, I want to start of it might be a lot of details but please bear with me. I went through a depression since the last quarter of 2017 and the first of 2018. I had personal tragedies and the person I thought I would spend my life with dropped me as a brick without ever calling me out on my shit after I went into a grip period. 

Afterwards I worked the entirety of 2018 working on getting my education back on the rails, getting a nice job in the meanwhile and working on improving my appearance which I neglected and my social life. 

Everything went alright I met a nice girl and I lived as a workaholic. Got back into my school rhythm too. 

My relationship went bad really fast after quiting my job to start an internship to complete my education. After this friends of me also went through troubling times.

I can start my internship this month, I was supposed to start last month but had to get some documents cleared to be able to. 

Anyways I had a really crappy time because of all this around the holidays. I just realised I fixed my problems in an instrumental fashion last year. Like I learned myself most of the tools an ENTJ needs to bounce back from grief through therapy and such. 

I just realised my friends aren’t what they were anymore. I reconnected with some people from years ago and that actually feels really good again. 

The months before I was pretty much only succeeding in goals like school and work but to be honest. I was living like an alcoholic and a drug addict in my free time. Succes is fun but not if I don’t truly feel it. 

After good talks with old steady friends I just realise how much I am seeking approvement in a toxic enviromment and that I’m disintegrating from 3w4 to a 9. 

I want to banish all unnessary pain for my life. I would also like to hear from ENTJ 3w4 how they managed to be true to themselves and set themselves up for life. 

I realise the only thing I’m missing is totally Fi related and all my addictive outbursts were pure unhealthy Se loop behaviour. When I’m om my best I actually act like a healthy ENTJ, but right now I’m afraid I might fall off. 

I hope y’all can give me some perspective or a nudge in the right direction. I googled some earlier posts about ENTJ 3w4 Fi gripping so I’m comfortable my peers would be able to. 

I want to thank you for atleast reading this and answering, feel free to ask questions.

ac1qy8,1,2019-01-02,should I email the hosts of lab research internships I applied to? need advice!,ElephantsRTasty,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/ac1qy8/should_i_email_the_hosts_of_lab_research/,"Kind of bad title, but I will explain. 1st post on this sub but have enjoyed it for awhile.

I am in the process of applying to REUs as well as a few overseas summer research internships for summer 2019. If it's relevant, I am applying to labs/programs focused in molecular and computational biology. I'm a junior in college but have been focusing on molecular biology lab experience in my coursework and want to be a researcher for my career.

Some of the programs I've applied to in the past have said (on their info pages) that you may email the hosts/PIs around the time of your application to tell them you are excited to apply to their lab, etc.

I have already submitted a few applications to overseas programs. I would like to specifically ask about one of my applications but any overall, relevant advice would be greatly appreciated!!!

**Context**: last summer I got reject from everything I applied to, including several overseas programs, several REUs in the US, and a few general internships found through Indeed. It really hurt my self esteem and is making me worried I won't be able to find a job after graduation. Realistically, I probably *at least* didn't have enough relevant coursework, and my GPA was only 3.26. However, my GPA is now over 3.5, I've gotten over 3.80 on the last two semesters, and I have more relevant coursework under my belt (and A's in all of them). So I am feeling better about this year but still *very scared* I won't get into ANYTHING. I really want experience because I barely have any outside of school. :(

**The current situation:** I have already sent in my application to my top choice of program (Okinawa IST research internship in Japan), and the deadline has already passed. On the website they state successful applicants will be notified within 3 months of applying; I applied on Dec. 15th, so almost but not quite 2 months ago. I REALLY want to get into this program. That being said, would it be too late to email the lab PIs I applied to to tell them of my application, express interest in their work, etc? If so, what should I mention in those emails? Would it look bad considering the time elapsed between my application and the email? Do these emails actually help?

**Looking for similar advice:** As for the applications for which the deadlines have NOT already passed, should I email all of the hosts/PIs of labs I apply to to express my admiration and interest in their work, tell them about my application, etc? If so, what should I mention in those emails?

THANK YOU EVERYONE!"

This September, I will have graduated 10 years ago. TEN fucking years ago. I never entered the workforce; I went into a series of horrible grad programs that I was forced into while batshit crazy, unable to do fieldwork or papers, babysat, and then temped, starting three years ago. Make no mistake, I tried as soon as I graduated to get the same temp agencies that found friends perm jobs eventually in 2012-2014 to help me. They all took my resume and that's all that happened.

That's where I am now. I have temped for three years, and it's felt like a decade in terms of pure demoralization, humiliation (I am treated like vermin in offices - it's funny how interns are investments and older temps are like treated like squatters taking a dump) and terror about poverty.

In that three years (longer - ten - none of my job experience matters, but the gap between now and college is more offensive) when I interview for perm jobs, interviewers and even many recruiters hold my resume like it's a piece of human waste when I have to admit that's all my resume is. But that's all I can get. I have to swallow having no skill that makes me worthy of hiring permanently. I have never been trained to do something valued, and well, in a place I can practice and ask questions *and learn it comprehensively*. 

But the worst thing is - I knew at 25, hating my classes, the sheer physical will it takes to be alive, to stay awake, to live for the first 12 hours (at least) of your day devoted to work, and negotiating the maintenance of your miserable meat husk around work (doctor, dentist, and fuck, managing all the pain, the acne, and the perpetual emotional/physical exhaustion - including of just *dealing* with people) - I knew I'd fuck it up. 

Other kids interned and worked and actually proved themselves to authority figures and peers. That's the basis of school, and work.

It all comes to down to this - 32 going on 13, skill-less, with no meaningful or close friendships, and worse, I am so tired and so ashamed of my life - so fucking allergic to life - I cannot sustain *any* relationship, cannot get through a conversation without having to lie, or feeling the effort: I will never be happy in any competitive system where you have to prove your value or ingratiate yourself - because you're pretty, because you're funny, because you're likable. Because you have the energy to keep up and also to be ""interesting"" and happy. I am none of those things. I never have been. What I'm babbling now - this is the real me. All the time, on and off, while moving through life like a zombie or an animal - agitated acting, but not really enjoying being alive, and the constant, desperate desire for quiet and rest. I have no specific health problem to blame it on that anyone would excuse, and my bloodwork is ordinary; it's as simple as that. Squat, upside-conical body with stubby legs and no lung capacity doesn't help though. I would leave my bedroom once a week, at most, if left to my own devices. I find people and being around them exhausting. From the time I wake up to after work and bedtime, my hands, back, shoulders, knees, feet - all hurt. When I have free time, all I want to do is sleep. 

And that's how it's always been. That's as strong as I get. If you feel like shit 24/7, in a 24/7 society - you are bound to be miserable. 

I cannot be happy in any contemporary schema of 21st century life. Not in capitalism, not in a looksist society, not in any scenario where one must compete for others attention, for grades, for jobs, for love. I hate my own physical sensations, my emotions, my memories, my knowledge of evil in the world I cannot stop, my own impotent, torturous fury at it - the fucking foul hateful injustice. My own increasing hatred of this species in all its cruelty, and simultaneously of whatever deity permitted such horrible suffering for living things in this mortal coil. 

 I am a loser in every gauntlet I enter - and you'll enter a handful just getting out of bed in the morning as part of middle class, post-collegiate life.

Perfect example - this good-looking, nerdy, nice kid who came later on this project. He's a good looking 24 year old white kid from the Midwest who codes - that alone impresses people in my company so much. Superiors I've known worked with for months that have never, *ever* made chit chat with me will stand their for fifteen minutes talking to him. The cute douchebag I sat next to for three months who never even said my name allowed is now a work buddy who says good morning, gives him gum - and says his name.

I know how petty this sounds - just watching this perfectly nice kid today...I'm thirty and wanted to bawl my fuckin' eyes out like an 11 year old at my desk over my laptop. 

The great struggle of a human life is wanting and feeling things - a job, friendship, even just the basic camaraderie and goodwill that indicates your boss genuinely likes you as a human being, not just someone costing him money  (I know **so many girls like that**, pretty, giggly, charming girls). 

And if every day is a million little tests to live up to others expectations, to be deemed worthy - I lose.

Every single time - I lose. I am unworthy of everything that has ever mattered to me and required my effort. But nothing makes it so awful as seeing how fucking easy it is for other people. Others are loved, as they are, because they need to be loved. They desire to connect, and those around them receive, extend.

Every person I have ever expressed affection for - it's never mutual or real. I would say that's doubly true in a digital age. **But it is for other people**. There are groups of friends I've been on the periphery of for five to ten years - others paired off, gotten close. People I expressed deep rejection for rejected me and sided with....bullies. Are indifferent to me where they shower others with sympathy.

It took me 25 fucking years to say, without ambiguity - I forgive myself. I did not ask for this life. I did not ask for my laughable, grotesque porcine face. I took a picture with colleagues and one again marveled that my head is like a shelf and Frankenstein had a fucking baby who sprouted long hair. A fucking head like a square jack-o-lantern. I've never even seen another Indian woman with a head shape like mine, and the sad thing is, the poorer or more ""ethnic"" look South Asians have some of the least desired jawlines I've ever seen - big, square, short-chinned...ugly. I'm ugly. I can't actually believe how my face must look to other people. Most will only ever see you in a photo, and mine....I've never met someone with a head as white, short, and flat as mine.

My own emotional landscape has been a living hell since I was 11 and scrawled in my diary about wanting to die because I couldn't take how I looked, because it was either that or the prison of anorexia and exercise bulimia (fuck me - I stunted my growth. Should have waited till puberty was over, FFS). Because I knew I'd never be as pretty as the happy white teenagers in shitty magazines that single-handedly helped launch me into an eating disorder nagging under the surface of chubby self hatred and an overreliance on food for self-comfort, but at that time, feeling what I felt, looking towards adolescence, hoping to be happy (you have to be pretty to be loved or even liked) - I didn't want to be so ugly. 

I am still 11, only on top of watching other women at work, or good-looking people, and how *they're* treated; watching those same groups in my acquaintance circles - I feel like a condemned soul in purgatory, and I've been here forever. There was no possibility of any other outcome for someone like me - no valued skills, ""lazy"", weak in physical, emotional, and mental constitution, unlikable and undesirable in any power gradient- in any society, but particularly capitalism. 


And you know what, ladies? Each year I have lived on this earth, it only gets worse. I can't adequately describe how horrible it is to feel more intensely that are you *more* scared, more paranoid, more ashamed, more aware of your own infantile helplessness, while your teeth are worn down, your hair greys, your skin turns to shit and crepe. To have it happen when you try to find a door and realize - you haven't got the strength. There isn't one.

This life is a horrible maze; I had flashes of knowledge I would never get out of the thicket while living by puberty, watching other girls and realizing how *different* I was from them. Whatever it was women, good students, good employees, and people others want to befriend are supposed to bring to the table - I lack it. Or none of it matters from me. I spoil it all so easily being myself, without saying a word. 

What I find each day I have to pretend and try and fail just to live a life of blessed emptiness as a middle class, self-sustaining single person who can endure life and have health insurance and enjoy some material comforts until my father dies and I can kill myself...I am more afraid, I am more humiliated, I am more alone, and I am more trapped. 

This is what adulthood really is. It's finding life intolerable and knowing that because you are dependent on others and your own devices, you have to deal with it till you die or kill yourself. 

If you relate I'm listening. I know this is crazy. 

Sitting there with all the other temps who get to stay, realizing I have temped for three HORRIBLE years, and am actually farther from being employable than when I began this, and realizing one of my only consistent friendships and connections to other people vaguely like me - with a guy like me, on the surface, thirties, underemployed, and a mean, contemptuous asshole *who has a shitload of friends* that all think he's such a great guy - it all hit me today.

One day this lady calls and requests us to build a PC for her son's birthday, we discuss the budget and I ask if she wants to include a monitor with the purchase, she says that is not needed as she has one to give to her son, fine. So the next day me and a coworker's head over to her house with the PC we built the night before to test it and show her how the games look ext. We get there and she pays, and we ask for her monitor, we plug it in and it doesn't work, we try a few times and tell her that her monitor doesn't work, but it's ok because we have a monitor in our car that we can use to test. We return with the monitor, boot up the computer, install Windows 10 and run some games for her to see. Once we're done we unplug the monitor and she demands we give it to her. She says that since her's doesn't work we have to give ours to her. We explain that that wasn't part of the order, but that we could sell this monitor to her for $250, this is when she goes on a tirade. She starts berating and yelling at us saying that we're trying to scam her and ends up calling my female co-worker a whore. We, for the last time, say no and leave the house with the monitor and the $2000, but this isn't the end. When I return the next day we get a call, it's the lady demanding that we speak to the head of the store, I give the phone to him and he puts it on speaker for us all to hear. The lady begins explaining that we tried to scam her and attempted to steal her things, she said that we threatened to HACK her bank account and steal her money along with a barrage of other false accusations. My boss tells her that she was in the wrong and that we don't owe her anything and he hangs up, but it still doesn't end. 20 minutes later a car pulls into the parking lot, she steps out with her husband, my boss goes to greet her and she immediately starts shouting at him, I and the rest of the workers head over to see what's happening and she points towards me and demands to my boss that I be fired. My boss tells her to stop before he calls the police, her husband seems to become enraged by this, goes over to an aisle and picks up an RTX 2080ti, a $1350 GPU, opens the box, and smashes it on the floor while yelling that we shouldn't talk to his wife like that. One of us call the police and the woman keeps yelling at us. Once an officer show's up we explain the story, and she goes on to tell her that our boss ASSAULTED and HARASSED her, all of us back him up saying he didn't do anything and it seems he believes us. She storms out while the officer catches up and starts talking to her outside. Eventually, she leaves and we assume that's the last of it. My boss is currently trying to get them to pay for the card and I hope she has fun with her broken monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Woman orders PC, we give it to her and she demands a monitor as well, which we refuse. She later calls my boss demanding I be fired before entering the store and having her husband destroy a $1350 GPU, the cops are called and she accuses my boss of assault, she eventually leaves angry without her monitor"

Manga spoilers",pmalls17,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/ac2jie/dissucssion_next_manga_arc_of_my_hero_academia/,"Hey guys i wanted to give you my prediction for what will happen in the next arc of mha. 

The PRISON RAID ARC

The pro hero arc and the internship arc have been leading to this. As weve seen shigaraki has expanded his groups power. In the prohero arc we see that the leaue of villains(lov) can now create extremely powerful nomus, have an ability to remove quirks and have some new members that will likely be explored in the upcoming arc.

Hirokoshi mentioned in an interview that the next arc will be ""crazy"" so we can expect another longer arc similiar to overhaul. I will be disscussing the motivation behind this attack, the major players, the main events and the results. This is all speculation but i will back up my thoughts.

MOTIVATION- as we saw in the manga, kurogiri has been captured by gran torino, on top of that all for one has been locked in prison for a while now. We have yet to get an arc with much major developments to the series since the hideout raid arc. Just like the hideout raid finished off the ""ua beginnings"" saga, i believe that this prison break arc will finish off the ""rise of the villains saga"". 

MAJOR PLAYERS- 

VILLAINS-as far as the villains, you can bet that most of the league will be there along with some new faces. Given that at the end of the pro hero arc we see someone use a telaportation quirk to help dabi, we know that there are new members in the league of villains. At the end of the overhaul arc we got to see a new villain giganto machia. 

HEROES-the heroes are a bit harder to speculate on, however i believe hawks will be involved in this arc some way. Endeavor will pribably show up, as well as Deku and some UA students.

MAIN EVENTS- This is how i see the arc going down. Giganto machia attacks the prison and makes a huge gate way, the league shows up as well as some powerful nomis to rumble with some of the top heroes. My guess is they eont be as steong as high end but still powerful.

The league busts in to free afo and kurogiri as well as some other villains along the way. Somewhere along the way of freeing afo, afo recieves a fatal blow, this leads to afo transferring his quirk all for one onto shigaraki. I believe that shigaraki will somehow recieve another quirck to amplify his current decay quirk to be more long range. Shigaraki then uses his new found power to fight and kill a powerful hero, my guess would be hawks. The league suffers some casualties but the main group escapes with some trouble likely using either kurogiris quirk or this new comes revealed in the prohero arc. 

RESULTS- the league goes from being a nuisance to a true threat to hero society, theres a decent chance all might will die as well but i dont see how yet. Shigaraki now has the quirk afo to boost the power of his league of villains to new heights. The ""Rise of the villains"" saga ends with the villains rising to a new level of power and influence. Also somehow the quirk bullets will be used, not sure how it fits in yet. What do you think of my theory?

ac2q58,3,2019-01-03,"I seem to be battling a continuous state of worry, anxiety, guilt, shame and a lot of other unwanted thoughts and feelings. How do I stop this?",CidAndroid,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ac2q58/i_seem_to_be_battling_a_continuous_state_of_worry/,"I'm on mobile so apologies if the formatting is off.

I've been lurking here for quite some time and based on the remarkable support and responses that I read here I wanted to share my own story. I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

I've had quite a history when it comes to suicidal thoughts. Ever since I was in elementary school I shocked my teacher and my friends by mentioning I wanted to die. I proudly made a wallpaper with paint where r.i.p. was written over my poorly drawn tombstones along with several poorly drawn skulls.  Where this came from I have no idea. But reading this back makes me realise how fucked up I was and how awful this must've been for my parents to discover.

I was generally happy as a kid. A great family that tried their hardest to maintain the relationship between all members. My dad was very strict and often gave me a can of whoop ass whenever I was an annoying brat. Which was quite often. In hindsight I realised that this could have been because I was the the oldest and my dad, who was a stay-at-home-dad who only worked on Thursdays, had to deal a lot with me. My mom worked full time and was only home in the evenings and the weekends.

As I grew older (age 15 till 18-ish) I started to create as much distance between me and my family as possible. Happy family moments when I was forced to go with them to a theme park or out to dinner made me cringe. Happy feelings made cringe and uncomfortable as though I convinced myself that nice times with a loving family is bad. Why? No clue. Every other normal human being realises that once your loving mother or father wants to do something nice specially for YOU, it's nice and should be embraced. In my case I got angry. Not furious but just agitated and I made my parents feel like shit whenever they tried doing something nice for me.

To reiterate, there was no abuse or domestic violence at play that would turn me against my parents. Every since I was a kid up to and including my adolescence stage I've been rejecting love, compassion, and my interest to commit suicide at some point grew.

Needless to say, my parents were extremely worried about me and I've been to three different therapists. Twice when I was 13 (I think) at different therapists and the 3rd time I went by my own admission as I felt something was terribly wrong. I was sad, depressed, and didn't enjoy much in life. The 3rd time was group therapy (sitting in a circle) and at some point I felt that it was time for me to stop.

I finally felt happy!

I entered a new stage in my life where I went to college and met a handful of friends. The benefit of being a smoker I suppose since socialising has been fairly easy. I could even say that with or without cigarette I was quite a social creature. I also didn't think much about death anymore as this was all new for me and I met new friends. I was optimistic.

The problems however began again when me and my new friends started to hang out and smoked way too much weed (I was 17 and this was in the Netherlands) even during classes. The last 3 years out of four were a complete haze and I'm still surprised I managed to graduate.

At the end of the fourth year the panicking started. I got older and the ""adult world"" is very close. And because of all the fucking about and the lessons my parents tried to teach me which I rejected instantaneously I felt extremely unprepared.

After the summer holiday I decided to pursue a business study completely in English as a university which was, in hindsight, almost too difficult for me yet I managed to graduate. These 5 years have been absolutely hell due to the insane study load and my work in the weekend combined with still smoking weed. Less, but still. I lost contact with my previous friends.

The suicidal thoughts came back but I thought by myself ""Cid, you're older now (23) and you know what counts. Graduating and reeling in that piece of paper"". What helped me suppress these thoughts was the 3rd year where I went on my Erasmus exchange to Krakow, Poland with two other Dutch guys. It was fantastic. The university there was much easier, I had more time to relax, and enjoyed the beautiful city each and every day. 

I felt truly happy again. Happier than ever before I daresay.

During this exchange I met a beautiful girl as well. We'll call her T. T and I started dating and had an amazing time during the last 2 months of my Erasmus. She came from Ukraine and moved to Poland and lives there for more than 10 years which gave her the advantage that she spoke 4 languages already and she was studying to learn another language.

After my Erasmus ended and the necessary tears wear shed I went back to NL and we decided to maintain a long distance relationship. Which was tough, but doable and she made me extremely happy. Lucky for me my university made it obligatory to be abroad for at least a full year. Joy!

Half a year Erasmus and half a year at an internship which allowed me to go back to Krakow and see my love. We started to live together and my internship went well. I graduated from uni and the company offered me a job. ""Great!"" I thought since my whole life I've been trying to create a distance between me and my family anyway, moving to a country where I don't (and still don't) speak the language and leaving my whole family behind in NL will not be a problem!

Fast forward into the future (I'm 26 now) - I broke up with T after 3,5 years in which we physically fought, I got locked out by her on multiple occasions because I was home late from a conference and didn't let her know, we literally spit on each other, I've been attacked by her when she was holding scissors leaving [a scar](https://i.imgur.com/LtAzbYA.jpg) on my shoulder, and have been called a fucking idiot for the tiniest things I did wrong. 

I've been an awful human being as well as I got very very drunk one night, came home and was verbally aggressive and punched her in the shoulder. A decision I rightfully regret each and every day probably for the rest of my life. I drank so much simply to escape from the stress she caused me while I had to work 40 hours a week and write my thesis. I paid for everything since she was just a student and she made me feel that it was never enough and she didn't appreciate it.

Aside from these awful events, I want to make it clear that she innately is a wonderful person, who takes the destruction of our climate very close to her heart, loves animals, put new socks on my bed when she found out I had a hole in one of mine, made my birthdays count, takes care of her little brother, and cooked almost every day. The list goes on but you get the gist of it. She was amazing and still is.

The reason why we broke up was of course because of the toxicity in our relationship and the fact I don't want kids in the future and she does. Something I didn't expect to be a problem at the beginning of our relationship but I should've known better. A breakup seemed the best solution and thus it happened.

Guys, what was supposed to be perfect; Being in a country I learned to love, with an amazing girlfriend, having a job that I really like, whilst living in a beautiful apartment and buying our (it was her birthday gift) [adorable parrot](https://i.imgur.com/V0D9y0J.jpg) and re-establishing my relationship with my family backfired like crazy.

I'll sum up my 2018:

* Lost my job as the company went bankrupt
* Lost my girlfriend
* Therefore, I lost the parrot,
* Almost lost the apartment (we were renting)

The situation now is as follows. I've been to the Netherlands to see my family in the last 2 weeks of December and when I got back she went, the same day, to see her family in Finland and I have no idea when she's back. Before I went to NL we managed to put the rent contract on my name but all her stuff is still here. She did say that she's going to move out this month.

As I had to make a choice, go back to the Netherlands where I had nothing anymore - bad relationship with parents, no job, and all my friends have moved on living their own lives in different cities OR stay in Krakow open my own company (which I did) and work together with my now business partner and former manager on a B2B basis. I chose the latter.

Running a business is no small feat which causes stress, money comes in slowly (delayed payments, thank you [clients]) which causes financial stress, I am going to be completely alone which causes loneliness and I don't speak the language (yet), I have only 2 friends who both drink and blaze way too much making me not want to hangout with them too much, my grandma is getting older and I'm afraid she'll pass away soon, I regret all the awful things I did during our relationship which causes guilt, and losing such a wonderful girl despite her wrongdoings (many of them caused by me by driving her nuts by being sad and grumpy the whole time) causes my heart to ache and my will to live to disappear even more.

The combination of all these things makes me want take my own life every single fucking day. And I'm inclined to just find a gun range here and get it done. My life is a fucking mess and I lost everything that made me happy. 

I'm completely lost as to what to do, I don't sleep well AT ALL, and I can't eat. For the last couple of days I've been crying hysterically the moment I'm home when I see the lovable parrot in my apartment who has no idea what's going on. And I'm going to lose the little fella as well as T.

How, please tell me, HOW is living still worth it. I feel like a huge dick  as I'm aware that so many other people have it so much worse. I'm just desperately searching for a reason to continue my life because deep down I know suicide isn't the solution. But for now it seems like it's the only solution.

Sorry for the long post and to all of you who are suffering too, my heart is with you and I hope you'll recover from whatever hell it is you're going through right now.

ac3by3,1,2019-01-03,Education Directive 001#,globustr,ModelSouthernState,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelSouthernState/comments/ac3by3/education_directive_001/,"In an effort to emulate the highly effective educational models in place in Scandinavia it is by my order as Secretary Of Education, Health, Labor, And Human Services that the following changes take place immediately at the start of the next academic term from K-12:

Definitions: Term ""regional"" refers to State of Dixie.

1.) All state funded entities providing education from K-12 are to eliminate standardized testing as a means of measuring learning. In its place students will be granted the autonomy to choose at will between vocational and academic tracks of studies starting from age 7.

2. All schools that receive regional funding will be required to implement this directive in its entirety at the beginning of the next school term or forfeit all funding until implementation is verified by regional officials. 

3. Education in this region shall begin at age 7 while at age 6 shall be optional as a period of preparatory and formulative instruction.

4. The tracks model shall be implemented in an inclusive forward thinking manner with the objective being to enable a student to study those subjects of interest to him or her rather than being subjected to narrow scope of traditional learning.

5. To acommodate the track method students will sign up for classes based on interest and age level the month prior to school starting. Classes will be aimed at the following general areas:

 A) Fine Arts (Foreign languages, arts and crafts, performance arts such as music, theatre, acting, etc)

B) Sciences

C) Engineering &amp; Mathematics

D) Technology &amp; Vocational

6.) Students will be able to change tracks and classes if they wish at end of the third week of classes at the beginning of a term. After the third week changes may only be made in the next term.

7.) Every 3 years students will be given a track examination based off the majority of classes a student has taken. For example if a student by year 3 has taken mostly science and fine arts then the examination will be focused on general knowledge in those areas.

8) The annual every 3 years exam will be administered in each school at the end of the 2nd week of classes. The examination will be 1 hour of oral questions in front of a panel of no less than 3 educators and no more than 6 and also 1 hour timed writing exam in the students track area.

9) Students will no longer be pressured into an all or nothing approach when it comes to the high school experience and transition to university. Students will be consistently exposed to alternatives to university such as trade school and joining the workforce.

7. All high school students will be required to complete school assigned internship placements the first month of the spring term. During this month the internship will be in place of classes.

8. School shall not be compulsory after age 16. Students at age 16 will be given the Gateway Challenge which will show them opportunities in their local area along with corresponding salaries if they discontinue their studies. Likewise the Gateway will also show their university and vocational trajectory if they continue in highschool studies.

9.) All publicly funded universities will be required to alter their admissions requirements to accept the new track format of education. No student that has succesfully completed their track or tracks of study in full shall be denied acceptance into any regional university.

10). At the end of study students will be given one of the following:

A) Partial Completion: Studies concluded at age 16.

B. Completion of a track: Student has completed all core courses in their track of choice

C.) Multiple Completion: Student has completed more than one track.

D.) Mixed Track: Students have  a mixture of more than one tracks assigned courses.

11.) Students will be required to fill their school day during term with track courses. Any gaps left by the student will be filled as follows:

7-13: Extra curriculars at teachers discretion from school projects to skills classes (writing, speaking, math, study skills, etc)

14-16: Community service on school grounds or with parental permission outside the school. Internship placement, supervised school work/ chores.

12.) Student progress shall be marked by age rather than grade number. Classes and tracks will be offered by age starting at 7 and ending at 18.

13.) Schools must submit reports of directive implementation by end of first term in which directive is in effect. The region shall assign a compliance officer from the regional office to each sub regional disttict. All schools in the region will be grouped together into sub regions for compliance efforts."

&amp;#x200B;

First a little background. I played since beta. Im a lurker on the forums and a ""silent"" player. Plaing like 2 months of every league and tbh i love it. I love POE. Its the best game ever made in my opinion by the best company simply cuz they listen to the community. That beeing said i have a few issues and thats the reason im making this post. Our little crew 3-8 players depending on time and such only playing hardcore (temp leagues). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is. The game is getting more and more painful for us casual/normal players who prefer hardcore and cant play standard. For us its hardcore or nothing. Most streamers moving to Softcore, since the game is getting more and more broken on hardcore. In 4.0 you (im looking at you Chris) really have to decide on two important things.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do we want our game to be Hardcore viable or to we remove hardcore?
   1. Atm all balancing are made around 1 shot mechanics, lately with the syndicate but also all other hard encounters. You give them a phase and a oneshot ability. This is pure crap for hardcore.
2. Do we want our game to be Party friendly or do we remove party play.
   1. The game ""lags"" due to mass spells, mtx, ability spam. Its basically not fun playing together atm in POE.
3. Could we consider different settings/challenges and so on for Hardcore league?
   1. I personally dont think this is a good idea but something to consider anyhow.

I still love POE - i will keep buying supporter packs, mtx and play the game. I only wish the game would become even better. We often joke that if Chris was playing Hardcore he would call some developer in the middle of the night and tell them to instant fix some of the issues cus its simply annoying. We also joke that GGG have a intern they put on some tasks's and he/she's a evil person who makes sick stuff like making syndicate spawn on breaches, abysses and such. The intern is basically responsible for all bad things :)

&amp;#x200B;

Please Chris, and top influencer Bex:

MAKE POE EVEN BETTER AND DONT IGNORE/FORGET THE HARDCORE PLAYER BASE"
ac3zd8,3,2019-01-03,A (so far) Unrequited Love Story,svenskirish_marx,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ac3zd8/a_so_far_unrequited_love_story/,"Wow this turned into quite the long post. I'm not going to do a TL;DR just cause I don't think it suits the purpose of my post. There's no real question to be answered here; it's more of a reflection and maybe confession than seeking advice but thoughts are certainly appreciated.

-------------------------

Hey y'all. It's me (27M). The girl in question (26F) is in my group of friends from college. I've thought she's adorable forever but realized about a year and a half ago that I had a little crush on her. She's barely 5ft (if that) brown hair, minimal makeup and doesn't need it. But a tiny little wing eye mascara like she's had on occasionally lately...ugh, sign me up.

I'll be clear.....this is the kind of girl who I have a crush on because she's adorable but mostly because I just love her as a human being. She's such a wonderful person to be around, so giving and kind. And real. I didn't realize my crush on her at first because the crush was like ""I very specifically have not had particularly dirty thoughts about you...I just have daydreams about cuddling and exploring and talking about life, cooking and just generally sharing a life and space and time together."" That's the kind of crush this is. (It certainly doesn't hurt that she's beautiful, and my favorite kinds of curvy). I fantasize about having little kiddos running around in our image, sharing our collective perspective and appetite for the wonderful in life. I'm getting old, I guess.

It got to the point about 6 months in that I wanted to say something to her, make a move, something, but I didn't for a long time. I was in graduate studies, with a substantial internship plus bartending a couple nights a week, while she was also in graduate studies with an internship and multiple jobs. #lazymillenials. After we finished school in May, we went and grabbed some food together, the first we've ever hung out just the two of us, but I was getting ready for a long haul trip (July to end of September) and she was going on a similar trip (from early September to end of November, of course). That and the whole ""part of my best friend group from college"" bit really made it hard to make a move without being really confident about it.

Anyways, towards the end of my trip I still had her on my mind, stronger than ever before. I'd met other girls, people I actually liked quite a lot. But the truth was that it only clarified my feelings for her and made me realized why I think she's the best thing since sliced bread.

We stayed in touch most days via Facebook messenger the whole time I was in Europe and she was back in the States, and that continued when she went to Europe and I was resettling back at home.

A couple weeks after she got back, over Thanksgiving, we made plans to go grab some beers and a bite to talk about our trips the next week. This was very intentional in my part from the beginning....I planned to say something to her about my feelings. When she walked in, it was just so good to see her... And I was very sure saying something now was the right call.

One of the first conversations we had when we sat down was about a guy she had been seeing before her trip who had met up with her and a couple other friends in Prague. She said he had gotten kind of distant or weird (something like that) leading up to her departure for the trip, and he basically ignored her the one night they had together in Prague, talking to other girls at the club they went to together.

She said he had seen him since she got back but was being met with some resistance and had decided she wouldn't ""put energy into pursuing people who aren't showing that same level of interest in me.""

I held my tongue through all of this. The topic of relationships and what she wants and expects came up again later about an hour later for some reason and I held my tongue again.

The third time the topic came up, I just went for it. I said it was funny that she's specifically making that shift towards people who show interest in her as much as she does in them.... And then told her I think she's dope, and I've thought that for a long time. I shared how much I enjoy being in her presence and talking with her. I told her how it's been a year and a half since I realized that I think she's amazing in ways that transcend friendship and that I believe there is more here and potential for something greater. I said I wanted to spend more time together to explore that and see if that connection is as I suspect it is.

She expressed ""surprise"" at my sharing this, saying ""I've never thought about you in that way."" We were a little drunk at this point, and she had some questions about how long I'd felt that way, and why I'd never said or done anything sooner, but she basically left things solidly at friends. She said she considers me a close friend but just had never considered anything more. I was a little surprised myself at her calling me a close friend, given that we haven't hung out just the two of us more than twice, including this night).

She was apologizing for not having more to say and I just told her it's fine, I wasn't expecting her to immediately reciprocate my well-thought-out feelings for her. I'd hoped for more of a response of course, but I didn't have expectations of her responding to my confession of feelings with an ""I love you"", and told her so. She thanked me repeatedly for being so honest and forthcoming with my feelings and that she found it refreshing but again, didn't reciprocate those feelings. Basically, I was sure I wasn't going to have any opportunity to explore this further and hopefully we could just remain friends.

I've only mildly been in touch with her following our ""date"", if you'll indulge me. She had mentioned during the ""date"" (and at the end, after I shared my feelings) about coming to visit me at the cocktail bar I work at for some drinks at some point, because she's never visited me at work and seen what I do.

I cold texted her one slow night at work a couple weeks later telling her I was at the bar almost every night before I was going to head home for the holidays so if she wanted to come in at some point she could almost certainly count on me being there. She ended up making plans to come in with her roommate (we've weirdly worked in a couple of the same places but never at the same time....I consider him an acquaintance now through our mutual connections and time spent over a couple beers).

They came in a little tipsy from the first place they went to, and she gave me a BIG hug. She was looking for my eyes during the whole of the 2 hours they were there. We were super slammed for a Tuesday so they sat away from the bar but she could watch me make drinks for the tables from where she was. When I had a minute to come by, she was touchy feely, not out of character for her so I just made note of it and moved on. But then flirted with me, asking if we needed a barback to help out with some glassware or something and I flirted back, teasing her and inviting her, then telling her not to dare come back behind the bar, just playing the game. She was pretty drunk when she left but she emphasized it was good to see me and gave me another big hug (there were few of those that night. A lot of prolonged hugs and touching my forearms when we talked).

Fast forward to after Christmas: my friend group has our annual Yankee swap, the night before NYE. We ended up sitting next to each other much of the time, and she laughed at all my jokes even though she didn't have a drop to drink that night. We chatted and just generally enjoyed each other's company. Later on she said her and another girl at the party had NYE plans with a friend from our group who I haven't seen for years since she moved to the West coast for grad school, but that she wanted to try to get back into the part of town where I work (and she lives) on the earlier side so they could get home easily after midnight.

I was surprised by her plans as she described them, but again didn't get my hopes up too high that they would come in. I was feeling pretty sure they wouldn't come, and then they texted me and showed up, ended up spending the whole of their NYE festivities with me in my (somewhat thankfully) slow bar.

They showed up dressed to the nines, especially the girl I have a crush on, in a top that's sheer over most of her chest, showing her breasts more than I've ever seen them in our 7 years of knowing each other. And I started to wonder if that was on purpose, since they only left the house to come see me.....

We talked, the four of us, about what we're thankful for from 2018, what we're leaving behind in 2019 and our intentions for the new year, all that jazz. We did a couple shots, drank Blanc de Blancs, and when we got the opportunity to close our downstairs bar a little early, had a couple beers and danced to the DJ at our sister bar upstairs until close.

Spending so much time with this girl had my emotions swirling, and there was a lot of physical contact.... More big, intimate hugs and prolonged eye contact, laughter. I started talking with my friend (the one I haven't seen in years) about my feelings and how they were swirling at that moment.... that I just felt like she was trying to send me a message or something (I wanted to make a move, but didn't tell her that). This girl hadn't yet been clued in (which I thought was kind of weird), but when I did the same with my other friend who I see more often later when we grabbed food she basically said ""I just don't want you to get your hopes up.""

So I'm happy now not saying or doing anything tonight, partly based on that response. I kinda needed to hear that at that moment so I could stop thinking about it. This girl (the one I like) had invited me to join all of them to grab a little food then back to their house for a little early morning pajama dance party before bed and offered I could crash on their couch. I said yes initially, but later changed my mind and just went home (I knew the couch actually meant the couch).

So now I'm in this weird spot where all I want to do is shout about how much I like this girl and yet if I want it to happen I have to keep my mouth shut, be confident and cool, right? So that's what I'm posting here for...this is my space to vent.

I've already talked with a couple friends about all this who aren't such close friends with her and I'm getting that positive support to be boundaried while also acknowledging that something is going on here, on her side of things. My co-workers have been particularly supportive and great in giving a very objective perspective on things since they don't know her personally. I don't know yet whether she's thinking about how she feels about me or if she's just sucking up my positive attention and gaze because I've said how I feel, but either way something is up. She's not the kind of person to INTENTIONALLY take advantage of my feelings to boost herself up and bathe in my intention for her own gain, but I do think there is (at a minimum) some of that going on, on an unconscious level. I find myself being hopeful for more right now but as I said, it's kind of a lonely hoping because it's not really a dialogue at this point. The ball is in her court, which is both liberating and agonizing. I don't have anything more to say to her, as I covered my feelings exactly as I wanted to in the first go around, and I'm not going to repeat myself. There's no need. But if she keeps coming around the bar, or being in touch and trying to find me here and there, I may be put in a position where I have to ask what's going on in order to preserve myself and guard my heart a little bit. Or maybe to push things forward and get her feelings out there, if that's what's actually going on.

Anyways, thanks for reading along. If you made it this far, I'm sorry but I really appreciate you taking the time."
ac40c8,6,2019-01-03,Help,10points4gryffinddor,JordanPeterson,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/ac40c8/help/,"Hello Mr. Peterson, 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly I would like to thank you for providing and doing all that you do to the world. I pray to Allah that you are well and that your family is well. 

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Ahmed.. I'm 22 years old.. living in Egypt and I am a muslim. I've always been spoonfed everything my whole life.. from birth all the way until I was 17.. Despite holding ""high"" standards for myself and always trying to do the responsible thing.. I feel as though I'm not unleashing my true potential. From 17 to 21 I traveled to USA where I pursued a degree in Engineering that I could really care less about. I've suffered from depression for 2 of the 4 years that I've been there, mainly because I was refusing to take responsibility of my life. When I finally assumed responsibility.. albeit being a little tough.. it was so worth it.. and very satisfying. After getting my degree I decided that I would want to go back to Egypt.. not sure why. but I felt that there was a calling for me there and that my time in the USA was done.. for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem starts.. mainly when I start living with my parents again.. too much comfort .. and very little motive to go out into the world and do things.. because essentially.. they'll provide everything. My father will provide me with a house and even a constant stream of income for the rest of my life that he has worked very hard throughout his life to provide..my dad had a very opposite childhood and growing up experience than mine. I was spoon fed everything.. he was not.. he had no choice but get out and make a life for himself.. I doo have a choice. Anyway, he has provided me that house and the constant stream of income that would essentially ensure that I would not need to work a day until im 30-35. Perhaps when I start having kids. 

 

I desperately want to leave.. but it is highly disrespectful in our culture and downright just wrong in my religion to leave your parents especially when they have essentially done ""nothing"" to wrong. But I want to be on my own.. I want to experience what it would be like to be independant.. I want to be autonomous!! I don't think they understand how destructive all this comfort is !! I hate the fact that I have to wait for them to give me money every single month.. I feel like a little kid. I feel like i need to bring out my 'survival' instincts for me to really unleash my true potential. My motive would be to survive! What greater motive is there? I would sweep floors, serve food, work overnight.. I know I have it in me to do all these things. Butt.. I have no real motive. Please help me, im really stuck here.. and btw it's not like I haven't been doing anything since I've been back home.. I've completed 2 internships and im on my way to my 3rd.. I just feel so ""bleeeh"" all the time. Mainly because I'm not assuming responsibility of my life.. and mainly because I feel like they control my life too much.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have read this thank you very much. I have no idea if you'll read this or not but I have a sliver of hope that you will do.. inshaAllah. God bless you.

ac4prw,4,2019-01-03,My Resolution This Year,IHeardYouLikeNutella,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ac4prw/my_resolution_this_year/,"I'm almost 19. Everything my mom has done is for my own well-being. Everyday she comes tired from work, then cooks food. What extra time she has left at the end of the day is spent watching TV alone, while I am in my room on the computer browsing Reddit or making music. Is the time I spend on whatever task I'm doing worth it to not spend time with her? No, because I will probably have a computer until the day I die though the time I spend with her is limited. My grades have always been mediocre. It's my first year in college and although it has improved this semester, it's still not what I would want her to see. She always asks how I am doing in school. Why should I be nervous to show her my school grades? Is spending more time studying worth it to see a smile on her face? Absolutely. It should be better so that I can impress her. Though, even her being impressed is a disguise of her own desire to see me become successful so that I won't struggle like her to provide. She wanted a better life for me so she left her loved ones and moved to America 14 years ago. She learned a new language, met new people she calls friends, and still works to provide for her family.

&amp;#x200B;

As I grow older, so does she and she will pass one day. I will not get to see her and all that comes with her. I should strive to please her. She always wanted what was best for me, so my resolution for this year is to work on myself. Career, body, relationships are all areas I want to improve on.

&amp;#x200B;

Grades:

I will prioritize grades. Gym and workouts can come after.

I will use the Pomodoro technique to stay focused and minimize burnout.

I will try to find an internship for my major and will take loans for school if necessary to avoid working.

&amp;#x200B;

Body:

I will stick to working out at least 4 days a week 30 minutes minimum. That's only 2 hours a week, it's doable.

I will start running for 10 minutes and progressively improve.

&amp;#x200B;

Relationships:

I will spend more time with loved ones.

I will help out around the house. Vacuuming, cleaning my room, and any areas that can be improved.

I will take more pictures so I can capture moments of my life that I can look at when I'm older.

I will massage her when her body is in pain from work.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom, I love you and I want to do better. I say ""I love you"" but I don't show it enough in action and actions means more than words so I will utilize my time instead of wasting so much."
ac4x40,0,2019-01-03,"Now that we are a part of The Authority, how would you book NXT Invasion angle, beginning from Royal Rumble leading to Wrestlemania?",St_Shadoe,SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/ac4x40/now_that_we_are_a_part_of_the_authority_how_would/,"For me, I would begin with something like this scenario:

&amp;#x200B;

It's the second hour of Raw after Rumble and we are going to see a 6-women tag match between Ronda Rousey, Bayley &amp; Sasha Banks going up against the Riott Squad. Cut to the backstage area, lead by Tomasso Ciampa, Johnny Gargano &amp; The Undisputed Era are terrorizing the entire locker room, referees, securities, intern guy, everyone is beaten up. Cut back to the ring, we see Riott Squad is being ambushed by Shayna Baszler, Jessamyn Duke &amp; Marina Shafir while Ronda, Bayley &amp; Sasha is preoccupied with what is happening backstage on the titantron. Bayley &amp; Sasha quickly try to take out Shayna and the gang but to their surprise, Ronda turn her back on them and join Shayna's side. Together Ronda, Shayna, Jessamyn &amp; Marina continue to beat the hell out of every women in the ring and those who came from the back to help.

&amp;#x200B;

With this, we have established a heel NXT faction with

* Tomasso Ciampa (Co-leader)
* Johnny Badass (Co-leader)
* Adam Cole (leader of sub-faction TUE)
* Bobby Fish (TUE)
* Kyle O'Reilly (TUE, tag team with Roddy)
* Roderick Strong (TUE, tag team with KOR)
* Shayna Baszler (leader of sub-faction 4-HW)
* Ronda Rousey (4-HW)
* Jessamyn Duke (4-HW, tag team with Marina)
* Marina Shafir (4-HW, tag team with Jess)

On that same week's SmackDown, this faction hijacked the show and interfering in almost every match. On the next week Raw too while having some promo like ""They are taking over WWE"" or something to that effect. On the following SmackDown, AJ Styles came out to the ring and say that he can't let this to continue, especially in the house that he built. So, for countermeasure to the NXT faction, he is forming a faction of his own. Of course the Good Brothers are on his side, and he need some hands on Raw too, which makes Finn Balor the second-in-command. To go up against the ever-crafty Adam Cole, Styles recruits The Architect as well. Naturally, Sasha and Bayley join in too. Styles manage to persuade Charlotte to join due to their history in Mixed Match Challenge while Becky just join in to kick Ronnie's lass. Styles also took Mustafa Ali under his wings because he see his younger self in Ali.

&amp;#x200B;

So, face WWE faction established:

* AJ Styles (leader)
* Finn Balor (2nd in command, leader of sub-faction Balor Club)
* Luke Gallows (Balor Club, tag team with Anderson)
* Karl Anderson (Balor Club, tag team with Big LG)
* Mustafa Ali (AJ Styles protege)
* Seth Rollins (Stategist)
* Becky Lynch (Balor Club, respect no one but Finn)
* Charlotte Flair (Mad queen, dangerous)
* Bayley (Balor Club, tag team with Sasha)
* Sasha Banks (Balor Club, tag team with Bayley)

And then, there is a neutral or slightly heelish WWE faction, with their motive mainly to create chaos:

* Shinsuke Nakamura (leader)
* Eric Young (leader of sub-faction SAnitY)
* Nikki Cross (SAnitY, crazy, do whatever she likes)
* Alexander Wolfe (SAnitY, tag team with Dain)
* Killian Dain (SAnitY, tag team with Wolfe)
* Ruby Riott (leader of sub-faction Riott Squad)
* Liv Morgan (Riott Squad, tag team with Sarah)
* Sarah Logan (Riott Squad, tag team with Liv)
* Asuka (The Empress, destroys anybody in her path)
* Aleister Black (Mythical overlord, descend to absolves anybody's sin he see fits)

With all of that in place, the current rivalry can still be continued with no or only slight changes, but everything become infinitely more interesting. What do you guys think?"

Also in my country,girls aren't really appreciated in STEM fields and the society is really anti-female(most girl's degrees are considered to be a marriage qualification) so I really do want to succeed and provide inspiration to other girls in my country who are afraid to take up STEM  fields.

I am wondering if you could give me some advice. 
I want to pursue an international Fintech career. Currently I live in Amsterdam (im Dutch), and I have a BSc degree in Finance. I just turned 25 and previously been working in a family global trading company, but I decided to go in my own direction. For which I find Fintech most interesting (and good to start in a growing industry). 

Since 1,5 years I have been very active in the cryptocurrency industry. I know a lot of crypto projects and the overall market very well.
Now I’m doing an internship for a startup that uses blockchain technology to tokenize assets. I learned a lot about regulation, privacy laws (GDPR) and KYC/AML here aswell. 

Furthermore have I been an active member of a blockchain event and visited many blockchain events worldwide.  Also I have completed an online certificate about blockchain technology and I continue to update my knowledge with the latest news. Security tokens, atomic swaps and the lightning network interest me the most. Especially applications of blockchain within supply chain, loans and real estate. 

One FinTech app I used a lot is Revolut. I applied for Revolut, but got rejected. My motivation letter was very good, but I don’t really got much big company experience yet. And ofcourse Revolut has a lot of candidates to choose from. 

If someone knows a job or internship that you recommend or where you could introduce me, would be very much appreciated. I am willing to move pretty much anywhere in the world, I am really extrovert and adventurous. However I would prefer London or the US, where I think currently are the most opportunities within FinTech. As an EU citizen I can start working in EU countries without a visa. 

Also Imperial Business College London starts with their first Financial Technology MSc in september 2019, will this improve my chances within the industry you think? 

What I can offer: 

- Finance (good strategic and analytical view on financial reports) 
- Business Development (Sales is definitely my strongest skill) 
- English (fluent), Dutch (native), Spanish (B1 and want to become fluent in 2-3 years)
- Experience with doing business internationally 
- Start-up experience as well
- Willing to make 60 hour work weeks if necessary 
- Up to date knowledge of the blockchain market 


Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

First I'll let you know a bit of background for the story. I am a 23 years old student from the Netherlands and I've been doing an internship in Madrid for 2 motnhs now. My internship will end in 1 month and I have to go back to the netherlands to finish my bachelors degree (finish in june). I have been in 1 previous longer relationship, but have dated a lot before that. My last relationship lasted three years and ended almost 4 moths ago. We ended the relationship mutually and I had already doubts about it long before that, but talked about it with my ex and tried to resolve it for half a year which in the end didn't work out. After the end of our relationship I moved to Madrid for my internship. This is also why we got over eachother pretty quickly.

After 1 and a half month I met a really nice girl and even though I had been single for a short while things moved pretty fast. Not only because we're both abroad (which in my opinion makes things go faster), but also because we hit it off really well together. After a couple weeks of dating we decided to go into a relationship even though we both knew I had to move back home after a while. But we both decided that it was worth it for the time being and we would see what to do when the time comes. 

Now after being in a relationship with her for a month I am completely and utterly in love with her. I want to be with her for as long as possible. But I don't know what to do if i'm moving back home. I have never been in a long distance relationship.

She is working in Madrid at the moment but is from Ireland and doesn't know yet what she's gonna do after the summer. She did tell me however before we started dating that she was planning to do some traveling after the summer. I want to do a masters after the summer but don't know where yet. 

Please let me know what the best thing to do is. Is our relationship to short to commit to a long distance? And also do you guys think I moved to fast into a new relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Me and new girlfriend have been going out for a bit more then 1 month, but I'm moving back to home country soon."

1. First, this idea works on paper and matches the time I currently use for chores and sleep, but it would be a 70 hour work week for 9  years, and I don't know if I can handle it. The best thing that I can do  is try.
2. Second,  the 8 books comprise about 4000 readable pages. I have a maximum of 5215 hours to study over five years if I only work 40 hours a week, don't take breaks, study during PTO, and don't study during my commute. However, I realistically  will only have 40 minutes average per page to fully comprehend  the  material and solve a significant amount of problems. I do not know if  that is enough time. I can probably alleviate some of this by  creatively using my academic paper time, and maybe skipping all or parts of book.

What is your opinion on this schedule and these two complications? Am I over planning my goals? How do you think I should approach this?"

What do I do?",AvaVer2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ac8f28/my_exboyfriend_24_m_broke_up_with_me_22_f_two/,"We were together for almost 3 years, being best friends for 2 years perviously and worked together on a project for about 6 months. I was one of the team leaders. Since I was also studying and doing other extra curricula at the same time, I got pretty stressed and felt that every person relevant in my life was annoyed and critisizing me (I really had problems with organizing myself and was diagnosed with a burn out). I admit that I got depressed, feelings of being a victim rather than a pro-active person and just kept on complaining all the time. Combined with us not meeting outside of the project anymore, I believe this led to my boyfriend getting more and more distant, avoiding me and catching up to other people on the team who had their shit together over the last couple of weeks of the project. Although he increasingly critisized me in front of the whole group he, somehow still to my shock, broke up with me at the climax of the project. He wanted to stay friends with me and then went to an internship in another country. I had to break up the contact as I wasn't able to process all of this so quick. This was 2 months ago.

Since then I did a lot of carreer unrelated stuff like workout, christmas, new years eve, getting back to hobbies, meeting with friends, working on a positive attitude and talking to two therapists (it's hard to get appointments here)...but I'm still at a bad place, since I feel like I can't focus on anything anymore, learn for my studies and I have problems of getting back to my old productive, ambitious and creative form. I used to want to change the world and I feel like I lost my drive to do that now. And I feel bad for having lost it, because successfull people deal better and more effcient with it, don't they? I used to juggle multiple things before lunch and now I don't even get an email written in one day. I am deeply embarassed since I had pretty much a nervous break down in front of the whole project group and now the people, who are the new best friends of my ex took the lead. I isolated myself, and feel like a complete failure, while he is thriving, happier then I've seen him in months and taking off in his carreer.

I'm sad rn but he will come back in a couple of days and I will have to see him everyday in my workplace, although I still have feelings for him and want to get back together with him. At the same time I'm dreadful of him treating me like he did before the break up, like a labile psycho or a child and not like someone on his level. Which is one of the things he told me too; that I didn't act like on his level and he wants someone who can. I am afraid to appear needy and as worthless as I feel. What can I do? How should I treat him and the situation?

**TL;DR:** Ex-Boyfriend comes back to my work-place after 2 months of no contact and I'm still not at a point, where I can face him, having not yet regained my sense of self worth and still not being able to get my life together. What kind of attitude or actions do I need to avoid him treating me like a labile freak and hitting me with his negative assumptions about me that he gained over the last weeks before break up? How to talk to him and get control over the situation, without distancing him even further?

ac94e4,3,2019-01-03,"Shopping for replacement heat pump/AHU, what to ask/look for? Any advice appreciated (Tampa Bay, FL)",FapDonkey,HVAC,https://www.reddit.com/r/HVAC/comments/ac94e4/shopping_for_replacement_heat_pumpahu_what_to/,"So for some brief background. I've got a masters in Mech. Eng. and took a semester of HVAC elective coursework. I worked briefly at a mechanical contractor as an intern, and have worked for past 7 years running a test lab with a lot of thermal chambers (using compression refrig. systems). So I'm more familiar than the average person with the science/concepts involved, but am by NO means an HVAC guy (never worked in residential HVAC, and not very familiar with the particulars of that field).

&amp;#x200B;

My house is in the Tampa Bay, FL area (climate zone 2A), a few blocks from the water. So, summer in the 90+ F, 80+% RH, 'winter' approx 50+ F, 60+% RH. House is \~1600 sq/ft, concrete block on slab construction (built in 1957) with newer double pane windows installed maybe 10-15 years ago. Has 3 large oak trees in yard so probably 30-50% shaded. I purchased the house \~2 years ago and have had nothing but problems with the AC system (an \~15+ yr old carrier 3-ton unit). Had to replace electrical cut-out, 2 caps, top off refrigerant twice, replace 2 different boards in the AHU control system, etc etc etc. And on top of that even when working at its best, performance an efficiency were just meh. So finally decided to pull the trigger and replace the whole shebang.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in process of getting quotes from about 5 different local shops that came recommended to me from friends/family. What I am hoping for is some guidance from the experts (ie y'all) on how to shop for a system like this. I'm a first time homeowner and have never dealt with AC shops before, much less purchased a whole new system. I've got a few specific questions listed below, but am very much open to any other advice, tips/tricks, or insight y'all can provide on the process, the equipment, the contractors, anything really. Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Unit sizing: Current unit is a 3-ton. Its hard to tell if it was sized correctly, as I've only ever seen it run when it was an old worn-out unit. I did a kind of ballpark Manual J (using [coolcalc.com](https://coolcalc.com)) and came up with a hair under 2 tons. But i haven't done a manual J since school 10 years ago, and in a lot of the fields i made assumptions/guesses, so I could be way off. That being said, thats still quite a range of sizes (2 vs 3 ton, a 50% increase), do either of those numbers sound more 'reasonable' for the house and climate I've described? Or are there too many variables to say? I understand the implications of an oversized unit and would really like to avoid it. I typically only keep the house at 78-80\*F in the summer, and living in coastal florida keeping humidity low inside is more of a priority. All of which kinda tilts me towards a smaller unit, I'd think. Any thoughts appreciated

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Unit efficiency/SEER rating: My local power utility offers incentives for replacing older heat pumps with newer more efficient systems. I get a $200 rebate on &gt;15 SEER and $600 on &gt;17 SEER. Is there a ""sweet spot"" as far as SEER, above which you start seeing diminishing returns?  And whats the balance between electricity savings, and additional maintenance costs (more complicated systems with variable speed fans, multistage compressors, etc etc)? Again, this may just be more opinion than anything else, or maybe there are too many variables. But any thought you guys might have on what SEER rating is 'worth it' is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Choosing a shop/contractor: Looking for any advice on picking a final quote to go with.  Obviously price is a concern, but its not the only one. One thing I've heard from facilities guys at work or other friends who work in HVAC, is that these days the quality differences between brands aren't as major as they used to be, and that you're really buying the installation/service. Basically a well-installed system with a 10-yr labor warranty with an established shop would be better than a poorly-installed system with a 1-yr labor warranty from a company with a bad attitude, even if the first option cost more up front and/or used a ""cheaper"" brand. do you agree? Disagree? Below are some questions I'll be asking the guys as they come out to take a look, what do you think? anything else I should be asking?

&amp;#x200B;

\- How long have you been in business?

\- How did/will you calculate heating and cooling load?

\- Do you have any pictures of previous installations or work you've done?

\- Will you be using the existing line set or replacing with a new one?

\- What is your labor warranty? 

\- Are any follow-up service calls included with installation (to deal with inevitable minor installation issues)?

\- What are the specific model #s of the equipment you've quoted?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the longer post, just trying to gather as much info as I can so I can make a good decision. I'm planning on being in this house for awhile, and want to make sure the system I get is the right one for me. Any info or advice you can provide to help me with that is very much appreciated!

ac9apz,12,2019-01-03,"I keep failing at finding a real career, and I'm very depressed about it.",thebiggestfan777,Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/ac9apz/i_keep_failing_at_finding_a_real_career_and_im/,"Hello everyone,  


Sorry for the novel, but I'm posting here on Reddit because I don't know who to talk to anymore. I (31, M) have been trying since I was 18 to find something that's ""right for me."" I've done a number of things, some of which seem like a good career-beginning on their own, but I just keep failing and landing back at square one. To warn you, this is going to be a pretty long post since this stuff has been pent up inside me for a while now. I'll try to make it interesting, though, and I really want to hear from people, so if you think you might have something valuable to say, by all means read the whole thing (or just the TL;DR) and let me know what you think! 

I graduated from college in 2010 with a business degree, and immediately afterwards was given the opportunity to do an internship in China. I couldn't imagine anything more exciting, so of course I took it. Living in China wound up being an amazing experience, but ultimately that internship did absolutely nothing for my career. It essentially turned out that this small company just wanted a white person to sit around in their office, so I made what I consider critical mistake #1 in my career-seeking life. The internship expired after 6 months, and instead of trying to leverage it into something else, I stayed for another year and a half in China teaching ESL. After that, I came back to the US and worked a sales job for a short time (selling construction equipment), then took a job as a processor at a large financial company. This is where I took probably the first major hit to my self-confidence and drive.

 I was TERRIBLE at that job, which was incredibly disappointing and confusing to me on account of the fact that I had always been A.) hard-working, and B.) fairly smart. Any class I took in college, I was always at the top. Creative stuff, sciences, language, you name it. If I put my full effort into it, which I did, I would be one of the top 3 students. Yet here I was working this job that didn't seem to require a particularly high IQ, and I was failing miserably. It was one mistake after another. ""Hey, we need to talk about that item you processed. You transposed a couple of numbers and a check went out for $15,000 more than it should have."" ""Hey, you accidentally processed this one as future-dated, so it went out 3 days after it was supposed to."" I absolutely dreaded going in there every day and hearing about another fuck up I committed. My metrics (the numbers we were required to hit to not be in trouble) were always RIGHT on the edge. One month I would hit my numbers (albeit be probably the worst on the floor, including new people), and the next month I would be in the red zone. People did get fired occasionally, as the metrics were pretty demanding, so I suppose I should feel good that I never actually got the axe. Although, I'm pretty sure the only reason for that is that I'm pretty personable and everyone there liked me. I got written up a number of times for bad numbers and mistakes, but I could always manage to meet the minimum metrics for long enough (2 consecutive months) that the write-up would fall off and I'd get another chance. 

After 2 years of that miserable nonsense, I managed to get another job with the company where I was on the phone with clients. I got licensed (series 6 and 63), and at that job I actually did fairly well. After a year, though, I started to realize that I was never going to be able to move up in that organization, so I took a job as a financial analyst at a smaller company. I thought that this might be the beginning of a new career for me, and I was very excited. The pay was higher, the atmosphere was far less strict and regulated (on account of it being a smaller business), and I was elated. Well, I kind of failed at that one too. A similar thing as the processing role -- I would just make really dumb errors. After almost a year of doing that, the company was in financial trouble and laid off about a hundred people. I was one of those 100 people. Thankfully, I've always been a big saver, and I had probably over a year's worth of living expenses saved up. This was a major turning point in my life, or so I thought. 

The layoff hit me pretty hard, emotionally. I was so tired of putting my energy into things that not only weren't paying off, but also made me dread waking up every morning. I decided to completely scrap the idea of climbing my way up some company's ladder, and that the best thing to do was find something specific that I could get educated or trained in. Something that didn't require me to sit in a cubicle and stare at numbers on a screen, or to be just another easily-replaceable cog in a machine. Something that took advantage of both my academic ability and my athletic/physical side (I'm huge into weight-lifting, running, swimming, etc). What I decided on was Physical Therapy. I had a few friends who were PTs, so I got to work talking to them and doing what I needed to advance towards that goal. I used my connections and managed to shadow some physical therapists. I signed up for classes at our local community college. For the next year, I Ubered and did other side-gigs while I filled in the financial gaps with my savings and took all of my science prereqs full time. My wife and I even had to move back in with my parents (she's a full time student and can only work part time, so I pay 95% of our bills). Last May, I finished the last of my prereqs and was basically ready to apply for PT school, but then a few things happened. My savings were almost totally depleted, my parents were tired of us living with them and it was affecting our lives and our relationship, and my wife informed me that she wouldn't be graduating on time. I realized that I needed another real, full-time job to get us through until I could apply for PT school, so I took a job at another large financial company. I got my series 7 and got back on the phones.   


Okay, fast-forward to today. My wife and I are living on our own again, which is great. However, I am, once again, feeling completely miserable going into work every day.  I'm not bad at the job, but every day that I have to wake up and go into that place, I feel like I'm pushing myself to ""just get through ONE MORE DAY!"" I'm drinking too much, and I feel depressed most of the time, but at least I get paid enough that I'm comfortably paying our bills. The Physical Therapy dream is starting to peter out. The other people that I've met who are trying to become PTs are incredibly passionate about it, whereas for me it's just something that I can see myself doing and perhaps being less miserable than I am now. Ontop of that, it would require me to take out close to $100k in student loan debt, and during the 3-year program, I wouldn't be able to work because of how intensive it is. I would have to wait until my wife graduates and starts making money, but we have no idea exactly when that is going to be, and the more time passes, the less motivated I feel about accomplishing the mountain of tasks that I would need to accomplish to become a PT. Plus, even though I have utmost confidence that I could get through the schooling, I'm not even sure I would be good at, or happy in, that job. I just doesn't feel like a wise decision to take out all of that debt and commit more years of my life if I'm not pretty damn certain. I feel like I am, AGAIN, back at fucking square 1. Trying to figure out something that's right for me while I get another year older, more jaded, less motivated. The more this goes on, the more depressed I get, and the more I think that it's just going to be an endless cycle of this.  


I think the most depressing part about this is that I can't seem to get the idea out of my mind that I COULD be doing something amazing. I'm not lazy -- In addition to working full time, I work out at the gym almost every day and do BJJ and kickboxing. If I have down time, I'm probably either fixing something, cleaning something, working out, or getting interested in a new hobby. I know that I have it in me to succeed, because I've been successful at a number of things during my life that weren't easy to succeed at, but why, when it comes to my career, do I just keep landing back at square one? Why am I watching 22 year-olds surpass me on their career tracks? I don't think I'm ""better than"" anyone, but I just feel so fucking frustrated at my lack of progress in life. I don't want to simply have kids, make ends meet, grow old and die. I feel like I have a real drive in me that needs to be exercised, but I just don't have a direction. I really can't keep being a miserable office zombie for much longer. I really can't.    


So, based on this, does anyone have any suggestions? Should I suck it up and go full-force towards PT even though I don't actually feel certain that it's right for me? Or, and I know this is a long-shot, but based on what I've written, does anyone have any suggestions for a career track that I might want to look into?   


TL;DR: I'm 31, married, with a bachelor's degree and international work experience, but I have no idea what career I'm suited for and so I keep landing back at square 1 (soul-crushing office/call center jobs at large corporations in my area). I always did very well in school, and I'm also really into physical and athletic pursuits, but when it comes to office jobs, I'm usually one of the worst employees on the floor, and it's not due to lack of effort. I mess up details and have a really hard time feeling motivated since I'm not remotely interested in what I'm doing. I've been strongly considering Physical Therapy for the last couple of years, and have taken all of the prereqs that I need to apply, but PT school is incredibly expensive, and it would take me about 4 - 5 years from this point, today, to earn my doctorate in the field. I feel like I could be fulfilled doing PT, but I don't think that I have the drive and motivation that other people I've met who are in the field have. It terrifies me to think about being a PT 5 years from now, being miserable, having $100k of student loan debt, and only making about $15k more than what I make right now. I feel like I'm back at square one again, thinking about which career I'm suited for, and I'm looking for advice/guidance.

:-:|
Old Saint Nick delivered his Christmas gift of putting the Eagles in the playoffs with a little help from his next opponent the Chicago Bears who beat their division rival Redskins to knock the Vikings out of the playoffs allowing the Eagles to sneak in with their win over the rival Redskins. Nick will have to use all the magic left in that big ol dick of his this week as the Bears come into the game with the best defense in football and are in the top 10 in nearly every defensive category. Their defense was good last season, but went to great when they traded for Khalil Mack before the season started. Mack is a terror for opposing offenses with 12.5 sacks and 6 forced fumbles this season, the Eagles OL and Nick Foles will need to know where Mack is at all times on the football field. I expect the game plan will be similar to when the Eagles played Mack last season using a variety of double teams to keep him off his game. On the otherside the defense has been playing better of late and shut out the beat up Washington Redskins offense holding them to mere 89 yards on offense. They will be put to the test this week taking on Matt Nagy's offense that Trubisky has thrived in this season. The DL will need to find away to get past a talented Bears OL and wreak havoc in the backfield to make Trubisky uncomfortable and stop the talented 1-2 punch of the Bears run game. The game will be a chess match between two old friends who should be very familiar with one another. Not only to Pederson and Nagy both come up under Andy Reid, but they both joined the Eagles staff in the 2009 and 2008 seasons and stayed with Reid when he went to Kansas City with Nagy taking the QB coach position and Pederson taking the OC slot. So coaching together for 7 straight seasons should give each other some ideas what the other will do and make for an entertaining football game. Go Birds!|

Eagles 31 - Bears 3|
he game many expected could be a trap for the Eagles turned into a rout of the Bears 31-3. The Eagles controlled both sides of the line of scrimmage and dominated the Bears running backs sending them the wrong direction as they ended the day with -6 yards rushing. The Eagles secondary also picked off Mitch Trubisky twice on the day. On offense, the Eagles running game was on point as they ran for 176 and Carson Wentz threw for 3 TDs and 227 yards before an early exit in the 4th quarter to prevent injury and give Nick Foles some playing time. The Eagles had their first 100 yard receiver this season as Zach Ertz crossed the century mark. The game wasn’t perfect though both Blount and Ajayi fumbled the football running and Malcom Jenkins fumbled after making a nice interception. |

Monday, September 19th, 2016|
Eagles 29 - Bears 16|
In Wentz’s second career game he threw for 190 yards and a TD while showing plenty of poise, just as he did in his debut against Cleveland. Ryan Mathews found the end zone two times rushing. The Eagles held the Bears in check most of the day and while Philadelphia was pulling away, Chicago quarterback Jay Cutler walked to the locker room with a right thumb injury and did not return. That was the biggest blow for the Bears (0-2), who lost several players and fell again after opening with a loss at Houston. It's not the sort of start they envisioned in their second year under coach John Fox after finishing last in the NFC North. But they continued to struggle at home, where they were 1-7 in 2016.|

**Eagles** - [Video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000001006076/Eagles-vs-Redskins-highlights-Week-17) – The Eagles looked to keep their season alive and Super Bowl MVP came out to play as Foles threw tied an NFL record for most consecutive completions when threw 25 straight completions that were part of 221 yards 2 TD 1 INT stat line. On the other side of the ball, the Eagles were even more dominant against a beat up Redskins offense holding them to a paltry 89 yards on offense in a shutout. Fletcher Cox feasted with 3 sacks in the game and Douglas had an interception as the Eagles got the job done against their division rival.|
**Bears** - [Video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000001006093/Bears-vs-Vikings-highlights-Week-17) – The Bears took on their division rival with a bye at stake if the 49ers were able to pull an upset over on the Rams. The Vikings had more to play for as they were win and in for the playoffs came out flat as the Bears dominated them in every aspect of the football game. The Vikings 84 million dollar man does what he does in big games and crumbled throwing for just 132 yards and a TD. Meanwhile, the Bears refused to let up as Howard and Cohen combined for 134 yards and 3 TDs on the ground. Once the Ramns game was out of reach many backups came in for the Bears, but it didn't make a lick of difference as they held onto the win and knocked their division rival out of the playoffs allowing the Eagles to sneak in who they will play this Sunday.|

**Fun Fact**|
:-:|
On New Year’s Eve, 1988, the Eagles lost a postseason heartbreaker to the Bears in Chicago, in a game that has gone down in history as “The Fog Bowl.” Meteorologically, the title was well-earned. Lake Michigan sent a blinding sheet of fog over Soldier Field late in the first half, and the haze stayed put until the very last play. Visibility was so bad that most players couldn’t see beyond 10 yards in front of their faces. Up in the public address booth, Bears play-by-play announcer Jim Riebandt had to get game updates relayed to him from an usher who was standing on the field with a two-way radio.

**PFF Stats to Know**|
:--|
**Chicago Running Backs**|
Tarik Cohen and Jordan Howard are going to need to be planned for. With injuries to the Eagles' defensive backfield, it's going to be a major task. Let's get to it. Cohen and Howard will not get many yards after contact (the Bears' offense generally does not generate much YAC or RAC). Cohen is ranked 58th and Howard is 37th in rushing yards after contact per attempt Cohen is tied for a close 2nd in % targets for overall snaps and 7th in % of his targets coming from the Slot. When aligned in the Slot, though, Cohen has generated the 2nd-most Yards Per Route Run, at 3.19. Overall, Cohen has the highest YPRR and 3rd-most receiving yards of RBs. Cohen has had an atrocious **7** fumbles in 2018 (3 lost). Jordan Howard is 7th in 1st Downs generated and 47th in Yards Per Attempt. Howard is 6th in Rushing Attempts (250), still, for 935 yards (14th).|

**Matchups to Watch**|
:--|
**Eagles Offensive Line vs. Bears Pass Rush**|
The Eagles snuck into the playoffs after week 17 with some help from their current opponent 10 years after the 44-6 beat down of the Cowboys to accomplish the same feat. The Eagles enter the playoffs as the 6 seed and rightful underdogs even with the recent success and face a Bears team that is strong on both sides of the ball - especially on defense. There are many layers to this matchup but for the Eagles it'll always start up front. Prior to the season the Bears traded for Khalil Mack after Jon Gruden decided to be an idiot. The Bears defense was already pretty good but Mack pushed the unit over the top. The Eagles have game planned for Mack before when he was on the Raiders and held him in check for the most part. However, the depth of talent on the Bears defensive front far surpasses the talent on the Raiders 2017 defensive front. To make matters worse for the Eagles, the Bears defense is strong at all 3 levels so they'll really need to win regularly up front to have any kind of success on offense. Akiem Hicks is a stout IDL who is having a strong season in a year where IDL across the league are making big impacts. Eddie Goldman is another DT for the Bears and together with Hicks formed a formidable duo prior to Mack's arrival. Mack and Hicks both have over 50 pressures for Bears defense and force a lot of offenses into making mistakes. Additionally, the entire defensive front is stout against the run as well. This is a complete unit and will need the Eagles OL to rise to the occasion as they have so often of late. Lane Johnson, Brandon Brooks, and Jason Kelce form the best right side of an OL in the NFL and all are having All Pro caliber years. Despite not playing at his usual Hall of Fame level, Jason Peters is still a good left tackle and Wis or Seumalo can hold their own at LG. This is a premier battle that can really help the Eagles win since there are many layers to this Bears defense as it is that will make the Eagles offense earn everything it can get. In their push for the post season, the Eagles defense neutralized the pass rush for the Cowboys, Rams, Texans, and Redskins on two occasions. They'll need it again for this one.|
**Eagles Defensive Line vs. Bears Offensive Line**|
The Bears enter this contest with one of the best offensive lines in terms of pass blocking efficiency per PFF this season and have veteran Kyle Long making his second consecutive start after returning from injury. Additionally, Matt Nagy runs a creative offense that does a lot to ease the pressure the offensive line can face. Fletcher Cox is having another All Pro caliber season for the Eagles with 95 pressures (per PFF) this season; that number is second only to Aaron Donald in the NFL. That's not just for his position, that is for all pass rushers. Cox is a complete player that will likely draw a lot of attention from the Bears offensive line. They'll need Timmy Jernigan and Haloti Ngata to step up opposite him and make some noise with the 1v1 matchups they'll likely get. Furthermore, Michael Bennett, Chris Long, and Brandon Graham will need to continue with their high level of play of late and take advantages of the matchups they'll get with the extra attention Cox will receive. As with any young QB, Trubisky is far less effective as a passer when he is under pressure and can be prone to throwing an interceptable pass or two. The Eagles defense has been very opportunistic of late forcing a lot of turnovers. The depleted secondary has done their part but it's the defensive line that can really change the game. Trubisky has made a lot of progress since last year but is still mistake prone. This is fine for the Bears as he'll likely improve especially with the quality coaching he has around him. But for now, this Eagles defense can help win this game by forcing him into negative plays. Lastly, controlling the Bears offensive line in the run game will help make the offense one dimensional. Force the Bears offense into unfavorable down and distances and their success rate drops. It'll be important to keep them off schedule and the defensive line will play a big role in that.|
**Eagles Pass Defense vs Bears Weapons**|
The Bears have done a great job surrounding Trubisky with plenty of weapons that can attack and win against every defense in a variety of ways. They added the big body receiver in Allen Robinson, the speedster in Taylor Gabriel, the versatile WR Anthony Miller, Trey Burton, and finally Tarik Cohen as a natural matchup nightmare for any defense. All of these guys have a trump card that can help the offense win and all are solid route runners to give Trubisky space to throw the football. Jordan Howard is a solid running back and it'll be important to contain him but Tarik Cohen is the matchup nightmare the Eagles must contain. Cohen will line up everywhere and take a lot of snaps as a wide receiver which gives the Bears the ability put the offense up against favorable defensive alignments. He's explosive with the ball in his hands and is a true competitor. The offense is much more dynamic and explosive when he is on the field. Lately the Eagles defense has done a great job containing opposing RBs but the depth of weapons and the scheme Nagy runs will really test the Eagles back end. Jim Schwartz has done a great job helping this defense finish 12th in points allowed, 1st in red zone defense, and 6th best third down defense despite all of the injuries. They'll need that performance again against an offense that'll stress every blade of grass and take what you give them.|
**Eagles Pass Offense vs Bears Pass Defense**|
This is the matchup every fan should be worried about no matter how much you trust the coaches and QB to execute at a high level. The Bears enter this contest with the leagues best pass defense with plenty of high end talent and excellent coaching that have largely shut down their opposition all year. Additionally, the Bears secondary is incredible at forcing turnovers and lead the league by a large margin in interceptions. The Bears added a ton of playmakers on offense to help out Trubisky but have a ton of playmakers on defense to elevate the entire team. [Few teams have been as good as the Bears have against the pass this year](https://twitter.com/JuMosq/status/1080651906978963457?s=19) and 3 of the 4 that did it won the Super Bowl - leave it to the Vikings to choke. If there is a ""weakness"" to this defense it is outside at CB (Amukamara), LBs in coverage, and Eddie Jacksons injury status (though he'll likely play). Points will be tough to come by as will running. I would expect the coaching staff to try to use the short passing game like they did against the Texans as an extension of the run game to keep the offense on schedule. An additional benefit of this attack is it gives Foles high percentage throws to limit the potential for turnovers. The Eagles need to take this game to the Bears defense but do so smartly. Even if Amukamara is a ""weak link"" he really isn't a weak link. Even if the Bears don't have elite coverage LBs they have 2 Safeties that are great in coverage. It would be smart for the Eagles to take their shots with Alshon Jeffery as he is their best man coverage receiver. It would be pretty surprising for the Eagles to put up an offensive performance similar to the NFCCG but they do have the talent to be able to at least score some points. They just need to be mindful of all the things Fangio does on the back end to confuse the QB and generate turnovers. The offense needs to stay on schedule to limit low percentage opportunities.|

Then she forces herself into the gentleman's night event, and arrives there acting like the last cookie on a pack.

Season 4 so far has been really good with the humor on point, the only bad parts being whenever George has scenes with people he had slept with, but I have a feeling I am going to see myself skipping ahead on some of her scenes."

I moved in  Amsterdam a year ago. I finaly settled down and I would like to quit my alimentary job as a Monteur in a montage company to work as a logistician, salesperson, project manager...etc. 

Is there some good website where I can post my resumé in order to find work?

I  have a diploma in French litterature and english literature, another in international trades, a year of experience in office relocations for big multinationals in the Netherlands and Europe in general and I speak 3 languages. I have CV, Linkedin profile, and can write cover letters for any need. But I am new to the job market in the Netherlands, indeed when I came here I got lucky and found a stable job with contract just by talking to people in the streets.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you know about a platform that could help me find a job \*as a salaried employee not an intern\* please tell me.

Thank you fellow redditers, and a Happy new year to you all.

acbm6r,9,2019-01-03,Ambit Energy,theleanto,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/acbm6r/ambit_energy/,"So I’ve been reading this thread for awhile and I decided to share my experience with Ambit Energy because I don’t see anyone on here who has been scammed by them.

I got involved in “my own energy business” because I was an intern for a company and the guy who I was working under on my first day working with him told me that I needed to have a multiple sources of income if I want to succeed I can’t just have one. I just shook my head and agreed (my fiancé grows hops as a side business and pumpkins as a side side business to make extra money in the fall). He then proceeded to tell me he owns his own energy business, trades online currency and also has many rental properties. All which stemmed from him starting his own energy business. Now here’s me thinking I’m talking with the CEO of National Grid (major power company where I’m from). 

So we’re sitting in his truck because it’s a construction site and there’s no where else to sit, and me stupidly asked him what the energy business was because he was too vague about it earlier, and I’m nosey because a lot of my relatives work for power companies.  He had a sticker on his windshield that said ambit energy. I had never heard of it before so I was intrigued to learn more.  He got excited when I asked and immediately started going on about how much money I can make and how the company is bbb accredited and you don’t have to sell any products blah blah blah. The way it works is a direct pyramid except instead of selling products you’re getting people to switch to Ambit as their energy provider.  “Your bill will still come from your electrical company but will be way cheaper since ambit is providing the energy not the electrical company”. I was suckered in because I would love to help my parents save money on their bill each month. I was creeped out by it though because they’re very faith oriented and it seriously reminded me of a cult. His only friends were people he met through ambit and he even disclosed to me that if people didn’t join ambit or change their electricity provider to them he didn’t talk to them anymore because they weren’t supporting him. 

To get started it was $75 to join and $26 to keep your website running every month. So I talked to my fiancé and we were like hey if it has the possibility of paying for our future mortgage every month it’s worth it right. 
Fast forward a couple months we didn’t really try hard we got his parents and my parents to switch providers but no one to sign up which was fine with me I didn’t want anyone involved in this scam anyways. We made our $100 back by getting two customers which was fine but in order to continue making money you needed so many customers and other people that wanted to “start their own business”. 
So my mom got her bills in for electricity. The first month was $40 above what she usually pays (bill was about $120) and the next month was $20 more. My mom immediately called and cancelled and she received her next bill and it went down to $4.67 because they had to change it based on how much she was getting over charged. 

Unless you can really smooth talk people into falling for this shit you can’t make a dime. "
acbv2z,17,2019-01-03,What I've gained and what I need to improve from my 2018 low-buy,bubikiwi,MakeupRehab,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/acbv2z/what_ive_gained_and_what_i_need_to_improve_from/,"I don't want to make this post super long. In 2017 I discovered MUR by the end of it I decided I wanted to try doing a low-buy since I wanted to save money and spend less on makeup to spend more on things like gifts/dates with my boyfriend and also be able to spend money on other things other than makeup.

At the time the only money I got was my allowance for my parents, things changed a bit mid 2018 when I got my first internship and was making some money. I've actually saved most it when I think about it but I also feel like I spent more than what I wanted this year, which I'll go more in depth at the end. 

I started 2018 wanting to do a 3 month no-buy that turned into a 6 month no-buy. I was allowed to purchase 20€ of makeup every month and it could roll over into the next month, so if I wanted something I would have to wait whatever amount of months I needed to get to the price of the product. I also had a budget for makeup, 250€ and for skincare 100€ which I didn't exceed, skincare isn't an issue for me but because I don't want to constantly add new items into my routine I'll make it so I only can try one or two new products a year. 

It didn't start out the best since I broke my no-buy on february or march when Lime Crime released their Venus XL palette, thankfully I returned it without even using it and I never regretted this choice. The next product I bought was in June, a Colourpop single shadow and a Smashbox liquid lipstick.

&amp;nbsp;

**What can I improve in the future?**

This year is no different and I'm doing a low-buy again. I noticed I have 3 issues I need to correct:

- Waiting for black friday to make a big makeup purchase since I will hardly spend any makeup during the rest of the year but ended up purchasing things I didn't have on my wishlist, didn't wait enough time to know if I truly wanted or not (I think I did well, while I still haven't used everything I got I'm very content with every single item I got and I wasn't as impulsive as 2017 where I bought 2 liquid lipsticks from Ofra and didn't wear them for months)

- I noticed I developed an anxiety related to having to spend money, I **HATE** to spend money pretty much and because of this I also become easily obsessed over trying to find the perfect product, if I see something I want I will spend hours on research so I'm sure I want this product and I will love it (I guess the fact that I can't return makeup makes this worst) and because I'll try to wait for sales sometimes I notice I obsess over products, like going to sleep thinking about them for a few days. This is ridiculous and it has to stop now! 

- I set up a maximum amount of money I could buy all throughout 2018, which was 250€. Around mid-year I had to get a new brush because my powder brush broke and I realized I didn't consider brushes into my budget, so I wasn't sure if I should count it as makeup spending too or another category. I ended up counting as another category since I had more money to spend at the time while also saving most of it. At the end of the day I feel like I exceeded my makeup budget, even though I actually didn't since I made a seperate budget for brushes of 100€.

&amp;nbsp;

**What are the things I improved with my no-buy?**

I can easily wait months without purchasing a product, it can be hard sometimes since I'll be tempted by something but I've noticed I quickly forget if I don't forget the item it gets put on a wishlist and I try to buy it when it's on sale. I also learned that *makeup always goes on sale* so because of this it easier for me to wait until I actually bought something, my wishlist went from being a document of 20 pages to a spreadsheet of I think maximum it got was 20-25 items (usually it's around 5-15), from this I also notice the items I still think about and wish I had because I see a gap on my collection. 
Also I used up so many products and hit pan on so many products, until mid 2017 I had never hit pan on anything!

&amp;nbsp;

**How much did I improve in my finances in 2018? Did you achieve your goals?**

- For my makeup budget of 250€, I spent 219,32€

- For my makeup brushes budget I added later I could spend 100€, I spent 95,70€

- For skincare with a budget of 100€, I spent 92,06€

- I managed to save almost 1500€ while working because I hardly spent money or things I didn't need. I still have that money saved and haven't touched it since it's atm my emergency fund money.

- I went on a lot more dates with my boyfriend and I almost always payed half and even had dates where I would pay the whole bill which was something that didn't happen before. I got christmas gifts for my close family which I didn't last year because I spent all my money on makeup during black friday.

&amp;nbsp;

In conclusion, I think I did mostly well. I can control my urges pretty well but I still have to improve how much time I waste thinking of all the pretty shiny things I want. For 2019, my low-buy considers everything I could money on that tempts me (makeup brushes, makeup and skincare) and it has gotten lower since I'm not sure if I'll have a stable job all throughout the year.

acc1ab,1,2019-01-03,"I completely stressed myself out, ignoring every chance not do so. Why? How do I forgive myself?",bobspeedyou,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/acc1ab/i_completely_stressed_myself_out_ignoring_every/,"Two years ago I spent almost an entire year qualifying for a very promising scholarship, which will only be granted to a few percent of all applicants. It is the key and also the best way to getting the job of my dreams, so I was never really lacking any motivation.
And yes, I actually qualified for it, I made it. It was one of the happiest moments in my life, quickly followed by one of the hardest decisions in my life: Starting the training immediately or waiting a couple of months, get everything sorted out at home first and then start with the next class.

This would’ve only meant getting into the job a little later and that the training would’ve been done by a different, but equally renowned institution.


For some reason, however, I was too impatient and placed too much value on the advice of other people, rather than listening to my guts and my heart. At that point, I was already exhausted after more than one and a half years without any vacation or time for myself. My body was telling me to slow down, take a break and reward myself for the great achievement. But my indecisiveness eventually made me start with the earlier class.


From then on I basically tried to survive from one weekend to the next. Training was hard. 10 times harder than expected, 10 times more to study than expected. I was just lacking the energy to do it. I stopped being able to sleep normally, I’ve never been able to catch a full night’s rest, looking for options, without finding any.


In summer, I got to know my girlfriend and she was like a savior, an angel to me, because no matter how stressful and busy the week was, she just made sure we had a great time in the evenings or on the weekend.

But in December it was time for our class to go abroad for the internship.
And again, no time to just sit down and relax for a second at home. Packing bags, saying goodbye to my girlfriend and now I won’t see her for half a year.

I like the job a lot, and I never had any doubt about what I’m doing, but it’s tough as hell and I just keep asking myself day after day why I had to rush for the first class. The price for it was just too high. I’m barely in touch with my family and it’s really tough for our relationship to becoming a long-distance one after such a long time.


I’m exhausted and over-stressed and there’s nothing more I wish to do than just lying in bed with my girlfriend, cuddling, watching tv and forgetting about the world for a while. Those moments were one of the happiest, because I need them so much.

I look terrible, the stress causes my hair to fall out and I feel like I aged 10 years due to all the stress.


The worst part is, I could’ve avoided all of it, If I had just listened to my guts back then. I still hate myself for it and I can’t find a way how to forgive myself for not doing everything right.
Yes, I should be happy that I got the privilege to get the scholarship in first place. And yes, I shouldn’t be too hard on myself, try meditation, look on the positive side of things…and so on.

But right now, I just feel miserable. I just want to forgive myself and feel better. And I need vacation more than ever before. But there’s no chance to get any before October.


TL;DR: Unnecessarily caused myself more stress than necessary, didn’t listen to my guts, now being totally worn out.

I do quite a bit of distance driving to visit family and I foresee a 1 hr commute to a future internship. My 22 mpg is killing me.

My mom has offered to help me buy a car for my birthday in March. I would probably try and trade in or sell my Vue, which is at around 150k miles. I can realistically get $4k from it.

Looking at a budget of about $10k. I am avoiding 2011 and 2010 Prii in my search because of all the reported oil issues. Is this a mistake? I’m also wary of older models just because I don’t know how long these cars tend to last. My mom is also very skeptical due to rumors she has heard about the battery etc. That said, I’m really not opposed to an older model if it’s going to last me a while.

There’s a 2009 Prius near me for sale at a dealer, 169k miles, no price listed. How would I know if this is a good purchase? My mom is balking at the mileage but I don’t know if that is warranted or not.

Any advice is welcome!"

I just need to vent (?) I am as close as I have ever been to full remission from depression. But this last week, I've been slowly growing more and more depressed. I ended up cutting on New Years (I mean, like at 4am so 2019, i think) I was drunk and I gave myself my worst cut. But it really was superficial (like I knew that), it was just one that I couldn't close with butterfly bandages. I wasn't sure, so I went to the ER (I know, stupid of me, even though the doctor said I did the right thing and I got great insurance). Best thing of it all: I got a tetnus shot. But I still can't shake the depressed feeling. And I just want to cut myself. I feel so low, and I just realized, I will never be the same person I used to be. I've been procrastinating on this one project and have tried to take care of everything instead of it. I've lost myself somewhere. I didn't realize it until now. I just slowly faded away. In some ways thats okay, but I can't tell if I've matured or I've just become more cynical and hopeless. And I don't think I'll ever be in ""total remission"". I just want to cut myself all over. All over. All, All, Alll freaking over.

the number one trigger this week: thinking of the future. And the future is something, even at my best, I can't believe in. And sometimes I cut myself because I feel like I can't handle the future. And yeah, I try to live day by day, but if you are applying for financial aid, study abroad, internships, and a progressive degree (getting a Masters and B.A. in five years total) it's impossible to think in the short term.  Oh, and guess what. I have to take a full course load to even have a chance to go for the masters. I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can survive this. I'm sure I'll survive for the next few months. But every semester is the same. Beginning is nearly suicidal, middle is suicidal, and end may or may not be depressed/suicidal. I'm in therapy, but someday i won't. I know I got things pretty good, but my anxiety and sleep issues are slowly leeching me of what I want and could do. I've already accepted that Anxiety is for life. I don't want to slip up two days after my relapse"

I grumbled and tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves, and for a moment I’m reminded of an Asian girl with dramatic eyes whose name I’d already forgotten.

*Now that was a good night.*

I sigh loudly – more of a growl now – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing of arriving guests is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

I actually smiled at that last one."
ace5py,0,2019-01-03,Transitioning from Stills to Motion,BenFromPerth23,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/ace5py/transitioning_from_stills_to_motion/,"
TL;DR. I’m a stills photographer with 10 years experience, who wants to get into more motion (I’ve done some, but I want exciting, well paid, rewarding gigs). Not afraid to pay my dues, but don’t want to spend another 10 years doing so. How do I get a shot, which department should I target, and who should I contact to get on a bunch of sets this year and fast track this whole thing? Ultimate goal would be a DoP, and/or Director.

Hey guys. I'm a Stills Photographer (and Assistant/Digi Tech) with 10+ years of experience, but have been bitten by the motion bug. I do shoot my own low level stuff (Fashion vids, some ads - even a small social spot for McDonalds which got close to half a Million views, and thousands of comments (Most of which were to complain about the lack of secret sauce on their Big Macs. But I'll still claim it. :) )

I'm just wondering what you think the best way to get work would be, and what department I should target? (And what role within that department). I feel like I’d be happiest in the camera department, but the barrier to entry seems higher to me than Grip, and I’d also enjoy that. I just would hope to transition to camera one day, so maybe I should just start there? 

The dream would be narrative work, but I'm not picky yet. Ads are fine. I'm even willing to intern a little if I need to for the right project, but I do need to get paid ASAP. Just reality.

Basically, as a Stills guy, I'm familiar with all aspects of cameras and lighting, including setting flags, shaping light, etc. And I've worked with a number of smaller HMI/Tungsten/LED sources. And shaping natural light is my happy place.

I also have experience with Reds, Ursa Mini Pro's, Alexa Mini's, FS7’s and have been everything from a Runner, to a 2nd AC, 1st AC, Camera Operator (2nd Unit), and Grip/Gaffer (But when I say Gaffer, I guess I just mean setting lights. No 18K's or anything too crazy. But I think I could. Just need the experience.

Areas I'm lacking in are Running Power, proper Set Etiquette, Sound, and really specific things I just haven't been involved in like slating, pulling focus, DIT work etc.

I'm not afraid to start at the bottom but I don't want to spend too long there. I'm not a beginner. Aside from over a decade in Stills, I've spent every moment I can learning as much as possible the last couple of years (Shanes Inner Circle Member, constant high end YouTube, Masterclass's, books etc), and I'm definitely not ""Green"". I'm just lacking practical experience on motion sets. And my Stills experience is really valuable. I understand light.

So, I feel like I'd go ok in the grip department without making a fool of myself. (Not great on electrical yet). But I can’t think what I’d need to do in that department that wouldn’t make immediate sense to me.

I also think I'd go ok in the camera department. It's just rounding out the knowledge. And I know this will come out wrong, but I feel like I'd make a better camera operator than an AC. I'd love to leave the technical up to the guys who really know and live that stuff. I'll pay my dues obviously, and could probably be a fast learning 2nd AC. 1st AC scares the shit out of me (pulling focus is nightmare fuel!). And in both of those roles, there’s so much more to it than that. I’d like to watch and learn and work my way up. But not forever. Like I said, I’m not starting from scratch.
 
But being the guy who operates the camera is sort of what I do already with stills. (Obviously I know it’s miles apart in reality, with camera moves and all that. But still, it’s more natural to me).

I’m working on a reel. I’m planning to write, shoot and direct a few small projects this year so that I can really up my game, practice and show what I’m capable of. But until that’s up and running, I need work. 

I have about 5 years worth of call sheets in my current city of Sydney, Australia (Lots of my stills work has been on motion sets). 

So… Who do I contact? How do I get my shot? "
aceai7,22,2019-01-03,Ran a game last week. Here's how it went!,AsherGlass,Pokemon5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemon5e/comments/aceai7/ran_a_game_last_week_heres_how_it_went/,"Hey everyone! I ran this game last Saturday and I finally got around to doing a right up of how it went. Thanks go to u/JaggedSun for making this game possible! He's been putting a lot of work into making this work and keeping it updated.

To start: I'm the GM for 4 players. In my campaign I set the minimum age to start a journey by ones self at 16 which is just after kids graduate high school and just before they start secondary school. The campaign is going to be set in Kanto (group decision) and the story will follow relatively closely to the games, manga, and anime.

One of the characters is Rick. He is a 20 something that worked for a collections/repossession agency as one of the muscle. He came into work with his Machop and found the place swarming with cops. He decided to nope right out of there before being spotted and turned the other way. As he was walking down the streets of Palette Town he got spotted by somebody he had muscled out of a debt and rubbed the wrong way. The guy had two huge friends with him and they were gonna mess him up. They ended up chasing Rick out of town and getting chased off by some Beedrill.

Two of the other characters are Arabella and Melody. They are sisters from Hoenn and daughters of Professor Birch. Arabella is the older sister. She just graduated and is looking to into an internship before continuing school. She was given a Bulbasaur by her dad. Professor Birch needed to travel to Kanto to do a bit of collaborative work with Prof Oak. The professors both saw an opportunity for Arabella to intern for Prof Oak. He sends her off to Viridian City to seek out Professor Pine, an assistant professor,  working on her research. 

Melody is Arabella's younger sister. She is twelve. She snuck onto on the ship Arabella and her dad took because she didn't want to be left out. They were both very surprised to see Melody depart the ship. Her dad was irate at first, but after much persistent begging he reluctantly resigned to allow Melody to travel around with her sister and her Cyndaquil. 

Dakota is Rick's step brother. He is younger at 20 years old. They haven't talked in a while but still maintain a distant relationship. Dakota is much more in tune with nature than Rick. He works at a pokemon rehabilitation center that humanely captures injured pokemon, fixes them up, nurses them back to good health, and releases them back into the wild. He has a Growlithe named Scruff that he had previously nursed back to health. Scruff decided to stick around with Dakota rather than go back into the wild. 

&amp;#x200B;

The story begins with Arabella and Melody heading out to Viridian City via Rt 1. They are in a small wooded area when  Arabella sees an Oddish and stops to take notes (she hasn't done very much field work and is thus fascinated with wild pokemon). Melody; however, is running around examining everything when she accidentally stumbles into a Beedrill nest. They get chased through the woods for a bit and are able to escape and hide in a tree.

Meanwhile, Rick finds himself outside of town after running from his pursuers. He decides to find a place to lay low for a bit in case he's followed home. He remembers that his step brother, Dakota, lives just outside of town. He has an idea of where Dakota lives, but isn't exactly sure. He ends up wandering around in the woods for a bit before being spotted by Dakota.

Dakota was doing his morning rounds, setting and checking traps when he spots Rick. Rick helps Dakota for a bit as they chat when they here a noise familiar to Dakota. It's a couple Beedrill. He sees them searching around the woods before they fly off. He checks the area out where they were searching and notices Arabella and Melody hiding in a tree (great perception check). He helps the two sisters down and tells everyone that they can rest up at his place for a bit.

They all head back to Dakota's house on the edge of the woods. They get to work fixing up a Rattata with an injured foot that had been found in one of the traps. When they're finished an associate of Dakota's tells him that one of the Nidoran(f) had gotten spooked and broke out, running off into the field. It's not too far from where they are now so they set out to find it and return it. They find the Nidoran(f) being harassed by a small nest of Pikachu defending their nest.  They engage the 5 Pikachu to defend the Nidoran(f).

Dakota starts out by running closer and commanding Scruff to Roar, sending the largest Pikachu running back into the nest. Arabella and Melody run closer, but can't yet engage. The Pikachu attacks, one misses Scruff and the other hits Bulbasaur. Rick does nothing. Scruff returns fire to one of the Pikachu but misses with a tackle. One Pikachu runs back into the hole, another hits Cyndaquill, and another hits Scruff. Cyndaquill hits one with a tackle, bringing it to half health. Rick attempts to catch that one much to the chagrin of Melody (the player was pretty upset at the attempt). I gave disadvantage to catching a pokemon that has not been injured by the player attempting to catch it. I reasoned that pokemon have greater trust and respect for those who have engaged them in combat and defeated them as opposed to those who have not and try to capture them by other means. Eventually Cyndaquill, Bulbasaur, and Scruff all fall to the Pikachu (each one was one shot). Dakota sweeps up the Nidoran(f) and everyone books it back to his place.

&amp;#x200B;

Later I realized we all messed up because the players forgot to add +10 to their starters HPs, and I forgot to remind them. I think we'll be returning to that battle next week to see if one of the players can get a Pikachu. Everybody still had a blast and really look forward to playing again."
aceaqh,3,2019-01-03,My experiences as a young designer,Fyredesigns,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/aceaqh/my_experiences_as_a_young_designer/,"Hello fellow designer! I see lots of posts around here asking how to find work and get your foot in the door as a graphic designer. I figured that I would share my experience on the matter.

\*//\*Note I am by no means an expert in any of this. I am simply sharing my experiences\*//\*

So a little background about myself. I'm currently 21 years old about to graduate college and I specialize in brand identity and front-end web. I have had 2 internships and I'm on my second part-time job at an agency.

So I assume most of those reading are currently freelance. I am going to cover pretty much how I go about getting freelance clients and how I got internships/jobs

Starting with freelance work. I have found that doing work locally was a big thing that helped bring in clients. I did this by verbally talking to people. If I saw something that could be fixed, a menu at a small restaurant for example, I talk to them about the design and how I feel it could improve and how that would benefit them. This is done respectfully. While this method brings in a few hundred dollars here and there it's not super sustainable but it's good side work. It's a good way to start off and getting comfortable working with clients. If you plan to move forward into freelance It it super important to establish yourself as a brand. I think for this it's good to have a web presence, social media, and showcase some work that you are proud of that was effective.

There is SO much more about freelance work I can go into such as contracts, interaction points, etc.

Now for internships. So the way I got my first internship was exactly the way you would think. The internet. So I used a website called [angel list](https://angel.co/). From here you set up an account and put in a cover letter, resume, portfolio and all that and you basically treat it like tinder. You just accept the ones you are interested in and if they contact you then GREAT! SO I did that a few times a day getting a few connections and eventually one messaged me and wanted to set up a meeting. I did so and we found that we would work well together and I was able to work remotely for this company (unpaid unfortunately) and was able to learn a lot about design process and print production.  
My second internship was found in a strange way I would say. I knew I wanted to try my hand at a larger kind of creative business. So I checked every design/creative agency within a 30 mile radius of my home town using google maps. doing this I sent about 40 emails that were structured similar to a cover letter which contained my portfolio, and resume. I got a bunch of emails back and a few stating that they wanted to chat. I had some meetings and eventually settled to intern (paid!) for a web design agency for a summer. This was a huge turning point in my web process. learning so much about the field to the point I could offer it freelance. This method was overall pretty effective.

Finally part-time jobs. So my first job was actually the same method I got my second internship with. I emailed some companies late January and was able to do some phone/zoom meetings and lock down a summer job by the start of February and was able to start in-house at the start of August. As for the second job (my current location) it was pretty much the same story. Sent an email out to places I liked and was able to have some phone meetings before they brought me into the office to determine my hours and schedule that fit with me being a student.

One really big thing I feel is important if you are seeking employment is to know your strengths and push towards them. do work that you enjoy doing. The way I see it, become an expert in 1 or 2 areas of design and be proficient in others rather than trying to be good at everything. My big thing that seemed to set me apart was web design/development. Places such as agencies if they are seeking someone often times want them to do very specific things.

The big takeaway with all of this is that you need to be confident in yourself and in your work and definitely be able to talk to people and show you have good personality. I have found that just communication alone goes a long way in this field.

**TLDR: Be social and approachable, don't be afraid to reach out to people you want to work for. try to specialize in the work you enjoy** **doing.** **be confident in yourself and your work.**

probably tons of typos. Sorry I suck at writing.

I hope maybe I helped shine a little light on anything. If not I'm sorry.

If you have any specific questions please feel free to ask!"

acejfk,1,2019-01-03,Hi guys! New Zealander making a return trip to Hungary. Anyone with Schengen visa experience here?,maxim_karki,visas,https://www.reddit.com/r/visas/comments/acejfk/hi_guys_new_zealander_making_a_return_trip_to/,"So, some background for you. I was in Hungary from September-December 2018 for a study abroad program (I go to university in the US). I got an internship offer which starts from June to end of August 2019. 

I was assuming that I would need to apply for a visa for this trip again since I used my free entry Schengen visa the last time I was there. However, on reading the requirements for Schengen visa, it says that I can get another 90 day Visa if it's beyond 180 days since the date of entry of the last time. So, it would mean that I wouldn't need to get a visa?

I got the info from this site: http://konzuliszolgalat.kormany.hu/how-to-apply-for-visa
I clicked on the short term (90 day) visa for the info 

To sum it up, I got my previous Schengen visa when I got to the Hungarian airport on September 4th. I left within 90 days from that date. And I need to go again on June 1st. It says so on the website that the 180 day period starts from the date I entered the country. So I'm assuming that it starts on September 4, 2018. Which means that if I reach there on June 1, 2019 it would be well past the 180 day window and I don't need to apply for a visa.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, and it would be helpful if anyone went through a similar experience before. Thanks!"

acfgbh,9,2019-01-04,Lonely at the Top,Hardine081,entj,https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/acfgbh/lonely_at_the_top/,"I never realized how true this statement was until I made significant strides at my university. During my first 5 semesters at school, I worked very dilligently to create the most opportunities for myself as possible in the realm of scholarships, internships, etc. After becoming one of the top students in my class with an ongoing internship at a Fortune 10 Company I realize how much it has cut me off from generating a trustworthy social circle at my school. I have two close friends there, everyone else is an acquaintance. I certainly run into people who I feel are befriending me solely for help in school, and others who are just intimidated by me. In a very honest way I’ve also been told I’m quite attractive, and this makes me feel so isolated from everyone else. So many people look at me like I’m an asshole, be it in class or around campus.

Though I feel like a loner while I’m there, more people know who I am than I thought according to some. This is due to the fact that they know I’m am overachiever who holds his head high with confidence around campus. 

To most, this probably seems like I’m being ungrateful for complaining about my achievements and my looks, but I feel as though ENTJ people would know more than anyone else what it’s like to be ahead of the pack with no one by their side. Most of the people I communicate with are friends from back home, as a lot of the other top students which I work with are simply like talking to brick walls outside of the classroom. Perhaps you guys could offer some insight as to how you might deal with being “lonely at the top”?"

This just fucking happened, and I am beyond sick and tired of this shit. I don’t know what to do or where to even start anymore. I don’t even know if this is the right subreddit for this but here goes anyway.

My dad woke me up at 2:00 AM, bitching and complaining about why one of my items on eBay had free shipping instead of paid shipping,(we share an eBay account because he does not trust me with PayPal and money despite me never having had history with money especially since he’s really good at it.) It was my mistake, which normally shouldn’t happen but eBay has this new confusing layout on mobile. My dad begins to rip into me about how I’m always lying how I can never find a job, and how he does not trust me at all, how “my attitude stinks”, and basically rips into me for a good 2 fucking hours. My mom, who is not like my dad and really hates the things he says  or does sometimes but goes along for the sake of keeping the peace between us, had to be woken up and get into this argument, and he outright calls us liers and how we are untrustworthy, we “spit in his face, never show him appreciation, never say thank you.” And how he’s basically done with his 10 year relationship with my mother, because of me and how my mom tolerated my bullshit for “10 years”. This is not true at all as me and my mom has always appreciated every single fucking thing he has done for us over the years, always say thank you, and always help out around the house in any way we fucking can. We always try our absolute best but it never feels fucking good enough for him. It’s beyond frustrating to appease a fucking person who honestly is not really a terrible person at all, but thinks so fucking highly of himself and that the world revolves around him. He’s helped me in many ways I can imagine from starting off financially, how to be a man, tools, looking proper, etc. 

He got upset at me because “ I can’t find a job, even though I’ve been looking for the past three weeks not only for a job for winter break but for an internship for the summer too, which isn’t all proving successful. Since it was holiday season that there has been fucking multiple parties and family gatherings that get in the way too that he specifically says we have to go to, and there are other things I have to do. like clean around the house, yard work, etc.

He pretty much berates my mother and I, and says that I’ll never amount to anything in life and I will always be a bum, and that I hold him back from being successful in life than he already is, and for that, he is cutting me off because he does not trust me and he does not want to be held back anymore. Because of this, my mom pretty much is getting cut off too from him, because in her eyes can’t function in the outside world just yet. In addition, my mom said that after this year, she won’t be helping me pay my tuition, for college, which means I have to figure out how to raise enough money for school relatively quickly.

I haven’t mentioned this but this guy, isn’t even my real dad, he’s my step dad, and he’s honestly treated me much better than my real dad could even dreamed, but for him to do this to me breaks my heart more because it makes me feel like exactly how he said I make everyone around me feel like, a “problem causing wreck.” I’ve been struggling with depression and every time I think something is getting better shit like this happens. I honestly don’t even know what’s going to happen after this or how me and my mom are going to survive. I haven’t seen her because she couldn’t sleep after being woken up to deal with this shit so she’s getting ready for work. I’m very sorry if this is too long or not appropriate but I really needed to get this off my chest and since I’m on mobile I used this to get it off. I’ll update and fix it after I get some rest."

*Uw Semi-wekelijkse overzicht van wat er gebeurde op RMTK*

##Actualiteit:  
-	**De Tweede Kamer spreekt: Kabinet graansmoothie-I mag blijven!**  
De Motie van Wantrouwen tegen Kabinet graansmoothie-I heeft het niet gehaald. Met 15 stemmen voor, 18 stemmen tegen, 1 stem onthouden en 1 afwezig Kamerlid is de motie verworpen.  
Opvallend aan het resultaat is wel dat coalitiepartner MBE intern sterk verdeeld was, en deels voor de MvW stemde, en daarmee voor het laten vallen van haar eigen Kabinet. Voor nu mag graansmoothie-I blijven zitten, maar de vraag is hoe stabiel ze nog in het zadel zitten.  



-	**D'18 houd haar wekelijkse bestuurswissel:**  
Vice-Partijvoorzitter van D'18, Streepje (/u/-___-_) is gestopt als Vice-Partijvoorzitter en als Fractievoorzitter. Als reden noemde hij problemen met een waterkoker, maar dat is volgens insiders een zwak en te vaak gebruikte smoes. /u/HiddeVdV96 (ook bekend als *Willem!*) zal Streepje opvolgen als Vice-Partijvoorzitter. De partij heeft nog geen plannen om een nieuwe Fractievoorzitter te benoemen.  


-	**Vice-Premier ontslagen vanwege inactiviteit:**  
Vice-Premier en Minister van Financiën &amp; Sociale Zaken, /u/Imperator_Pastollini (SP) is ontslagen vanwege zijn inactiviteit.  
Hij zal worden opgevolgd als Minister door Tweede Kamerlid /u/SimonScalary (MBE), Minister /u/JorenM van Onderwijs, Cultuur, Wetenschap en Sport (SP) zal de positie van Vice-Premier overnemen.  

##Activiteit Kabinet:
-	**Minister /u/Alfus van BuZa kondigt staatsbezoek naar Duitsland aan:**  
Minister /u/Alfus van Buitenlandse Zaken heeft in een persbericht een staatsbezoek aan Duitsland aangekondigd. Hij zal tijdens het staatsbezoek onder anderen op bezoek gaan bij de nieuwe Bondskanselier (/u/Eszix), zijn Duitse collega van Buitenlandse Zaken en het gesprek aangaan met de Duitse pers.  
  


-	**Rest van Kabinet houd zich stil, ondanks belofte tot meer activiteit:**  
Ondanks beloftes over vernieuwde actieviteit houden nog veel Ministers zich stil. Deels is dit natuurlijk te begrijpen, want Kerst en Oud en Nieuw zijn drukke tijden, maar toch kijkt onze redactie met opgetrokken wenkbrauwen naar de inactiviteit.

achlbk,55,2019-01-04,That time I got blown by a younger trainee on a business trip,gwcurioustaw,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/achlbk/that_time_i_got_blown_by_a_younger_trainee_on_a/,"Several years ago I was working with a relatively small investment company that owned and operated various franchises. They had everything from gyms to fast food restaurants in different cities across the country. As part of my job, they would frequently fly me out to newly built locations to help organize the launch operations. On one of the trips they had me helping them open up a new gym in a pretty big city.

Typically when I'd be on these trips I'd stay in a company owned apartment with whoever else from the company happened to be out there at the time. On this one... the CFO and CEO was out there as well (which kind of sucked because it was basically living with my bosses in the next room.)

Anyway, at the gym we were opening they were in the process of hiring all of the new employees. One of these new trainees was a 19 year old girl. She was a smokin' hot, petite, half latina. Maybe 5'1, super tight fit body, tan skin, incredible heart-shaped ass and amazing tits. Really cool personality too....one of those happy,  bubbly innocent girls that every guy wants to marry as soon as they meet them.

She'd wear the tiniest little spandex shorts to work that hugged her bubble butt perfectly...they could barely contain it. I would always catch every guy in the place staring at her as she walked by...including the CEO &amp; CFO. When we'd go out to the bar after we were done working they'd always talk about how hot she was and how much they wanted to fuck her (yea, once the drinks started with these guys any sort of professional filter came off).

Anyway, for some reason this girl was constantly flirty with me over the course of the 2 weeks I was there. I figured it was because I was the youngest of the corporate bosses, and she was trying to get on good terms. Whenever she talked to me she'd give me these ""fuck me"" eyes and a smile that drove me insane. She'd always giggle and grab my arm. She always made sure to walk right in front of me so I got a perfect view of her ass.  I wanted her badly, but I restrained from flirting back because I was technically her boss, and the execs wouldn't be cool with me doing anything with an employee...especially a young trainee. I think this just made her want me more. The day before I was set to go home she asked if I wanted to go out in the city with her. I hadn't really explored much, and my internship was almost over so I said yes. 

I didn't have a car in that city, so she came by the apartment to pick me up in hers. The execs saw her drive up to the house, and had a pretty astonished look on their face when I went out to meet her. 

She took me out to a bar. She had to use a fake ID to get in. We had a couple drinks and started getting pretty flirty and close. Eventually she asked if I wanted to dance and pulled me onto the dance floor. She was a great dancer...knew just how to move in all the right ways. After a few minutes dancing in front of me, she turned around and began grinding her perfect ass into my crotch. Within a minute I was rock hard, and I know she could feel it...She seemed to be loving it.  I grabbed her ass and pulled it in closer to my cock. As she gyrated against me, she leaned her head back, put her hand on my dick through my pants, and stated kissing me. We danced like that a while until I felt like I was going to explode.

Eventually I suggested it was time we left the bar. So we went back to the public parking garage where the car was parked. Pretty much as soon as we got inside we started making out pretty furiously in the front seat. After a few minutes she climbed on top of me, straddled me, and started rubbing my dick through my pants while grinding on my lap. As I began unbuttoning hers she started making the sexiest little noises. Like these adorable little moans. We only manage to get her jeans down to about her knees since it was too tight a space. She was wearing a tiny lace thong. I grabbed her bare ass and couldn’t let go it felt so amazing. I'd been dreaming about it for weeks. Then I took her shirt and bra off revealing her massive perky tits. They were almost gravity defying for how tiny of a frame she had. Soft, round, and perfect little nipples.

 I began rubbing her pussy through her thong and sucking on her tits as she rode my lap. Her sexy little moans got louder and louder. We were both super turned on to the point didn't even care that people walking by in the parking garage could see us pretty clearly in the car. I told her I wanted to fuck her so bad right now, and asked if she wanted my cock in her. She apologized, saying she wanted to fuck me too, but couldn't because she was on her period.  I looked her in the eyes and said “I want to suck my cock then”. Without saying anything else she smiled and locked eyes with me as she unbuttoned my pants, slid her hands into my boxers and took out my cock. I was throbbing, rock hard. I'm pretty big (about 8' x 6' for a visual), and her petite hand looked so tiny around my shaft...she couldn't even close her fingers all the way. 

Keeping hold of my cock she climbed into the other seat, leaned over and slid her mouth down around it. She could barely wrap her tiny mouth around the head. She gave an incredible blowjob. Her lips were soft. It started slow and innocent, then gradually ramped up sluttier and harder....keeping her sexy eyes locked onto me almost the entire time. She kept moaning and swearing and more with my cock in her mouth. The whole time I was rubbing her pussy through her panties...I could feel her clit was super engorged, and her thong was getting soaked. Before I could bust, she couldn't stop herself from crawling back over to my seat, straddling me, and grinding her pussy against my hard dick. She pushed it against her and slid herself up and down it while I sucked her tits.

I slowly moved my hand up towards her neck, which I could tell she was loving from the intensity OC her moans. I began lightly choking her with one hand, and grabbing her ass with the other while she eagerly rubbed her swollen clit up and down my shaft. She looked so sexy on top of me. I said “ I had no idea you were such a little slut. Do you like that cock.”  “Yes daddy, I love it” she dutifully replied. I could tell she wasn’t lying. Eventually I felt her legs tighten around me and she pushed into my cock harder...she moaned softly as she came.

She immediately went back to sucking me again. This time she was going at it furiously, taking me deep into her throat. Every once in a while taking a break to suck my balls. I was bucking my hips up and down. When I felt myself getting close, I grabbed her head and began face fucking her pretty hard. She was absolutely loving it. When I told her I was going to cum...she opened her mouth wide, put the head of my dick an inch or so from her mouth, looked up at me with the most innocent yet slutty look, pumped my cock with one hand and massaged my balls with the other. Prodding my throbbing head with her tongue. I exploded. I filled her mouth with a massive load, so much it dripped out onto her chin and tits. She kept eye contact as she swallowed, then licked it clean.

We caught our breath for a few minutes, got dressed and drove back to the apartment. My bosses were still up when I got back. They could see the big smile on my face and could immediately tell I hooked up with her. They tried asking me questions about it...I could tell they were super jealous...but I just smiled and shrugged. They were kind of assholes, and it made me feel pretty good making them jealous.

One of them said something douchey like ""You know you its against company policy to be doing anything inappropriate with the employees"". I just said ""Are you going to fire me?"" with a smirk on my face, and then went to bed. 

I never saw that girl again...but it was one of the most memorable blowjobs of my life."

I wasn't going to let my senior year in college rush by me. I needed to make the most of it, at least that's what all of my family and friends would tell me. Some might consider joining a club, going to more events, getting internship. I had more exciting things in mind. With my sights set on a celebrity (preferably, Hailee Steinfeld, but I'll include a list below of some favorites), I was ready to create my new slave. It may take awhile to finally meet her in person, but the end result will be worth it. 

So how would I change this famous, head-strong celebrity into a slave for my use? Needless to say, you can find almost anything on the internet. Without complete confidence in its ability, I get my hands on a drug that fosters an addiction to cum. Such an unhealthy and constant addiction is going to ruin her image and career, but also ensure I have a loving slave who will do anything for a single drop of my seed...

I'd love to play this out with someone. We can discuss more details when you reach out. I love the slow burn of someone changing and becoming a cum addicted slave. If you're interested, kik me at HelloMySlave

I am wondering if you could give me some advice. I want to pursue an international Fintech career. Currently I live in Amsterdam (im Dutch), and I have a BSc degree in Finance. I recently turned 25 years old and previously been working in a family global trading company, but I decided to go in my own direction, which I have more affinity for. For which I find Fintech most interesting (and good to start in a growing industry).

Since 1,5 years I have been very active in the cryptocurrency industry. I know a lot of crypto projects and the overall market very well. Currently I’m doing an internship for a startup that uses blockchain technology to tokenize assets. I learned a lot about regulation, privacy laws (GDPR) and KYC/AML here as well.

Furthermore have I been an active member of the biggest digital currency event in the Netherlands and visited many blockchain events worldwide. Within this event foundation I also did marketing &amp; sales work. Additionally, I have completed an online certificate about blockchain technology and I continue to update my knowledge with the latest developments. I am really excited about what security tokens, atomic swaps and the lightning network can offer the industry in the coming years. Especially applications of blockchain within supply chain, loans and assets have great potential in my opinion. 

I find FinTech banks as Monzo, Atom, Revolut and N26 very interesting applications and I think those challenger banks (and new competitors) will gain much marketshare compared to traditional banks. Revolut recently introduced cryptocurrency trading. That is why I applied for a job there. Unfortunately my application was denied. I think my motivational letter was strong, but I don’t got much big corporate work experience yet. And Revolut has a lot of applicants to choose from, just like the popular crypto companies.  

If someone knows a job or internship that you recommend or where you could introduce me, would be very much appreciated. I am willing to move pretty much anywhere in the world. As an EU citizen I can start working in EU countries without a visa.

What I can offer:

* Finance (good strategic and analytical view on financial reports, decent in Excel)
* Business Development (Sales is definitely my strongest skill)
* English (fluent), Dutch (native), Spanish (B1 and want to become fluent in 2-3 years)
* Experience with doing business internationally
* Start-up experience as well
* Detailed and driven worker. Willing to make 60 hour work weeks if necessary
* Up to date knowledge of the blockchain market 
* Wide network within blockchain and cryptocurrency (especially in the Netherlands) 

Thanks in advance!"

I have been trying to find work in the tech industry for a the last few months. I had a software development internship from February of 2018 - September 2018. I am not going to post my code anywhere here because I want to have some level of anonymity, but if you are curious. Some of it is original code that I have written for raspberry pis, and a few other things, code from classes, and code from tutorials. I usually state that I am using a tutorial with the link to the tutorial, or just state that you can find it at x website etc. I also have a lot of private code that I am keeping that way so no one can steal this because I am planning on releasing some of that commercially in the future; what good is code if it is open source and anyone can just come in and take your idea, and repackage it; please don't focus on this part. I am remembering one other thing might explain something later on I put 3 secret links in my website, two that take you to memes as a joke, and the last one is the soviet anthem because I thought it'd be funny to hide content on my website.    


So I have been out of work for a bit, and I get recommended to a team after some time, and meeting people. I start to go through their interview process, and the first interview I do very well at. The second interview comes, and I first get some OOP questions, and I get through that, and then I get some SQL questions, and some Javascript, and C# specific questions. Compare them to Java, blah blah blah. I get really good remarks back according to the recruiter. I get my interview scheduled for today pretty early in the morning, and it is a 40 minute drive away, so I prepared a lot for this. I have my dress shirt, tie, slacks all ready to go, and I am just about to eat a quick breakfast, and I get a call. Typically I don't pick up calls early morning because 99% of the time, it is someone trying to sell car insurance on a car I don't own, or telemarketers. I pick up this one, and the recruiter just mentions that they are sorry about this, but they found stuff in my code that doesn't align with their values. Is this the code I copied from tutorials, could it be that I am just not what they wanted out of a programmer e.g. my skill level is too low, is it the memes? I have no clue, but having a really tough 2018, and then 2019 to start this way. Idk; I am becoming disillusioned with life itself. Having an internship where they lie to you, before you ask I do not say this in interviews or anywhere because it's a easy way for people to just not hire you on the fact that you will talk shit at companies that have obviously predatory behaviors, and now this. I watch a lot of engineers who don't have a lot of experience, and just come out of bootcamps and get a job, but my experience in tech has been depressing to put it lightly. "

I love getting to create something that's a lot more hands-on than other programs, something I can touch and interact with.

I was speaking to my professor for the course for some advice, and one thing he told me is that a lot of companies who are hiring Jr. Developers look for people with +2-3 years experience. I'm not quite sure how I'm supposed to go about getting that experience without getting a job first. I currently have an internship, but it's not related to Android at all. My professor also spoke to learning how to use tons of different utilities like Dagger, Glide, etc and it all sounded pretty daunting.

What are some important steps for a soon-to-be graduate to get into an Android Developer position?

We have not been able to celebrate Christmas and Easter together since I left home for college for one reason or another: school, internship, they visiting the motherland etc. So, I decided that this is a good time for them to stay with me for a while. I went into quite apprehensive because vacations in the past have been nothing but stressful. I would take two weeks off from work, college or internships to visit them and try to get it all done in a whirlwind. It was awful.

However, this trip has been fantastic so far. I think the difference is that we all know that we have time to get things off the check list of 'things to do'. Dad is plenty busy doing things that don't interest me at all: gardening, cleaning things over and over again, watching Indian news etc. Mom is plenty busy with reading her religious books, talking to relatives, cooking food that I am not the biggest fan of etc. However, it is fine. They are doing their thing and have autonomy over it, while I am working on things that interest me and going to work. Sure, going out has gone down a bit. Sleeping in is not really happening. But, the benefit is that I am staying with my parents and it feels like a home. I feel quite lucky to have had this opportunity.

I have had my share of disagreements with them on long road trips this time around as well. But, this time around, we are both able to hear each other. Much of their anxieties are coming from the fact that they think of any non-desi people as the other. And, this time around, I am semi-forcing them to interact with my 'gora' friends and do 'gora' things like go and read in a coffee shop. It is amusing, sometimes; but, I think we are all gaining new experiences and perspectives out of their vacation.

Wholesome desi family time, y'all."

aclvx5,12,2019-01-04,Why is it so hard to let go of a 'relationship' with a person who never wanted to be with with me? (21f) (24m),ughjustwannaletgo,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aclvx5/why_is_it_so_hard_to_let_go_of_a_relationship/,"This story has three major players: Me (21f), ""Alex"" (23m), and ""Noah"" (24m).

So this story actually starts back in summer 2016. My ex boyfriend, Matt, left me for another girl. It absolutely destroyed me because he was my first everything and we'd gone through so much together (we're from a country that has two main ethnic/cultural groups and we had different first languages - I only spoke English while he spoke both English and his mother tongue; I got really upset because he only ever spoke his mother tongue around his friends even though they all
spoke English and they knew I didn't speak their language. Of course, I immediately downloaded Tinder and that's where I came across Alex (then 21M). He was in my country with his family for a week although he'd only be in my city for 2 days at the beginning and 2 days at the end. We met up both times and had an amazing time but we didn't get each other's contact info so we pretty much didn't speak at all after he left for the second time.

A few months later (Nov 2018), I met ""Noah"" on Tinder who was getting over a breakup with his girlfriend of seven years. It started off super casually because we were both rebounding from breakups but I started catching feelings for him by March and although he said that he wasn't ready to date then, he implied that he'd definitely want to date in the future. Like an idiot, I held on to that hope. Throughout spring and summer 2017, I thought we were building a relationship. I understood wanting to take things slow (looking back, I know how dumb it is to attempt to date someone who is months out of a LTR) but I got several ""hints"" that he saw me as girlfriend material. I met his friends, he met mine, he asked me to be his +1 for his work party although I couldn't make it, etc. But when I raised the question at the end of the summer, he ended up telling me that he didn't want to date me and had slept with someone else while on vacation. I stupidly decided to tell him that I didn't want to date either and we ""agreed"" to be FWB. Nothing changed after that though and he still invited me to meet his friends and even his parents so of course I thought that he'd change his mind eventually. I pretty much became his emotional tampon where he'd complain to me about how no girls ever wanted to date him and it LITERALLY made me want to scream. I eventually started seeing him less (we went from seeing each other 1-2x/week to 1x/month) because I was tired of him talking to other girls and all of my friends hated him (because I told them pretty much everything I've written so far). Despite this, I wasn't brave enough to fully end things although there was a period of about 1.5 months where I avoided him, although I'm pretty sure he didn't notice. I met him again right before Christmas 2017 and he invited me on a weekend trip with him and his sister. That got my hopes up that me pulling away had made Noah realize that he missed me.

In a shocking twist, Alex found me on facebook (also in December 2017) and told me he was going to be in town. So as I mentioned before, we didn't exchange contact info when we'd last met in summer 2016. However, we both have complicated/ethnic last names and we'd tried to guess how each other's name was spelled. I eventually told him the correct spelling and he told me the correct spelling and he'd remembered it for a year and a half. My jaw literally hit the floor when he told me that tbh it was such a movie moment. Anyway, he was in my city and we hooked up again; my roommates loved him and wondered why I was so hung up on Noah when Alex was so much better. Even so, I only had platonic feelings for Alex still. I thought he was super attractive, smart, kind, and generous, but he didn't give me butterflies the way Noah did. This time when he left though, we traded snapchats and added each other on facebook.

In January 2018, I went to hang out with Noah and he told me he'd met a girl. Actually, he'd known this girl for almost his entire life (parents were family friends) and apparently had always had a crush on her but he'd never acted on it because he'd been with his ex. Well apparently he met her again and confessed his feelings and she confessed hers as well and they went on a date. He pretty much told me that she was his dream girl in every way and that they'd gone hiking together even though he always made it clear that he'd never go hiking with me (it's one of my favourite activities and I'd asked him multiple times). It was so humiliating to be sitting in a restaurant across from the guy you've been pining over for a year while he pretty much says that one date with this girl was more significant than one year with you. After I went home, I pretty much unfollowed/unfriended him everywhere and ignored his texts. He eventually told me that things with his ""dream girl"" had fallen through because he was too clingy and pretty much scared her off. The funny thing is that he expected me to feel bad for him. I was still an idiot though and decided to re-add him on snapchat and facebook. During this time, I was also talking to Alex still but it was mostly just pictures of pets and memes. 

By the time winter semester ended, I felt like I really needed a break from my city so I decided to take an internship in another city about 2 hours away. I didn't tell Noah I was leaving for the summer and the next time we saw each other (June) he mentioned that he'd missed me. We saw each other sporadically in August and September although by this point I'd pretty much given up. He was initiating every text and hang-out because I guess I was just burned out but I never said no because he still made my heart flutter. The funny thing is that he always asked me why I don't text first; when we first met, I did!! In fact, I was the one who'd texted him first after our first date instead of just letting it end as an ONS. But ever since he told me about the other girl, I got super anxious any time I tried to text him first. I already have social anxiety but I'd start imagining that I'd text him and he'd just reply to tell me he had a gf or he wouldn't reply at all. As long as he was initiating the conversations, I felt like he was the one chasing me for once.
Last time we saw each other was in late October. We went to dinner and a movie and he stayed the night and it was super fun. We even had sex three times and it reminded me of when we first met. As he was leaving the next day, I jokingly said, ""Goodbye forever,"" as he was leaving and he looked kind of confused but kissed me on the forehead. After he left though, I started wondering *what if it actually was goodbye forever*? Could I actually cut Noah out of my life and start anew? We didn't talk for several weeks; he's send me silly pet pics on Snapchat but I'd never reply.

Again, I was maintaining my friendship with Alex. He'd actually started grad school so had moved coasts and was now a 10h drive/2h plane ride from me. Our conversation got a lot deeper by this point and I started to realize that he was one of my best friends (many of my other friends had graduated the prior Spring). When something silly happened in class, I knew that I'd send it to my best friend who's across the Atlantic, my sister, and Alex. Despite this, we kept things platonic and I never discussed my relationship with Noah him and I never talked about him with Noah. Alex had family friends living in my city so he decided to fly up and see them. We made plans to hang out the first night he was here. It's like Noah is clairvoyant or something because right after Alex and I made plans to hang out, he started blowing up my phone and snap and even asked if I wanted to go to a particular concert he'd promised to take me to two years ago. I honestly was just so tired at this point I just gave one word responses. In the lead up to Alex's arrival, I was so nervous, although I didn't know why. We hung out that day and it was amazing. The next day, we pretty much hung out until the late afternoon when he literally had to leave to study (he had three difficult exams coming up in the next week and I'm still an undergrad so I had exams coming up too). We were texting each other and I was joking about procrastinating studying and he told me to study so we could hang out the next day. We made plans to have dinner at this beautiful high end restaurant the next day and we were only supposed to see each other for a few hours.......

It's been over a month and I honestly still can't believe it. We've always had fun before (both sexually and as friends) but our dates usually involved binge-drinking in the way only a college student can. I used to literally feel physically BETTER the day after I'd drunk a lot but then I started getting older and suddenly I had my first hangover.  Ever since then, I've limited my drinking to about 4 drinks a night although I usually only hit 2. Since I wasn't drinking that much, Alex also wasn't drinking much, which meant that we were both pretty sober. Both nights were AMAZING. I swear, I have NEVER felt a connection with anyone the way I did with Alex. It's like if someone made a prototype of my ideal future husband. He's intelligent (in grad school at a top American school with ambitions of becoming a scientist), kindhearted, generous (he never lets me pay for anything- I had to sneak to the waiter to slip her my CC), understanding, compassionate, handsome, and he even has dimples aka my dynamite. I could tell that he was feeling it too - and it felt SO GOOD to finally not have to decode a guy's every text or glance. Saying goodbye to him the next day was so awful. I promised myself I'd never do long distance but I found myself wondering *what if*? This is the first guy since Noah I've had real feelings for and it honestly felt like one of those movie moments where the main character realizes that the girl he really loved all along was his best friend. Since then, Alex and I have talked nonstop. I'm flying to see him in a week so we can see where this is going.

Noah still texts me. I think he misses me more when I'm not into him, honestly. He asked me when I was coming home from break and got sad when I told him (it was a week and a half away). He's been sending me snaps of his dogs and how much they'll miss me and we went from exchanging maybe 10 texts in a month to 160+ in a week. We even have this tradition (I'm not going to get very specific because he's also a redditor) that we do every year after new years. Last year, he was super annoyed at having to do this tradition and made it clear that he was doing me a favour. This year, I texted him and told him that he didn't have to continue this tradition because I had no right to force him to do it. He replied that he actually didn't mind the tradition (even though his complaining about the tradition was what prompted me to tell him that). When I lie in bed at night, I think of all the ways I've gotten myself hurt by him. All the times I could have backed off and didn't and ended up crying while he didn't notice. And the thing is..... I can't really blame him. Should he have ended it with me when he realized that my feelings were a lot greater than his? Sure, but *I* was the one who was blind to the truth. He kept telling me, literally and figuratively, that he didn't want to be with me and somehow my mind twisted it into ""he doesn't want to be with me.... right now"". So I stayed, hoping that if I promised him threesomes and wingmanned for him and listened to him talk about other girls, he'd eventually realize that I was the girl he wanted. Except he's told me that I'm not, again and again. So now, even as I have feelings for someone else, why am I so reluctant to sever things? I literally have half a dozen Notes rants that I've made that discuss some of the hurtful things he's done. I can recognize that he's not good for me and yet I feel almost scared to really, truly be done. I honestly want him to break it off with me at this point so I don't have a choice. I'm not quite sure why I feel this way though and how to work through these feelings.  

TL;DR why is it so hard to let go of someone who's hurt me time and again"

[Post 2](https://reddit.app.link/grgKkB9ddT) (Sorry, I’m on mobile and the wrong link got copied at first)

UGH. Oh boy... Yeah, okay. I really hoped that my last post would be the end of this, but I can see now that was a foolish wish.

So the owner had AD call the dad to tell him that due to his wife’s accusations, they were no longer allowed to bring the child to the daycare. The dad was absolutely horrified that EM would say something like that to us, and echoed all of our thoughts that they wouldn’t bring their daughter if they thought she was being abused. He said he loved our center and that the child loved it, and would always point to it when they drove by and say, “That’s my school!” While EM had said that the kid always ate what she gave her at home, the dad said that wasn’t true, and that it was a struggle for them to get her to eat at home as well.

He insisted that we not say anything to the mom (she ended up being the one to pick the child up), and that he wanted to see what she would tell him when she got home and then tell her about the call. So EM showed up this morning and was much more pleasant, and will be allowed another chance, APPARENTLY. I’ve been told that if she does anything else, they’ll be out, but I’m 100% NOT okay with this, and have already begun looking for jobs in the local school districts for teacher’s assistants and paraprofessional positions.

The decision to give them another chance was AD’s, and when I talked to the owner last night, she also seemed uncomfortable with having them back due to the liability. But she’s not going to go back on what AD told the family, even though it’s her right to.

At this point, regardless of the overall good time I’ve had at this job, a lot of little things have been building that make me know it’s time to move on. I don’t feel like I’m valued. I don’t feel like my ideas are heard or my contributions are appreciated. I’ve asked for simple organizational things to be done (literally as easy as putting picture labels on toy bins so the kids can help us sort the toys instead of it always falling on the teachers) and every time I ask, I’m told that they’ll do it. Months go by and nothing. This situation is just the nail in the coffin, I’m afraid.

I’m a hard worker. I’m willing to work the shifts no one else wants. I’ve come in early. I’ve stayed late. I’ve gone in on my days off even when I wasn’t on call. But nothing is ever good enough. I’ve called in maybe twice since I’ve worked here, both times because I was throwing up and running 102 fevers, and I got lectured for it. I was 30 minutes late because they had always scheduled me for a certain time and then changed it suddenly without saying anything, and I got lectured for not paying close enough attention to the schedule. Now, I’m just tired of it.

So hopefully everyone enjoys this (hopefully) final update on this saga. I’ll for sure be writing up some other stories in the future, but not for a little while. This whole deal has been exhausting, and I don’t have the energy to tell any more of my adventures at the moment. Thank you everyone who has been following along the past 48 hours. It felt good to rant, and the support and validation was very encouraging.

**Edit:** So shit ended up blowing up. AD has been really rude and disrespectful to us lately, and it boiled over today. Constant nitpicking all day, and telling me to do something and then reprimanding me when I couldn’t read her mind that she wanted me to stop doing that thing and do something else. While I was on my lunch break, AD kept texting me, not listening to what I was saying, and I had to keep repeating myself. I finally told her that I wanted to finish my food so I could start applying to new jobs because I couldn’t take it anymore. She blew up at me, and I ended up having a breakdown/panic attack in my car. I almost left, but I didn’t want to fuck over the girl who came in the shift before me, because she’s also a hard worker who gets taken advantage of, and she would have had to stay until my shift was over to cover. She apparently spent the entire time I was gone talking shit about me to my coworkers, who at least know me well enough to know that if *I* had snapped, it was for a good reason.

I told all of my coworkers who were there what actually went down. We swapped notes on things AD has told us about each other and confirmed many lies/hyperboles (like, yesterday, on girl was visibly very sick and AD wouldn’t let her leave and told her that myself and the other girl who were there both woke up sick that morning and *we* weren’t complaining, which was total shit). I let all of them read the text exchange and they all agree that I am in the right. I informed the owner of my decision to search for new employment, and she asked what happened. I’m going to be writing out the issues I’ve had, as well as the issues my coworkers have had so that she knows exactly why she’s losing her last reliable full-time employee. I’m also taking everything I’ve ever bought with my own money, which is basically everything that makes the changing room even a little functional. I was always the one who did small repairs around the center. I touched up paint. They’re going to realize how much I did when I’m not there anymore.

One of my coworkers said that when I leave, she’ll leave. Another is probably going to quit soon because she’s starting her final semester internship. Another is about to start college and said that if I leave, she probably won’t stay much longer.

Hopefully this is the end of this mess."
acmgc3,2,2019-01-04,Feeling lost and can't really know if I[21M] should break up with my gf[20F],DownloadPow,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/acmgc3/feeling_lost_and_cant_really_know_if_i21m_should/,"Hey, it's probably going to be pretty long, sorry in advance, I'll try not to get lost.

I've been with my girlfriend for 6 months and a half now. We're madly in love with each other. We moved really fast. She partially moved in with me after 10 days, in my former 17m2 apartment with moist everywhere, 3 glass panels and a water faucet as a "" shower "", low light, 2 round electrical metal pieces as a kitchen, basically a shitty one room apartment in a shitty building. Living conditions were not good.

My girlfriend is the MOST stressed girl I've ever seen. She has social anxiety, she cries a lot ( a few times a week, she's hyper sensitive ), looks for approval from other people, not in a "" bitchy "" way ( posting photos on IG etc.. ), but more in a "" afraid of what people think of me "" way. She's stressed about her exams, if I or anyone else talk about exams, she starts overthinking it and starts crying and can potentially go in panic mode, hyperventilates, cries and looks for physical comfort. She's a really demonstrative person, she NEEDS to tell people she loves them, and she NEEDS to be told her relatives love her. She likes comfort, she likes her routine and gets stressed if she has to change her habits or go somewhere where she loses her bearings.

I'm the opposite. I don't give a damn about what people think of my looks, I like adventure, I like to travel, I like change, motorcycle, thrilling activities. I dropped out of university to start my business, it works really well, and I make a lot of money now. Also I like going to the gym, and gave up on that to spend time with her and to focus on my business, gained 15lbs.

About the "" I make a good living now"", it's important to know this because she's been criticising the way I spend and plan to spend my money. I finished my internship in September, started my business, survived with the little money I had until December ( spent my birthday and Christmas money on basically eating and paying for rent, bills and gas ). Got my first long term contract in late October, got paid a small pay-check in early December, that I spent on bringing my bank account balance above 0€, paying for food ( she paid for food until I got this contract, now I pay for most of what we buy ) and upgrading my apartment ( cost me 75% of my first pay-check ), I'm now in a 40m2 renovated apartment. So far all of my furniture was from my parents', because I've spent money on getting a better apartment for both of us ( I could have stayed in my previous apartment a month or two more to save up, but she couldn't take it anymore ).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the issues :

&amp;#x200B;

\- She argues wrong and gets mad for literally no reason at all. Whenever we start arguing, she completely shuts herself from me. Just today when I was at work, she asked me if I could drive her to her dad's place ( instead of taking the train ) because she has lice and doesn't want people to see her with the plastic thing around her head. I told her that I'll already have a 1h15 commute to come home, and driving her to her dad's would take me 1h30 more, while I'm exhausted ( because yesterday we stayed up until 3am because she was panicking and I had to comfort her, got up at 7am this morning ), but I eventually accepted after she insisted. I get home, and she tells me she saw a 550€ bed base + mattress, and asked me if I could pay for it, it can be paid in 3 times, and that she's ready to partly pay for it. I told her no way, there are 300€ bedbase + mattress package at IKEA, it's good enough and it's better than the 70€ broken sofa bed we're sleeping on, so nope. She shuts herself from me. I asked her what I said wrong, she doesn't answer, I insist, calmly first, and she says "" stop talking "", so I ironically answer "" well tell me whether I should shut up or not "", and she basically tells me to fuck off. She left my place 5min later to go to the train station without the plastic thing around her head, not a word, not a "" sorry "", not a "" I love you "" or anything. I should mention I'm always the one who comes back to her, even when she's clearly at fault. I'm not saying I'm not at fault this time, but there were other times when I had to come back while she clearly had been wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

\- She never apologies. My grandad was kind of racist, but was the kid-adult kind of man, always telling jokes, being the kid among his friends. He died 2 years before I was born, killed himself. When my gf was at my grandmom's with me and my family, before going to bed I showed her a picture of my grandad and told her I wish I had known him because apparently he was like me in a way, plus it's my grandad. She says, word for word "" Who cares ?! He was racist.. "". I told her I found that offending, impolite and disrespectful, and she didn't see what was wrong there, she didn't apologise or anything, literally nothing, we argued that night. Another day, she told me that she wishes I'll stop talking to my best friend in a few years, cause she's jealous. I thought she was joking, but she wasn't, she got mad when I told her that was NOT something to be said. Same, didn't see what was wrong with what she said. Other thing, this last Christmas was the very first time I could afford giving gifts to my family, so I did, and I prioritised them, especially my parents, because they've always financially been there for me. I knew what I was going to buy my gf, but I had not bought it yet. During a fight, she says she's mad that I prioritise my family instead of her, and complained that I had not bought her gifts yet..

&amp;#x200B;

\- She can't stand being criticised. Whenever we fight, I make sure to ALWAYS ask her to tell me what is/was wrong in my behavior. I literally asks her "" What did you think was wrong in my behavior and how I can change that "". She explains what she thinks was wrong, I don't always agree, but I do efforts on my end to keep me from doing these mistakes again. One day, I told her calmly what was wrong in her behavior, she disagreed, got mad and told me to stop saying that. I explained her that I don't know why she wouldn't hear what I think was wrong, and told her that she should accept criticism the same way I accept it. She said she can't handle criticism, and that she never will, and thinks she can't and shouldn't try to change that.

&amp;#x200B;

\- She thinks she should be my priority. On the 2000€ I got a month ago as my first paycheck, I spent 1200€ on the new apartment because SHE couldn't handle the previous one, 300€ in various things we had to buy for this new apartment, 200€ to stop being in the red, the rest on my bills, gas and our food. There was no money left, I'm using my christmas money to resist until I get a full paycheck in a few days. I could have saved 1200€ to be able to buy better gifts, to save money and to take her to the restaurant for our 6 month "" anniversary "", but she doesn't see that, and she thinks I'm not doing any efforts. I told her I'm planning to use my next paychecks to get my first motorcycle, to save up money in case my contract prematurely ends and to go see my uncle in Canada next summer while she's on vacation. She thinks I shouldn't, and I should instead plan our next ( and first ) trip in May. I'll be able to comfortably afford that, and I was planning on buying the tickets in March or something, but I don't like the way she tries to force me to think about her first.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this makes me feel our relationship is a one-way thing. Being in a stable relationship is one of my main long term goal, and sometimes I feel like I have this, but sometimes I don't, and feel like I should break up, and spend my evenings and free days travelling, going to the gym, working on my social skills, my hobbies etc..

What do you think I should do ? Sometimes I'm actually considering breaking up, but it would truly destroy her, and she's studying for her exams, I'm afraid she may either drop out of uni or completely fail her year, which would lead her to dropping out eventually, she has "" school phobia "", basically she's stressed when she thinks or is at school/uni. Plus she told me many times she'd kill herself and/or kill me if I broke up with her, I don't know if she was being serious, but honestly, it wouldn't really surprise me if she even threatened to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm truly sorry about my poor storytelling skills, I know it's a long read.

**TL;DR :** Girlfriend and I argue more often, she's being childish and doesn't know how to communicate, doesn't accept critics, and we both have very different goals in life, I'm wondering if this is actually going somewhere."
acmq7x,16,2019-01-04,We only hired you to keep your boyfriend happy,keephimdrunkandhappy,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/acmq7x/we_only_hired_you_to_keep_your_boyfriend_happy/,"I need some advice. I am a student working at a large University and experienced some blatant sexism an hour ago. I'm shaking with anger, and confused, and unsure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start at the beginning. I did an internship with this lab during last summer. After the internship ended, I started dating one of the head graduate students (call him ""Matt"") in the lab.

&amp;#x200B;

An outside company took a tour of the lab with Matt. The head of the company was looking to hire someone in the lab and wanted to use the resources available in the lab. The company is very specialized in ""X"", which I happened to do research on before. Matt realized the connection, and set up an interview with me and the company head. They decided they wanted to hire me through the University to do work for them, and we set up a contract with ""Jim"" being my supervisor. Jim was hired last year by the University after volunteering for a long time, and his job is to bring in more money into the lab and connect us with outside companies. Jim was not involved at all in hiring me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jim and I have known each other, mostly because Jim and Matt work together and are friendly. All three of us have gone out for drinks together and are friendly. Since I have started working for the lab, I have kept it professional with everyone and stopped going out for drinks. I didn't think it was appropriate to keep drinking with my now supervisor. Jim would invite me every now and then, and I would decline politely without citing a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I was working when Jim approached me to talk about my position. We had exchanged emails earlier talking about hiring someone to take my position so I could be a full-time student during the Spring Semester.  During this discussion, Jim said ""We made this position because of your relationship to a certain someone"" as well as ""We normally wouldn't hire you, but we did it because I like Matt and I want to keep him drunk and happy"". I was flabbergasted and unsure of what to say, so I returned the topic back to who to hire and who to train in. I wrote down these quotes right after so I could remember them correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel absolutely disgusted that he thinks I was hired only because I am dating Matt, and that my job was made in order to keep him happy. NO - I was hired because I'm good at ""X"" and I do a great job! Jim always receives complements from the company I work with about how good my work ethic is and how happy they are with the results.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do from here? Honestly, my thoughts are --- My work contract expired 12/31. I have thought about refusing to renew it and refusing to train someone into my position over the next 2 weeks. I have thought about telling the company about how Jim has treated me, and offering to work for them outside the University instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or am I overreacting? "

After this post I did a lot of job searching and pulled myself together. I made an appointment with an environmental career counselor, and he's going to recommend some affordable masters programs and help me get a three-year career plan together. He is actually IN permitting currently, and was impressed with my experience. So that was very validating. 

And a couple days ago, I was told I'm definitely being promoted to manager and given all-expenses paid move out to a new project in the spring. 

I still don't want to do this forever, but a new project, a sizable raise and a shiny new title certainly help with the existential dread and anxiety. 

Thanks again to everyone who responded! 

----

Lately it feels like I'm having an early life crisis. 

Where can I go from here? (Interested in regulatory, planning, and permitting) 

Any advice or feedback welcome

I have a BS in environmental studies and have been working as a ""coordinator"" for a large construction/engineering industrial sector company for three years. I am the primary field compliance representative. I handle all things environmental permit-related on a given project (I've been on two now). So everything from oil storage to stormwater to special/haz waste you might run into while building massive projects. I have problem-solving, management, communication, and high-pressure skills to spare, as well as knowledge of construction environmental regulations, or at the very least how to find them and understand them. 

I'm also very, very tired of the lifestyle. I have realized that I really don't want to move every 2-3 years at a whim to a new and far-flung plant town only to work 50-70 hours a week doing something that I am beginning to hate. The client my project is currently working for right now is increasing my burnout. But even on my last project I looked at my manager and thought 'I just don't want to be out in the field catching snakes, checking silt fence and educating workers about why we can't spill oil when I'm 30'. 

(I'm also concerned about staying with one company forever. Isn't that probably not so great in today's world?)

8 months ago the plan (in writing, in my annual review) from my corporate office was to bring me into HQ after this project and set me up helping the engineer that prepares our permits and does estimating, that kind of thing. There was talk of liasing with regulatory agencies as part of that. I was ecstatic. It would be somewhat of a pay cut (per diem, hours) but I would be working in planning and permitting, which is what I've always been most interested in. My internship was with a state agency. I would be living in an actual city. Perfect. 

Then all of a sudden, about 3 months ago, it was like none of that was ever uttered. The company was taking on several more large projects, and I've done so well with this difficult client they want to promote me to manager and send me to their currently most challenging project because they knew I could handle it. Lots of praise about my ability. Seems like a bad deal to me, though. The promotion is great, sure, but I REALLY do not want to get stuck in the field forever. I've agreed verbally, the plan is 6-9 months I'd go. But I've found myself feeling dread, and started looking for other jobs.

I want to transition into something more regulatory, planning and permitting. I'll go along with this for as long as I have to, but I'm trying to plan the next five years more clearly and I don't trust corporate to get me where I want to go. 

Can anyone recommend job titles I'd be looking for?

Or a wake up call? With my education and experience, is private planning and permitting even a realistic option? 

Do I need to go back to school? What degree? Would that even be worth it? 

Is my best bet in government work at the state or federal level? Will I have to start over?

I have my LinkedIn updated and my ""bat signal"" on but I usually just get recruited (3 times, so far) for EHS construction jobs- kind of the same thing I'm already doing. 

I'm overall just anxious and depressed about my career. Feels like I've painted myself into a corner and I'm doomed forever. I know that's dramatic, but the burnout is real. 

I've also identified an environmental career counselor and I'm planning to pay for a phone consultation. I figured posting here might help out before I go through with that. 

ANYTHING you would like to share would be very much appreciated.

TLDR; hating my field based construction career, is it possible for me to transition into a more planning and permitting type job, and any suggestions?

acnwr5,6,2019-01-04,Is it common for parents of gifted children to resent the fact that they are gifted ?,Papaya-Poupouyou,Gifted,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/acnwr5/is_it_common_for_parents_of_gifted_children_to/,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this. I'm hoping I can get insight from parents of gifted children or adults that were gifted growing up. (English isn't my first language btw, sorry if there are grammatical errors)

&amp;#x200B;

When we were kids, both me (now 22F) and my older brother (24M) saw a psychiatrist that said we were ""gifted"" (at around 7yo). This resulted in recommending skipping a grade for both. I skipped 3rd grade. My brother didn't want to skip a grade so he didn't. School went alright for both, with good grades and all.

The thing I want to ask about is my mother's view on this. I've recently started to add up a lot of comments she's made over the years that I feel like indicate that she doesn't like that we were gifted kids. Or just that we aren't ""normal"" I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I started thinking a lot about this this summer because of a specific incident. I had just gotten my MD (biology) and was looking for funding for my PhD, and I shared my struggles and anxiety about this with my mother. I also have a cousin that got a MD in biology but had to look for a job in another field because she couldn't find one in biology (although this was 15 years ago). This is relevant bc my mom thinks I won't find a job because of this. At the same time, my brother was struggling to find work (bad economy and niche field).

We were talking about this and my mom said ""I just was talking about it to \[aunt's name\], and I told her: its crazy, I have two gifted kids and neither of them is going to find a job!"" (while kind of laughing, but it's not just a joke, from what my brothers have said) (btw, he got a job and I found funding soon after)

Every so often she makes those kind of comments, like the ""My kids are smart, but..."" kind. I don't think I've heard her say this without the ""but.."" part nearly as much, if at all (though that might be selective memory because I find those comments hurtful).

Another comment she made at the end of my MD was that she ""didn't believe \[I\] actually worked hard"" after I just came back - practically burned out from stress and 6 months of stupidly long work days at my lab internship. This was a comment about me getting up late and spending too much time on my computer (therefore I must be lazy all of the time, not just when I'm on vacation). But when I confronted her about it being rude and hurtful, she said she didn't believe me because when I was in high school (so, 5 years ago), she thought I worked hard because I had good grades, but later on I told her I was just kind of going through the motions and doing minimal work. (like most high school kids do..)

 Idk i'm probably reaching too far with this one but it's like she's still mad that I didn't have to work very hard to get good grades. Highschool is not like getting a master degree or a PhD though, you can't get by not doing much at this point. I can get not liking the fact that we could get through while being lazy bc we were gifted but that was 5 years ago and I was a goddamn teenager..

&amp;#x200B;

The weird part is that she also makes these kind of comments about topics that are completely unrelated. For example, the other day we were talking about spas and massages and such, and I said I'm not a huge fan of massages bc I don't like being touched by people I don't know. She said (again, while laughing) ""Oh wow she doesn't like being touched, my kids are almost autistic!""

Neither of us have been diagnosed with autism. I don't even mind being touched, I'm just shy and don't like being touched by strangers. Presumably the ""autistic symptoms"" my brother has is that he is socially awkward.

I know there's nothing wrong with being on the spectrum, but it bothers me because it's not the first time she's made a comment like this (""joke"" about us being autistic) and to me it seems like she's looking for ways to pathologize us/our personnalities.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the most explicit ""proof"" I have is a very weird conversation I remember from a few years back. She described the fact that we were gifted kids as though it was a handicap. I didn't understand and made her elaborate and she said she heard that the fact that we were gifted came from some kind of ""malformation"" of the brain (used this word, precisely, which is why it stuck with me).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little bit scared of sounding petty in this post, getting angry at small comments, but I find myself increasingly pissed off because these are somewhat semi-regular and bc of the language she uses to describe me and my brother. Obviously these are the examples that I can clearly state bc they were striking to me, but they do underline a general attitude she has about us that I find disturbing. This honestly makes me feel like she's ashamed that I'm not ""normal"". Like there's something fundamentely wrong with me in her eyes.

I cannot tell for sure if I'm not just projecting insecurities or something but there has been enough comments now that I don't think I am (or at least that there's an underlying truth to my projecting).

&amp;#x200B;

I think at least part of it might come from the fact that my brother was severely bullied as a child. As a result he went through pretty bad depression, with suicidal ideation at its worst (in middle/high school). I also went through some bullying but it wasn't too bad (to put it simply, I was a nerd, he was a overweight nerd). Tbh I think the bullying made him socially awkward, not the nerdiness. This was regardless very hard for my mom to see my brother going through this, and I think she might associate that with the fact that we're ""different"".

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, she's a good mom. Apart from the occasional rude comment, she's caring and supportive. However I find myself slowly turning away from my family because I do hold resentment over this. I straight up don't want to spend time with my mom because sooner or later, she's just gonna make another comment like this. I WANT to spend more time with my family but I always end up leaving early or not coming at all because I'm getting angry at my mom. I know this hurts them, they were very sad to see me leave earlier than planned on my christmas vacation (like 1 or 2 days early after a week there).

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone gone through something similar ? Or known someone struggling with this ?

Am I projecting maybe ? Do the comments even seem weird to you and am I justified in being upset by this ? I know I could be overreacting. I do have some issues with self esteem about being ""weird"" and ""not normal"", that I know stem at least in part from being a gifted kid (adults and other kids do see and treat you differently, especially when you're the kid that skipped a grade, and that definitly affected me negatively at times)

&amp;#x200B;

tldr : My brother and I were ""gifted"" kids. My mother seems to think that this means there's something wrong with us/ like she's disapointed we're not ""normal"". This makes me feel like shit. I'd like to know if this is common or eventually if I'm just projecting/overreacting or whatnot. Sorry for the length of the post."

acob35,1,2019-01-04,"Thinking of transferring from my ""Junior Ivy"" to the real thing -- just got excellent news for my GPA.",cslac,CollegeTransfer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/acob35/thinking_of_transferring_from_my_junior_ivy_to/,"Hi /r/CollegeTransfer, I'm a freshman at a top-100 (top-50 on most lists) private 4-year University in New England. My high school was a very prestigious (always top-10, usually top-4) boarding school also in New England. My ACT was a 34 (one section point off from a 35), and my GPA climbed steadily throughout my 4 years from a 3.06 in freshman year to a 3.7/4.1 in senior year. I'm majoring in Computer Science.

My current college was one of my safeties -- I was denied or waitlisted from most of my prospective schools, and ended up choosing this one because I received a very generous scholarship/financial-aid package: almost-free tuition, but I have to pay boarding and food. It comes out to under $10,000/year; I will only consider transferring to a new school if I can get a similar or better financial deal.

Since my ACT is very high for my University's admissions, attended a super-competitive high school, and worked very hard on my essays, my old college counselor and I agreed that the reason for my rejection from many colleges was likely my very poor (B average with one C) freshman and sophomore year grades. Like I said, though, I improved significantly later on and even won the Advanced Computer Science award at graduation.

My first semester grades at University were very pleasantly surprising: taking 18 credits (normal is 16), and two higher-than-freshman-level courses, I managed to get straight-A's with a B+ in math: a **3.83** GPA. I was kind of a teacher's-pet in my writing course, so I'm confident that I can get at least one good recommendation, but I'm not sure where to find the other; hopefully I can get close with a Spring semester prof in the coming months.

My college extra-curriculars are virtually non-existent (just a member of Debate and a Work-Study job), but in my last two years of high school I used a scholarship to do two incredible research opportunities working directly with world-famous professors: this is my main ""*thing*"" that I feel makes me stand out to admissions officers.

The school I'm most interested in is Haverford College, which was my ED choice last year and I was denied outright. I'm also very interested in Stanford and Columbia, and my parents are pushing me to try my luck at Harvard (I'd love to go, but I don't think I'd get in). While I *am* a Computer Science major, I have very diverse interests and am not interested in technical/engineering schools.

What do you guys think my chances are at these schools? Is a great first-semester GPA enough to convince them that I can handle heavier workloads than previously thought?

**TL;DR:**

* I want to transfer from one of [these ""Little Ivies""](https://www.newsweek.com/americas-25-new-elite-ivies-108771) to Haverford College, Stanford, or Columbia.

* My freshman GPA at my college was a 3.83 taking two more credits than usual.

* I went to a *very* prestigious (top-5) boarding school where I worked my way from 3.06 Freshman year to a 3.7/4.1 Senior year -- it's my poor freshman year grades that likely lead me to be rejected from many of my favorite schools.

* I managed to, by emailing professors directly, snag two research ""internships"" in other countries working directly under very high-profile professors distinguished in their fields. These were in my junior and senior years of high school.

* In high school, I was a leader in the Debate team (one of the best in New England) and won the award for Computer Science.

* In college, my only extracurriculars are Debate and a Work-Study job.

* Over the past two years, I've worked as one of two employees to launch and raise money a highly-valued startup that will be releasing our product early this year, and I do freelance web design for multiple clients.

What are my chances at Haverford, Stanford, or Columbia?"

I'm a 21yr old male Belgian intern (software engineering), in NY from the end of Feb (\~25) until the beginning of June (\~10). I'm looking for a private (furnished) room  with a relatively short commute to midtown. Preferably in UWS / UES. My budget is around 1300-1400$. I'm housebroken and easygoing, love rock climbing and running after hours.

Definitely don't hesitate to contact me or PM if you have something that might fit. Thanks!"
acoe9j,6,2019-01-04,Need help deciding what internship is best for me,aerointernhelp,AerospaceEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/acoe9j/need_help_deciding_what_internship_is_best_for_me/,"Hi, I'm an aerospace engineering sophomore with two internship offers from two different worlds and branches of aerospace. I really need help choosing. The reason I'm stringing both along is one is a clearance required position, so I thought it'd be best to get  a backup in case the fed doesn't like me. So far, I've made it decently far in the process and haven't been knocked out, but that is subject to change at any point, especially considering my investigation just recently started. 

I'll list some benefits for each, but some external input would be very appreciated. Just for some reference, I'm an aerospace engineering major and I'm seeking a computer science minor. I'd love to work anywhere those skills intersect, which is usually systems, GNC, or other stuff along those lines. 

1. U.S. government satellite stuff

- I'm going through the clearance process to receive a TS/SCI clearance for this internship. 

- Places you very well in the fed government structure. You're already miles ahead of most other interns and you'll be even further ahead if you go full time. 

- Hyper cool work. So cool it's secret. I'm treating it like a once in a lifetime opportunity. A cool, no strings attached opportunity to peer into a world I most likely would not continue in (though I'm not opposed to it totally) because I'm not a fan of keeping everything secret. 

- Pay isn't horrible. It's about $21 an hour in the DC metro. 

- Will likely work on satellite systems, but I really can't say anything for sure. Won't know unless I clear. 

- The intern community is very small. I kind of like the idea of having a close set of people to work with. 

- They seem to really, really want me. I even think they've been giving me a bit of leeway in the security clearance process because of that, but that's just me speculating. But tiny hints such as being the only student to meet with an actual manager means that they want to grab me. 

2. Systems and software engineering

- I might one day want to transfer over to the CS world and not have anything to do with aerospace. I'm not certain, but it's an option I'd like to have. The software part of my job title makes me feel doing such a thing would be easier. 

- They're throwing more money and perks. Relocation, $26 an hour in a much less expensive area, free housing, a free college course, and the standard insurance stuff. 

- Probably very practical skills will be taught that I can transfer anywhere. I can also talk about whatever I did without fear of getting nabbed for leaking classified info. Might help me acquire a future pure CS opportunity or another opportunity in aerospace systems. 

- They offer a lot of interns part-time remote work after interning. That's pretty sweet. Kind of drooling about making cash at the same pay all from the comfort of my campus apartment. 

- They treat their interns extremely well. 

- No uncertainty of the clearance. I'm already set to work there. 


Thanks so much! Please let me know if you have any questions. I know it's a bit of a read, so thanks for bearing with me haha."
acol4k,3,2019-01-04,Career and life troubles after recovering,rude_jellyfish,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/acol4k/career_and_life_troubles_after_recovering/,"Hello. I'm actually new to Reddit, and I stumbled upon the INFP thread and found out that I could relate to alot of what is said in here. I'm 28 years old with a BA in psychology and art, and I don't know what to do with my life (an infp problem?). I suffered from severe depression and anxiety in college, had 2 mental break downs which ended up in suicide attempts. I worked as a behavior therapist for a while and found the job to be too much for me that I ended up leaving multiple behavioral therapy companies. I also worked in social services as a parent education/independent living specialist and found the environment to be very overstimulated at times. I worked inhome for that position and that was too much for me. I'm trying to figure out my life, and I'm scared. It's frustrated and stressful. I finally decided to take therapy seriousy and take medication. I've been stable for a year in a half, and I feel so much better. Learning coping skills really helped. I'm proud of my recovery and how far I've come. Currently, I'm working in retail and was recently hired at a childcare facility. I'm financially stressed, and due to my employment history and gaps I don't think I can find a fulltime job. I help out my family with bills and help my siblings with school and financial matters. I'm handling it well, but I don't want to stay in retail forever. Im starting an internship with a nonprofit as a development associate, working with grants, fundraising, outreach. I'd like to use this experience to find a fulltime job eventually, so I can finally save money for grad school and other matters.

The problem is that I don't know what I would like to do as a career. Right now I'm mainly focused on getting a fulltime job in a nonprofit working in grant writing, so some of the financial stress can slowly go away. I'm kind of hesitant to go back into mental health and social services because i feel like it's too much for me.

I really like working with people, and I really like writing. 

I'd like to know if anyone has any suggestions. :D"
acooeq,8,2019-01-04,[practice] Advice for my GF,BigBlanket,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/acooeq/practice_advice_for_my_gf/,"So my girlfriend is a recent college graduate from UC Berkeley. She had really good grades (3.8 gpa), internships, awards, and glowing recommendations from her professors and previous bosses. After graduating, she landed another unpaid internship that came with the promise of hiring her if things went well.

Fast forward 3 months, and they just offered to put her on full-time and paid. Hurray right? Well, here’s where the advice is needed. They offered her 13.50 dollars per hour. Personally, I think that’s much too low, especially given that she live in Southern California. However, it’s her first paid job, so she’s really unfamiliar in terms of what’s a normal wage.

So, with all of the being said, can anyone tell me if this company is screwing her? It is a smaller company, but they have her doing actual architect work (not just an autocad drafter) where she’s visiting sites, making plans, working with teams on multi-million dollar designs, etc. Any advice is welcome, thank you!!"

I’m starting an internship next week and I’m looking at a 40 minute commute one way, and 200 mile drive every other weekend or so, so something that doesn’t sit at 4K RPM doing 80 would be great. Backseats would also be nice (for insurance and hauling people every now and then).

Mainly looking to upgrade to something a bit more practical but still fun to drive and won’t dick me down on insurance (350Z/370z are definitely out) or repairs.

I can drop around 8k at the moment, but I’m not in too much of a hurry to buy something right now, and that number will go up.

As of right now a G35 coupe is at the top of my list. Haven’t had the chance to drive one yet, but  it seems to check all of the boxes for me. I’ve heard that the clutch on them isn’t the best though. I’ve also been looking into BRZ/FRS/86, but those seem to be a bit out of my price range right now.

Anyone have any recommendations?"
acpnhi,1,2019-01-04,[M4A] Cum-Addicted College Girl,Samsy1029,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/acpnhi/m4a_cumaddicted_college_girl/,"I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+

I wasn't going to let my senior year in college rush by me. I needed to make the most of it, at least that's what all of my family and friends would tell me. Some might consider joining a club, going to more events, getting internship. I had more exciting things in mind. With my sights set on a female friend of mine, I was ready to create my new slave. She had a bright future ahead of her, always studying and ensuring she would have the best opportunities when she graduated. 

So how would I change this dedicated college girl into a slave for my use? Needless to say, you can find almost anything on the internet. Without complete confidence in its ability, I get my hands on a drug that fosters an addiction to cum. Such an unhealthy and constant addiction is going to ruin my friend's future, but also ensure I have a loving slave who will do anything for a single drop of my seed. In addition to this addiction, her mental capacity may be affected as well. What better combination than a cum-addicted bimbo...

I'd love to play this out with someone! You'd be playing as a female character that I have references for, and we can discuss more details when you reach out. I love the slow burn of someone changing and becoming a cum addicted slave. If you're interested, kik me at HelloMySlave

P.S. if you wanted to do a celebrity variant of this plot, I'm completely okay with that. Just include that in your first message if you do!"

acpqwa,89,2019-01-04,"I'm enjoying my break, but I can't wait to smoke again!",FaceofaLion,Petioles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petioles/comments/acpqwa/im_enjoying_my_break_but_i_cant_wait_to_smoke/,"I'm 17 days into my break from weed, and I've noticed a lot of great benefits. Before taking my break I had been smoking every night with the occasional daily sesh when going out hiking or hanging with friends (this lasted for about 5 months, before that I was smoking 3-5 times per week). I felt comfortable in my habit, and was mainly driven to a T-break as I am pursuing internships. There have been a lot of great benefits that I wasn't expecting! I realized that weed was having an impact on my ability to dream, I've been filling the time I used to use to get high to be more productive and write more code on my own time, and I've had a more regular appetite during the day. That being said, my break has also helped me realize the benefits weed has on my life. It's ability to relieve my anxiety, make mundane activities more exciting, and enhance social settings are great! I love smoking with my friends, alone, and with my girlfriend. Not smoking weed has made me appreciate and respect how great it can be in moderation. A lot of the posts on this subreddit are about the negative impacts of weed, but my break has made me realize just how great weed can be in a healthy setting. I can't wait to be able to smoke again in a healthy and responsible way!"
acprs8,0,2019-01-04,2.5 uGPA. Undiagnosed ADHD. Where do I go from here?,casa_laverne,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/acprs8/25_ugpa_undiagnosed_adhd_where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I graduated with a BS in business admin in 2015 from BU. I scraped my way out of there due to uncontrolled depression and anxiety that was exacerbated by undiagnosed ADHD, which I got diagnosed last year and my whole life has changed. 

I’ve been unable to hold down a job long term for the past few years, in a very privileged way because I’m surviving pretty easily. My degree is in HR, but I couldn’t get hired after internships (I talked to all my managers and it was not due to my work, just no open positions).  I’ve done a series of temp jobs that have all ended.

The business degree was a huge mistake. I’m not great with numbers at all and *i didn’t get along with my classmates at all. I would have struggled even with my ADHD under control. 

So basically I feel like I wasted $200k and 7 years of my life. 


Now I’m 26 and my whole life is turning around!

My ADHD is under control, I had surgery to get me more oxygen at night that has helped me control my depression and anxiety (weird, I know). I’m working for my parents’ very successful company doing a ~real job~ (it sounds fake, I know, but it’s a job I’m qualified for with my degree and a position they’d have to fill otherwise). It’s been a long, slow, painful process, but I’m finally growing up and regaining the confidence that I can excel in school again like I used to. I’m taking  marketing classes related to my job at BU and doing very well. 

Law school will be a good fit for me, I’m soon seeking direct experience to make sure I’ll enjoy practicing, and it’s something I think I want, not a ‘nothing better to do.’ I excel at standardized tests and I’ve been practicing the logic games for fun for over a year. I want to work in the non-profit sector and do something service based. Also, i have no debt and a lot of patience. 

Where do I go from here? For future school and for life in general. What steps can I take that will show on my application that my life is on an upward trajectory?


Thanks so much for reading, seriously. I know I sound like a spoiled brat because of the privilege I have and it’s something I’m very insecure about.

acpume,21,2019-01-04,I (21F) am choosing my career over my SO (25M). How do I find peace with my decision?,makennawenna,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/acpume/i_21f_am_choosing_my_career_over_my_so_25m_how_do/,"TL;DR: Got my dream job across the country which means leaving a loving BF and two dogs. I know this is what's best, but I am terrified. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, and have lived together for most of that time. It's been an incredibly supportive and happy relationship and we even adopted two dogs together. At the beginning of our relationship we promised each other that if one of us got an opportunity far away, we would have to support each other. I always assumed it would be him, not me.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year, I moved across the country for an internship in Washington DC. It was a fantastic four months, and when I got home I knew I wanted to go back longer-term. However, I knew this would mean the end of our relationship. Until this point we had planned on moving back to his home state together, but after the internship experience I knew that plan wasn't for me anymore. A couple of months ago, I got an opportunity to move back to DC and work in congress (my dream) and I have decided to choose my career over our loving life together.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am making the right decision, but as I only have a few days left before I leave, I am filled with emotions and have started second guessing myself. I should be happy and eager, but all I can think about is what I am leaving behind. If there's anyone who's been in a similar situation, how did you cope? How do I come to peace with my decision knowing I am only trying to better myself? Thankfully, my SO is happy for me but I can't get over how much I am going to miss him. I am terrified that I am making a mistake, even though I know this is what's best for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on leaving a long-term relationship and how to be happy with where my life is taking me would be greatly appreciated."
acqqub,7,2019-01-04,Getting started,Ioncell08,computerforensics,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/acqqub/getting_started/,"Hello, 
I’m a junior in college studying cyber security but I have a concentration in networking forensics intrusion investigations. I wanted to know any tips for applying to internships and tips for applying to jobs after I graduate. As of right now, I really would like to do something in law enforcement, but I’m not sure how to get started and I want to know a little more about what it’s like working in law enforcement doing computer forensics. All I’ve heard is stuff from my professors and alumni the professors have come in and speak to us.

Little background:

Comm. Col Freshman @NoVA doing GAA to transfer to School of Engineering (Comp Sci)

We’re the classes harder as expected when you go to higher institutions or were they unimaginably hard and you were not prepared at all through NoVA?


Is it easy to get settled at tech as junior?

Will it be harder to land internships junior year due to history?

Thanks. 


I’m looking at tech and UVa as options. UVa sounded good until I heard of Tech’.s impressive r/d and internship opportunities 


Thanks. "
acrj6g,5,2019-01-05,First anxiety attack,Airam13,pornfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/acrj6g/first_anxiety_attack/,"I have been in the journey for 4 days now and fully commited, is the night of the fourth day and I am under my first anxiety attack, I know I will not relapse but my mind is strugling right now, I am listening to music to divert my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy because next week I will start doing an internship and every day after that I will go to the gym, so, most of my day I will be really bussy since I will be home just for dinning, taking a shower and sleeping which will keep me away from thinking stuff and messing with my mind.

this post is just to divert my mind but if you have any advice it is much appreciated!

stay strong everyone!!"
acsdx7,1,2019-01-05,Am I a really a weak man?,Jun_Artist,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/acsdx7/am_i_a_really_a_weak_man/,"first sorry for my bad English, as It's not my native langugae.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got dumped by my LDR gf who said, I 'm just a weak and I make her weak.

&amp;#x200B;

And now I think I have let her define who I am too much for all this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I really loved her, so I opened my heart. Even Sometimes Let myself vulnerable to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am questioning that I am really weak.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time, when I see the things I feel not right or, some disputes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to communicate with her, yet she told me that 'don't bring up the problems to me, I already have bunch of problems that I am dealing with myself, you are such a weak, be strong' 

or 'Don't drain my energy to talk about just small things, relationship is for a happiness not for working on'.

&amp;#x200B;

So I tried to solve my worries and feeling as she told me 

and telling myself that 'it's my problem that I have to deal with all by myself, it's just my emotions'.

&amp;#x200B;

I justify myself that, yeah I need to support her, I can't make her life complicated with my worries. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even one time, while we are apart, I made a female friend from Russia who is same nationality as my ex GF is.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my ex honestly that we just hung out together as a friend, and she raged at me that she wanted me to stop

being friend with her. For me, I prioritize my girl over than anyone, so I shut the all contact with her. as my ex wanted me not even text with her. ( not all actually but just in terms of not being rude, occasional message from female friend like how are you? or shall we hang out?, I replied that 'sorry I am preparing for exam, maybe next time.)

&amp;#x200B;

In summer time, while we spent our time together, she found out that text log with russian friend and insisted me to see the all the chat. Yeah, I wasn't hiding anything, so let her do whatever she wants. I expected that she believes me as I show her everything without any hesitation, then she raged and cried that My neutral reply may implies her think that I am not happy with my ex. So I had to apologize and tried to make ex calm down.

&amp;#x200B;

I flew over 7000km 4 times in last year all by myself.  even just to see her for only 4 days as a surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to send her flower through delivery services time to time and surprise her with present, chocolate and flowers when I visit her.

&amp;#x200B;

The funny thing is that,

&amp;#x200B;

when we were together, she has a impulsive anger or short temper on me sometimes and said sorry right after.

even on the call while we are apart, she just ended in all sudden when she pissed off. As she told me that she know it's the problem, and wanted to fix it, so she wanted my support for understanding and improving it.

So I kept myself patient and calm, whenever she loses her temper and rages over me or blames me for small things.

Because I believed her that she will fix it and she doesn't do it on purpose on me.

all the time ex told me it inherits from her father who is such a fire as well.

&amp;#x200B;

At some time, I found a one guy keeping asking her out over text my ex last Oct, and I told her I felt uncomfortable that you reply him, so I just want you to be clear with him and shutting the contact. I thought she would do same thing as I did for her.

But she told me, I just don't want to be rude to people, and you need to believe me more. Then I asked her if I can see her messages, she refused. And we fought.

&amp;#x200B;

While we are away, when she wants to vent over me for her sad day or things harsh for her, I supported her.

I took all of her complains and crying as I just love her.  Sometimes even at 4am while I am sleeping.

I told her that everything will fine, I will always be the one who will stand till the very last for you. I listened her story carefully and did my best to support her. 

In her down time, and I would try my best to be with her, She told me she loved me so much and I am such a strong.

&amp;#x200B;

But all this time, I just felt somewhat empty. I started to feel unfair, and my efforts and love are not met. So one day, I started to complain that she takes me for granted. And that lit the fire and we argued. She told me that 

I am such a child and wanting her energy and attention all the time. I only drain energy out from her. She feels like She is my mother. Wow, I did't say it every day. I just claimed that I just need more care from her.

Again, she said I am just a weak, and she is much more stronger than me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I said sorry to her that I said not good words during her internship period.

&amp;#x200B;

after few visiting, everything goes as usual. I did all her favor, I didn't ask anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just felt like a crap, and sent her message that, I don't know if she loves me or not, I deserve better.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, she was blaming everything, I am just emotionally weak and not a strong  guy. just a weak man.

&amp;#x200B;

Told me She doesn't love me anymore and kick me out from her life in 2 days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As I question seriously myself, 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I really weak man?

&amp;#x200B;

I think I just let her rule over me too easily.

Lowering my guard too much that I slowly get lost who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway thanks for read.

Now back to my work. (Web Dev)

acsvtu,5,2019-01-05,I want to ask for a raise and need help,Phasko,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/acsvtu/i_want_to_ask_for_a_raise_and_need_help/,"Hi Reddit,

I've been working for a company for the past 1.5 years under a temporary contract. The contract doesn't reflect my duties within the company very well, and the company has since then hired other people with the same job description but a smaller amount of responsibilities. I've worked for this company before, and did a year-long paid internship. I'm looking for help in deciding what I should ask for in regards to a new job description with a new salary.

My contract states me as a junior, with no responsibilities other than following orders of senior members and accepting help to improve my skills related to my title.

In reality, I have been testing, hiring and training both interns and juniors. I am streamlining the workflow, working with other team leads to alleviate pressure from various departments. I also spend a lot of my time working on planning and management of resources. I research new techniques and technologies both inside and outside of work. In the last year, the quality has been improved, and the output is now consistently 300% of what it was. I've done unpaid overtime at an average of two hours per day.

My responsibilities now extend to planning of output, communication with the rest of the company, hiring and training of new employees, improving workflow for my team and leading the team in improving output and quality. I also check all work made by everyone before it's sent out, and catch (most) problems before they become a problem.

I'm 24, have 4 years of experience in the industry, and 2.5 years (combined with internship) at the employer I currently work at.

I'm currently making 2200 euro (2500 dollar) per month in gross, 1900 euro (2100 dollar) in net. This translates to 26.400 euro (30.000 dollar) per year. This is for a junior position. Overtime is not paid, I am not eligible for bonuses or profit sharing.

Interns usually work about 3 months in a temporary contract to bridge the gap between their internships and they get paid the same.

Regular position gets a raise of 25% as a starting position, with the added benefit of tuning into the profit share of the company, and being eligible for bonuses.
The average bonus is about a month salary or more, profit sharing wildly varies, but I do know there was one around 6k at some point.

The pay for a regular position in the my company is  33.000 euro (37.605 dollar) per year.

On average, the pay for a regular position in the US is  47.386 euro (54.182 dollar) per year.

My job is in a capital city, apartments are all 1000 and up. They demand you make more than 3-4x the rent, so I can't afford to live there. Living where I live now means o have to travel for three hours  every day, my girlfriend has  to travel 4-5 hours every day. The prices and sizes are very similar to Los Angeles, if you want to compare.

I want to ask my employer for a new job description, which should have all my responsibilities in there, but I don't know how much money i should ask for.

I think I should get paid more than the regular position (if I have added responsibilities). I think it would be fair to start the bidding at 50.000 (and work down to 40) but I'm afraid I'll scare them off and they won't give me a permanent position. 

I'm also unsure how to phrase this, I've never asked for a pay raise or a change in contract conditions.

Can someone give me some advice?

The ending got me tearing up and all the characters were wonderful and I honestly don't know if a Persona 6 could top P5.

One thing I am a little salty about is the fact the Acheki just like died???? I really thought he was gonna come back and be redeemed but nope, dude just died. I also really wish we had a bit more time in the game but that is the flaw with all Persona games. They don't last forever :&lt;&lt;&lt; "

&amp;#x200B;

I will be obtaining my MBA next fall at Duke - Fuqua and looking to complete a pre-MBA internship before the start of school. My work experience so far have been in consulting, corporate strategy for a tech startup, currently in tech product management.

&amp;#x200B;

I completed a final round interview for a boutique private equity firm and there is a solid chance I will have an internship offer. My goal is to break into venture capital (yes, i know it will be difficult with my work experience), and I do have a few coffee chats with VC firms lined up (but nothing too serious on the internship side, will try to network my way in).

&amp;#x200B;

Question is, how does venture capital firms view private equity? Will taking this internship improve chances for VC? If I am offered the PE position, would it be dumb to turn it down in hopes of landing a VC internship?

I am wondering if y’all have any thoughts on applying for Harvard Law School via their Junior Deferral Program, for which I’d apply during the spring of my junior year. A few things to consider:

- I’m a current sophomore at Harvard College with a 3.67 GPA (although it’s trending  upwards since I got hit by two completely avoidable B-‘s my freshman spring). The longer I wait to apply to HLS, the higher I‘ll be able to get the GPA on my transcript. By the time I’d apply next year, it’d be a reasonably safe bet to say that my GPA would be upwards of 3.8
- I’m a URM (Hispanic/Native)
- I haven’t done any legal internships over the summer yet, but I’m trying to apply for a bunch right now in the human rights area 

What do you guys think? Would it be worth taking the LSAT so early (like sometime junior fall) and then keeping the scores so that I can easily re-apply my senior year if things fall through? Would it be worth it with my relatively low GPA going in? "

One thing that has been irking me is finding a place to live. Many places in Rochester either don't offer 3 month leases, or are simply way too expensive to justify it.

I've looked over many Apartments.com listings and have found a few places, although not many of them really fit my needs.

I would be looking for a place that has a maximum rent of $1000 a month. I would need a 1 bedroom / 1 bathroom place, although if need be I could possibly try to find a roommate. I don't have any other requests; all locations, sizes, amenities are fine by me. 

Any anyone could point me to some properties or ""hidden gems"" that would be fantastic."

acy2uf,13,2019-01-05,How I got here...,DasEFFEXOR,EffexorSuccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/EffexorSuccess/comments/acy2uf/how_i_got_here/,"This is a crosspost from something I did some time ago on another platform. It's been slightly edited... some names and personal details have been removed. I op under a pseudo-account. I think that legitimate and fair to do (also, this platform makes that pretty easy).  Keep in mind that this was written in the past as you read it. I've been treating what I describe below for quite some time. The thing that really helped was therapy, a support system, and Effexor. Hence this post...

**Mental Health Awareness Month**

It’s Mental Health Awareness Month! May has been Mental Health Awareness Month since 1949. I had no idea.  I bet many of you didn’t either. That’s OK. It’s also the reason for this post. 

Talking about mental health can be awkward, and intimidating, and just plain hard. You may live with someone who struggles, or you have a friend, or perhaps a child that does. Or, maybe, that person is you. Mental health can be a taboo subject. It’s deeply personal. I get it. 

We might be afraid of disappointing the people who love us, or we’re worried that we’ll be written off as “dramatic” or “not tough enough.” But here’s the thing, most mental illnesses are treatable health conditions. They’ve always been common, but just as often ignored. However, they are very widely acknowledged and to a high degree (at least by professionals) recognized in the world today. They can affect anyone, regardless of age, race, religion, or income. It might be depression, anxiety, autism, borderline personality, bipolar, dissociative, obsessive-compulsive, PTSD, eating disorders, dyslexia, schizophrenia, or something else (not intentionally leaving anything out – just covering some of the more well-known). That said, many people are still afraid to talk about them due to shame, misunderstanding, negative attitudes, and fear of discrimination. I’m in the same boat. Ignoring it is not a long-term strategy though. Acknowledging what is… is the first step.  

I get it. I’m one of those people. I’m going to be extremely candid about it.

I’ve seldom talked about it but to a select few (thank you to those people, you’ve helped me get here). Here’s the deal, I’ve been suffering from extreme depression and anxiety for 6+ months now (probably MUCH longer but my life has had \*so much good\* lately that I was probably ignoring that it was there). It’s likely that’s always been a coping mechanism: focus on the good and squash the rest. If I’m high functioning, then awesome. It still impacts me and there are certainly those who aren’t high functioning or who do not have support structures to enable them to be. 

Just to get it out there, because it is, rightfully so, a go-to for many: I’ve never considered hurting myself in any way. I DO get how people can arrive there though.  If you’re in that place, please seek help. You can reach out to me…but I’m NOT an expert. I’ll certainly listen but I would suggest that if you want to talk to someone or are experiencing suicidal thoughts, text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. 

Because I’m a guy, and I experience life that way, I must point out that it’s very common for men to ignore this type of thing. 

*I did*. 

It's not about protecting masculinity and upholding some male-centric mantle though. Admitting you have something going on is not the end of the world; \*dying\*, because you didn’t admit you have a problem, is the end of the world. If it helps, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, Michael Phelps, Kevin Love, Brandon Marshall, former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, comedian and TV host Wayne Brady, musician Pete Wentz, the rapper Logic, and Prince Harry all share one thing in common. It’s not their fame… it’s that they have talked publicly about their mental health struggles.  These guys are paragons of masculinity (OK maybe not Prince but dayum if he didn’t straddle some line that most of us would have liked to at least be able to see I dunno who did). They also wrestle with anxiety, depression, or some other mental illness. It’s OK if you do too. I know I do. 

If I’m being honest, my stuff could all reach back to my childhood. Maybe. I don’t know. Nor do I know if it matters; certainly not in the short term. Addressing the genesis is something I personally would like to (attempt) to get to the bottom of but I don’t think it’s really of much concern. Certainly, it’s not the concern a when you’re in the midst of dealing with it. 

Here’s the thing… nearly a third of men have experienced a period of depression in their lifetimes. WOMEN experience depression at roughly *TWICE* the rate of men. If it’s NOT you then it’s somebody you know. The important thing is to get help when you need it, even if it’s sometimes hard to find (this was certainly my case). If your parent, caregiver, or friends aren’t able or willing to support you in that process, don’t give up. Someone out there is willing to listen and help. 

My story… I recall, what could in hindsight, be my first panic attack in the 5th grade. I’d always been a really good student. I was, by all definitions, a “good kid.” But 5th grade, I had a VERY difficult teacher, and was in the unruly class (which they probably gave him because he was able to handle it). I got my first ever D in that class. I remember hyperventilating. At some point, I had chest pains. At one point I had a vein on my right collarbone literally pop out… literally… if it was grazed blood would gush down my chest and soak my shirt. I would cup my arm at my torso in a vain attempt to catch it. It never worked.

I was taken to Children’s Hospital. I had all manner of tests done on me. In the end, they decided I had a mitral valve prolapse. They would check me once per year and I had to take antibiotics before seeing the dentist. As an adult, I’ve seen cardiologists’ multiple times, over multiple years. I do NOT have a mitral (or aortic) valve prolapse. I think I was fucking freaked out. I didn’t know how to deal… and that manifested physically. Maybe the tech to detect it has gotten better?! I don’t know. But that likely skewed how I viewed things as a young man. There wasn’t anything wrong in my head… it was OBVIOUSLY physical. I *had* tests. They would parade interns to all listen to the “very good click” my heart made because they thought I had a heart defect. Seriously. I’m not joking. I was a big deal for interns to come to listen to the “very good click” of what a mitral valve prolapse sounded like through a stethoscope. 

In my high school years, I would… Well, first, have you ever stood up too quickly and had a head rush? That would happen to me… but even while I was standing up (so, while just standing). I spent a period of time with wires hot glued to my head and connected to a box I wore on my torso, so they could track my brain activity. Literally. I couldn’t go to school. I mean, physically I could have but… I just couldn’t. My parents generously made up some excuse why I couldn’t be there. 

None of this affected my life… per se. I was the head of a student organization, king of one of the dances, was in choir, played sports, did drama club, and went to the Junior Olympics multiple times for martial arts. Among others, I got a gold medal in sparring at the Junior Olympics. It’s not much… but it’s nothing to sneeze at either.  I didn’t complete college, but I didn’t need to do so. #rightPlaceRightTime I’d been a computer nerd since the 80’s and eventually that turned into a career. I have a failed marriage under my belt, I won’t address any of that here, but in the end, it gave me the most wonderful son. He’s kinda the bee’s knees. Since then, I’ve found someone who just… really… loves me for me. Our relationship is an improbable one that just happened to work. I’m very lucky. I have a wonderful life, an amazing family, great friends, and a decent gig for a job. 

I still suffer from mental illness. 

I *experience* anxiety the most. My therapist(s) all seems to lean that I have chronic depression (coupled with anxiety… but as a secondary to depression). \*I\* want to know the first cause… but, I’m a nerd in that way. It doesn’t really matter. They’re both present. I “feel” anxiety physically but it might be secondary to the underlying “thing”. Or maybe it’s not… that doesn’t matter. 

Recently, ok… not really \*recent\*, I fell in love with someone. After many years, we tied the knot. I was scared, but also confident. The wedding was perfect. My kid SO VERY MUCH stepped up the plate for both of us… confirming he too thought it was a good move. 

Yet, after so much good happening in my life, something changed. OK, I \*think\* I know what changed. I was challenged with work (Trigger? Cause? Does it matter?) To be clear, this was something I’d wanted for a very long time. It was also more of a challenge than expected. At a certain point, I was so messed up in the head that I spent DAYS starring at my screen. Trying… but… stuck. I work from home. 100% remote. I *could* have simply played a video game or gone for walk. That wasn’t the thing though; I wasn’t trying to just slack off at work. I was trying, or at least wanted to, \*work\*… but I was stuck. Utterly stuck. 

It didn’t take long for my wife to notice. She gave me some latitude but eventually it was so bad that she gently, but firmly, suggested I go see a therapist who I’d seen before and really connected with. At some point, because I was between doctors and our healthcare system is shit, my wife thought it might be a good idea if I did outpatient hospital therapy. Seriously. At that point, a new patient intake for ANY doc takes 6 months to see the right doc… but, in her mind, at least if I did then I would have had the required doctors in a single setting. It felt overkill for me. I 120% got where she was coming from. Should you ever need that… don’t be afraid to embrace it. I’ve talked to some who will say that experience changed their lives. If things had gone on much longer I would have done it.

So now… now… I’m spending a shitton on a therapist because our health care sucks. But she’s awesome. I moved primary care providers… that took almost 6 months to do. It sucked; I think it will be good long-term. I also spent a shitton on a psychiatrist who’s not so awesome. He’s hard to communicate with. I had to do a crapton of homework but eventually \*I\* went to him and said, “I want to try xyz”.  

So now I’m medicated. Getting on it was crap. There are side effects… but the side effects dissipated. 

Does that mean I’m taking something for life? Does this mean it’s the right thing or right dose? Who knows! Does that mean my latest actions are the fix? Who knows! Does this mean I’m in action? Yes. Does this mean the road forward is easy? No. Does this mean it’s biochemical? I have no fucking clue!  I mean, I hope not… but… if it is, is that so bad? If I had another disease that impacted my life I would take the medication health care professionals say I should take. Is this so different? 

The point being… if you are normal and don’t feel it (or aren’t normal and know it) you’re not alone. It’s so.very.hard. I get it. I really do. Firefighters are brave. Single parents who work multiple jobs to take care of their kids are brave. The Parkland students are brave. People who reach out to get help for their mental illness are brave. I’m not brave. I needed help; I was ignoring it. I’m grateful I had people who spotted it and/or who helped me to this point. 

I’m not ashamed. OK, that’s not true. I do feel shame (even though intellectually I know that’s silly). But… I’m trying to be brave and say what is true. No person, anywhere, especially here in the richest country in the world, should live in the shadows or suffer alone, because they can’t afford treatment. We have all the money in the world for weapons and corporate tax cuts, so I know that we can afford to prioritize not just health care in general, but mental health care, specifically. Should that not come to pass, we still have one another. I know the path is there… even if I’ve lost sight of it at times. It was those who I could lean on that showed me, despite the fog that obscured it, that it was still there. I thank you to those people so much. We need to share our experiences, so someone who is suffering the way like I was won’t feel weird, or broken, or ashamed, or afraid to seek treatment. So that parents don’t feel like they have failed or somehow screwed up when they see symptoms in their kids. 

I’m ok. You’re ok.

acyli0,0,2019-01-05,Need advice about starting LTR contingent on having threesomes with other girls,lifestuff69,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/acyli0/need_advice_about_starting_ltr_contingent_on/,"I am early 30s and have a few plates right now. All know I am seeing other people, though I don't go into details.

* **Francine:** 34, single mom. No desire for LTR from either of us, we both know we are just having fun, and we are actually good friends and share a larger friend group. I see her a few times a month.
* **Sally:** 32, former coworker. Great body, average face, very cool and smart, but not interested in an LTR with her since I don't want kids for at least another 5 years or so. I have told her this, but I get the feeling she wants to settle down soon (tick-tock). I will continue to be honest with her and spin this plate until it breaks. I honestly just want someone younger than me if I settle down. I see her a few times a month.
* **Amy:** 29, ex GF, single mom. Probably best GF I have ever had, but I ended LTR with her because of kid. I didn't want to lead her on thinking we were going to get married, and honestly feel like I did the right thing. Since we both know we will never be more serious again, she is now looking for a provider and fucks me while she searches. We even joke about it haha. I see her a few times a month, sometimes spending a weekend with them fucking and watching Netflix.
* **Jackie:** 23, just graduated college, studying for the MCAT and doing internships before applying to med school. Unless she gets into a local school here she will be moving in the next 9 months or so. I see her about once a week, sometimes spend weekends with her, and we usually do couples things or go out to dinner before fucking.

I am not interested in an LTR with any of them except maybe Jackie. That said, I would only enter an LTR if I could fuck other women because that is what I want to do right now. That is a pretty hard sell, but I would like to talk Jackie into an LTR where we fuck other women in threesomes when she brings up exclusivity (I think she will). She has made out with other girls when drunk before, but nothing more than that. I still haven't had a threesome, but she doesn't know that (frame). Jackie, while initially experienced (1 guy before me, good family upbringing, etc.) is open to a LOT with me and loves me ""teaching"" and ""corrupting"" her haha.

&amp;#x200B;

Jackie recently started asking me what I am looking for in a girlfriend. Last weekend, she made a joke about ""us, or whatever this is..."" at dinner. She has known I am seeing other people since the start (\~5 months), but I predict she will bring up exclusivity in the coming weeks. Now, I can easily deflect and continue fucking her for a while, but I try to be honest with my plates and actually enjoy Jackie's company.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ""relationship"" we would have will end anyway when she moves for medical school. If she stays in town for school and it doesn't, I could continue seeing her while fucking other women with her or end it before then if I get bored.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize one can fuck other women outside of an LTR, but given Jackie's career ambitions, age, low n-count, and overall pleasantness, she is LTR material and someone I could see myself being with exclusively a few years from now when I am ready for a family and something more serious. In addition, she is a lot of fun, and could be an asset when I travel (she speaks like 6 languages fluently and could help with fucking locals). Plus, since most of my closest friends are married or in relationships now it would be nice to have someone to bring to all the couples events that I actually like.

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't do complete sexual exclusivity right now. I never thought I would say this, but having a girlfriend that I fuck other women with is exactly what I want right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone here successfully talked an LTR into something like this before or at the start of the relationship? There has to be a good way to frame ""sure, we can be exclusive if we do threesomes together"", right? If I do this successfully, I will more than likely lose Sally as a plate forever (no biggie), but I could probably keep Francine (and possibly Amy) in the threesome rotation."

Naturally, we’ve spent a lot of time together. Our chemistry undeniable. Like magnets until we finally gave in 4 months ago. Since then we’ve spent a lot of late nights in the office with me bent over your desk, blowing you in the parking garage, and sneaking to my apartment for long lunches. We can’t get enough of one another and I want you so badly right now. 

Tonight is huge for the company. A big investor dinner for our clients. Your wife had insisted on coming and you only told me right before. I’m pissed but I still only want you. Our time together is rushed and secret but our chemistry is real. I think tonight I’m finally realizing that I want more than sex.

Maybe you’re a married woman, and have been for a while now. You no longer have that spark from the honeymoon phase, whether you’ve been married for ten years or twenty. You used to be very careful about keeping up appearances, going to the gym, shaving your body, and more. But now, things have quieted down on that front.

Or maybe you have never been married. You like to enjoy yourself with as many men that you choose. Tying yourself down to one guy was never in your plan and that is perfectly fine with everyone ;)

Regardless of the type of life you lead, you have somehow found me. I’m young and handsome, and in many ways I am exactly the kind of young guy you've been looking for. Not surprising, I'm instantly turned on by a sexy older woman like you. Maybe you see me at the gym and catch me sneaking glances at your ass. You think it sags a bit, and you know you have cellulite on your thighs, but I still keep on checking you out. Little do you know that I’m sneaking into your locker after you leave and smelling your used gym shorts, the smell of your sweat and natural odor combined with your hairy pussy giving me an instant hardon.

Or perhaps I’m an intern at your firm, and you realize that I keep on coming into your office to get different forms because you have to lean down to grab them from a drawer, giving me an eyeful of your cleavage. Your tits sag after three kids, but you realize that that turns me on.

Maybe your an average looking milf. That means cellulite, sagging tits, an ass that had dropped a little, a wildly hairy pussy, and more. Or maybe your a pornstar-type bimbo, hotter than anyone else in town! I’m open to most kinks so I’ll just put my limits, which are death, scat, gore, and vomit. As to kinks, why don’t you include those in your message, and we can work out a story."

I'm a big fan of your videos and the work you are doing.  You are incredibly eloquent, and I believe you sincerely aim to help people.  I have benefited greatly from your videos and am currently acting to improve my life.  Based on your advice, I am now taking a distance learning course in IT system design.  This not only keeps me busy (it's challenging), but will almost certainly help me find a more interesting job later.

You've also helped me understand many trends I see in the world.  Recently I was able to politely and calmly discuss my views on the importance of free speech while enjoying a dinner party with some of my left-leaning and politically correct friends.  I used many of your arguments and techniques.   In the end, we remained friends, which is also important.

So thank you for the good advice, the inspiration, and the positive example you are setting for people like me.

I do, however, wonder what you think about receiving support, financial and otherwise, from family when trying to build build a life (i.e. when studying at university, and or starting a new career).

Clearly, many people, including many successful people, receive no support at all (financial or moral).  Some don't have families at all.  This, is tragic.  But on the other hand, many people do come from ""middle class"" or slightly upper middle-class families.  In such cases I wonder how much parents should help their children get started in life, and also how much burden the child should carry on their own.  At what point is the person no longer being ""responsible"" for their own life?

Let me provide a few examples to demonstrate where I'm coming from:

(1) I have a friend whose son recently graduated from UBC.  She earns $48,000 a year as a Montessori teacher.  In order to pay for his university tuition, she worked every weekend as a private tutor for five years.  He graduated bottom of his class with a 2.1 GPA and was unable to find work.  So she paid for him to attend UBC again (by working weekends), and he did a program in landscape architecture.  After this, her son was accepted into an Ivy League university where he studies architecture (he seems to have some talent at drawing).   She again pays all his costs (with personal loans and working nights and weekends tutoring at $35/hour).   Twice she has had to go to the hospital for exhaustion.   Making things worse - her son keeps taking semesters ""off"" for work internships (delaying his graduation).  Recently I learned that not only does he not get paid for these co-op terms, but that she pays the firms to take him on.  He just returned from 4 months at a prestigious architecture firm in Japan (she paid the firm $5K to take him for four months).  On the upside, it seems her strategy worked.  Her son is about to graduate and just got a job offer from one of the top architecture firms in New York.   He is 28.  But he has a job offer from a top firm, and great co-op experiences on his resume (and will have an Ivy League architecture degree in a few months).

What do you think about this?

&amp;#x200B;

(2) I have a friend whose daughter was a decent student in high-school and wanted to become a nurse.  The daughter attended ""Kwantlen PolyTech Uni"" in Vancouver for one year (not UBC).  She scored B and B- grades - which is far from sufficient for acceptance into nursing schools in Canada (not even close).  After a year and poor results, the daughter became exasperated.  When I heard this, I made the mistake of telling the Mom (who I know socially) about the Australian university system, and about how foreigners often attend nursing and medical school there if they can't get accepted in Canada.  The tuition is high (foreign tuition), but acceptance is much easier than in Canada (if wiling to pay the fees).  Her daughter then skipped Canadian university entirely, and is now in medical school in Australia (she quickly forgot about nursing and went for med school).  Unfortunately, the tuition is absurd ($60,000 a year for six years = $360,000 + Living for six years).  The Mom, is now working ""extra shifts"" and overtime to pay the bills (she is a single mother with three children).  I asked how she can possibly afford to pay such enormous costs, and she said she is making about $125,000  a year by working overtime and weekends, and that she is taking bank loans to pay her daughters costs (she has two more daughters, but they are much younger and are now expecting the same).    I told her she is nuts, and that her daughter could have done a three year bachelor of life science at Queens U in Kingston before going to Australia, thus shaving two years off the Australian medical program (and saving far more than $100,000).  The daughter does not work in the summers.  She instead takes one or two courses, thus lightening her course load for the subsequent school year (i.e. she is spreading the courses over three semesters a year rather than the usual two most students take).

What do you think about this?

&amp;#x200B;

(3) I have a friend who is CFO of a small software company.  He makes about $225,000 a year.  This sounds impressive, but when living in downtown Toronto, it's not as much as you might think.  He has a son, who was a pretty good student in high school, and a very nice kid indeed.  But he was a little demotivated.  His father, who I know well, concluded that his son would be ""eaten alive"" in the corporate world, so he started encouraging him to become a doctor.  But he also realized his son would never get accepted to a Canadian medical school (you need a 3.8 GPA or higher in some of the hardest subjects).  With this, the father said he was looking into the Caribbean medical schools, and that he was encouraging his son to go direct to medical school after high school (no need for a bachelor degree first, they offer integrated 5 and 6 year programmes for high-school grads).  He then told me he was going to pay the full cost of his sons medical school ($40,000 USD / year + tuition).   When I heard this, I asked why he didn't look into Australia and Ireland.  They are a bit more expensive, but his son would get a well recognized ""first world"" medical degree, and doens't need to do a bachelors degree first.  His father immediately looked into my suggestion, and his son was soon off to Europe.  He is now attending a six year medical program (no bachelor degree, direct acceptance from high school), and is well on his way to becoming  a qualified medical doctor (this for a kid that would be ""eaten alive"" in the corporate world, and who could ""not"" get accepted to a Canadian medical school according to his father).   The tuition is about $55,000 a year (for six years), plus living expenses of some $20,000 a year.  All in, the father, who I know, is paying over $500,000 to get his son though medical school and started in life.  The son is living in a big fancy condo, with granite counters, fancy gas appliances and has a maid clean-up every two weeks.   In the summers, he returns to Canada and hangs out at the tennis club (he was a pretty good tennis player).

What do you think about this?

&amp;#x200B;

(4) I have a friend who owns a condo in downtown Toronto.  She bought it with her divorce settlement, some 20 years ago and it has since skyrocketed in value.   When her son was accepted to the U. of Toronto engineering programme, she sold her condo and ""downshifted"" to a smaller unit, thus banking a few hundred thousand dollars in profit.  With this, she paid 100% of his tuition and living costs (he moved out and lived with his girlfriend in a fancy near U. of T).  After graduation, he worked for two years, but things weren't going all that well.  So he went back to school and did a masters degree.  Again - she paid 100% of costs (tuition and living).  This time he got a better job, and things seemed brighter.  So he got engaged, and quickly married.  With this, she again sold her condo, and downshifted to a less expensive unit (this time 10 minutes out of the city and a bit smaller).  She was again able to pocket a few hundred thousand dollars, which she gave him as a wedding present (she bought the happy couple a small but brand new condo in downtown Toronto). Both of their condos have since skyrocketed in value, and he is now a huge success.  He works for one of the worlds most famous tech firms (his options are worth hundreds of thousands, and his condo has increased in value by over $200,000).  What does she do for a living?  She is a personal trainer at the local community centre.  She earns about $80 a day teaching two large classes (fitness, pilates etc.).  Basically, she is poor, but very fit.  Luckily, she bought a really nice condo in downtown Toronto when she first divorced (but she is very fit).

Questions:

\- What do you think is right?

\- Is it right and normal for families to support their kids this much?  In all cases, the children seem to turn-out as incredible success stories.  Doctors.  Architects. High-rolling engineers with a beautiful  wife and a new child and a condo (no mortgage).

\- What would you do?

\-  You are making good money now.  Would you pay for your children to attend med school in Europe or Australia knowing they could not get accepted here? (and didn't even try as they skipped the bachelors degree here).  What if you were not making good money and were just a professor earning a typical professors salary?  Then what would you do?

\-   What do you think is the right balance? And at what point does this balance change?  What is middle class and what is wealthy with regards to supporting your children and building them towards their goals?

\- Should these students learn lessons in life by burdening them with student loans? Or, if possible, should parents assure students don't have to carry that load and that they can move forward in life quickly after completing university?  What is best in your view?

&amp;#x200B;

Notes about me:

ad1503,9,2019-01-05,The time a church collapsed,Alphanerd93,ChurchDrama,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChurchDrama/comments/ad1503/the_time_a_church_collapsed/,"Edit: sorry for the click bait title, that's my next story. Booze made me forget!

So, after reading this subreddit be created, and buzzed enough to post, I decided to post some fun drama I've dealt with. I no longer practice, mostly because I'm tired of the drama and judgy people, and losing a precious day off. 

First, the time I got ostracized by my group of friends in high school youth group for telling about sexual assault. It really opened my eyes to people, and made me realize how hypocritical people can be.

Names changed and abbreviated to protect the guilty and innocent
Key players:
Q: One of my best friends in this group, became my only friend for awhile. Helped me from killing myself in middle school. Assaulter #1
T: Another good friend, brought  O into my friend group who got everyone into the party scene
O: N's friend, and bad influence. Assaulter #2
K: Another friend in the group. Dating C 
L: K's friend, and new to this group.
Pastor: My youth pastor at the time. Good guy, still occasionally talk football with him. At the time, I was also going into the office one day a week as his intern, and doing little things like building worship slides and whatnot. 

So when I was in high school, I did an early college program where I took collage classes, and the spring break weeks didn't line up. So I didn't get a true ""spring break"", where I had a week off, but I had 2 weeks of half days, one with taking only high School classes, and the other with collage. So, I didn't really have free time to hang with my church friends. 
. My church friends started getting into the party scene, and partying with O. I wasn't a fan, and started moving away from them. 

This next part is all hearsay, based on what I've heard from them. O rings the booze one night during their spring break, and everyone is having a great time. Q ends up herding L into a room, and O herds K into another room. They all do what drunk teenagers do, except L says that she didn't want that, and confides in K and T about this.

T gives me a call to vent, as he's pissed about this. L is upset and crying, and K is trying to comfort her. T tells me some of the details, and then has to go. I end up talking to K about it, and she tells me that L definitely was assaulted, and makes it seem like O assaulted her as well.

I end up talking to my youth pastor about it, as he is a mandated reporter, and I just couldn't not talk about it. He tells me he'll take care of it, and ends up calling the non emergency line, and has a female detective come into the church office and interview the girls.

I'm in class, and my phone BLOWS UP. K is texting a hundred miles a minute about how dare I break her trust, and talk. T is mad that I got his friend in trouble, and my buddy Q is texting about someone reporting (no one told him it was me that said something). I just stay radio silent and focus on my class, and am flabbergasted at their responses.

The next day, on our youth night, the youth pastor asks both guys to leave the youth group, as either way they are a bad influence and he doesn't want them around. They leave super upset, and I get pulled aside by K and yelled at more.

Q's family ends up leaving the church over this, as they felt he was ""unfairly accused"" and L's family refused to let their daughter go back, because, sexual assault around church folk. I end up not talking to Q or O directly ever again, and drift away from T and K (T felt like it was all overblown, and I had other things happen with K). 

I found out a year later from the pastor that due to no DNA evidence being able to be collected, and conflicting testimonies, there's a not guilty verdict returned. 

This was where I started realizing that people can be manipulative, and just shitty. To this day, if I see Q or O, I swear I will punch them in the face, jail time be damned.

I hope I didn't ramble too much, and y'all enjoy my story. I have some good ones about how I helped a church plant, and ended up seeing it go belly up due to a crazy ass pastor.

Not a rant about praying for another plague. But instead about how a below average person as myself hardly stands the chances of landing certain positions. 

Currently I am starting my spring semester of my senior year as a Physics and Astronomy major with a painful 2.7 GPA. All my life there has been a goal to get into grad school, contribute to the sciences, not be famous but be successful. The process of applying to graduate schools, internships, and eventually jobs has made me sick to my stomach. Let me be forward in saying I've only applied to 3 internships thus far, all engineering based. However all positions require a 3.0 gpa or higher. Experience in so many different areas, where though my current research and coursework experience makes me viable, it seems to hardly touch the surface. Browsing linkedIn for summer internships shows hundreds to thousands of applicants for such back alley positions (hard to find). Perhaps it is all meant to intimidate people. Because it is working for me, since I've been stalling with submitting any more applications. 

This has snowballed so much lately that I am constantly questioning if it has been worth it, will I be happy in the long run, will there be financial stability, is this even for me. All these thoughts are so last minute that it keeps myself from sleeping at night. Additionally I compare myself to every single person I meet. Ask them their goals, what grad schools they are applying to and whatnot. In a sad way it has gone from genuine interest in these peoples lives to a demand for material to make myself feel worse. 

What's hard is when people ask me what I am passionate about, my hobbies, and what makes me happy. These questions are very difficult to answer. It does not help that my first two years of undergrad were filled with youthful distractions with emotional attachments to a past lover, and recently diagnosed anxiety and depression disorders. 

Art makes me happy, drawing, photography, photo editing, and much more. But those never fill the void of needing to learn something new every day. Maybe programming is an option? Maybe engineering? But wait, the odds for those are all tremendous. 

Anyway, if you are still reading this I thank you for sticking along this whole time. Just something true to get off my chest about feeling lost in life. A last stress that could be addressed is perhaps the feeling of guilt associated with wasting all the time and money generously provided by my family. I just want to be happy in the end, for all this to be worth it.

So how would I change this dedicated college girl into a slave for my use? Needless to say, you can find almost anything on the internet. Without complete confidence in its ability, I get my hands on a drug that fosters an addiction to cum. Such an unhealthy and constant addiction is going to ruin my friend's future, but also ensure I have a loving slave who will do anything for a single drop of my seed. In addition to this addiction, her mental capacity may be affected as well. What better combination than a cum-addicted bimbo...

I'd love to play this out with someone! You'd be playing as a female character that I have references for, and we can discuss more details when you reach out. I love the slow burn of someone changing and becoming a cum addicted slave. If you're interested, kik me at HelloMySlave

P.S. if you wanted to do a celebrity variant of this plot, I'm completely okay with that. Just include that in your first message if you do!"
ad27u7,12,2019-01-05,New Beginnings Retreat Review,rororower,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/ad27u7/new_beginnings_retreat_review/,"I don't even know where to begin with this.

I am still emotionally fragile from top surgery in Florida a few weeks ago and now I have a lot of regrets as to how I should have handled a lot of things. But I'm trying not to get too down on myself for it because I recognize now that a lot of it was not my fault and that the people around me that had promised to take care of me did not follow through.There's one other post from a few months ago on this subject going over some of the negative things they experienced at NBR, and I've got to thank them for putting this feeling into words that I didn't feel like I was allowed to have. My experience there felt more than a little bit off. I did not think I received the services that I paid for, and ended up having kind of a miserable time.

I'm not going to describe the interns because I thought they were the best part of the entire retreat. Every single intern made me feel loved and cared for in their own way, but mostly because we were similar in age (20s-30s) and could relate on a lot of things other than top surgery. One of them was incredible about making sure I got to all of my appointments on time and got all of the necessary aftercare products. That was amazing and lifted a lot of stress off of my shoulders.

Like the post I mentioned earlier, the place itself was very nice and I personally liked the interns a lot. What I did have issue with is NBR's lack of accountability, deviation from what they advertise themselves to be, and inattentiveness to their patients.

They advertise outings, and community, and ""family dinners."" I had to request an outing (just one!) multiple times before one of the interns that took me. One of the guys that left about a day after I arrived apparently didn't even get a single outing. There was one time when everyone congregated for somewhat of a group dinner. I think this kind of situation was also due to the fact that I arrived when there weren't many people there, but it felt like they were using the downtime to catch up on other work and that my experience was a second priority to them.

I have terrible PTSD from childhood medical abuse and that flared up when my friend that had come with me left midway through my week at NBR. I was already feeling so abandoned by him and the other person that had said they'd come but bailed at the last minute, and that plus the PTSD it made it really hard for me to communicate what I needed. I ended up barely being able to leave my room and crying alone for a couple days straight. Leland made me feel awful for not being able to ask for help when he finally came in to talk to me. And then he said that he would make a point of checking up on me, and he didn't. I had to make the (herculean, at this point) effort to get myself out into the common spaces and seek everyone out for company and for food. If I felt too tired to leave my room I basically would be forgotten about. I didn't know I could call the staff on my phone to ask for their help until my third day there because they had briefly mentioned it but didn't clarify that I could call for even the smallest things I needed help with like getting in and out of my chair. Leland consistently made me feel like it was my fault for not telling him what to do, when I had assumed that a certain level of care was to be expected like checking up on me since I was alone. He said things like, ""I keep forgetting your caregiver has left"" and ""there are guys that just do their thing and get on by themselves by the second day"" like that is supposed to be the standard. I came here expecting fucking a minimum standard of medically appropriate care, not the assumption that I could take care of myself after major surgery.

Another thing was that I have a chronic illness that is managed through an extremely restrictive diet, and during the phone conversation I initiated in order to ask questions after booking my room Leland refused to even have a discussion about meal planning and what I could expect to find at the retreat so that I could plan on buying everything else myself. Being stressed out and wanting everything to be simple, I ended up not pushing it and figuring it out when I got there. Thankfully I was able to figure out the food situation but it was way more stressful than it would have been if Leland had been less dismissive of my questions.

I'm emotionally exhausted and continue to be so because I have no family to take care of me even back in my home state. I don't wish this mess on anybody, and will not be going back to NBR even if I get bottom surgery in Florida for some reason. There were even times when I felt actively suicidal during this whole thing because I felt so abandoned and not taken care of, on the part of the staff and because of my PTSD as well as many of my friends back home forgetting to check up on me online. Somehow I got through it and I'm almost a month post op now.

On the actual surgery side of things, Dr. Sassani is a fucking artist and I'd 10/10 recommend him purely because my results are fantastic. He is pretty expensive and his office is very sketchy with financials  but to be completely honest I am so happy with my results that I would have paid twice as much and considered it worth it.But my experience at NBR  really sucked. Maybe I'll be feeling more positive about the good parts eventually, like the great friendships I made with the other guys staying there and the interns. And I can't lie and say that for people with more supportive friends and family accompanying them to surgery, it probably wouldn't be as devastating an experience and maybe even a great one.The most constant thing I would hear while I was there was, leave good reviews. We're going to be shut down if we don't get good reviews. The emphasis was almost on pressuring people into writing good reviews online. Maybe I'm just a pushover but I thought that was completely inappropriate to convey to a recovering patient. It's not my responsibility to leave a good review to help you, reviews are there to promote transparency and accuracy.

I have to make it abundantly clear that I am not advocating for a boycott of this place or trying to dissuade anyone from considering it as an option, because there are definite advantages to staying there and it is the only one of its kind providing a place of community for trans people recovering from surgery. But for right now I'm sad and hurting and pissed off and feeling a bit ripped off and just needed to talk about it.

To sum it all up, I had a bad time at NBR as a solo patient and would not recommend it if you are in a similar situation as I was. This post was a bit all over the place  but that's honestly where I am right now. Hope it helps validate someone else's top surgery recovery experience that wasn't all sunshine and daisies either."
ad2imf,5,2019-01-05,[Letter]: Seeking advice: Families and and support - What is right? What should parents do and how much?,jason3333531,JordanPeterson,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/ad2imf/letter_seeking_advice_families_and_and_support/,"  

Dear Dr. Peterson (and readers), 

I'm a big fan of your videos and the work you are doing. You are incredibly eloquent, and I believe you sincerely aim to help people. I have benefited greatly from your videos and am currently acting to improve my life. Based on your advice, I am now taking a distance learning course in IT system design. This not only keeps me busy (it's challenging), but will almost certainly help me find a more interesting job later. 

You've also helped me understand many trends I see in the world. Recently I was able to politely and calmly discuss my views on the importance of free speech while enjoying a dinner party with some of my left-leaning and politically correct friends. I used many of your arguments and techniques. In the end, we remained friends, which is also important. 

So thank you for the good advice, the inspiration, and the positive example you are setting for people like me. 

I do, however, wonder what you think about receiving support, financial and otherwise, from family when trying to build build a life (i.e. when studying at university, and or starting a new career). 

Clearly, many people, including many successful people, receive no support at all (financial or moral). Some don't have families at all. This, is tragic. But on the other hand, many people do come from ""middle class"" or slightly upper middle-class families. In such cases I wonder how much parents should help their children get started in life, and also how much burden the child should carry on their own. At what point is the person no longer being ""responsible"" for their own life? 

 Let me provide a few examples to demonstrate where I'm coming from: 

(1) I have a friend whose son recently graduated from UBC. She earns $48,000 a year as a Montessori teacher. In order to pay for his university tuition, she worked every weekend as a private tutor for five years. He graduated bottom of his class with a 2.1 GPA and was unable to find work. So she paid for him to attend UBC again (by working weekends), and he did a program in landscape architecture. After this, her son was accepted into an Ivy League university where he studies architecture (he seems to have some talent at drawing). She again pays all his costs (with personal loans and working nights and weekends tutoring at $35/hour). Twice she has had to go to the hospital for exhaustion. Making things worse - her son keeps taking semesters ""off"" for work internships (delaying his graduation). Recently I learned that not only does he not get paid for these co-op terms, but that she pays the firms to take him on. He just returned from 4 months at a prestigious architecture firm in Japan (she paid the firm $5K to take him for four months). On the upside, it seems her strategy worked. Her son is about to graduate and just got a job offer from one of the top architecture firms in New York. He is 28. But he has a job offer from a top firm, and great co-op experiences on his resume (and will have an Ivy League architecture degree in a few months).

What do you think about this? 

(2) I have a friend whose daughter was a decent student in high-school and wanted to become a nurse. The daughter attended ""Kwantlen PolyTech Uni"" in Vancouver for one year (not UBC). She scored B and B- grades - which is far from sufficient for acceptance into nursing schools in Canada (not even close). After a year and poor results, the daughter became exasperated. When I heard this, I made the mistake of telling the Mom (who I know socially) about the Australian university system, and about how foreigners often attend nursing and medical school there if they can't get accepted in Canada. The tuition is high (foreign tuition), but acceptance is much easier than in Canada (if wiling to pay the fees). Her daughter then skipped Canadian university entirely, and is now in medical school in Australia (she quickly forgot about nursing and went for med school). Unfortunately, the tuition is absurd ($60,000 a year for six years = $360,000 + Living for six years). The Mom, is now working ""extra shifts"" and overtime to pay the bills (she is a single mother with three children). I asked how she can possibly afford to pay such enormous costs, and she said she is making about $125,000 a year by working overtime and weekends, and that she is taking bank loans to pay her daughters costs (she has two more daughters, but they are much younger and are now expecting the same). I told her she is nuts, and that her daughter could have done a three year bachelor of life science at Queens U in Kingston before going to Australia, thus shaving two years off the Australian medical program (and saving far more than $100,000). The daughter does not work in the summers. She instead takes one or two courses, thus lightening her course load for the subsequent school year (i.e. she is spreading the courses over three semesters a year rather than the usual two most students take). 

What do you think about this? 

  

(3) I have a friend who is CFO of a small software company. He makes about $225,000 a year. This sounds impressive, but when living in downtown Toronto, it's not as much as you might think. He has a son, who was a pretty good student in high school, and a very nice kid indeed. But he was a little demotivated. His father, who I know well, concluded that his son would be ""eaten alive"" in the corporate world, so he started encouraging him to become a doctor. But he also realized his son would never get accepted to a Canadian medical school (you need a 3.8 GPA or higher in some of the hardest subjects). With this, the father said he was looking into the Caribbean medical schools, and that he was encouraging his son to go direct to medical school after high school (no need for a bachelor degree first, they offer integrated 5 and 6 year programmes for high-school grads). He then told me he was going to pay the full cost of his sons medical school ($40,000 USD / year + tuition). When I heard this, I asked why he didn't look into Australia and Ireland. They are a bit more expensive, but his son would get a well recognized ""first world"" medical degree, and doens't need to do a bachelors degree first. His father immediately looked into my suggestion, and his son was soon off to Europe. He is now attending a six year medical program (no bachelor degree, direct acceptance from high school), and is well on his way to becoming a qualified medical doctor (this for a kid that would be ""eaten alive"" in the corporate world, and who could ""not"" get accepted to a Canadian medical school according to his father). The tuition is about $55,000 a year (for six years), plus living expenses of some $20,000 a year. All in, the father, who I know, is paying over $500,000 to get his son though medical school and started in life. The son is living in a big fancy condo, with granite counters, fancy gas appliances and has a maid clean-up every two weeks. In the summers, he returns to Canada and hangs out at the tennis club (he was a pretty good tennis player). 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts?   
 

(4) I have a friend who owns a condo in downtown Toronto. She bought it with her divorce settlement, some 20 years ago and it has since skyrocketed in value. When her son was accepted to the U. of Toronto engineering programme, she sold her condo and ""downshifted"" to a smaller unit, thus banking a few hundred thousand dollars in profit. With this, she paid 100% of his tuition and living costs (he moved out and lived with his girlfriend in a fancy near U. of T). After graduation, he worked for two years, but things weren't going all that well. So he went back to school and did a masters degree. Again - she paid 100% of costs (tuition and living). This time he got a better job, and things seemed brighter. So he got engaged, and quickly married. With this, she again sold her condo, and downshifted to a less expensive unit (this time 10 minutes out of the city and a bit smaller). She was again able to pocket a few hundred thousand dollars, which she gave him as a wedding present (she bought the happy couple a small but brand new condo in downtown Toronto). Both of their condos have since skyrocketed in value, and he is now a huge success. He works for one of the worlds most famous tech firms (his options are worth hundreds of thousands, and his condo has increased in value by over $200,000). What does she do for a living? She is a personal trainer at the local community centre. She earns about $80 a day teaching two large classes (fitness, pilates etc.). Basically, she is poor, but very fit. Luckily, she bought a really nice condo in downtown Toronto when she first divorced (but she is very fit). 

What do you think about this?   
   
 

Questions:

\- What do you think is right? How should families support future generations in your view?  What should and should not parents do? 

\- Is it right and normal for families to support their kids this much? In all cases, the children seem to turn-out as incredible success stories. Doctors. Architects. High-rolling engineers with a beautiful wife and a new child and a condo (no mortgage). 

\- What would you do? 

\- You are making good money now. Would you pay for your children to attend med school in Europe or Australia knowing they could not get accepted here? (and didn't even try as they skipped the bachelors degree here). What if you were not making good money and were just a professor earning a typical professors salary? Then what would you do? 

\- What do you think is the right balance? And at what point does this balance change? What is middle class and what is wealthy with regards to supporting your children and building them towards their goals? 

\- Should they be burdened with student loans? Or, if possible, should parents assure students don't have to carry that load and that they can move forward in life quickly after completing university? 

   
 

I'm looking forward to receiving comments. 

Note: 

I’m in my early 40s. Married. One young child.  Work in OK job, but looking for a better job soon. 

Thank you. "

I've just graduated and my current job, while better in a lot of ways than my last, isn't giving me enough hours to sustain any quality of life. at this point I'm just working to pay bills and rent - nothing more, no outings, movies, proper nutrition or anything, just work, sleep and work.

now I'm careful saying that cause I don't want to be seen as ungrateful but at the same time I would like to improve my life a bit and be able to go and get coffee without having to come to terms with buying one means I have to skip a meal or walk to work cause I can't afford to bus. Also like I've said, I've just graduated and I was a strong performer in my degree but my teachers didn't like and they never went out of their way to help me make contact for internships or jobs post graduation but they've sent two of my classmates to Europe in our second year and told me they just couldn't see me there and sent them instead. now they've arranged for them to go to back this year to make contact with the artist overseas but haven't even pointed me in the right direction regardless of the hours I put into my craft. I'm waiting for a MAJOR film to begin production soon and there's a strong chance I'll be involved in an entry position (better pay for work I enjoy)

&amp;#x200B;

The Job: Job doesn't want to give me more hours but doesn't want me looking for another job either cause ""rather you didn't do that cause then you wouldn't be available to us"" still can't afford to live

The Location: came here with parents but have always hated it here. I stick out like a sore thumb and can't build a life cause people want to hire their friends from primary school or high school and I didn't school here. my degree has more work over seas

As to how LOA fits in all this-

I had a conversation with my parents and they said that I'm just having trouble with the location ( yeah the location you move me to you assholes) then after that a random customer at my job asked about my future and what I wanted, we started talking and he complimented my demeanour and said I was a great guy but if I want a life akin to what I'm dreaming of then I have to leave this country. he said everything from Making more friends, a beautiful relationship,  job, house, car everything is waiting for me and is even mine right now BUT I have to go and meet it out there!. I was so stunned I didn't even know what to say

my mentor who is an industry leader in my field said that he understands I might be scared but I need to do it anyway otherwise my dreams will just be that dreams and never reality so pour all my energy towards leaving, don't even bother with relationships or anything here just go and I will find what I'm looking for.

I have countless other examples of RANDOM people having chats with me that result with them always telling me to ""just go"". Now I did ask the universe for guidance on what I should be focused on and this has been happening to me for like a whole year now, should I take this as the universe answering ?, is 27 too late to get the life I always have been dreaming of ? and last do you ask the universe/LOA for the life in the form of ""I want my life to look like this!"" or do I request in a modular way like "" ok universe I need a new affordable  place to rent' gets it, then "" ok now I need a car for my job"" gets it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: manifested before but now I really need something to manifest HARD but because I feel that way worried I won't get it. almost not even sure what I should be asking for either

ad4687,5,2019-01-06,Should I supplement a digital media degree with coding experience to appeal to UX recruiters?,learning1skey,UI_Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/UI_Design/comments/ad4687/should_i_supplement_a_digital_media_degree_with/," 

Hi, looking for some advice. I started out college in engineering, then switched to comp sci when I figured out I wanted to pursue User experience design. Then this past semester I ended up dropping the 2 computer science classes I was taking, to save my grades. I was finding it difficult to do the weekly labs by myself &amp; it was stressful, my scores showed this.

My current major is called digital arts and sciences (digital media. web design/ animation/ production/ etc). I have doubts about whether or not the degree would be worth it.

I was considering taking a semester off to make a final, informed decision. But then I was just offered an internship as a programmer/ analyst for this summer. I accepted because I couldn't pass up the opportunity.

Because of the type of internship, I'm considering retaking the programming/ discrete structures classes and trying to switch to computer science again. But I really had a hard time in the classes. I don't have any more room to mess up my GPA; I've used all my drops.

So because I've struggled with programming classes in college, I think it will go more smoothly if I finish my degree in my current major and learn programming/ everything I need to know for the internship online. I'll use my programming internships to show I can code. Eventually, I'll be able to pivot into a UX design role.

I'm hoping for some feedback. Does my plan sound solid or more like a recipe for disaster? Should I try to get a computer science degree at all costs? 

Or should I just take a semester off to really delve in and figure this out before I make another move?"

Just looking for some input. Initially planned on transferring to UH-Main fall 2019 for CS, but now I’m considering UHCL. I have little to moderate experience in coding. I’m decent at math. I’m not sure what path I want to take within CS since it’s so broad and a lot of things interest me. Software dev, web design, app dev, Data Analytics, maybe even a little business.. Econ minor? I’m not sure, but that’s what internships will help with, I hope. So here’s how my list is going so far.

UH Pros: 
— Prestige - higher rank 
— Networking
— Will take maybe a semester off my expected graduation date
— Nice night life for young adults 

UH Cons:
— Houston traffic
— Big campus 
— Parking 
— Higher rent for nicer apartments 
— I heard the CS department has been exponentially declining lately 
— Also heard professors weren’t so good 

UHCL Pros: 
— Cheaper tuition 
— Smaller classes/campus 
— New STEM building, so maybe more funding?
— Moderate traffic
— Convenient stores/malls nearby in clear lake/Webster area 

UHCL Cons:
— Not ranked 
— Don’t know anyone who recruits from here
— Don’t know how job prospects after graduation look 
— Don’t know how professors are 
— Will possibly add a semester to my expected graduation date 


So now.. I wanna hear anyone else’s thoughts? Did anyone transfer from one school to the other, what were your reasons, and what was your experience after? I seem to find little to no information from students on UHCL’s undergrad computer science program, professors, recruiters at job fairs.. I just want to analyze all my options before I make a decision.

Thank you all. "

I had an abortion in the summer of 2015. At the time I was 22 years old, about to start my final year of university, was working an unpaid internship for a local theater company 7 days a week and was in an outpatient program treating my eating disorder. A week before opening night of the show my boyfriend (now husband) and our 2 roommates could see how burnt out I was so we took a mini vacation to our friends family cabin. I'd been feeling like something was off while we were there so I decided to take a pregnancy test, low and behold it was positive. Shocked I wasn't sure how to bring this up to my partner who adamantly does not want kids I chose not to say anything at the time. Later that same day my mother called to tell me my grandfather had also passed away. I was devastated, I felt so lost and didn't know how to handle the situation at all so I only focused on my grandpa's death.

A week goes by and I go to the doctor to confirm I was pregnant, when they came back with another positive result I just bawled in their office. I told my boyfriend and he completely shut down, later telling me this had happened in his last relationship and she blamed him until they split up not long afterwards. 

I was just numb. I was numb when I booked the appointment for a surgical abortion, numb the entire process, and numb for a month after it was all over. My boyfriend tried his best but was not there for me the way I needed, I don't blame him at all. After a month I finally broke down since it was the first time I was alone since having the abortion. I saw myself slowly becoming more and more withdrawn and sinking into my depression as time passed and I almost ruined my relationship before I was finally able to talk with him about how badly that had hurt me. It's now been over 3 years and I can say I was in now was ready for a baby and was still battling my own demons but it still hurts and I don't think that ache will really ever go away.

My best friend gave birth to her first son last night, it was one of the most incredible moments in her life I was able to witness but on the way home I broke down crying. All I could think about was how I would have had a toddler at this point. I keep trying to remind myself I made the right decision but it still fucking sucks sometimes."
ad55sj,1,2019-01-06,21 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ad55sj/21_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

In college I had applied to an IC for an internship that required a TS/SCI. 

-	SF-86 in early 2016. 
-	Poly/medical in August of 2016. 
-	Interview/references called May 2017

I was never cleared in time for an internship and I am set to graduate in 5 months. The only recent update is that they are looking to see if there is a full time position available but nothing concrete (~5 months ago). Due to this uncertainty, I have accepted another offer of employment after my graduation.

Questions: 

1.	The new company is a defense contractor and so I guess my question is that would I still receive my clearance if I were to not work for the original IC directly after graduation? 

2.	If the investigation closes and is adjudicated favorable, would I then be able to transfer the clearance/adjudication to the new position? 

3.	Would this be frowned upon by the IC company who originally started my process if I get a clearance and don’t work for them, even with the waiting? To be clear I still very much do want the position however with the uncertainty I had to take another position that I may work at for a while before a full time position at the original IC is found. 

Thanks for any information you can provide about this situation. "

ad66su,39,2019-01-06,"[spoilers, all seasons] bad ending, bad filler material, and no character development turned a great show into a mediocre one",kenm_v2,GossipGirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GossipGirl/comments/ad66su/spoilers_all_seasons_bad_ending_bad_filler/,"I binged the whole show in one month. This is just my opinion so please don't hate me :)

the show was very strong at the beginning. All the characters had personalities and complex relationship with each other especially Chuck and Blair. others were pretty alright too but the show makers failed to capitalize on that. Instead of developing all the characters and their relationships, they just decided to change them according to the story.
In the first season and even in the second season, character development felt fluid but after that, everything feels wonky. It feels like you don't even know who they are anymore.

the filler material I'm talking about is the guest characters that only stayed for a few episodes and most of them were pretty boring. They should've been used to develop our main characters but it felt like that they did their thing and left leaving no effects whatsoever on the show or the characters.

The ending was simply terrible. I wanted Serena and Dan to end up together but that just felt unnatural. Watch season one (or two) after they break up for the first time and meet at that white dress party. even that had more feelings involved that the marriage or the hand holding (?) they did when they were sitting on the couch. And I don't even have to say anything about Blair and Chuck's marriage. It was so painful to watch. They tried to involve the police to make it more interesting but that clearly didn't work.

here is how it could've been improved; should have made the show about characters instead of relationships and who ends up with who. Instead of just Serena+Dan and Chuck+Blair being the end goal, it should have been about their personalities.
Serena dealing with her past and her addiction to partying
Dan becoming more cut throat to write stories and then going back to being a good guy
chuck going from being chuck to being normal and
blair being less manipulative and competitive
^this is just a bad example but you know what I'm talking about

to me, it felt like the show did so much but in the end, nothing really changed. Blair was exactly the same person as she was in season one (telling Serena how dan doesn't belong with them). Chuck's decision to marry with family was kind of cool but they overdid it with the baby. Serena was just being Serena when they found out Dan was GG and Blair was pissed at him. Dan not admitting that he was an asshole to them and wrote shitty stories about them or even tried to explain why he did that. ""I did the right thing, 'nuff said"" ""yeah guys, he did the right thing"" ok it's over. Let's time jump. Even Jenny had better character development in season one (or two, where she's an intern) than the main characters. the whole, nothing really changed thing made me feel like I wasted my time.

I understand that it's that type of show where they create drama just for the sake of drama but I believe this show could've been something more.

TLDR: no change in character's personalities, too many things happened in the finale and nothing really led up to it. The show gave no sense of progression at all."

It's a 2002 9-5 Aero, with 86k miles (joystick optioned). I drove it back to Chicagoland from Florida two days after I bought it and found out some of the things I need to fix before I leave for school again, and was hoping for some advice. 

• I need to replace the tensioner pulley for the serpentine belt, and it looks like there's two possible routes to go. I could go with the long serpentine belt, or I could go with the short belt and omit the center pulley. Which would be best? (Yes I would check all pulleys while doing this) 

• The beam from the headlights are pointed pretty low and visability was poor at night, is there an adjustment I can make somewhere? 

• There is sometimes a clunk from the front right engine bay area while accelerating/hitting a bump (passengers side), I think it could either be from a bad engine mount or possibly it needing new shock tower bushings. Has anyone experienced something similar, and what did you do to fix it? 

• HID bulbs are pretty expensive to replace, is there a conversion kit so I can make the fog lights LED?

There's a shop dedicated to Saabs near me, so I will also go visit them to pick at their brains and get some more advice. But overall, I'm really happy with my purchase! It's a blast to drive, and with great mpg and lots of trunk space it'll be a perfect fit. Thanks for any advice you guys might be able to provide!

Salut!

Ma gandesc tot mai serios si mai mult sa ma las de facultate(info anul 2). Ma dezgusta din ce in ce mai tare pe zi ce trece. Materie stufoasa,plictisitoare , nefolositoare (80% din cazuri). Incep sa realizez ca nu ma ajuta mai deloc(desi stiu ca ar fi de preferat sa ai o facultate, chiar si in IT). Stiu ca isi are si ea rostul(iti da gandire de programator),in acelasi timp cred ca timpul si resursele alocate ar putea fi folosite mult mai eficient.

Singurul motiv pentru care mai stau sunt parintii, sa fiu sincer. Desi in primul an mi-am platit singur mare parte din cheltuieli(drumuri, camin etc), stiu ca parintii au contribuit si ei suficient, si nu vreau sa fie degeaba. Si nu avem o situatie extraordinara. + stiu ca pentru ei conteaza, fiind mai de moda veche. Si nu stiu cum as putea sa le dau asa veste minunata :).

Pe de alta parte, daca m-as lasa, as avea mult mai mult timp sa ma concentrez pe studiu individual, care chiar conteaza(sa invat bine un limbaj si principiile lui, sa fac proiecte etc). Apoi, cat mai degraba(probabil in vara) sa ma bag la un internship.

La voi cum a fost? De ce v-ati lasat si cum au decurs lucrurile dupa, avand in vedere asteptarile voastre? Cum a decurs discutia cu parintii?"

Alias: (of the church)(white snake)(Grand Thunder)

Age: 21

Height: 175 cm

Weight: 75 kg

Weapon of choice: spear - morning star - Naginata spear

Shield: stone shield

Gregory is a paladin who's the leader of the group. Very proficient in the use of lightning and healing magic. He is an orphan boy who was raised in a mega church. During his early teen years, he took the job of a courier of the church at he age of 10, delivering messages of the churches throughout the empire. He eventually got knighted as paladin of the church (which is just glorified security guard) at 14 because of his physical toughness and strength. Later went to study in the main city of the kingdom of Yygris at the age of 18. Because of his strict religious upbringing, he was discouraged from his ambition to be an adventurer and making fame for himself. So when he was old enough to be independent, he set out to chase his dream. At the years of 21 when he finished his study, he took on petty quests and taking intern jobs, living day to day, sometimes joining other adventuring party but always as a tag-along. That all changed when he met Eliza, he took an instant liking to her and request she and him form and adventuring party. Along the journey, they also are joined by other adventurer as well(as seen below). He is the person who strung the member of the group together. He can be goofy at times and somewhat took too much of a straightforward approach to problem.  His self-centered worldview could make him blunt at times, causing him to be mistaken for an egotist douche when he clearly didn't want to hurt anyone. However, he can be very serious when situation comes to dire and has unbreakable resolve

Eliza:

Alias: (Red menace)(Red hood)

Age: 17

Height: 168 cm

Weight: 64 kg

Weapon of choice: spiked club - claymore - ultra greatsword

Shield: (rare occasion) roundshield

Eliza(our MC) who was born into rich family as a kid. She is extremely intelligent, with many many offers from privileged university at young age. However, he parents have always been abusive power trippers since she was a kid. For example; being harshly scolding her on every little things which is sometimes doesn’t make sense like  if she was even a minute late for getting in the car to home from school, they would leave her to walk home by herself(distant not from home to school is not near). Her mother would physically hit her all the time even with something that is trivial and it’s so sever that sometimes she can’t walk. Her parents also kept her academic successes above all else represses her personal desires such as socialising and making friends, which she never was given much autonomy. While she had a success in academia, she always felted empty inside because academia isn’t all what she wanted in life. This rage that builds up over time turn her into an angsty person with temper problem which she would be the cause of her lashing her anger by getting into fights with other students.

At the age of 15 she had been been training (as a hobby) in a couple of forms of martial arts including kickboxing and judo

One time at the age of 16 while her mother was hitting her again, she finally had enough and fought back. Her mother ended up in hospital and she was later disowned from the inheritance. She ran away from home to live in the streets, living day to day doing shady stuff like selling weed and stealing because she really had no choice. One day while she was driving her scooter, there was 2 trucks speeding at her from 2 sides of the road. However, when the impact is expected, the trucks disappear, only for her to find out that she got transported to another world. And some time later met with Gregory to form the party. She also has some anger issue as well. She is very polite, as a person of her background is, but can get really violent if she gets angry which she is really easily provoked.

Sonya:

Alias: (Silver (sonya)) (Iron Ocelot)

Height: 170 cm

Age: 27

Weapon of choice: sai - estoc - katana

She is notorious for her brutal and lethal assassination. One day, she was framed as a traitor and was killed by one of her colleagues and is left to die. However, she miraculously survived and had been living an alias of “Sonya”. She became depressive and eventually join Gregory’s party, which made her feel like she had a direction in life. She is a more serious member of the team, always thinking logically and what’s most beneficial for the group. She takes commands from Gregory as serious and absolute. She never participates in the antics of his teammates. However, she still frequently participates in a handful of casual group conversations with them from time to time

Andus Greenrock:

Weapon of choice: staff(for casting magic) - kris dagger

Shield: hide shield

Andus Greenrock is a sorcerer of of Whatever-goes magic school of magic and witchcraft which was founded by his father Androxus Greenrock with only him being the only student. The school is not an official magic school by any means. They chose to learn in a more experimental way than more conventional way, by living in the woods and collecting doing some totally unsafe experiements with new spells and potion effect. They never harmed anyone, surprisingly enough, and has actually help some villager with problems such as giving them cure potion for disease for free without any compensation . However, at age of 12, Andus's father was arrested with illegal magical practice(or something) but the real reason is that he discovered something that the official mage establishment doesn’t want to find out. Without anywhere to go in life, he set out to be an adventurer, using whatever skill his father taught him and trying to uncover the conspiracy of his dad’s arrest along the way. Andus is a pretty smart guy, but he's extremely immature for his age, and likes to goof around all time which can get on his teammate's nerves as well. He likes to troll people on purpose, half the shit he says makes people wanna stab him with a fork"

I am currently in a graduate program and have just received an offer for a 3 month summer internship with a large, private company that is a perfect fit for me. I have been passed along to a college recruiter in the company that I have not met before now, and they have emailed me the offer with the compensation and details. The recruiter informed me that I will need to pass a background check before starting, but that they are going to do it in about 2 months rather than doing it right now. The details of the background check were not mentioned, so I don't know exactly what they are looking for.

My only conviction is from 4 years ago for criminal sexual conduct in the 4th degree, a misdemeanor. Sometimes it turns up as a felony in background checks that I have run on myself. I'm really embarrassed about having done this, and have done a lot to try and make up ground to put it behind me. It's truly not representative of who I am, and the conviction comes as a total shock to those that don't already know.

I've decided, based on advice I've seen in other threads here, to come clean to this recruiter. I'm just not really sure how.

* I want to ask for more details about the background check to see what would be disqualifying, but this will obviously raise some red flags.
* I want to come clean about my background, but I don't know what level of detail to provide to keep things professional.
* I have been in this situation before at a different company and came clean to the recruiter, and they rescinded the offer after the bg check, which was very discouraging. I may have provided too much detail that time.
* I know liability is the big issue here, but I have had multiple other positions in various settings (office, restaurant, school, etc.) without any incidents.
* The application didn't ask about criminal history, although I was told there will be a second application I must submit prior to starting.

I'd really like to do this internship, although I have other options to put food on the table if it gets rescinded. What advice do you all have for me that would maximize my chances of retaining my offer? I'm really willing to do anything to show the company that I'm worth taking a chance on."

(Indian MILF / Gangbang)",rockingrema,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/adai1m/f4m_road_trips_birthdays_internshipsoh_my_indian/,"I’m always looking to make new writing partners - reach out whenever you're interested. 
 
Below are some scene ideas that will hopefully frame my general interests. I’m not sold on any one of these and would be happy and prefer to chat with a partner to work out details and see how we can form stories that are fun for us. 
 
My preference is to find good long-term partners but one-shot roleplays or short term is fine as well. Quality writing is important to me. For me, that means full sentences, grammar, punctuation etc. and generally no text/internet lingo-talk. I’m just too old for it, I think and I don’t find it very enticing or exciting. 
 
For these roles, I like male characters that are balanced and have personalities. I do like somewhat aggressive leads but not so much that they’re one-dimensional. I am not into jocks/jerks (at least for these scenes) or guys whose sole focus in roleplay is the sex. I want there to be lots of kinky sex in the roleplay, but only if there’s plenty of story to support it with good characters. 
 
As for me, I do best with roles where I am not the aggressor and nor am I playing “teacher” to anyone. Instead, I tend to play more nurturing, sweet, fun, flirtatious, joking type. That doesn’t mean I want to be your sub or anything, please understand the difference. When you write to me first, showing me you have an understanding of these dynamics will make it easier for me to see we’ll be a good fit. 

I'm a South Asian American. Mostly have spent the last 25 years or so in America so am a bit of a mix. I don't have a hard accent or anything but a slight one that most folks find endearing, haha. I usually prefer scenes set in America because that's what I know best. 
 
We can hash out more details in PM’s as well. I’d like to get to know my partners before starting a roleplay. 
 
A good initial message will: 

- Be a paragraph or two long. 
- Enough to give me some info about you but not a novel. 
- Clearly explain some of your biggest **current** interests 
- What are some things that excited you about my post? What do you want to do with these ideas?
- Where you like to roleplay: Reddit, Chatzy, other options etc. 
 
Kinks: race play, age play, titty fucking, facials, swallowing, lingerie, anal, dp, groups and generally open to anything as long as we discuss it first.
 
Here are some takes on scenes. I’d love to hear your own take on them and what you have in mind as well. When you message, put your favorite kink in the subject line so I know that you read this. 
 
 
**A Road Trip to Remember**
 
I play a MILF-type character who's related to a group of younger guys (maybe 2-4). I could be a mother's close friend, for example, but am open to other ideas as well. I'm thinking we'd be on a cross-country road trip that's going to take a couple of weeks. None of us would have had any kind of sexual history, but during this trip such situations arise. 
 
**The Internship**

You and a few of your friends are interning for the summer at company. I’m a doctor and researcher and occasionally we take a few interns during the summer. The guys have recently graduated HS and are headed to college and are planning to get some experience under their belt. For this scene, we’d need to hash out whether we are already known to each other or if we’re strangers who are meeting for the first time. I’m open to either depending upon the setting. 
 
**Start-Up Culture**

We’re all co-workers at a high-paced start-up environment. We’ve gotten to know each other fairly well over the last year. I started at the company a few years ago when it first opened and moved to the states from India for my first job. It’s one of those intense work environments and our team always ends up saddled with coming in on the weekends to help out with them team over in Europe. It’s kind of annoying but the pay is great and the work environment is pretty fun. 

**Happy 50th (or 60th) Birthday!**

I enjoy holiday/celebration themes. In this scene, I was imagining that it would be my birthday and perhaps an important one. I’d be MILF aged so we can discuss what options we want for the ages. I end up invited to a wedding of my friend’s daughter and have to attend myself while my husband is too busy with work. One of us must go, so i give in and do it and figure a wedding is a fun way to spend a birthday. I was planning on a wedding that’s fine but a bit boring . The evening winds down and my friend’s son a few of his friends find themselves bored as well and chat me up. This can might be split up into 2 different scenes if we wanted to focus on the birthday angle or the wedding angle.

Hey guys,

I'm graduating in May of 2019 - and have been searching for a full-time real estate job.

Some quick details:
- Moving to a different market right after graduation (from a smaller market --&gt; to Toronto)
- Finance Major, 3.3 cumulative GPA, 3.6 Major GPA
- 2 real estate internships (CBRE &amp; market research firm)

My goal:
Get a full-time job in the real estate industry in either investment sales analyst, acquisitions, debt brokerage, etc.

What my plan is: During February, the week of my spring break, I'll be flying out to Toronto for ~4 days. Prior to this, I want to set up as many coffee chats as I possibly can and cram them all in into those 4 days. Aiming for 15-30 minute chat lengths.

Right now, I'm in the process of looking up people that I want to meet with and beginning to reach out. However, I'm faced with a couple of options on how to go about this, I would love some feedback from you guys on this.

Option 1:
Reach out to industry people now by email, ask them for a phone call (remember they are across the country so can't meet them in person till Feb). Over the phone call, ask a few questions about him, the company, his role, what he thinks of X, etc. At the end of the phone call, tell him I'll be in Toronto in Feb and ask to meet for an in-person chat then.

Option 2:
Basically Option 1 but without the phone call. Cold email people I want to meet with, and in the email ask them to have a coffee chat for when I'm in Toronto in Feb.

Which one would be better? Here's another question I've been thinking about - how direct do I be about telling them I want to work in their firm? At what stage of the process do I bring this up?

Thank you very much, would love to hear any feedback or thoughts that went through your head as you read this

P.S. Been applying to open positions but no hits yet, thinking because I'm still 4 months out from being able to start."
adciu7,2,2019-01-06,How to deal with emotionally-manipulative and controlling father,IReadItDifferently,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/adciu7/how_to_deal_with_emotionallymanipulative_and/,"For a little bit of background information, I recently graduated from college and have moved back home to the Chicago area. I worked an internship last summer in Seattle, which I loved (both work and location wise). It’s important to note that Seattle is halfway across the country from my hometown. I was able to get a return offer to that company and have accepted it. I’m scheduled to begin working in about 2 months. 

I’ve found out my father’s very against me moving to Seattle for several reasons. The main things he brings up are economic (cheaper to live at home) and social (I don’t know anyone in Seattle that I can lean to for support). I will say I have a couple friends in Seattle but no family members. He firmly believes that moving to Seattle will be a very negative thing for me and that if I do that, It’s only to run away from my parents and that I should find a job near home. He went so far as to say that if I live out there for enough years than he won’t even consider me part of the family. 

A couple of other important factors to know are that my older sister did too move away from home and is on bad terms with my parents for several reasons. My parents believe that if I move away I’ll be just her, which is certainly not true. I would still do my best to maintain a good relationship with them so long as they treat me like family still. For me, moving to Seattle is an amazing opportunity, I love the city and work. In Chicago, I don’t have as many job options, any extended family I talk to, and only 2 or 3 close friends from before college.

I know that even if I stay in Chicago, it’s not going to make my family life perfect. This is because my father is controlling about many aspects of my life, not just location. For example several years ago I started dating someone from a different culture that he totally disapproves of even though he’s never met him. We never talk about my relationship because of that and I do plan to continue to date him. If I appease him about living at home, he will most likely still ostracize me one day if I chose to marry that man. 

I know most people here will just say fuck it and cut ties with my parents. I do want to say that my mom is a pretty reasonable woman whom I would love to be close to for the rest of our lives. She’s not too excited about me moving to Seattle either but I do feel that she will do her best to accept my choices and maintain a good relationship with me. How do I deal with having that type of father? If I could, I would make him see that I can make my own life choices and still be a great daughter, but I really don’t know if he’ll ever be open to that."

We began dating as freshman in college and both graduated last spring. We're currently working jobs and living on opposite coasts of the US, however we plan on moving in together within the next year and have had serious talks about getting engaged. I realize how messy this sounds, but an entire relationship is hard to contextualize in a few paragraphs. I'll try to hit all of the important details.

Our relationship has had plenty of ups and downs as all do. Before we went official we were hooking up, and I lost my virginity to her (she's been with a handful of other guys). I was more hesitant about going exclusive because I was unsure of whether I wanted to jump into a relationship so soon after starting college, but I ultimately agreed. After 6 months of officially dating I decided to break up with her. I was nervous because I felt that I wasn't in love with her, and she had confessed to me that she loved me. Keep in mind that we spent 3 of these months apart on summer break, however we were communicating daily through text and occasionally video chat. We got back together within only a few days following some long talks in which we both really opened up to each other in a way that we hadn't before.

Fast forward a year. In this time I fell deeply in love with her, and things were really great for quite a while. Until junior fall semester, a pretty significant low point in our relationship. She had grown a bit more distant and had voiced more concern in whether we were right for each other. She said 'I love you' less frequently, and we had sex slightly less frequently. I made plenty of mistakes, a lot of little things that piled up. I took our relationship for granted at times, we spent too much time with my friends, and far too little time with her and her friends, etc. Things were rough for a couple months, we talked about how she felt frequently. We cried a lot, apologized a lot, and both tried to picture our day-to-day lives without each other. I assured her that I was very in love with her, but if she wanted to end our relationship, she needed to just do it, rather than pushing it off further and causing more pain for us both in the long run. She told me that although we were in a rough patch, she wasn't ready to end it. So we continued on. In the coming months I was more proactive about being a better partner and things improved a lot. I remember her telling me that spring that our relationship was at an all-time high for her, and I was so happy that we got through it.

The summer before our senior year she was working an internship in NYC, and I was in Seattle. About 8 months had passed since our rough patch and things were still great, and naturally we started talking about our plans after this last year of school. That's when she hit me really hard with some news. She slept with one of her old friends who was back visiting campus for an alumni weekend during our rough patch. She saw him at a party, and they talked all night and eventually drunkenly went back to her place. I was away at a cross country meet that weekend.

I was devastated. Things had been going so great between us that this completely blindsided me. She told me that she couldn't continue taking things forward in our relationship until I knew. What followed were days of her begging me to give her another chance, assuring me how in love with me she was, and telling me about how she wanted to move in with me after graduation. If this came out at any other point in our relationship I would have ended it on the spot, but I was so in love with her, and hearing her sob and promise that she could never hurt me like this again made it so hard to leave. I realized that this part isn't exactly what you picture when you play through these hypothetical situations in your head.

I decided to give her another chance. For reference we had been dating 2 and a half years at this point. It was a long healing process for me, and I'm still not completely over it (if this post didn't make that obvious). A year and a half have passed since she came out to me, we're both still in love, but I haven't yet felt the same high about our relationship that I did before I found out. BUT, I'm getting better with time! I've seen noticeable improvement with my happiness in our relationship as time has gone on. Just this past month I was able to send her a really heartfelt text message about my feelings for her (while sober). I know this seems small but expressing my feelings like that was something I struggled to do for a long time following the incident.

We didn't end up moving in together after college because of our job situations. I think that giving it some more time was actually a positive thing. We visit each other frequently though, and now are starting to seriously plan moving in together. I genuinely believed her when I listened to how broken up she was when she promised to never hurt me like that again. If I'm being honest, I don't know if I ever would have found out if she didn't confess to me.

Before I go forward with such a major life decision (moving in together would involve one of us leaving a job and moving across the country), am I making a mistake? I know how anti-cheating this sub tends to be, so I'm curious to hear what you guys think.

addiu2,32,2019-01-06,Larissa vs Fernanda: play by play analysis,mugrita,90DayFiance,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/addiu2/larissa_vs_fernanda_play_by_play_analysis/,"Ok I know this just happened so I may be missing lots of things, so please feel free to chime in on thoughts re: points so I can edit this accordingly.

**Tell-All Outfits**

Fernanda’s dress is a standard “tight party dress.” Larissa is also wearing a tight party dress, but it’s very blah compared to Fernanda’s. I assume she would have worn something more  “Kardashian-ee” if her luggage wasn’t lost. Unfortunately for Larissa, she had to make do with whatever spandex dress the Sharp intern could find at Rainbow.

Point: Fernanda (+1)

**First Insult**

Fernanda gets one right out of the gate by telling Shaun that the tell all was much better before Colt and Larissa arrived. Larissa basically tells her to shut up and no one likes her because she doesn’t have “charisma.” Weak, Larissa.

Point: Fernanda (+1)

**Explaining the Feud**

Shaun asks the two to explain the feud between them. Larissa gives a half-hearted explanation about how she was trying to show her “fans” that her legal troubles were not keeping her down. Fernanda tries to interject, Larissa screeches to shut her down.

Shaun tries to ask Fernanda about her side and Larissa keeps screaming to drown Fernanda out. The other 90 day cast members become visibly annoyed. Jay stands up and paces angrily and Asuelu smacks his own head and yells that he wants to hear.

It’s not the most mature response but it is an effective strategy to keep the attention on Larissa, even if it’s negative attention.

Point: Larissa (+0.5)

**Insults**

I’ll need family Reddit’s help to catalog all the insults and their points worth because this was all reality tv gold.

Coltee: calls Jon out on buying a child bride. Unfortunately the impact is drowned out by the screeching. (+5 to Larissa)

Jon: Calls Coltee out for living at home with his mother. Again, impact diminished due to the screeching (+5 to Fernanda, UPDATE: points now +3 because it has been pointed out that Colt lives with Debbie for her necessity and yo momma jokes are weak. If Jon insulted Colt’s moobs, we might have had something here)

Fernanda gives Larissa the middle finger by pretending to scratch her nose. Juvenile but it sets Larissa off. (+1 to Fernanda)

Larissa: “Try to buy a butt” (+5 to Larissa)

Everyone is clearly annoyed with Larissa: (+3 to Fernanda)

ETA: Additional insults, thanks to Family Reddit

Fernanda tells Shaun that Larissa is jealous of Fernanda’s looks. Larissa calls Fernanda a bag of bones. (+3 to Larissa. I would have given Larissa more points if she got a dig in about Fer’s boob job and/or Fer’s cheap looking tassel earrings.)

When Larissa keeps telling Fernanda to shut up, Fernanda mocks her accent by repeating “shut upee.” (+10 points to Fernanda. I’m sorry Larissa fans but that was an excellent burn. If only Larissa shot back “Yes I have an accent and so do you. Shamee on you bitch.” [side note: remember the happier days when Larissa would answer Instagram questions in Portuguese?])

Larissa tells Fernanda to “show some respect you  f*cking brat”. Amazing. Unfortunately, we already had a discussion about RESPECKT with Steven and it was agreed that one cannot demand respect without first giving it. Sorry, Larissa. (+3 to Larissa)

**Total score:**

Fernanda: +11 (UPDATE: now +18)

Larissa: +10.5 (UPDATE: now 16.5)

She was so teeny tiny every time I saw her. She was eating such well rounded, full meals in the nursing home that she actually gained weight! The Alzheimer’s had made her forget how much she cared about keeping her figure. I said I would pull myself together and get my act together, do well in my classes, find an internship or a job or something. But I couldn’t cope.

adeqsj,4,2019-01-07,Frustrated with my husband. Seeking advice.,clairebearcd,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adeqsj/frustrated_with_my_husband_seeking_advice/,"So, we’re (m24, f23) high school sweethearts, been married for three years this coming February. We’ve had our ups and downs and lately we’ve been on an up. The holidays were really nice to spend time together, especially after a stressful semester for myself, with a 2 hours commute to school with public transit, 16 credits, a research project, and 2 part time jobs. 


Anyways, I was reading another post today about how many girls in relationships mother their SO. Or basically a lot of guys are lazy and don’t help out and act like adults. Which kind of got me on a thinking rant because today my SO came to me all sad saying he fucked up (AGAIN) and didn’t have enough money for rent when it was due at the latest the 5th of every month. Sooooo yesterday.  Along with that he ‘forgot’ to do the dishes for the third day in the row and left out of town today for a work retreat. Guess who got to do the dishes again? Me. Ugh. 

His car and office are always a complete pigsty. Rotting food, dirty plates on his desk, garbage everywhere.  He’s always saying that I get mad and stupid stuff and that I’m so irritable. But it’s like Jesus dude. You live in filth and when I tell you to clean up you don’t because you don’t care. Apparently I have too high of a cleaning standard and if they don’t match, since he doesn’t give a shit, it’s not his fault if he doesn’t clean as much as me. 

It just gets so old having to live with this person who is so forgetful and doesn’t care. The worst part is, is he’s super smart. But doesn’t apply himself. He won’t just fucking work. 

Like our fafsa got cut this year for school, and he didn’t have money to pay for the rest of tuition ($1000-1500ish) so he took the semester off and didn’t take any classes to work full time and practice with the lacrosse team for the spring. 

Guess what. He barely worked part time throughout the whole semester, and didn’t save any money for this spring’s tuition or for the lacrosse team. 

So no money for rent, no money to pay for tuition or lacrosse. 

Meanwhile I just had to pay out of pocket $1,800 to fix my car (fuck 2010 BMW mini coppers) and another $1,300 for dental work that I’ve literally post poned since this summer because I haven’t been able to afford to get this root canal done. And I have tuition too! I go to a more expensive university so idk how I’m gonna pay that. And as previously stated I work my ass off in school. I’m about to do a 17 hour credit semester and a new internship that’ll lower my monthly income. 

So yeah. I don’t want to mother him. But it feels like I’m constantly nagging him about how it’s his turn to take out the trash or do the dishes or how he owes me money for this or that, or how he needs to go to fucking work because it’s 12pm. (I was a waitress, my last day was yesterday, so I have weird hours. He works at a medical software company as a coding intern) 

Bottom line I love him and don’t want to leave him because I love him. But he won’t grow up and it’s literally a mental and a financial burden on me. It’s like if we’re ever going to have a family, which we want to in a few years, how am I supposed to even trust that he’ll be able to support us and take care of our family while my working hours may cut down due to have a kid? 

Sorry this is long but I realize it was a must needed venting session. Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any advice on how to get him to grow up and act like an adult. 

Tdrl: I love my husband but he’s irresponsible, forgetful and unreliable. He didn’t work enough to pay for rent, tuition or lacrosse for this spring semester. He most always forgets to help with household chores and has lower cleaning standard than me so he doesn’t help as much as I do. Tired of it and looking for advice.

adf2s5,3,2019-01-07,Please Help Me (23M) Fight My Insecurity,FirmAardvark,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adf2s5/please_help_me_23m_fight_my_insecurity/,"This is a throwaway account, sort of. I do not intend to use my main account as I use my full name in it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I (23M) have been dating this girl (20F) for 6 months now. We are both uni students and we met each other at work. We connected with each other rather quickly as there are some things we can relate to. I personally came from a relationship full of gaslighting whilst she has been in an abusive relationship as well (Pls do PM me if you need more info on this. I don't think it's pertinent to the topic I'm discussing though)

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, we get along really well. We're open with each other. We communicate on our issues, insecurities and both of us constantly try to help each other in this trying times (We both have financial and familial issues aside from school). Money issue is well, money related and nothing to write about. As for family, we are an interracial couple and as of now GF's dad is adamant that she should marry someone her race.

&amp;#x200B;

So, it kind of brings me to this. I think everything is going on quite well for the both of us. Except that she is now on a month long internship abroad since December 2018. We've been having long distance for a while now. I think this is not an issue for the both of us since we chat every night and always happy to keep each other updated on what we are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

At work though, there seems to be this one guy who came from the same country currently on contract employment (Previously was an intern but rehired after the December break). Her internship place has this group and she sometimes shares her chats to me. Mostly talking about food but there is this one message that came from the other coworker seemingly shipping her and that guy. She herself said that she is glad because then she don't have to use that foreign language all the time to talk in the office now that there's someone from a relatable country (Same race too. Probably her dad would most likely approve). And idk why I got the feeling he might be interested in her.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not the first time I realised someone has a crush on her. She doesn't really know it until I point it out to her but then once she does she will promptly settle the issue. She also told me that she's not interested in going out on sort of a date with any guy except me. I too reciprocate that sentiment as we want to be exclusive to each other. Yet still, I am constantly feeling insecure. What if he can provide better for her? What if I end up a complete failure?

&amp;#x200B;

I really feel like a piece of crap for having this thought. I know people always say that once she chooses you, she chooses you and that's the end of it. Part of me accepts that, but then there is always this thing going on in my mind. I have talked about this many times and she reassures me tirelessly. I really do not want to keep bringing up the same crap to her. I don't want to rile her up with this stupid thought

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, I really see a future with her and I really want to make this work. If possible I would really love an advice or two in shaking this thought off or perhaps you see an issue within me. In which case then i humbly ask for your input

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for the time and attention, and I really hoped I did not offend anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: I have yet to sleep for 2 days since I've been doing some lab work. Pardon my overshare if any and if there is any error grammatically or anything I'll fix it soon. My mind is in a bit of a mess right now"

I wasn't going to let my senior year in college rush by me. I needed to make the most of it, at least that's what all of my family and friends would tell me. Some might consider joining a club, going to more events, getting internship. I had more exciting things in mind. With my sights set on a celebrity (preferably, Hailee Steinfeld, but I'll include a list below of some favorites), I was ready to create my new slave. It may take awhile to finally meet her in person, but the end result will be worth it. 

So how would I change this famous, head-strong celebrity into a slave for my use? Needless to say, you can find almost anything on the internet. Without complete confidence in its ability, I get my hands on a drug that fosters an addiction to cum. Such an unhealthy and constant addiction is going to ruin her image and career, but also ensure I have a loving slave who will do anything for a single drop of my seed...

I'd love to play this out with someone. We can discuss more details when you reach out. I love the slow burn of someone changing and becoming a cum addicted slave. If you're interested, kik me at HelloMySlave

adf9mk,5,2019-01-07,Boyfriend [21m] still talks to the girl[19f] that he hooked up with before me [21f],bamboozled217,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/adf9mk/boyfriend_21m_still_talks_to_the_girl19f_that_he/,"Let me start off by saying that i generally believe you shouldn't really tell your partner who they can and cannot be friends with because that is controlling and can cause resentment and whatnot. My Bf has a lot of female friends which I don't mind but one girl in particular bugs me and i don't know if Im just being crazy and jealous or if i am valid in being upset.

&amp;#x200B;
I met my bf at the end of August and we were dating until he asked me to be his gf 2 months ago. Over the summer he had an internship in another state and while there had a little fling with a girl. They were never officially together but they hooked up and saw each other nearly everyday right up until he left (about 2 weeks before we met).
&amp;#x200B;

When we first talked about her he said he missed her at first but then got back into school life and moved on/forgot about her. a few weeks later I figured out who she was and discovered they were still texting and snapchatting. we weren't dating at the time but i still asked him about it and at first he outright lied and denied it was even her but eventually admitted it was.
&amp;#x200B;

He claimed they just have friendly conversation now sometimes and she even tells him about guys she hooks up with now (which i thought was kind of weird because i feel like typically girls only really tell guy friends about their hookups if they are either really really close, or if shes lowkey showing off a little letting him know shes available/DTF and/or trying to make him jealous/think about her in that way). He also said he never really liked her and that she was a brat but she had a nice beach house and only wants to stay in contact because her dad is rich/well connected. He assured me that i shouldn't worry because he is never going to see her again anyway.
&amp;#x200B;

a series of unfortunate events then occurred in my life so i dropped the issue and we moved on. Since then, I have continued to see her name pop up on his phone (texts and snapchats) and he often angles his phone away from me when using it so i can't see the screen. I never said anything but i did notice how often her name shows up. at one point he asked how i would feel if she visited and if i didn't like t he would just tell her not to come. i told him i didn't like the idea of her coming down and sleeping in the same room as him. a few weeks later he mentioned that she was going to come down but she asked him to pay for her plane ticket and he said no. to me that meant he hadn't told her no when i said i was uncomfortable and they had gone ahead and tried to make plans for her to come but the only thing that stopped him was the money. (this was all before we were officially together.)
&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago i saw that he had commented on a series of her, shall we say, strategically posed bathing suit vacation shots. i asked him about her again and he said he ""doesnt talk to her anymore"" (which is funny bc just last week i had seen she was texting him). this really pissed me off and i tried to explain how they way he hasn't been straight up about her in the past with me has made me feel as if he is hiding something and honestly it hurts me because i start assuming the worst. He apologized for making me uncomfortable and said he will be more open with me in the future and again promised i had nothing to worry about.
&amp;#x200B;

this was all over text as he is currently in another country and will be for the next week. I feel like he isn't really taking things seriously and won't really change what he's doing (he didnt last time it was an issue). I just don't know if he really understands why it upsets me or maybe he just doesn't care. I don't know what else to say to him in person when he get's back and i feel like i can't just tell him they can't be friends and whatnot. what upsets me the most is how he hasn't been honest about her in the past and the fact that i dont really know her intentions with him either (i don't even know if she knows i am in the picture). if he truly doesn't really care about her then why bother to continue keeping in touch and all that? sometimes i think maybe i'm just being crazy/jealous/bitter but am i really or do i have a valid reason to be annoyed/upset/concerned about her?

**TLDR: Bf of 2 months had a long term hookup with a girl right before we met. He no continues to text/snapchat her and comment on her insta posts all while downplaying/sometimes lying to me about their relationship and I'm not sure how to really put the issue to bed or if i am being crazy/jealous/over-analyzing**"
adfbh6,32,2019-01-07,AITA for thinking I should not pay?,throwaway1946392211,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/adfbh6/aita_for_thinking_i_should_not_pay/,"Sorry for the long post, the full story requires some background.

I’m currently in college and was born into a well off family, enough to be considered top 5% of the income distribution in my country. It was not always this way though, my parents came from honest backgrounds contributing their paychecks to their respective utilities bills as teenagers each month. 

I’ve been fortunate to not have to work for the same reasons and during the summers I used to work to have spending money to have liberties to spend in what I wanted and still contribute.

I decided to commute from college voluntarily which involves a moderate hour commute each way every day and I’m paying for the insurance of the vehicle which amounts to somewhere around $2000 USD each year. The car is electric and cost to power it is very cheap.


Now here’s the issue:

This past semester I’ve failed a course and I’m at risk of losing my internship that I’ve worked hard to obtain. I’m broken every time I see my grades. He says the only way for me to understand what I did is to pay back the credits I failed. I fully understand how I possibly fucked up my immediate future but I haven’t been able to afford anything since he wants to me to try to be partially finically independent. The past summer job was only able to cover the last 6 months and I’m still on the hook for the next 6 and the 6 after IF i start my internship. 

I also feel He’s been unfair as of lately. I pay for all my leisure expenses from video games to dinners with my gf. Since I haven’t been working I’m almost out of funds yet my younger brother for the most part gets everything he asks for no questions asked. This holidays I wasn’t able to afford a christmas gift for my gf and felt ashamed to bring it up to her. I had to cover my expenses out of my account for the secret santa my family forced me into while my brother had his fully paid for by my father. I feel the extra burden of paying the credits is alot specially if I am to have no job while studying and may not even have a well paying job this coming summer.

I understand my dad wants to teach me a lesson, but is it really the right way? I’m young but I feel this is a lot to handle.

So reddit, AITA for not wanting to pay the credits?"
adfq3c,10,2019-01-07,Advice for Self-Employed CPA,Kronseyes,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/adfq3c/advice_for_selfemployed_cpa/,"Hello, 

I'm glad I found this subreddit. My family has had a rough go of it the last few years, and I am considering a change from self employment to industry or possibly switch to financial planning (work at an RIA). I apologize in advance as I'm guessing this will be a long post :)

About Me:

Me - 33m, CPA license holder in Midwest City/town  (population 200k). I have a SAHW who is 32. We have two sons, 6 &amp; 3. I am our sole provider. 

Professional Background:

I've worked in public accounting my entire professional career (a little over a decade now). I started as an intern at a small firm, then interned at a larger firm, then graduated and started in the tax department of a regional firm. After making senior left for more moey at a smaller firm. Stayed there for a few years before venturing out on my own in 2015 (basically was a manger without the formal title as the firm wasn't big enough for it to matter). All tax and small business financial statements, zero audit experience.

My practice is primarily made up of successful small business owners. I provide them monthly bookkeeping/accounting, tax prep and planning, and payroll oversight. My business is a nice size in that it isn't too huge or too many hours while still provideing a nice income. 

I do some fairly complex accrual accounting for a few clients in the $5M sales range, but many clients are closer to $500k - $1M in annual sales. So the monthly accounting work doesn't have much complexity (considering for transferrable skills).

Health Problems:

Unfortunately in December of 2016 I had an emergency surgery and a subsequent diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Due to timing of surgery, I didn't have time to get signed up for health insurance on the ACA for 2017. Previously we had used a cost sharing healthcare ministry which was great while healthy, but now needing ongoing care wasn't going to cut it.

Unfortunately that meant either coming up with $30-$40k a year for self pay medicine (Remicade) or going without. I chose to go without and spent most of 2017 just trying to keep my business from failing. The pain and problems were pretty severe and I was spending upwards of 6-8 hours a day laying in bed from pain and exhaustion.

Fast forward to 2018 and I signed up for health insurance. I started on Remicade infusions and starting feeling better almost immidiately. I was still having some issues with fatigue, but nothing compared to 2017. 

Life was starting to look a little better, and I went to see a plastic surgeon for what I thought to be a small cyst on my left jaw. Turns out it was a parotid tumor. Had to have it removed by an ENT surgeon and there was a possibility of cancer. Surgery was in August and was successful (tumor wasn't cancerous and they didn't clip any nerves), but the recovery was very slow. He basically had to cut the whole side of my face open to see what he was doing. I think I had around 50 stitches to show for it. That area of my face looks completely different now as he had to remove that entire gland as well (wanted to be cautious about cancer).

As 2018 came to a close, I have also been suffering from a bad case of gout in my knee. I'm sure all this sounds utterly crazy/ridiculous, but unfortunately it is all true. I have a lot of anxiety thinking about the next issue/problem that could arise.

ACA Scares:

So with those health problems mentioned above, having good health insurance is absolutely essential for me physically and then for both of our mental sanity. 

I am fortunate that we live a pretty frugal life which allows for us to sock away a good amount of money in pre-tax retirement accounts which qualifies us for CSR and APTC credits on our ACA plan.

With the Texas judge's ruling about constitutionality of the ACA and the Republicans promise to repeal and replace, we feel very unsure to continue to count on the ACA as a viable long term option. 

If preexisting conditions were allowed back on the table, I would be uninsurable. 

Also, if the tax credits were taken off the table, the cost might become prohibitive (monthly premiums for 2019 would have been $1,800/month with high deductibles on top of that).

Note: I know there are a lot of politics wrapped up in the ACA, but I would prefer to leave that out of the discussion if possible.

Options Moving Forward:

So with the above in mind, I am very nervous to continue down this path with little contingencies in place.

Option 1 - Stay the Course

I obviously have the option to just keep doing what I'm doing. A few problems even outside of ACA: I'm very beat down and tired from the past two years. I am fortunate that I don't work more than 50 hours/week during tax season and about 30/week outside of that, but as anyone who had owned a business knows you still think about it after hours. It isn't like a job you leave at 5 pm even if I technically leave at 5 pm. Because of my mental state, I'm not sure if continuing on without major changes is the best option.

I do not have any desire to try to grow and hire employees at this point. I just don't have the energy to do so right now. 

Option 2 - Sell business and work in corporate accounting

I haven't really mentioned this above, but I am burnt out from doing taxes and have no desire to continue providing tax services. So I am not going to sell and work in public again. I would rather die a slow painful death than work in another tax department at a firm.

I would also like to stay away from industry tax jobs. I really overall dislike taxes if you can't tell :)

I think that leaves the financial accounting, analyst, eventually controller route. I'm really green on opportunities here so any advice you all would have based on my experience would be great.

Option 3 - Sell business and work for RIA

This is probably an option better suited for another group, but I have a lot of experience helping and designing 401k and profit sharing plans. I also do some financial planning with my clients. I have a passion for financial education and think this would be a good fit. I'd just need to find the right opportunity. I'd be willing to get the CFP as well and have already passed the Series 65. A potential downside is that many RIAs are smallish in size and don't always offer good benefits.

Option 4 - Wife get a job with benefits

It is important to know that my wife does not have a college degree nor many high paying skills. She is ready and willing to get training, certificates, or degrees, but we would prefer for her to stay home and care for our boys if at all possible. We homeschool our oldest son and plan on continuing that all the way to graduation with our youngest so another 15 years unless she would have to seek outside employment. So this is really a last case resort and I would feel like a total failure if she had to do this unless I truly am unable to work.

Other Highlights/Points

As I'm sure you can gather from reading this, my wife and I are really beat down and discouraged from this rough time in our lives. I'm physically, emotionally and spiritually exhausted from it all and so is she. She was basically my full time caretaker during 2017 and has never really had the chance to rest/recover. 

If seeking outside employment, I would be looking for a very set work schedule. I am a hard worker, but I have no desire to do 50+ hour work weeks. I understand accounting has deadlines, but I have no interest in a hard grind for the foreseeable future. I want to work hard while I'm at work and then go home and enjoy my family and not have to think about it til I get up the next morning. 

Our city isn't exactly booming. There are only a few public companies and both pay shitty wages. We realize it will probably be in our best interest to move to a larger market if we go through with selling the business and finding a job. We would prefer to stay in the Midwest. Not sure it matters, but DFW or Kansas City would probably be our top two choices.

Benefits are really important. Especially good health insurance. So that probably rules out most small businesses (at least that has been my experience). Retirement benefits are very important as well as I am a strong saver and am hopeful to retire at around 50 (health insurance being the great unknown).

I think that is everything. Please feel free to ask questions if more details would be helpful.

Overall I'm asking for advice on potential options, potential job titles to look for, and potential pay and benefits to expect with everything I have described.

Thanks for reading!"

Clarisights is a data ingestion and analytics platform that enables marketers to make sense of and gain unique insights from data coming in from all the sources (analytics, ads data, CRM, Payroll, etc). Our platform is a seamless in browser experience - the users just add the data sources they want to track, our backend then pulls in data from those resources and stores it into our own database. The user then proceeds to the visualisation page to create the required data visualisations.

Clarisights was founded to empower performance marketing and growth teams by creating a platform that gives them insights and superhero powers they have always wanted. Rather than wrestling with outdated spreadsheets and BI platforms that can't keep pace with their growing volume of marketing channels and data, marketers can use Clarisights to independently explore and analyse all their data in a single and intuitive interface. Marketing teams around the world use Clarisights for every aspect of their performance marketing workflow - from integrating with data channels, creating and optimising dashboards, and collaborating with teammates - all in real time!

adjgp0,10,2019-01-07,A 2019 16in12 - Looking for Feedback,SSSkies27,12in12,https://www.reddit.com/r/12in12/comments/adjgp0/a_2019_16in12_looking_for_feedback/,"Well, with a new year comes another mountain of backlog games to be completed. After having a rather mediocre year in terms of numerical progress last year I'm going to be a little more strategic with my list. To ensure that I make a larger dent in my backlog I've laid out a set of ground rules for the coming year.

1. I can only buy a maximum of two games at launch the entire year, all other new releases must be bought at least 6 months after the release date (taking a page out of r/patientgamers book here).
2. I can't buy any games during sales (eg; Steam, PSN sales) unless one of the following requirements are met:
   1. If it's a short-medium length game, I've recently beaten at least two games of the same length or less.
   2. If it's a longer game, I've beaten a game of similar length in the past few months.
   3. My backlog size has decreased to at least the low 20s.
3. Preferably keep buying games in bulk to one or two major sales a year (eg, Summer/E3 sales, Black Friday, Winter/Holiday sales).
4. Only add free games from subscription programs like PS Plus or Twitch Prime to my backlog if the game is one I really want to try or doesn't have a long completion time.

This way I'm not cutting off myself from buying games completely, or forcing myself to miss out on all the new releases coming out (especially since 2019 seems like it might be another case of 2017 for new game releases), but I'm also pushing myself to focus more on my backlog itself.

As for my list, I'm not going to be assigning any game to a specific month since I have no idea what kind of time I'll have on my hands in the coming months considering I'll be balancing college, work, and an internship for at least the first half of the year. I'm also going to try to balance out my list with a variety of shorter and longer games. Last year, it was really difficult for me to tackle as many 60+ hour games as I had listed, so I'm going to mix more short-medium length games in from my backlog.

As for my list, this year, I decided to go for a smaller number of 16 instead of last year's 24. That way, my list is more of a baseline than it is a schedule of games to beat. I can prioritize those 16 games, but not be tied down to trying out other games in between. These can be played or beaten in no particular order (for the exception of games that are sequels of course).  By the end of the year, these are the games I want to finish:

**2019 List**

1. Golf Story (Switch) **(Completed 1/6/2019)**
2. Half Life 2 (PC - Steam)
3. Half Life 2 Episode 1 (PC - Steam)
4. Half Life 2 Episode 2 (PC - Steam)
5. Final Fantasy VIII (PC)
6. Final Fantasy X (PS2)
7. Tales of Zestiria (PS4)
8. Bioshock 2 (PS4)
9. Bioshock Infinite (PS4)
10. Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle (Switch)
11. Horizon Zero Dawn (PS4)
12. Bayonetta (Switch)
13. Bayonetta 2 (Switch)
14. God of War (PS4)
15. Fallout 3 (PC - Steam)
16. Assasin's Creed IV: Black Flag (PC)

This is just a rough list of course. If anyone here is more familiar with these games, do you think this list is too ambitious? I know I have some lengthier games on here and I want to make sure I balance it out with some short-medium length games. I have some shorter titles on my backlog that I may swap out the longer ones with if this could be too much. Also, how do my rules for buying new games sound? Are they too lenient or too strict? I'm trying to set up a system that will actually work.

Anyways, here's to hoping for a great 2019!"
adjqdc,3,2019-01-07,"Undeclared 2nd year, yikes.",DolphinStar33,CollegeMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeMajors/comments/adjqdc/undeclared_2nd_year_yikes/,"okay so here's the deal, I'm a second-year second-semester student at a pricey liberal arts college in the middle of nowhere. My family is not rich so I have to be out in the normal 4 years to 5, here is my dilemma: I have no idea what to major in. I've narrowed this thing down to like 3 options, Computer Science, Information Systems, and Actuarial Science. 

&amp;#x200B;

CompSci - A good major, not perfect by any means especially with the fact that the department is small and underfunded at my college. Meaning the compsci education being offered most likely isn't the best for the money in the state.

Information systems - an okay major not anything to write home about, when I look at the numbers for this it doesn't look the best. By that I mean they're paid less and more underemployed than the compsci major. 

Actuarial Science - I've always had issues with math and stuff, but here's why, a lot of people I talk to just say I sound like an actuary and to pursue this degree. I live in a place where a lot of actuaries dwell, an insurance mecca. The road to being an actuary is a long road and the major is like a straight narrow one with not a lot of pathways.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright enough whining here are things I'm holding constant here,

no major is perfect

just because the major opens a lot of doors doesn't mean I'll like each door

I cannot be in college for more than 5 years 

Each major requires additional education/certification to get jobs.

I need an internship quicc as fricc or I'm gonna explode, because most internships require me to be pursuing a degree and in order to get these jobs I have to have at least one by junior year.

the brain doesn't stop developing, so additional education/certification won't kill me.

Math won't kill me because of Khan Academy. 

I need to practice coding more but it's difficult as for most hackerrank and geeksforgeeks stuff I just draw blanks.

Yeah so here is this dumpster fire feel free to grab an extinguisher and help me out fellas.

adkie3,1,2019-01-07,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/adkie3/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good afternoon, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! It's a new one, so I'm sure there are kinks to work out along the way, but I really like the concept!

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"

(f,21 and m, 23)",lovergirlxoxo18,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adlbez/stringing_along_vs_cautiously_approaching/,"So him and I have been seeing each other exclusively (or so he says on his side) for a bit over three months.
In the beginning we met up for dinner, hit off well, and agreed to meet again.
Fast forward a few dates later, we slept together and later, we discovered we liked each other, but he didn’t want to admit it at first since he’d had a traumatic break up in the past and didn’t want to be the one to express feelings first because it would “put him in a position of vulnerability”. So we avoided labels, due to its commitment stereotypes, and plus we are both busy college students (who go to separate yet nearby schools).
Our dates/hangouts have been once weekly. We usually do what’s best for both our schedules to fit each other in. Sometimes we go out for dinner. Sometimes he’ll cook for me. Other times we’ll share drinks with Netflix. No matter what we did, we’d have amazing conversations, and We just really click in physical affection (I.e. kisses have sparks flying for both of us etc). And we’d spend the night together and he’d have to drive and drop me off back at my place the next morning. 
And now, it’s been three months, we’re still seeing each other exclusively. But a few changes. Before holiday break, we’d discussed experimentation on meeting during the daytime (before, we were limited to evening hangouts only since my classes ended at night) and trying out more things in bed.  
The other day, he wanted to buy me a sex toy. 
Then, later that night we were having a nice sober talk. We reminisced about childhood memories, talked about our families. Our new year’s resolutions. He showed me his plans for the semester, and asked what times would be best for us to see each other each week. Then, he asked me what we would do for the summer (esp with internships coming up). And even alluded to us being “one of those attractive couples” after we both get into our New Years resolution of hitting the gym periodically.
I really want to ask him, but I’m worried that it’ll scare him off, or make me look desperate, since that night was the first night that he’d ever talked to me about us in a future tense; and he knows I like him, since I was the first to admit my feelings since the beginning.
So I guess, do you guys think that he’s slowly easing us into a committed relationship but is perhaps a little scared to admit it?
Or do you think he’s just been playing me the whole time, and plans to string me along for the summer?
What should I do?"
adlkpm,2,2019-01-07,"M4F married couples, threesomes, and more",MrCoffeeNJ,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/adlkpm/m4f_married_couples_threesomes_and_more/,"Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous college student. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. NOTE: all characters are over 18, and actual incest doesn't necessarily come into play. This is more about a married couple spicing things up.

COUPLES' CABIN This is a fairly straightforward setup. Two couples (or more, if you prefer) spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods where the fireplace is warm, hot-tub steamy, and walls are thin. Over the course of the weekend, they all start to loosen-up and let go. This might include some voyeurism (listening/spying on the other couple); exhibitionism (showing off for the others); bi-play (girls and/or guys get friendly with one another); swaps; or group sex. I'd be ok with some jealousy, reluctance, or other drama if you want to spice things up too. THE

NEIGHBORS' DAUGHTER A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could college or post-college in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.

ABUSES OF POWER A single mom desperately wants to get her daughter into the best high school in the community, but her grades just aren't good enough. She meets with the school's principal to discuss her options; he suggests there may a way he'd agree, involving a late night visit to her house. I'd also be up for anything involving a married couple spicing things up."

adm2b3,1,2019-01-07,Need mentorship .,Arcadian2,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/adm2b3/need_mentorship/,"I (male and pakistani) was a kid  that was in clinical depression triggered by the time i was 8 years old.  It affected my memory, my personality and made me an anxious wreck that was afraid to even open the door or provide water to the guest as i believed i won't be able to do that as well. 

My father was an extremely strict  man as well that was not above telling me how useless i am every living moment of my life since i couldn't do what normal people my age would do. I did my metric with 60 percent and FSC with 59 percent and somehow got admission in a good university in computer science.

The stress lead me to snap and had a physical fight with the course lecturer. I was suspended and i took a decision of getting professional help or else i genuinely feared i was going to kill myself. 

It took me some forcing and i was able to finally get help with a psychiatrist Dr Fareed Minhas in islamabad. took me 4 years to recover but it was not enough for me to complete my degree. 

I did what i had to do create a fake degree and showed it to my dad. 

last year i decided to restart my studies and this is now going to be the second semester but by the time i would be finished i would be 30 years old. 

I knew basics of programming so i am looking for jobs and internships but i don't know  how i would get them and  I don't have references.  

I do have an internship (i personally call it a job as i want it to be) but its unpaid (i personally don't have an issue with it ) but my dad is now getting agitated my family is now starting to fuck me over with how i am unable to get a decent Job even now. 


I am tired of living a life of lies and life of expectations. I don't know what to do. I have fought all my life with obstacles that no one saw, no one endured. 

I don't know what to do anymore i am looking for jobs but who will take me a man with nothing but an FSC(basically high school degree) degree and no Job experience. I tried working on call centers but i couldn't because the stress that i have endured has physically manifested in the form of strutting  that i was not born with but is now my identity. 

At this point of time i am looking for a way out this mess which i know will take time. I believe that my only way out is to code and code  meanwhile i'll get my degree as well.   

I know website exist with programming challenges but please right now all  i want a human connection.I know all of you are busy so i am not asking for much . 
If you are a web developer all i ask for is an hour or two of you every few days so you can personally guide me  and help me get skill needed through a series of tasks as well as a check on me. 

I know that websites exists with coding challenges and i know that people are very helpful here on reddit as well but  at this time i feel  that i just can't proceed alone  and that if i do i will fail like all other times.

adm3af,3,2019-01-07,[RF] An Inch to the Left,TimesNewCarthaginian,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/adm3af/rf_an_inch_to_the_left/,"Denny Telson grew up in Harvest, Texas, a moderately sized town of about 100,000. It was close to Houston, at least in Texas terms, which meant it was about a two hour drive. His parents were hard-working, they both held jobs but were always home on time for family dinners in the evening. The family was solidly middle class, his mother Ruth worked as an administrative assistant for a nonprofit organization that provided university scholarships for children with disabilities and his father Logan was a golfing supply store manager. They were political moderates and religiously moderate and while they didn’t attend church every Sunday, they tried to go as often as they could.

Both of Denny’s parents had spent their whole lives in East Texas. They moved to Harvest not long after they were married. As young newlyweds, for their honeymoon they had gone to Mexico to see pyramids and white sand beaches with stunning turquoise waters. But they had been disappointed with their first few nights in Mexico City and when Logan got food poisoning in Cancun, they cut the rest of their trip short and came back to Texas. A few years later they had a redo on the honeymoon and went to Key West instead, which they liked fine. That was about as far as they wanted to go. Aside from a few trips around Texas, to Dallas to Austin and to Lubbock to visit family, they didn’t travel much. 

And they weren’t bored or felt like anything was lacking in their lives, they had other things they liked to use their time and money for: there was the mortgage, there were vet bills for their pets and car payments to make, there were plans to put a swimming pool in their backyard, and there were savings accounts for the kids they wanted someday, and maybe their kids wanted to go to college, and maybe once in a while they wanted that new TV or they wanted a new mattress, and the years came and came and didn’t slow down and they just didn’t think much of leaving Harvest during that time.

After Denny and his twin sister Carolyn were born, their early childhood was much like any others in Harvest. Both were relatively smart children compared to their classmates, both were relatively well behaved, but the twins began to diverge in personality and temperament once they were about eight years old. Carolyn was sunny and extroverted, she was well-liked by the other girls in town and spent a lot of time at birthday parties, princess parties, soccer parties, church youth parties, and learning to play the piano and golf with her father. 

Denny was different. He was often ill as a child and spent a lot of time in bed watching VHS tapes rented from the library in a tiny TV in his room or reading library books while he waited for the perennial cold or flu or sore throat or sinus infection or ear infection to pass. He was quiet. He was reserved. He had few friends, and spent much of his free time looking at books, watching TV, drawing comic books, riding his bike, walking in the woods, and playing with the Telson dog, cat, and rabbit. His parents didn’t think much of it at the time, Denny never seemed unhappy, he didn’t get into trouble, he was polite and mostly got along with his sister. 

In particular, Denny’s favorite book was a world atlas he checked out from the library over and over again until a kindly librarian gave it to him as a Christmas present. He spent hours pouring over the world map alone, tracing his finger across Texas, down to Mexico, south and even further south, all the way down to Chile and Argentina, and then that great white mystery at the edge of the world: Antarctica. He’d cross the ocean and trace along the West African coast, he’d pause along the Himalayas, tap each of the tiny Pacific Island nations that seemed almost lost in that vast empty ocean. He mouthed out the names of tiny microstates in Europe: Andorra, Lichtenstein, San Marino, The Vatican. He marveled at how Russia seemed to stretch across half the world, in the west it seemed right next to Germany and Poland, and in the east it practically rubbed against Japan and South Korea.

He devoured the articles and paragraphs in the Atlas in the way that some children his age devoured video games or baseball cards or Halloween candy. He spent a long time pondering what he had read about the Sahara desert, about the Amazon rainforest, about Hinduism in India, about British colonization in Australia, about herds of migrating wildebeest in the Serengeti, and the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Even as he grew older, when he was ten, eleven, and twelve, much of the context was lost on his young mind, and he didn’t understand everything he read, far from it, but this didn’t deter him. If anything, the fact that whatever he read prompted far more questions in his mind, only encouraged him to read more and watch more documentaries on TV. 

Some days, like during a lackluster sermon, on long bus rides to school in the early morning, or lying by the pool in the afternoon heat, Denny turned all kinds of questions over and over in his head: What kinds of prayers did people say at weddings in Nepal in the valleys of the Himalayas? What did they eat for Christmas dinner in South Africa? What kind of music was popular in Buenos Aires? Did children ever dress up in costumes in Switzerland like they did for Halloween in America? And what would it be like to see an elephant in the wild? Would he be scared if he came across lions on a safari? How would it feel to see sharks and brilliant, rainbow fish in a sunny coral reef? Why did so many countries play rugby instead of football, cricket instead of baseball? Was the Great Wall of China really so big? Were the pyramids in Egypt really so old? Even closer to home, what did Navajo children his age want to be when they grew up? Did kids in New York really take the subway everywhere? How did kids in Alaska stand the snow?

At times, Denny felt very small when he thought about the world. He had read that the United States population was already over 300 million, and the world population was already over 6 billion people. The world seemed immeasurably vast, impossibly full of so many people, animals, places, languages, things to see, things to do, things to eat, and he was just Denny Telson. He was just one kid in Harvest, Texas. Was there a child his age in Senegal at that very moment that was thinking about what it must be like to live in Texas? He didn’t know. Was there an old man in Borneo that wondered what kind of cars people drove in Texas? Was there a beautiful woman in Tehran that wanted more than anything to visit Dallas one day? He didn’t know.

At times when he couldn’t fall asleep, he felt a deep aching in his chest, it was more than just an idle daydream or wish, it was a yearning, a calling, to see these places that he had read about. To see chimpanzees and gorillas in the forests of Uganda, to eat noodles in Singapore, to hike in the Rockies with fresh snow on the ground, to walk along the crowded streets of New York fighting his way through crowds as the leaves changed color and dropped in Central Park, to listen to tropical birds call at the foot of Christ the Redeemer as Rio de Janeiro stretched out before him like a glittering jewel and the sea sparkled like liquid sapphire, to listen to church bells toll in sleepy Spanish towns on warm afternoons as the townspeople took their siestas. Denny would lie on his back in the stillness of the night, staring at the ceiling, these thoughts tumbling around and around in his mind, even though they were not fully formed or understood, before he would fall asleep, muttering to himself, “The world, the world, the world…”

----------------------------------------------------------------------

“Next!”

“Oh my god, Denny? Is that you?”

Denny looked to the person bringing their groceries to his register. The man’s hair was starting to recede, there were the beginning of wrinkles in his face, and he was sporting a patchy beard, but Denny knew that face anywhere. Memories came to Denny’s mind unbidden: summer nights sneaking into R-rated movies, he, Jason, Carlos, and Henry smuggling in candy, laughing their heads off like hyenas to Seth Rogan and Jonah Hill, staying out past curfew, sleeping until the late afternoon the next day.

“Jason! Hi, wow, it’s been a long time,” Denny muttered. He put his hand to his forehead and closed his eyes for a moment. A brief sense of unreality washed over him. He opened his eyes, and Jason unloaded his groceries on the counter: a six-pack of beer, some potato chips, burgers, and buns.

“Denny, Denny, Denny…” Jason said, still smiling and looking at his old friend. “I haven’t seen you since high school, man! How are you doing?”

“I’m, uh, I’m okay…” Denny said quietly, looking down.

Jason didn’t seem to notice Denny’s subdued reaction to the question. “Man, you’re still here huh? I figured if anyone would have left this town it would have been you.”

Denny blinked and stood there for a moment. The fluorescent lights blared, it was hard for him to think clearly. It was like his head was full of mud. He struggled to respond, he tried to say something but the words wouldn’t come.

What could he say? “Yes, I left for college and planned to travel the world, never meaning to come back.” He really wanted to say that, and he wanted to add even more, “I moved to DC after I graduated and was working as an intern at the State Department. While biking to work I was in an accident and got a concussion which hasn’t gone away in over a year. I still have all kinds of health problems. I had to withdraw my Peace Corp application, even though I had made it to a final interview. I was going to teach English either in the Ukraine in the enigmatic heart of Eastern Europe or at the end of the vast, African continent in the snow-capped mountains of Lesotho. But I couldn’t, I had to leave my internship, leave my future, my apartment in DC, though I’m still paying for the lease. I can’t even really drive and I bike to work here at Kroger. I’m back in Harvest again and I will be for the foreseeable future, but I have no idea how long I’ll be able to keep working, or if I’ll ever get better. All I keep thinking about is that if I had been an inch to the left on my bike, literally just an inch to the left, the car never would have hit me and none of this would have ever happened.” 

But of course he couldn’t say all that. Even as simple an answer as “I left for college, but I’m back now,” was going to provide little context. It might invite more questions from Jason, questions that Denny didn’t want to answer. 

He glanced at the line, there were quite a few people there now, waiting, their faces bored and tired, all of them looking at him, watching him and Jason. The first frown of impatience was beginning to crease the mouth of the next customer. Denny grabbed the groceries in front of him, the beer, the chips, the beef, the buns. “Yeah,” he said, forcing a smile and looking at Jason. He packed the groceries in a paper bag. He hadn’t asked if paper was okay, he should have asked Jason if he wanted paper or plastic as he had been told in training, but he didn’t care. The next customer in line began to move over to the checkout counter, their cart squeaking as a rusted wheel obstinately lurched against the store floor. 

“Yeah,” Denny said, handing Jason the bag, “I’m still here.”"

He spent a long time pondering what he had read about the Sahara desert, about the Amazon rainforest, about Hinduism in India, about British colonization in Australia, about herds of migrating wildebeest in the Serengeti, and the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Even as he grew older, when he was ten, eleven, and twelve, much of the context was lost on his young mind, and he didn’t understand everything he read, far from it, but this didn’t deter him. If anything, the fact that whatever he read prompted far more questions in his mind, only encouraged him to read more and watch more documentaries on TV. 

Some days, like during a lackluster sermon, on long bus rides to school in the early morning, or lying by the pool in the afternoon heat, Denny turned all kinds of questions over and over in his head: What kinds of prayers did people say at weddings in Nepal in the valleys of the Himalayas? What did they eat for Christmas dinner in South Africa? What kind of music was popular in Buenos Aires? Did children ever dress up in costumes in Switzerland like they did for Halloween in America? And what would it be like to see an elephant in the wild? Would he be scared if he came across lions on a safari? How would it feel to see sharks and brilliant, rainbow fish in a sunny coral reef? Why did so many countries play rugby instead of football, cricket instead of baseball? Was the Great Wall of China really so big? Were the pyramids in Egypt really so old? Even closer to home, what did Navajo children his age want to be when they grew up? Did kids in New York really take the subway everywhere? How did kids in Alaska stand the snow?

At times, Denny felt very small when he thought about the world. He had read that the United States population was already over 300 million, and the world population was already over 6 billion people. The world seemed immeasurably vast, impossibly full of so many people, animals, places, languages, things to see, things to do, things to eat, and he was just Denny Telson. He was just one kid in Harvest, Texas. Was there a child his age in Senegal at that very moment that was thinking about what it must be like to live in Texas? He didn’t know. Was there an old man in Borneo that wondered what kind of cars people drove in Texas? Was there a beautiful woman in Tehran that wanted more than anything to visit Dallas one day? He didn’t know.

At times when he couldn’t fall asleep, he felt a deep aching in his chest, it was more than just an idle daydream or wish, it was a yearning, a calling, to see these places that he had read about. To see chimpanzees and gorillas in the forests of Uganda, to eat noodles in Singapore, to hike in the Rockies with fresh snow on the ground, to walk along the crowded streets of New York fighting his way through crowds as the leaves changed color and dropped in Central Park, to listen to tropical birds call at the foot of Christ the Redeemer as Rio de Janeiro stretched out before him like a glittering jewel and the sea sparkled like liquid sapphire, to listen to church bells toll in sleepy Spanish towns on warm afternoons as the townspeople took their siestas. Denny would lie on his back in the stillness of the night, staring at the ceiling, these thoughts tumbling around and around in his mind, even though they were not fully formed or understood, before he would fall asleep, muttering to himself, “The world, the world, the world…”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Next!”

“Oh my god, Denny? Is that you?”

Denny looked to the person bringing their groceries to his register. The man’s hair was starting to recede, there were the beginning of wrinkles in his face, and he was sporting a patchy beard, but Denny knew that face anywhere. Memories came to Denny’s mind unbidden: summer nights sneaking into R-rated movies, he, Jason, Carlos, and Henry smuggling in candy, laughing their heads off like hyenas to Seth Rogan and Jonah Hill, staying out past curfew, sleeping until the late afternoon the next day.

“Jason! Hi, wow, it’s been a long time,” Denny muttered. He put his hand to his forehead and closed his eyes for a moment. A brief sense of unreality washed over him. He opened his eyes, and Jason unloaded his groceries on the counter: a six-pack of beer, some potato chips, burgers, and buns.

“Denny, Denny, Denny…” Jason said, still smiling and looking at his old friend. “I haven’t seen you since high school, man! How are you doing?”

“I’m, uh, I’m okay…” Denny said quietly, looking down.

Jason didn’t seem to notice Denny’s subdued reaction to the question. “Man, you’re still here huh? I figured if anyone would have left this town it would have been you.”

Denny blinked and stood there for a moment. The fluorescent lights blared, it was hard for him to think clearly. It was like his head was full of mud. He struggled to respond, he tried to say something but the words wouldn’t come.

What could he say? “Yes, I left for college and planned to travel the world, never meaning to come back.” He really wanted to say that, and he wanted to add even more, “I moved to DC after I graduated and was working as an intern at the State Department. While biking to work I was in an accident and got a concussion which hasn’t gone away in over a year. I still have all kinds of health problems. I had to withdraw my Peace Corp application, even though I had made it to a final interview. I was going to teach English either in the Ukraine in the enigmatic heart of Eastern Europe or at the end of the vast, African continent in the snow-capped mountains of Lesotho. But I couldn’t, I had to leave my internship, leave my future, my apartment in DC, though I’m still paying for the lease. I can’t even really drive and I bike to work here at Kroger. I’m back in Harvest again and I will be for the foreseeable future, but I have no idea how long I’ll be able to keep working, or if I’ll ever get better. All I keep thinking about is that if I had been an inch to the left on my bike, literally just an inch to the left, the car never would have hit me and none of this would have ever happened.” 

But of course he couldn’t say all that. Even as simple an answer as “I left for college, but I’m back now,” was going to provide little context. It might invite more questions from Jason, questions that Denny didn’t want to answer. 

He glanced at the line, there were quite a few people there now, waiting, their faces bored and tired, all of them looking at him, watching him and Jason. The first frown of impatience was beginning to crease the mouth of the next customer. Denny grabbed the groceries in front of him, the beer, the chips, the beef, the buns. “Yeah,” he said, forcing a smile and looking at Jason. He packed the groceries in a paper bag. He hadn’t asked if paper was okay, he should have asked Jason if he wanted paper or plastic as he had been told in training, but he didn’t care. The next customer in line began to move over to the checkout counter, their cart squeaking as a rusted wheel obstinately lurched against the store floor. 

“Yeah,” Denny said, handing Jason the bag, “I’m still here.”"

adn1b9,2,2019-01-07,The Grey's Anatomy Protagonist Theory.,Ava_Cats,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/adn1b9/the_greys_anatomy_protagonist_theory/,"""The Grey's Anatomy Protagonist Theory"" is a theory about Grey's Anatomy I created about who the true protagonist is in Grey's Anatomy. At first glance you think  Meredith Grey is the star of the show because she is the glue to the show, she holds it all together, her name is in the title. So who else could Grey's Anatomy be starring? **I want to make it clear I think Meredith is the star of Grey's Anatomy just alongside Cristina Yang in seasons 1-10 .** Derek Shepherd in season 11 and kind of Alex but not really it's debatable in seasons 12-14

**Cristina Yang**

When Meredith is upset and needs someone to lean on who does she go to? Of course Cristina Yang. But Cristina Yang is not just Meredith's sidekick her role is not to be Meredith's bestfriend her character is just as and possibly more complex than Meredith's.  Cristina was on Grey's Anatomy from seasons 1-10, she went from being a competitive intern to an incredible cardio surgeon. Cristina's relationship with Burke and Owen are some of the shows most iconic relationships ever. Her character in certain scenes was a comic relief and in others was the center of the drama. Her amount of screen time and character development only rivals Meredith Grey who ""stars"" in Grey's Anatomy. I think that **Meredith and Cristina are both the protagonists in Grey's Anatomy** if you had to say who the sole leading role in Grey's was you would say Meredith. But for the purpose of this theory let's think of the possibility that they both starred in the series as two best friends.

**Grey's Anatomy Meredith and Cristina Protagonist Time Line**

**Seasons 1-3**

Cristina and Meredith 2 Surgical interns who are faced with medical and personal drama.

Big Events- Derek Drama, Burke Drama,  Izzie, George and Alex drama , persewing their careers , Meredith drowning,

**Seasons 4-8**

Cristina and Meredith are Surgical Residents and are faced with even more medical and personal drama.They both discover who they are without their boyfriends and are faced with multiple life threatening events.

Big Events- George dying, Shooting,Owen drama,Derek Drama, plane crash, Lexie and Alex and Izzie and Jackson and April drama, and pursewing their careers.

**Seasons 9-10**

Cristina and Meredith are fellows they are in a better place than they were in the earlier seasons (besides plane crash)

Big Events- Meredith gives birth during a power out, Cristina is nominated for a Harper Avery, Cristina and Owen break up, Derek and Meredith's relationship is tested.

**Derek**

So another theory I have is the show is about Meredith and Derek as the lead or  Meredith, Cristina,and Derek + Owen or Burke depends on the season. Everything in Grey's Anatomy centers around Meredith and Derek, since he  is one of the shows most popular characters and him and his on again off again relationship with Meredith is probably the longest running story line on the show.  It would make sense if the whole show was about the attendings who's drama is centered around Derek and the interns who's drama is around Meredith. The downfall to this theory is that, especially in season 1-4 Meredith and Derek's relationship is rocky so Derek couldn't be the protagonist alongside Meredith because the show portrays the feud they have from her perspective and not his. He only can only be the main lead with her once they are married and stable like around season 10 however at that time Cristina is in the leading role with Meredith. So it is only in season 11 when Derek can finally have the leading role with her. However at that point their relationship is rocky again and they are getting into fights so because of the points I raised earlier (their fights are from her point of view)  it could be argued he can't be the leading role with her. So at that point it is up for debate who the leading role was in season 11 Meredith, Meredith and Derek.

**Season 11**

Meredith and Derek go through a rocky phase in their relationship barley staying a couple for awhile during the whole D.C drama. However they hold it together and stay strong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Meredith**

The simplest way to answer the question who is the star on Grey's Anatomy. She has a best friend, boyfriend , friends, and bosses that create more drama along with the patients.  Things supporting this are Title of show, her narration in every episode, drama centering around her, the marketing all focusing on her. I think Meredith was the only protagonist on Grey's Anatomy from seasons 12- present.

**Seasons 12- Present**

Meredith overcomes the loss of her husband in season 12 and learns a lot about herself in seasons 13-14 most of her drama is medical and not personal she just holds the show together while the rest of the charcters are running around, screaming and flipping out . (April no offense)

&amp;#x200B;

**Alex**

Grey's Anatomy is trying to make  Alex  the new Cristina. It honestly kind of works, he is her new best friend. Alex is one of the 4 OG cast members to still be on. He has been through a lot with his rough childhood like Meredith. I am kind of tempted to think he took over as the protagonist with Meredith after Derek left. As the new best friend supporting Meredith. However I don't think that is true because none of the drama is as centered around him as it was Cristina. I think after season 12 Meredith is the only lead.

&amp;#x200B;

Arranged  a chart or tree on the importance of the characters on Grey's. Which do you agree with?

Theory A                                            

**Derek  + Meredith**                

Attendings   Interns               

Theory B 

**Cristina +  Meredith** 

Rest of MAGIC

Burke or Owen          Derek 

Attendings 

Theory C 

**Derek     Meredith     Cristina** 

Attending        Rest of MAGIC 

Theory D 

**Meredith** 

Everyone else 



&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone else

**My Belief is that Theory B is correct from seasons 1-8. Theory C is correct through seasons 9-10 . Theory A is correct in season 11. Theory D is correct from seasons 12-now.**

I grew up in Queens before moving upstate, lived there and worked there for a couple of summer internships. While going to school in Washington DC. And now I live in Seattle. I was talking to my SO about how Seattle severely lacks delis/bodegas that offer cheap, convenient food. 

I’m now realizing how bodegas/delis on every street corner, many of which that make inexpensive food, are almost exclusively an NYC/Tri-State area thing and pretty much don’t exist anywhere else and its crazy to me and I miss it. 

NYC has like 6 bodegas on every corner, but DC and Seattle? You’d be lucky to find a deli for miles. Do you want quick and inexpensive food like a bacon egg and cheese? Shit outta luck. God I miss a good BEC. 

Even places like Boston and Philly don’t have as many bodegas as you’d think for such a large city.

This gives us the issue of apartment searching. We both have very good credit, and we have rented here in NYC before too. 2 years and never missed rent or a late payment.

What should we do to prepare for an apartment hunt as we are already lacking compared to some others?

We are saving a lot and will have a lot saved by then, more than enough to cover a full years rent.

He is an actor, he does have a bachelor degree in criminal justice (he was pre law but then decided to go with acting) and has experience mostly with retail and restaurants due to acting field.

I hold a bachelor in fashion merchandising. I have had trouble securing a full time time in nyc, so I have held numerous internships as well as part time jobs. These jobs mostly were office assistant positions for beauty or fashion industry related companies. I also have extensive babysitting experience and work as a host for a pub crawl!

You're probably wondering how lame we got to be writing one of these, well let me tell you, we got pretty lame, lol. 

I honestly wish I could tell you that it gets better.. it doesnt... BUT we do get better at hiding the pain. We don't wince anymore when dad raises his voice. When mum's on the verge of tears we know how to leave the room and disappear. When our brother ignores us, we play it off and now he thinks we're just that cool little sibling who does their own thing. And people even seem to like us, ALOT. We get to be the head of a whole division in our law clinic, even the president of our year for a while. Got Selected by our dean for two fully paid internships one in Madrid and one in Australia. We were also elected the vice president of the University's Red Cross Chapter, helped a lot of people, talked to a lot of ""troubled youths"" haha! and a bunch of other stuff as well. Oh and when we see cousins S and M these days, we actually manage afew laughs. Our scars from being bullied every day at school have faded mostly, and your uni's dress code hides the rest. 

But, you still get extremely anxious everytime you hear dad's car in the driveway, you still feel that pang in your heart when you see your mum is trying so hard to keep it together, we still wish our brother could hear us crying for help and actually helps. Everytime we go on stage or speak in public our hands still shake uncontrollably and we need to take two ""happy pills"" everyday to function (which, surprise surprise! nobody knows we take). We still deeply detest every single one of our ""achievements"" and feel completely undeserving of every remotely good thing that comes our way, and we're still damaged from the pain S is causing you right now (spoiler alert, they don't stop until your innocence is completely gone, so forget being intimate with anyone for the next seven years or so). I won't even start on what the bullying did to our self esteem. And you added afew scars to the collection in our first two suicide attempts, so no short sleeves. 

So, I write this not to discourage you but to let you know that all that false hope bullshit that you're probably feeding yourself right now, it's worth nothing. My take, say fuck it, leave and live your life to the max. Everything you think about life in high school, college, and after that? All those dreams you have? That hope you are clinging so desperately onto..abandon it and start taking control of your fucking life.. T has the right idea, be sure to listen to her more, maybe she'll teach you how to be fearless without faking it. Be sure to do WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO DO... go, be a chef, a dancer, a freaking escort just GET AWAY FROM EVERYTHING.. please...

 ...because if you don't, you'll be dead, just like me...

ado91w,19,2019-01-07,My story,Antonio_Margheriti_,Dyslexia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dyslexia/comments/ado91w/my_story/,"It all started 14 years ago, before my parents or I even knew what dyslexia was. I had just started secondary school and had somewhat struggled educationally so far. 

It took less than a year for me to realise I was well behind the rest, bottom set for most subjects, most of all for English. Kids in the school were quick to realise I had a weakness and bullied me for it. what made matters worse was that I was always good natured and struggled to fight back. Over 6 months the abuse and harassment intensified until I started skipping school and playing sick, school gave me absolutely nothing. Knowing I had at least 5 year left of school, I became depressed and debated suicide, which looking back, as a twelve year old was insane. I’m so thankful that my brother saw the warning signs and raised the concern. After my parents finding out they took me out of the school and found another one. 

At this time I still didn’t know I was dyslexic, I had the reading age of a 8 year old and could barely write nor spell. Things got better in my new school, they specialised in dyslexia, who picked up the symptoms that I had it. I took a psychological test at 13 which confirmed the suspicions. This test changed my life and Helped me rationalise in my early teens that I did struggle and that was fine/normal. I received helpful advice from teachers who know dyslexia well, I was very lucky. Throughout school I never found English easy, I gave up learning a language to focus on additional English lessons. I did however discover music. I picked up guitar initially at 14. Up until then I couldn’t pick up language nor grammar but music was like opening Pandora’s box to a side of my brain that I didn’t know existed, I’ve heard that music and dyslexia go well together, I think it’s because we excel at recognising patterns which is a large part of music (listening). So this is the point I finish school I got average across the board results (just about scrapping English with a C) but excelled at music and decided to take it further. The idea of starting my life at 18 with no decent education or any skills apart from the weekend job working in retail was too much for me and I decided to defer life, enrolling at university studying... you guessed it, music. 

I had a great time there, the course I was on had no written exams and the majority of modules were a performance or coursework. Throughout my time there I began to get interested in education, specifically music education. I began to find a love for research which required me to overcome my two biggest obstacles in life - reading and writing. With practice these two skills helped me develop my grammar and vocabulary. The final boss of my degree was a 12,000 word dissertation. I decided to write about how music education is linked to attainment especially from non-affluent backgrounds.  This research included interviewing music projects and charities, who I reached out to, to hear their points of view. I received a first for this research and to this date is something I am truly proud of, i felt I was able to overcome my greatest challenge in life, giving me a thirst for knowledge. 

After finishing university, with a 2.1 and wanting to travel the world a bit, using my skills and knowledge but at the same time being broke to move around, I volunteered for a charity in Ghana. The charity put me up with a local family, in return I taught music and English at a village school. I’m not a religious person but I attended and played music in a church. Putting yourself out of your comfort is an experience I would advocate anyone to do especially if you have dyslexia (I know as a kid, staying in my comfort zone was something I did too much). This experience gave me grounding and appreciation for simple things in life. Most the people I met there were experiencing hard poverty but at the same time learned to enjoy life. 

On returning home and a period of agonising unemployment one of the charities I interviewed offered me an internship following the research I did with then . This internship was to evaluate their work and projects and write a report for them. Not wanting to make the story too long, between now and then I’ve had a string of jobs which stretch me both as a person and intellectually and I now work as a policy advisor for the government in the country I live in, writing briefings and advice to senior colleagues and ministers. 

There wasn’t really a message to this story although I do want to say dyslexia doesn’t define you as a person and can change with you. It can make you weak at certain tasks but it can also make you naturally strong at others. Harness your strengths and do your best to improve your weaknesses. I sometimes have to look back and realise the journey I’ve come on so far, and me and my dyslexia have been there every step of the journey, for better or for worse. "

Tommy Daniels is one of the hottest young commodities in Hollywood. Despite being under 16, the actor has earned praise from A-list celebrity co-stars as being a talented professional, fun, and incredibly entertaining, Producers are lining up to cast him in movies, and Directors sing his praises. He had, by age 10, already starred in big-budget films as a main character, and doesn't seem to be stopping soon.

&amp;#x200B;

What no one except those around him knows is that the blond-haired and blue-eyed Tommy is a desperate, eager little bottom even in spite of his age. He goes out of his way to find at least one person to fuck him on each film he does - be they co-star or producer or director - and wins them over by indulging their darker sides: their kinks, their secret shames. He'll do anything to get the cock he's picked - and for his newest film, he's picked yours.

Perhaps you're the director or producer, or even the college intern who got stuck as Tommy's assistant. Anyone at all is welcome to be the object of the young star's attentions, and so long as you're willing to fuck him, he'll do anything you want to get your cock.

adplqf,10,2019-01-07,Top 10 Competitors (Who Didn't Compete Last Season) I'd Like To See Return in 2019,AlphabettySoupd,Schmoedown,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schmoedown/comments/adplqf/top_10_competitors_who_didnt_compete_last_season/,"Made a quick list of 10 competitors, all of whom did not compete in any format during the 2018 season, that I would love to see return for the 2019 season. Some of these are unrealistic for one reason or another, but one can dream! Drop yours in the comments! 

1. **Sam Witwer:** This is a pretty obvious one. The man has been part of one of the greatest SD matches ever, might be the only established competitor who could take the belt from Damon, has such a great personality, and brings with him a fanbase. Wins all around. As long as the Star Wars division continues to exist, we will want Witwer v. Damon. 

2. **Tim Franco:** Franco has only had one match, but he's done more than prove his potential. He tko'd Matt Atchity (who is no slouch) and, in doing so, got a perfect round 1 (including the bonus question) and, if I remember correctly, only missed one of his questions. If you watch some of his reactions, he's very impressive as well. Would love to see him return and maybe feud with Chance (or team with Robert)? 

3. **Chris Atkinson:** In their sole appearance, both of the CinemaSins guys did pretty damn well and while neither was a clear weak link, I think Chris was slightly stronger. He seems to have a pretty wide range of knowledge and dissecting all those films probably can't hurt.

4. **Jeremy Scott:** Same deal as Chris (though to a very slightly lesser degree.) If we're looking to beef up an already stacked teams division, bring these guys back! 

5. **Jeremy Jahns:** With Mara stepping away and a weak Star Wars division, Jahn's return could beef up both the IG and SW sectors of the Schmoedown. I don't think he's a serious contender for either of those belts at this point, but it would help start to bridge the gap, I think, between the top tier and those who get in way over their heads. 

6. **Marc Benardin:** I love Benardin's playful sarcastic persona and on any given day, he's likely a strong mid-tier singles player. If he returns, however, I think it should be to the teams division where he can have someone to play off of. If you paired him up with JTE, we might get something even better than what we were promised with Lon/JTE. 

7. **Korey Coleman:** The list of things that Coleman could do with a SD character is endless. I think his return could also bring in some lighthearted fun into the SD that, in my opinion, has been minimal lately. He's also proven that his knowledge isn't shabby either, so we could potentially add in another jokey character who isn't just a jobber. 

8. **John Campea:** If we're keeping the Star Wars division around and don't have time to seek out new talent, bringing Campea back (especially now that SD is only renting Collider studios) would be nice - even if it's only for live shows (so Collider doesn't have to be involved at all.) Based on his reaction, he kept up with Witwer and Napzok during the Iron Man match, so Campea v. Scrimshaw as a contender's match at Celebration (if Witwer can't make it)? 

9. **The Kid:** Not really sure what The Kid is up to these days, but he'd be an amazing wacky addition to the Free For All. Then set up a fun little Interns Bowl, where each intern is trained by someone competent lol. (Each former intern must produce their own entrance and promo.)

10. **Chris Stuckmann:** Stuckmann's debut and win wasn't super impressive, but he is another person who I think could work great if he was paired up with someone in Teams. He seems to know a lot about a narrow range of films, so if you team him up with someone with a bit greater breadth (but lacking the depth,) I could see an entertaining match or two. 

So, who ya'll got?!? "
adq63l,161,2019-01-07,A Gaming Shop Experience,bunable,talesofneckbeards,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesofneckbeards/comments/adq63l/a_gaming_shop_experience/,"So I've been lurking on this subreddit for awhile and I finally broke down and made an account because frankly I have too many neckbeard experiences and my friends are tired of my salt. I am the textbook definition of beardbait, and have been ever since I turned 14 (so going on 10 years now). I've been deep into the hellhole which is anime since ye olde days of blockbuster video. I love games of both the video and card varieties. I'm a regular congoer and avid cosplayer, so much so that I've migrated from just walking the floor in costume to competing and presenting at conventions. When not in cosplay, I eagerly experiment in other fun niche fashions such as steampunk, morigirl, and lolita. Add to all that my double major in environmental science and english literature (which covers both sides of the competing ""intellectual"" neckbeard factions) and a dollop of an overly bubbly demeanor, and you can see why I suffer an onslaught of Neckus Beardicus.   


Seeing as this is my very first reddit post in all of ever I thought it would be prudent to start off with a low key beard encounter that happened fairly recently. It goes a little something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

So I play somewhat uncommon tcg, (I say somewhat because trying to find anything besides magic, pokemon, or yugioh at a store not specializing in cards is a shot in the dark but I digress) and my favorite local store for it very recently closed. They do have a sister branch only 10 minutes away but my branch was specifically the ""gaming"" branch of the store and the sister branch doesn't have nearly enough stock or variety to keep me happy for long. So I have started a quest to find a new favorite store that isn't 1.5 hours away at the closest. In my most recent bout of frantic googling I found a store that was about 30 minutes away from me that I had never been to and decided to try my luck.  


The store seemed pretty average when I pulled up in my car. It was your basic hole in the wall at the end of a strip mall with the windows covered in so many gaming promotional posters that you can't even see in. Now as I mentioned before I have a pretty varied kind of fashion sense but I treat trying out a new store a bit like a job interview and I learned a long time ago not to make too heavy of an impression on the first encounter. So I was keeping it low key but still very me, which meant basically a flowy sundress, a cardigan, and a bow headband. Very cute, very girly, very not what people are used to seeing in a game shop. I was also alone for this quest. Not ideal to be sure, I don't like going to game shops alone until I'm very comfortable there after years of bad experiences, but no one was free and with how busy I am with work I knew I wouldn't get another chance for awhile. So, steeling my nerves, I left the car and proceeded with caution to the door.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew immediately upon entering that I would once again come up empty in my search for the coveted tcgs. It was obvious that this shops specialty was warhammer. The only cards on display were a case of magic and a smattering of pokemon at the store counter and the rest of the store was covered, floor to ceiling, in warhammer memorabilia. Now I have no problem with warhammer, I can see the appeal though I've never tried it myself, but it is very much not what I was looking for. My disappointment must have shown on my face because the cashier asked if there was anything he could help me with in a worried tone. I smiled politely and asked about my cardgame and the guy hissed through his teeth in the way of every retail worker who knows they don't have something. I told him it was fine but he was very sweet and offered to text some of the other shops he knows to see if anyone had stuff in stock. Honestly I was touched and accepted his offer. I decided to look around the shop to see if there was anything there that caught my interest because if the cashier was going to go out of his way for me then I was going to buy *something* to make it worth his effort. I had just moved to the wall covered in various figures and paints to see if anything caught my eye (I think some could look really neat when incorporated in steampunk props, please don't witch-hunt me over it) when the heard arrived.

&amp;#x200B;

A whole bevy of beards shoved their way through the door of this little game shop. I'm talking 8-12 full grown neckbeards of the most stringent definition. There were fedoras galore, black and red cargo-pants covered in chains, at least 4 trenchcoats with ominous food splotches all over, anime waifu shirts (even one ahego shirt, ew), a hearty mix of greasy ponytails and ill-conceived middle-parts, and every single one of them had some form of beard on his neck. It was a gloriously horrifying sight. They all shuffled over to the tables at one side of the store, the ones specifically made for warhammer games (matches?), toting with them boxes of figures as well as salty snacks and the illustrious dew of mountains. It was when they loudly started unloading their bounty of figures and munchies that I came to the realization that while they had been entering, the other two customers that had been in the shop when I had come in had exited. 

&amp;#x200B;

That left me alone in a game shop with a bunch of neckbeards and one distracted cashier.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt a pit drop into my stomach. This was a cringeworthy repressed memory in the making and I already have enough of those to deal with, thank you very much. Luckily, at the moment, most of the heard hadn't yet noticed me, being too preoccupied with setting up what must be a weekly game to pay attention to anyone else in the store. I know many neckbeard's have motion based vision when it comes to prowling for m'ladies, so if I just stood still they wouldn't notice me. But eventually one of the greasebeasts would look up from his cheetos and see a small girl in a dress and then they would all be onto me. With a pit in my stomach, I came to the conclusion that my best chance of getting out of this unscarred was to make a break to the relative safety of nice cashier man and his close proximity to the door. I still wanted his intell but if I needed to bolt, neck I was going to!  


I took a steadying breath and straightened my posture, putting on my best resting bitch face. I find looking like you could easily commit white collar murder and not care is a good enough deterrent for the more lily-livered of beards.  With that thought in mind I slowly wandered back to the front counter, hugging the wall shelves and not letting my eyes stray over to the conglomerate over at the play tables. I made it to the counter with no issue, thank goodness, and found that nice cashier guy was on the desk computer on facebook with  5 messenger boxes open. He told me the first three places he tried also didn't stock it, the fourth one did but they only had one box, and he was still waiting on the last one to get back to him but he had a good feeling. I thanked him profusely for his efforts and he asked me to wait just a few more minutes to see if this other shop keeper would respond. I reluctantly agreed to wait it out. I really didn't want to be in there with the horde any longer than necessary but my thirst for those sweet sweet cards won out.

&amp;#x200B;

The cashier, bless him really he was a gem, started talking to me about my favored tcg. Just the basic what decks I ran and why, if I'm casual or competitive, if I play anything other tcgs or if its just this one. I was happy to babble on to him about my cards. I got into it fairly recently and I run some fun but not meta decks, I'm pretty casual but I do compete on occasion and I managed to get to the regional tournament this year but didn't place, and that I used to be really competitive in yugioh but I switched to this after yugioh stopped being fun for me. I was surprised that he actually knew a bit about the tcg, which was very cool, and that he had some options for some sleeves and dice that might compliment my deck. I was so distracted by this conversation that I didn't notice the imminent beard encounter until it was too late.  


I smelled him before I saw him. My back was turned to the swarm as I was having my chat with the cashier so I didn't notice right away that there was a sudden lack of chatter. I was halfway through a sentence about a particular card effect I enjoy using when a stench the likes of which gym locker rooms can only aspire to hit my nostrils. Now listen I'm no shrinking violet when it comes to stink. I have two brothers that had been playing hockey since before I could walk and avoided showering before a big game because it was ""unlucky"". I also had an internship in college that dealt primarily with amphibians and reptiles, not exactly the most pleasant smelling of creatures. This smell though, it was like the most rancid B.O. and a catbox that had never been emptied had a baby on pile of garbage. I think my nosehairs melted back into my face. It was abominable. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Ahem,"" A man said far too close to my back for comfort, sneer audible in his voice, ""We are waiting to start, *sir""* 

&amp;#x200B;

There it was. The cringe was real and I was deep in the thick of it. I straightened up from where I had been leaning against the counter and turned my head to witness the absolute bearditude that had graced us with his presence. This guy was presumably the ""alpha beard"" based on the smug look on his face and the fact that all the other beardies were still sat at the table and looking on with horror/interest at what was about to go down. He was a ginger fellow, in a pair of those hot topic pants with all the pockets and chains and a heavy metal t-shirt streched over his generous middle for a band that I'm too much of a pleb to know. The fedora on his head had a smattering of skull patches sloppily glued onto one side (I know it was glue too because it seeped out the sides of the patches) and a red craft store feather poking out of the other. He wasn't wearing a trenchcoat but I kind of wish he had been because I could see his overgrown pit hair poking out of the sleeves of his t-shirt. His beard was patchy at best, missing his chin almost entirely and looking more like a scraggily pair of muttonchops got too big for their britches. Over all, a very groady sight to behold.

&amp;#x200B;

I was still to surprised by the appearance of this person, still way to close to my back, to really understand what he'd said. Luckily for me the cashier was unphased. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Weekly 40k doesn't start for another 10 minutes."" The cashier said without missing a beat. He pointed over his shoulder at the big digital clock on the wall, ""When that clock hits 5 then I'll start taking names.""  


""Everyone's here already,"" the great beard scoffed, flicking his chin up and making his hat's plumage bobble, ""Stop cavorting with the *female* and get on with your proper duties. We won't be held up just because you mistakenly think you can 'score' with this lost little waif.""

&amp;#x200B;

There was an honest to goodness gasp from the peanut gallery at the tables. I could tell from the bug eyes and open mouths that they hadn't expect that to come from their fearless leader here. I myself was feeling a little off kilter, I mean I'd never be called a waif before. (Has anyone else gotten that one? I'm honestly curious) My shock quickly turned to embarrassed anger. I was so ready to rip this guy at least 2 new buttholes but the cashier beat me to it.

&amp;#x200B;

""I know I don't need to remind you about this store's conduct policies,"" He said venomously, obviously this wasn't his first clash with the alpha beard, ""What you just said is completely unacceptable. I'm giving you your second strike, one more and your out for the tournament season. Now if you want to play at all today you're gonna go sit down and shut up while help out this *paying customer that was here before you.* And I'll start 40k when she's done with her purchases.""

&amp;#x200B;

This got the beardy all kinds of steamed up! His face turned so red he looked like a ripe tomato. With how ginger he was it almost looked like his head was on fire, truly it was a sight. It was clear he wanted to escalate the situation but his gang of groupies realized a losing fight when they saw it an begged him to come back to the table. He gave me one last glare, I'm sure it would have been intimidating if his bottom lip hadn't been quivering ever so slightly, before turning on his heel and stomping like a toddler back to his seat and flopping into it with a jiggle.  


""I'm so sorry about that,"" The cashier said to me quietly, ""My little sister has to deal with the same thing when she goes to pokemon tournaments and I hate it. That store got back to me though and they do have your game in stock. They also have a weekly tournament for it if you were interested in that. It's just a bit of a drive."" 

&amp;#x200B;

""Thank you for the help,"" I said, ""With the cards and also with him.""

&amp;#x200B;

""If you really want to thank me, pretend to shop for something for a minute,"" He said with a mischievous grin, ""I want to make them wait a bit.""

&amp;#x200B;

I happily spent the next thirty minutes loudly hemming and hawing over dice and sleeves. I even had him take out the yugioh singles so I could look through their collection, audibly discussing different strategies I could implement if so-and-so card was added to my deck. Through it all the alpha neckbeard sat getting redder and redder in his seat. The gaggle of sub-beards switching between looking at him worriedly and then to me as a flexed my little bit of nerd knowledge with the cashier. I left the shop with a new set of over sleeves, about $25 in rares to start a link summon yugioh deck, and the pinkest most glittery dice they carried in stock, along with the address of the next shop in my quest for cardgames. On my way out I made a point of telling the cashier that I would be sure to tell all my friends that played warhammer to checkout that shop. After all it seemed that their usual weekly group could do with a bit more *feminine ingenuity.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I ducked out of there with the sound of a furious REEEEEE at me heels as the alpha beard finally lost it. I haven't been back since but I'm so curious to know if he got that last strike or not.

I’m originally from the Chicago suburbs and considering moving back for my internship (I’m a 2nd year at a school out of state). Unfortunately, pay is an important part of my search as my partner cannot support both of us, cost of living in the suburbs is higher than we’ve paid in undergrad and grad school, and I’d prefer not to take loans out for living expenses. 

Does anyone know of intern positions in the Chicago suburbs that pay at least $18,000? (Although more would be great!) I’m guessing not considering the trend I’ve seen in some of the postings that are already available, but I wanted to check anyway. Thank you!"

I today at 120 days of SR sit alone in my room, feeling exhausted, my dreams piling up on me, ideas not executed, alone in my room with no energy. Now even after 120 days, why am i like this ? why am i having these emotions ? Let me briefly explain you guys/girls on changes i have gone through with expanding over the title i posted:

&amp;#x200B;

Exhausted : Benched my record high today and developing solid pecs ( should have it sculpted like a greek god by may: had man boobs before)

Alone in room : i see no point in wasting my night today on a bar discussing women and then heading out to have a movie night. ( i have planned to complete my consulting application and prepare for a job interview i have on friday)

No energy : i literally have no energy left at 10:32 pm ( woke up at ten , yoga/meditation, did my grad job till 5 , made a healthy meal,  hit gym, made a healthy meal , back on bed to finish my application but decided to give back to the community if any one wants to take it)

Lesser friends : i have lesser friends than i started with but there are more people who admire me and decisions i took over time.( i am not a big fan anymore of my best friend but i am working on it and have decided that he is a essential part of my life and just because i am doing better today doesnt mean i kick him out as well. Casualties include weed addicted friends , girl addicted friends, energy vampires , my girl friend .

Now i do have to thank people like crazyR14, monkmode, juggernaut and many whom i deeply apologize for not remembering names. You guys have kept the amp up and have been a beacon of light with solid information in the evergrowing cess pool of meme's which was once called no-fap subreddit.

So i have crossed 120 days and i do not consider this a milestone as i do not plan to stop.I make this post for the sole purpose of educating who is on the same journey as i struggled to find answers for my questions, i will post this in a format of problems i encountered and solutions i gathered for them and my mental outlook with them and how i decide/decided to overcome them.

1. **No female attraction** : i had magnetism dripping but lost it on a streak during my emotional break up with my then girlfriend and i never experienced attraction post that.---&gt; I gave up putting emphasis on it and any thought just cruising and concentrating on other stuff, the term female attraction striked again when i was walking on the road like a half-ass and all the girls outside the pub stared at me like i was some celebrity (thought it was due to how weirdly dressed i was on monday night and headed to panda express where my usual server told me that she cant imagine how i dashing i was gonna look for new year bash if i looked so nice without taking a bath and then giggled about the bath comment). So things do come when you dont want them. /Another take on this is i had a lot of pent up frustrating negative energy blocked in my body and SR just amplified it, so be pure and careful and have positive outlook. There are many people who are on good streaks but get no female attraction and this is where i can pin-point the reason to.I personally have no interest in it anymore but thought i would put it out as i remember how much it effected me.
2. **Sleep cycle fucked up** : you need less sleep but your body is tired.---&gt; make a habit of reading books, do not go heavy into self help books( yes they are great and those are our ultimate jackpot but dont stress it as you will fall of the bandwagon if you do not have strong simulation for hard copy books.start slow read something you love, thriller novels go for it , lord of the rings or harry potter any genre 4 weeks of fiction wont hurt you at all but the love to read books and not waste time on facebook, youtube, netflix will take over and eventually your brain will crave for it. Feed them these tougher books then. Crux is fill your hours with productive things.
3. **Meditation/Gym** : i still struggle for meditation but have made a habit of doing yoga/meditation first thing in morning. No reasons, if i get late to office/class and have to hear abuses thats my fault of getting up late but meditation has to be done. This has helped me loads as i dont like the faces they make when i swipe in late automatically making my brain to get up slightly early to get things done. Gym i am struggling nowadays as i was on vacation in florida for 12 days and missed gym so now i do not feel like going, i have to push myself but once i am there i become a beast so i know its just a matter of time my will power wins and i defeat my demons\[ AGAIN \].
4. **Great thoughts Great ideas but they got lost** : I had tremendous amounts of ideas popping in my head on daily basis, i dreamt about them, brainstormed them but after a few days i could not even recollect what they were.----&gt; i started keeping a diary , this diary is split up into three parts . One where as soon as i wake up i outline my day things i need to do, things i am going to do and one extra thing to push myself ( i dont always complete them but the progress have been tremendous- be careful to not push your limits ) , second part is where i write positive affirmations and how i am grateful for everything that is happening and thank the universe/god/my parents ( this has made me extremely positive in life). Third part is my crazy ideas : i see something intresting , i write up about it , any idea which clicked my mind i just open my diary and write it. The idea section is now 11 ideas old and i have started executing the first and second one.Now trust me guys this shit is boring, i struggled like hell on what the fuck is this, why do i write in my diary that i woke up , then i have to eat breakfast , then grad school , then office isnt it given and i should do it normally but soon after 25 days you will start noticing that these will become second nature and you will start taking them as something you have to excel at and not something you have to bear. Bonus things : I often miss things my mom tells me due to time zone difference but due to this i write it down and she started crying one day telling how responsible i have become lately( another fun fact i just become a little emotional thinking about that moment : Ripe raw emotions are what SR leads you too and its beautiful)
5. **Quit searching for soul mate** : Just let it go, someone will come along who will vibrate with you and they will be the best thing but one small suggestion i can give to you is increase your flirting, start complementing girls blow them off their feet do it more and more. Build up the courage and compliment. Compliment and move on and do whatever you were doing, this for your self-help. I just started few weeks back, i have no intention of gaining anything but it's keeping my vibration solid, the girls will love you and want to share everything with you eventually and since you are not after any prize you will feel more human and understand that everyone is a human. Small example : I like a girl with whom i worked, my 1st month i was happy that my attraction was working as she would get all nervous and start twirling her hair and become upset when i said i had a gf. then it passed with my magnetism and she was just professional, since i still enjoyed being with her, i often tried to be funny, she did laugh but there was always a pressure to perform ( if you guys are catching my drift) but now i like her but i literally have zero interest in her, i just complimented her out of blue without thinking and now the tables have turned again( only difference is i do not have time for casual dating/relationship). Again the crux is they will come when it is time dont stress over it.
6. **Improve Improve Improve :** i have something which changed and shocked me totally, let me share it with you guys.Imagine we have to live on this earth for 75 years , do you guys know if you decide to dedicate yourself ;follow this path of SR; improve in every way possible. Just give it a year, a year of your dedication, 365 days. Just 365 days of your life.365 Days of your life is just 1% , can you imagine 365 days is just 1% of your life . Cant even imagine what 30 days 90 days are\[ 90 days is just 0.3 percent of your life.If we cannot try to be the best version of ourselves for 031% minimum of our lives do we really deserve all the happiness, wealth, love, affection that world has to offer ?/ This is just a question that you guys have to think deeply about.PS( CALCULATED but excluded sleep , 1-18 years of your life before your dick could stand up properly and other outliers, its just simple math but i am sure even if you include many things the percent wont vary that much as you enjoyed porn free like for first 12 years so potato potato its the same thing).

Also guys many of these stuff are really tough and more harder to implement. I am huge advocate of learning through experiences and truly believe that it is not possible to do anything until your own mind wants to achieve it But when ever your brain decides it is the time, i want to save you the horror of finding what can i do to improve myself?

I am 4 months alcohol free.I am 4 months weed/free.I am 45 days instagram free.I surf reddit much much less.Most important after 12 years , 18 cigarettes on an average a day, i have started the journey to quit cig for good. My lungs today are 7 days old.

I want to conclude all this with a simple thing, give it time dont push yourself so much in one go that your brain thinks it is better to stay safe. Understand the mechanism of the world , everyday you go to gym your strength increases ( it is not visible instantly but you know you are making gains). My friends partied ,had threesome's on tinder , had sex , boozed , laughed on stories of madness, i sat in my room worked hard, still working hard , crafted my resume, thinking each day should not i try to give myself some time off and waste my life a little. But thing is my friends are there abusing the country, laws outside factors for not getting a interview call and i see clearly what is it you gain with SR ( **Mental clarity and the most important but never talked about nor cared by anyone : THE WILL TO SUCCEED** ). I have over 30 rejection mails stacked up but today i got calls from 2 recruiters but i am still not perfect and i have too much to learn but the thing is my hard-work has shown some glimmer of hope. I hope i convert those internship interviews but i am confident if i keep my head down and continue being the best version of myself, **i will be a beast**.

And to add guys, i am the most horrible example for anything, i have wasted 12 years of my life on cigarettes, mindless parties,  , 11 failed relations, 1 semester of grad school wasted just in pain over a break up, lazy , serial procrastinator , developed man boobs , horrible eating habits, cheat my way out of exams, give the absolute minimum to just pass ( luckily i have been intelligent enough to crack things without putting efforts) but such things and luck can only take you so far SO do not stress ;i know its said a lot here but if i can keep pushing myself and not accept defeat so can you and so will you.

Move on world, make some space, Leaders are here.

Good Night.

LONG SPEW

I don't really know where to begin, what the appropriate subreddit this kind of post belongs to, how to go about it, but I'll try to keep it short and straight to the point (still going to be a long, somewhat disorganized one).

I've been through therapy when I was 16-17 to help specifically with social anxiety. It helped but I was never truly open about what I wanted to really talk about (the real gritty, dark stuff I suppose) as I was still feared of being criticized or be looked down for showing my true vulnerable self with even my own therapist. I fear looking weak, and I get in the loop of feeling weak because of that or when I do decide to open myself about it. What I got out of it is being more comfortable with myself being at home, going to school, and occasionally going out. What was already my sorta comfort zone. It didn’t get rid of my issue but just made it more tolerable for my situation.

Now I'm a 20-year-old college student in my junior year. I'm getting older, and that requires more action to get out of my comfort zone due to shifting demands in my life. Such as applying for internships and getting an actual career job, making new friends after high school, even possible romantic interests, but that is something I can't be worrying about right now for obvious reasons.

In 2018 I’ve turned my time-wasting pastime of watching YouTube videos into watching videos about positivity, self-improvement, etc. I would say I’ve gotten a better positive outlook on life and feel somewhat wiser from it. I started reading over winter break too with some books that deal with kind of the theme of philosophy of self-improvement. It has helped in one way or another.

However, in the last few weeks, this new self-awareness(?) or having a better outlook of life, I realized I still have these problems from my anxiety. I just got better managing them in my daily life, I still lack what I truly want to experience in life. I still doubt myself over the simplest things. Such as seeking approval or worth. Also realizing possibly I don’t really have strong, real connections with anyone. That my anxiety and self-doubt has turned people away or prevented me from making those important connections everyone needs.

Let’s say I just experienced an awkward or bad moment, I will resort to my positive, logical mindset (for a lack of better term) to tell myself “hey, in this grand scheme of things, this won’t matter in a few days”. Or if someone I felt I was with good, genuine friends with starts to drift away or stopped replying my texts, I will tell myself “it's unfortunate, but hey there is plenty of more awesome people out there to meet”.

Despite this “positive, logical” mindset, there is always this anxiety-driven, negative mindset in my head that is always present, and because it’s always present, I can’t help myself to get over whatever is bothering me because it’s there. Sometimes it’s not my inner voice self-doubting me, but like some negative, inaudible, thoughtless emotion I get sometimes. Maybe I just gotten so used to it’s just… always there.

It’s like, despite me doing good in school, have a car paid off, being pretty good or somewhat skilled at the guitar, might even graduate with zero to no debt, I feel really lonely and worthless because of my lack of confidence in myself. Someone can compliment me that would make my entire week, or hell, I could win the lottery or land the perfect career, but I feel I will always get back to this feeling. And I feel bad because there is people who would love to have things or aspects in my life that they don’t have. The typical “first world problems” sort of deal.

I understand it’s important to always seek improvement in my life, and I have done that, but what is the point when I don’t really have anyone that is actually genuinely happy or willing to celebrate with me? My dad is in his 70s now and is super stressed with financial shit he wasn’t responsible for, something no one deserves to go through at his age. My mom is the most negative person I interact with and I constantly argue with her. No one else in my family I feel truly connected or I am willing to be willing to open myself to. No friends I feel comfortable being myself to, as when I go on little rambles like this they are either like “huh, ok” or afterward our friendship just feels… off. Probably because a lot of people don’t normally feel this or can’t relate. Or just something else I’m overthinking.

I feel like I need to go back to therapy, and just be straight up and open. But with my anxiety and self-doubt, of course, I feel overwhelmed and doubt that they are just getting paid and won’t genuinely care about me. That they would repeat the same things I’ve gained or known this last year. Because that itself isn’t helping. Even if I was super honest my first time through therapy, would it actually help? Would he just repeat the same advice? Idk. I’m not making improvements with it. I can’t make any improvements in my life because of it.

Anyway, thanks to anyone who read this, or gave me advice. I’m just feeling overwhelmed because of today. First day back in class, my friends going back to college, and a new friendship where I felt really happy about isn’t really going anywhere, due to another person not putting as much effort in talking to me as they once did and it being an online friendship of course too (sad I know). My parents got into an argument, and because of it I got in an argument with my mom, and things were said that a mother or son would say to each other, but it is what it is. I was starting to think some really bad shit (nothing suicidal, don’t worry) that made me want to make this post and just get this off my chest.

I know a good portion of this rant is me overthinking or in my head, but… idk. I can’t achieve the life I want with whatever I got. I know you gotta love yourself first and be okay having a day to yourself, but I feel like I’ve been too alone for too long."
adr5u7,114,2019-01-08,"Exhausted, Alone in room , No energy and lesser friends [My journey of 120 days of SR]",Alarmed_Equipment,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adr5u7/exhausted_alone_in_room_no_energy_and_lesser/,"I have been thinking of writing this post for quite some time but had no energy. I today at 120 days of SR sit alone in my room, feeling exhausted, my dreams piling up on me, ideas not executed, alone in my room with no energy. Now even after 120 days, why am i like this ? why am i having these emotions ? Let me briefly explain you guys/girls on changes i have gone through with expanding over the title i posted:

&amp;#x200B;

Exhausted : Benched my record high today and developing solid pecs ( should have it sculpted like a greek god by may: had man boobs before)

Alone in room : i see no point in wasting my night today on a bar discussing women and then heading out to have a movie night. ( i have planned to complete my consulting application and prepare for a job interview i have on friday)

No energy : i literally have no energy left at 10:32 pm ( woke up at ten , yoga/meditation, did my grad job till 5 , made a healthy meal,  hit gym, made a healthy meal , back on bed to finish my application but decided to give back to the community if any one wants to take it)

Lesser friends : i have lesser friends than i started with but there are more people who admire me and decisions i took over time.( i am not a big fan anymore of my best friend but i am working on it and have decided that he is a essential part of my life and just because i am doing better today doesnt mean i kick him out as well. Casualties include weed addicted friends , girl addicted friends, energy vampires , my girl friend .

Now i do have to thank people like crazyR14, monkmode, juggernaut and many whom i deeply apologize for not remembering names. You guys have kept the amp up and have been a beacon of light with solid information in the evergrowing cess pool of meme's which was once called no-fap subreddit.

So i have crossed 120 days and i do not consider this a milestone as i do not plan to stop.I make this post for the sole purpose of educating who is on the same journey as i struggled to find answers for my questions, i will post this in a format of problems i encountered and solutions i gathered for them and my mental outlook with them and how i decide/decided to overcome them.

1. **No female attraction** : i had magnetism dripping but lost it on a streak during my emotional break up with my then girlfriend and i never experienced attraction post that.---&gt; I gave up putting emphasis on it and any thought just cruising and concentrating on other stuff, the term female attraction striked again when i was walking on the road like a half-ass and all the girls outside the pub stared at me like i was some celebrity (thought it was due to how weirdly dressed i was on monday night and headed to panda express where my usual server told me that she cant imagine how i dashing i was gonna look for new year bash if i looked so nice without taking a bath and then giggled about the bath comment). So things do come when you dont want them. /Another take on this is i had a lot of pent up frustrating negative energy blocked in my body and SR just amplified it, so be pure and careful and have positive outlook. There are many people who are on good streaks but get no female attraction and this is where i can pin-point the reason to.I personally have no interest in it anymore but thought i would put it out as i remember how much it effected me.
2. **Sleep cycle fucked up** : you need less sleep but your body is tired.---&gt; make a habit of reading books, do not go heavy into self help books( yes they are great and those are our ultimate jackpot but dont stress it as you will fall of the bandwagon if you do not have strong simulation for hard copy books.start slow read something you love, thriller novels go for it , lord of the rings or harry potter any genre 4 weeks of fiction wont hurt you at all but the love to read books and not waste time on facebook, youtube, netflix will take over and eventually your brain will crave for it. Feed them these tougher books then. Crux is fill your hours with productive things.
3. **Meditation/Gym** : i still struggle for meditation but have made a habit of doing yoga/meditation first thing in morning. No reasons, if i get late to office/class and have to hear abuses thats my fault of getting up late but meditation has to be done. This has helped me loads as i dont like the faces they make when i swipe in late automatically making my brain to get up slightly early to get things done. Gym i am struggling nowadays as i was on vacation in florida for 12 days and missed gym so now i do not feel like going, i have to push myself but once i am there i become a beast so i know its just a matter of time my will power wins and i defeat my demons\[ AGAIN \].
4. **Great thoughts Great ideas but they got lost** : I had tremendous amounts of ideas popping in my head on daily basis, i dreamt about them, brainstormed them but after a few days i could not even recollect what they were.----&gt; i started keeping a diary , this diary is split up into three parts . One where as soon as i wake up i outline my day things i need to do, things i am going to do and one extra thing to push myself ( i dont always complete them but the progress have been tremendous- be careful to not push your limits ) , second part is where i write positive affirmations and how i am grateful for everything that is happening and thank the universe/god/my parents ( this has made me extremely positive in life). Third part is my crazy ideas : i see something intresting , i write up about it , any idea which clicked my mind i just open my diary and write it. The idea section is now 11 ideas old and i have started executing the first and second one.Now trust me guys this shit is boring, i struggled like hell on what the fuck is this, why do i write in my diary that i woke up , then i have to eat breakfast , then grad school , then office isnt it given and i should do it normally but soon after 25 days you will start noticing that these will become second nature and you will start taking them as something you have to excel at and not something you have to bear. Bonus things : I often miss things my mom tells me due to time zone difference but due to this i write it down and she started crying one day telling how responsible i have become lately( another fun fact i just become a little emotional thinking about that moment : Ripe raw emotions are what SR leads you too and its beautiful)
5. **Quit searching for soul mate** : Just let it go, someone will come along who will vibrate with you and they will be the best thing but one small suggestion i can give to you is increase your flirting, start complementing girls blow them off their feet do it more and more. Build up the courage and compliment. Compliment and move on and do whatever you were doing, this for your self-help. I just started few weeks back, i have no intention of gaining anything but it's keeping my vibration solid, the girls will love you and want to share everything with you eventually and since you are not after any prize you will feel more human and understand that everyone is a human. Small example : I like a girl with whom i worked, my 1st month i was happy that my attraction was working as she would get all nervous and start twirling her hair and become upset when i said i had a gf. then it passed with my magnetism and she was just professional, since i still enjoyed being with her, i often tried to be funny, she did laugh but there was always a pressure to perform ( if you guys are catching my drift) but now i like her but i literally have zero interest in her, i just complimented her out of blue without thinking and now the tables have turned again( only difference is i do not have time for casual dating/relationship). Again the crux is they will come when it is time dont stress over it.
6. **Improve Improve Improve :** i have something which changed and shocked me totally, let me share it with you guys.Imagine we have to live on this earth for 75 years , do you guys know if you decide to dedicate yourself ;follow this path of SR; improve in every way possible. Just give it a year, a year of your dedication, 365 days. Just 365 days of your life.365 Days of your life is just 1% , can you imagine 365 days is just 1% of your life. Cant even imagine what 30 days 90 days are\[90 days is just 0.3% by the way\].If we cannot try to be the best version of ourselves for even 0.3% of our lives do we really deserve all the happiness, wealth, love, affection that world has to offer ?/ This is just a question that you guys have to think deeply about.PS( CALCULATED but excluded sleep , 1-18 years of your life before your dick could stand up properly and other outliers, its just simple math but i am sure even if you include many things the percent wont vary that much as you enjoyed porn free like for first 12 years so potato potato its the same thing).

Also guys many of these stuff are really tough and more harder to implement. I am huge advocate of learning through experiences and truly believe that it is not possible to do anything until your own mind wants to achieve it But when ever your brain decides it is the time, i want to save you the horror of finding what can you i to improve myself?

I am 4 months alcohol free.I am 4 months weed/free.I am 45 days instagram free.I surf reddit much much less.Most important after 12 years , 18 cigarettes on an average a day, i have started the journey to quit cig for good. My lungs today are 7 days old.

I want to conclude all this with a simple thing, give it time dont push yourself so much in one go that your brain thinks it is better to stay safe. Understand the mechanism of the world , everyday you go to gym your strength increases ( it is not visible instantly but you know you are making gains). My friends partied ,had threesome's on tinder , had sex , boozed , laughed on stories of madness, i sat in my room worked hard, still working hard , crafted my resume, thinking each day should not i try to give myself some time off and waste my life a little. But thing is my friends are there abusing the country, laws, outside factors for not getting a interview call and i see clearly what is it you gain with SR ( **Mental clarity and the most important but never talked about nor cared by anyone : THE WILL TO SUCCEED** ). I have over 30 rejection mails stacked up but today i got calls from 2 recruiters but i am still not perfect and i have too much to learn but the thing is my hard-work has shown some glimmer of hope. I hope i convert those internship interviews but i am confident if i keep my head down and continue being the best version of myself, **i will be a beast**.

And to add guys, i am the most horrible example for anything, i have wasted 12 years of my life on cigarettes, mindless parties,  , 11 failed relations, 1 semester of grad school wasted just in pain over a break up, lazy , serial procrastinator , developed man boobs , horrible eating habits, cheat my way out of exams, give the absolute minimum to just pass ( luckily i have been intelligent enough to crack things without putting efforts) but such things and luck can only take you so far SO do not stress ;i know its said a lot here but if i can keep pushing myself and not accept defeat so can you and so will you.

Move on world, make some space, Leaders are here.

Good Night.

adsbsi,9,2019-01-08,Thinking of killing myself in 2 months.,lostlabrador21,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/adsbsi/thinking_of_killing_myself_in_2_months/,"Hi Reddit. Thought this was the best place to literally get this off my chest. Ha ha. And yeah I know this sounds whiny. Believe me. It's another reason why I hate myself so much. 
So here's the deal. I'm a 24 year old male. I graduated college in May. I've had two paid internships since graduating. One military the other political. I have been looking for a job since senior year, and aside from the internships, I have gotten nowhere. 2018 was also one of my worst years.
 A psycho ex tried to fuck with my life spring semester. The cops called me based off one unverified statement from her that basically said I was nuts. I didn't get in trouble but I felt profiled and stressed the fuck out. I felt like a freak and a criminal and lost some rights.  The break up before had been really shitty and I'd been depressed all year from it. She basically used me for sex, pretended to care got really intimate(I usually don't feel safe to be emotionally close with sexual partners) and then dumped me when school started. All summer she acted so sweet, so disarming and so affectionate I never saw it coming. I never should have shared with her that I had depression. She lied to the police about me months later in a false statement saying I was stalking her and quoted me on things I never said. I  hadn't seen her in months until she showed up at my building, where I didn't say a word to her. When I was dealing with this and trying to sort it out, my grandfather fell ill suddenly. I was able to visit him when he was recovering but he died one week after I left. I was very close to him my whole life and that hit me real hard. At the time before his death, I was seriously considering suicide. I was worried the false statement would follow me my whole life and that I'd been profiled as some  kind of freak. Ironically, my grandfather's  death kept me from killing myself at the time because I didn't want to give my family a double whammy. I also met another girl and frankly used that relationship as an emotional escape/distraction and stress relief(I'm a piece of shit). I graduated and went to a paid internship out of state. I stayed in touch with the girl, and we decided to try to have a real ""thing"". I came home after the internship and visited her. She told me I had nothing going for me because I hadn't landed a real job yet, my degree wasn't work anything because I'm not STEM and I was essentially a failure. That I should train in a different field. She confirmed some of my worst feelings about myself. I had been applying to jobs all summer during my internship and got nowhere. I left her and moved a little over a thousand miles away to start fresh. I'm living with another family member. I did a consulting internship for a while and got some money but that's over now and I'm still at square fucking one. I also have no social life in this new state. I had a fuck buddy from tinder for a bit, but it was just more meaningless sex and after she got some fun fucks and dirty pictures out of me, she stopped talking to me. I have no friends here, and when I go out to try to  meet people, I just feel numb. Its like someone threw an off switch in the back of my head and I just can't connect anymore.  I know I'm lucky to have family to stay with but it makes me feel like a goddamn failure. 
 I've applied to hundreds of positions over the last six months, and the only positions that call me for an interview are the bullshit sales jobs that disguise themselves online as ""public relations"" or ""marketing"".  Every day I feel like a bigger and bigger failure. I apply to jobs every day as well, I worked part time over the holidays for UPS. My driver's been there 15 years and it's depressing as shit. 
It feels like I'm going to have to settle for some shitty job I hate  that doesn't pay what a degree is worth and I'm going to be a bad joke the rest of my life. I'm so fucking angry with myself. I hate myself for failing, I hate myself thinking I had a connection and getting used by that woman, and I hate myself agreeing with the last girl that I have nothing going for me.  I hate myself for not having enough adequate work to be a professional, I fucking hate myself enough to kill myself.  I feel pathetic. So pathetic I genuinely want to hurt myself but I don't want to hurt my family. They all say I'm working hard, I'm doing the right thing, that I'm too hard on myself and I just need to keep going. But I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall. It's just not working out. I feel emotuonally broken from last year's experiences, and I don't know how to feel better.
I've applied to the Peace corps with hopes of starting over again and focuing on helping people who really need it (Ive worked abroad before) and I'll know by March. My current mindset is that if I don't have a real job by then or haven't been accepted into the peace corps, I'm done. I've failed for the last fucking time. And no, don't ask me to get help. There is no such thing as help. For one, I have no insurance for treatment. I took antidepressants in high school but all they did was kill my creativity and give me a seizure. And getting hospitalized is a death sentence. They'll just pump me full of drugs, stick me with a huge bill and then I'll be back where I started, but this time saddeld with huge debt, my neurochemistry fucked with and absolutely no chance of getting a job that doesn't involve moping floors. 
 I just wanted to write it down and say it somewhere where no one will panic. I know I sound like a self sorry sad sack of shit. Maybe I am. Just one more reason to bite the fucking bullet."
adsf4t,2,2019-01-08,Episode III: Revenge of the Bliss?,SoundingFurrows,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/adsf4t/episode_iii_revenge_of_the_bliss/,"First post here, on mobile. Just feel a need to rant and share my story.

Growing up, I always knew I struggled with some from on mental illness. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8 or 9 (back in 90s/early 2000s when that was all the rage) I took medication for a while but eventually stopped taking it because I didn’t like the feeling. (I was a kid, who likes swallowing medication) I go through Grade School being kind of a outsider/loner but make enough friends to get through. Things were going developmentally well until the 7th grade when my Dad has his first manic episode after his kids were born. The twins were just born (his youngest of 7) and he wasn’t making enough money. Knew things were going to get rough (and a manic episode coming on) and went to the local psych hospital to get some medication but they refused to give him anything immediately. Long story short he quits his job, leaves the house, and my family/mother have to 302 him based on questionable evidence. 

Here’s me as the oldest in the family who’s trying to process it, and it just kind of shatters my whole world. After grade school going into High School, I was definitely depressed for those couple years. All my memories of that period in my life are one of just kind of a black hole where my self-confidence was lacking, I knew I was gay and didn’t come out to one person until Senior Year, and just me not meeting my potential. I had some good years, Junior year of HS in particular was a pretty stellar one. But moving into Senior year towards graduation I felt an emptiness and anxiety about the future going into college which I wasn’t sure how I was going to handle. 

I went to a little known, but excellent technology based private university in the Northeast. I had friends from HS going and they definitely acted as a support network and got me through that difficult first year. I was studying Computer Science at the time (and ending up switching to the “Man I Suck, M.I.S.” Major a year later) and doing mediocrely. Got A’s and B’s in the Gen Ed classes they made us took and C’s and B’s in the classes more geared towards CS major. Maybe it was the depression which compounded my feelings that C.S. wasn’t for me, but I knew the writing was on the wall after a couple semesters. Then came the alcohol. I hadn’t had a sip of alcohol until my first year in college but I definitely had my fair share of blacking out. Strangely enough, after nights of drinking to excess, I felt a sense of peace. Like I had survived some type of traumatic event and my body was stronger because of it. I was also involved in my local religious campus community, and still feel that spirituality gives me something in my life that I can hold on to. Towards the end of freshman year, I ended up losing my virginity to a guy I became infatuated with shortly after. He was in an Improv group and I ended up joining said Improv group with a hope something could work out between us. It never ended up the way I wanted it to.

Moving into sophomore year I felt a burst of manic energy. I joined the rowing team at the college, (which I had prior experience with three years in HS), was doing pretty well academically (got an award for being a scholar athlete based on GPA or something) and everything felt like it was going like it was supposed to. I also joined said Improv and made a lot of good friends there. Got a job on campus at a restaurant. I ended up getting in trouble for an alcohol related offense and had to go to counseling, but nothing major which showed up on my record. Got an internship for the summer afterwards (which was required for the program I was in). Overall, not a bad year. 

Junior year was another excellent year. Excelled in all of my classes. Quit the rowing team because it wasn’t what I was looking for in my college experience. Maintained the Improv group. Joined a professional fraternity. And still had a great relationships and friends. Good roommates, parties, etc. Around February of the Spring semester I started smoking cigarettes, which is a habit I still maintain today. Smoking, drinking, I found my self-medication to get me through. Got another internship around the city I went to school in, thing were looking bright. 

Senior year started out pretty sweet. Moved to a house off campus with two friends from HS and another great person. I made student manager and weekend bartender at the restaurant I worked at. I was on track to graduate in the spring. We threw awesome parties and I went to some pretty wild ones along the way. Drinking, smoking, socializing, everything felt really, well perfect. Then Winter break hit. I had started to build up a lot of resent towards my parents for some reason. I believe this was a result of my sexuality. I came out to them around this period,  (prior to this, I was out to all my college friends) and their response was about as good as one could expect. Acceptance, love, all that Jazz. But I was still resentful that my dating/sexuality was never a topic they addressed with my personally. Is agreed that I would start seeing a therapist when I got back to school.

I start my sessions with an intern at the counseling center (and all of our sessions are taped and monitored by the director of counseling) and the topic of our discussion mainly revolves around how I felt like I was too, perfect. Like I didn’t deserve all the good opportunities I have had in life thus far. Any-who, I got to a conference for my fraternity and it was a complete rager for me. I drank, I smoked, I had sex, I spent a lot of money. The whole 9 yards. I get back and I already was behind on my course work, and my mind won’t turn off. I get back to school at like 9 PM Sunday night and I didn’t sleep the entire night. Smoked at least a pack of cigarettes throughout the night. Went to my morning class and also smoked a bunch. I recall the sound of what sounded like the entire class sniffing my smell of cigarettes. And then things start to get weird.

I interpret people’s facial expressions towards me very deeply, I think the campus is monitoring me. I walk briskly around campus and look behind me because I think representatives of the counseling center are following me. I only go to my first class and go home for the rest of the day to try to sleep. I call a friend over and he spends a good part of the night trying to calm me down. At this point I was too afraid to go outside to smoke because I started having visual hallucinations. I’m also hearing some type of radio signals/static/interference on my phone. I think it’s the CIA. I spend all of Monday night/Tuesday morning calling every crisis line trying to get some help. I call friends, call my parents/mentors at odd hours of the morning. People are starting to realize that things weren’t okay. I was also acting very aggressive towards my parents, yelling and swearing at them for no reason. My roommates don’t really know how to handle all this. I had a standing therapy appointment on Wednesday and I mentor on campus had offered to drive me to my appointment. I go to the appointment and tell the therapist what’s up and that I need go to the hospital. They bring in the student social worker and contact all my professors and let me know how long I can be on leave. I get driven to the local hospital by the campus police and go to the observation room. Luckily enough the mentor was able to spend a couple hours with me there and calm me down. But when she left, things only get worse. I start seeing smiley faces all over the walls in some type of neon color. I can’t sleep. I wasn’t admitted to the Pscyh Ward for like 14-16 hours. They brought in a wheel chair and take me there. At that point, I had though I died and went to heaven.

I felt a sense of peace. Like I had entered the afterlife. I was so interested in the fellow patients. I made jokes and played games with the doctors/nurses/techs. They gave me Ativan, lithium, Risperidone. They helped calm me down. But I was still having delusions. My roommates had no idea where I was. I had a phone and ended up contacting them and my family. My Dad visits me. I start to gain a sense of reality back and contact my professors to let them know I’m coming back to finish my last semester. I had to end up dropping one class. But I still could walk. After getting out after 10 days it felt like getting out of prison. I felt like a new man. I excel at my classes and finish the semester with my highest GPA ever. I take my medication regularly and give up alcohol and smoking. I graduated (sort of). Still needed one class to finish the degree. Then I start feeling empty.

Summer roles around and I go on vacation while taking this online class to finish me degree but fail the fuck out of it. No motivation to do anything. Lay in bed all day and watch twitch streams. Don’t look for a job, don’t have a psychiatrist. October/November rolls around and I end up finding an entry level job at a good company. I find a psychiatrist, start drinking and smoking again. Things starting feeling better.

New year comes in and I’m working out three days a week, spend money on a personal trainer, take my nutrition seriously, volunteer 6 hrs a week. Go to conferences for the my fraternity, meet friends. Things felt really good again. Then Saint Patrick’s Day comes around and I visit my Brothers who go to a well known university for their St. Paddies Day shenanigans. I drink a lot, I smoke, I socialize. Things feel really good at this point. The weeks leading up to this, I was also writing a business plan for a restaurant I was going to open it up and pitching it to executives I knew. I get back from St. Paddies Day and my Brian doesn’t want to shit off. I ask my boss if I can come in late. I work for 4 hours, and I start hallucinating again. I see things on the the computer which I interpret very seriously. I get phone calls where I attribute too much meaning to people’s names, phone numbers, cities, etc. my last phone call of the day I have the person present their computer monitor to me and I see that they get an email that says “Go To St. Louis”

So I did. Almost. 

I get home and buy the next Greyhound bus ticket to St. Louis. I get to the station and homeless people start asking me for money and I empty my bank account. I board the bus and I start hallucinating again. I hear voices that I feel are talking to me, I think I see a poster of my brain scan posted at the front of the greyhound bus. I’m sitting in seat 51. And then I go into the bathroom. I get rid of my clothes, my cell phone and wallet, my passport. At our next stop someone knocks on the bathroom door and I exit in the nude. I had deluded myself into thinking that this was a new garden of eden, where man could begin again. I’m wandering around nude when I walk into the bus station and they hand me a towel and call the police. The police recover my belongings on the bus and take me to the closest hospital. They ask me who I am and I assume a false identity. I eventually tell them the truth and the run some tests to make sure I’m not on drugs. At this point, I had convinced myself I was on some black site where they where going to take me out. I refused to sleep. When the want to transport me to another hospital with a better psych ward, I resist them and they have to strap me down. It was the most intense experience in my life. Being transported to the hospital. It felt like I was on a roller coaster. 

I get to the hospital and then give me some haldol through my butt. Felt like they were pulling barbed wire through the body. Felt kind of nice actually, like a jolt of lighting. Days go by in the hospital and I make friends with all the patients. I try to escape once but didn’t make it very far. I settle down and call my parents everyday. My brothers take me home. 7 days.

I come back to normal life taking meds, avoiding alcohol, getting a lot of sleep, working. Then things start to get mediocre again. I was taking a class online to finish my degree and was doing fine in that class despite some missed deliverables. I get slightly depressed. Then around the beginning of May my Dad has first episode in like 10 years. We have to 302 him. I felt a sense of guilt that my episode a couple months earlier may of triggered his. Oh, and I had leased a car without a license prior to the hospitalization without telling my parents so I was suffering financially. I got out of my contact with my personal trainer thankfully. Summer comes along and I’m still moderately depressed. Don’t talk to any friends, sleep a lot. Feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I stop the meds before July and don’t see any hope. This past November rolls around and I start drinking and smoking and having sex again. I start seeing friends back from holidays, and applying to better positions within the company, and things are feeling good, really good.

So here I am, in the midst of my third manic episode. Hoping it doesn’t end up with a third hospitalization but I’m not sure. I haven’t seen a psychiatrist/therapist in 8 months. Planning on seeing one soon contingent on making more money at this new job. Plan on moving out my parents house soon as well. I have a lot of exciting plans for 2019. I feel like depression has robbed me of a year of my life for the past two years in not seeing friends, doing anything meaningful, etc. Well that’s it.

TLDR; Have has two manic episodes in the span of two years with hospitalizations periods of depressions lasting 6-8 months between. I think I’m in my third.

They fought less when I was younger, but they also never slept in the same room. They never really showed affection for each other.

Since I've been at college, they've started sleeping in the same room in the same bed. While I'm home for break, I tend to stay up very late and because of it, I hear my parents fight when they think my siblings and I are asleep. I hear them yelling at each other, and I think they hit each other sometimes. I know my mother has had depression since her father (my grandfather) died, and my dad has some anger issues coupled with some skewed definitions of love (his parents used to beat him as a kid, but as an Asian family, my siblings and I grew up learning this was normal). I know neither of them are in the right, but I also know they have no plans to divorce because of us (their kids). They fight so much I know it isn't healthy. During the day, I try to watch carefully and sometimes it looks like they're honestly happy, but at night, they're more likely to fight.

I know my mom thinks my dad is cheating. I know that on one hand, it may be my mom misunderstanding or her depression making her think these sort of things, but one the other hand, I've seen my dad leave late at night and come back two or three hours later. I know my dad doesn't let my mom or my siblings touch his phone or know his password. But I also don't think my dad is the type of person to cheat and I know he is allowed his privacy. From what I've heard, this is the thing they fight about most.

They know I know they fight to some extent, and they tell me not to worry, just worry about getting my degree, focus on getting internships and jobs, etc. but as their kid, especially as the oldest, it feels like I shouldn't do nothing. I just want to know what I can do. I know obviously I can't do anything to directly fix my parent's marriage, but the idea of doing nothing at all just seems... If there's anything at all, any advice from someone who had been in my shoes, I'll be thankful. What did you do when your parents fought? Is there any way I can make things easier for them?"

adteca,2,2019-01-08,Is this anxiety or am I just lazy? [long post],tatilopespt,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/adteca/is_this_anxiety_or_am_i_just_lazy_long_post/," I’m doing an academic internship in a company, it’s a month and half away from finishing. According to the initial planning by now I think I would have to be done more a huge project in the company. I’m working with my mentor and also a group of 4 professors from uni who are involved in a project in this company. At the beginning of the internship I would have regular meetings with them, they would tell what they needed and what should I do, and then my mentor would help me lay out the best course of action and with any doubts I would have. 

Since December I don’t have any contact with them. They asked me to change some graphics and as soon as I did that they would meet with me so we would all work together, they would help me moving forward, what would I do etc. The thing is I emailed them the graphs as soon as I did them, and I got no answer (normally they would reply back within a few days to make remarks). By the end of the week I contacted my mentor saying I didn’t had any reply if it wasn’t best to schedule a meeting. She said she would talk to them, but until yesterday I heard nothing from anyone. Yesterday she emailed me asking if could meet her Wednesday afternoon to see where I am at and take a look at my work.

What I am stressing about is that since the beginning of December I hadn’t done visible work in the company, I had just been working on my essay (that I have to present at the end of internship). Because 1) they told me they would help getting started and 2) even though I know theoretically what to do, I haven’t done anything like this before, and I have a lot of trouble talking to/asking for stuff with the people in this company. I get really nervous, I rehearse it in my head a thousand times before asking a simple question, and when it comes to this project it would require constant help from people and I hadn’t done anything because I’m so overwhelmed. 

I’m meeting with my mentor tomorrow, and I’m starting to get nervous when she sees I haven’t done any advances in the project. She is really understanding and as helped me a lot, deep down I know she will help me, but I feel like I could have work harder and am a failure. 

I also have a record of making things harder for myself (overthinking and not talking to people), and simultaneously thinking it's too hard for me so failure is my best option. If I finish this internship and pass it will be the first time in a lot of years I succeed at something academic in my life. 

**TL;DR:** Sometimes I think I am just lazy and use anxiety as an excuse for myself.

-----

Hello DPP! I'm here trying to ~~ride the success of previous posts~~ write something unique and exciting compared to my previous posts! You may have seen me around here before, and if I suddenly stopped responding or if I didn't respond at all, consider the fact that I had one metric *fuckload* of responses. You can compare the amount of responses I got to a pornstar offering to do free cock-rates on a public snapchat account. 

Yeah.

Anyways, I figure that I'll list off heroes/villains of Overwatch/Talon and we can come up with a fun little story where this little intern offers her pussy(And ass and mouth) up to get ploughed!

-----

***Jack Morrison, Soldier 76.*** - While I am aware that Jack Morrison was LITERALLY just confirmed to be gay, that still doesn't change my horny little mind. I picture we can either do *young* Jack or *old* Jack. That fat pale cock is probably a fucking monster in bed, something Ana would dream about as she spied on him using a few well-hidden cameras in the base. It'd be a fat thing, a small dusting of pubes at the base. **Potential Story:** Young Jack Morrison fucking the intern in the shower, Old Jack Morrison plowing her in an alley, Young Jack Morrison fucking her quietly in a work-out room, Old Jack Morrison being taken care of by a nurse.

***Jesse Mcree.*** - This hot cowboy might be on the younger side (For Overwatch, he's still like 37!), but boy does he recognize good pussy. All American county boy with a cock that could break a girl in two, he can really give a girl a good time. He's been known to have complaints that his beard tickles soft thigh tissue, he more than makes up for it by his organ slipping into a girl's holes and giving her the *time* of her life. **Potential story:** Younger Jesse (Deadlock gang) fucking bar babes in route 66. Current Jesse banging the intern in a car, after leaving a bar. (I know, not much difference but I can picture myself giving that fat cock of his a nasty bit of lip-service after downing a few drinks.

***Mako Rutledge, Roadhog.*** - If you can figure out hot to make it hot, I'm super down. I see Roadhog as being a cuddly guy, his hands easily dwarfing my ass. That being said, his bio literally says he's a ruthless killer so--I mean, your call, not mine. **Potential story:** Your call, really. Suggest things.

***Akande Ogundimu, Doomfist.*** - Ignoring the fact that I'm a total snowbunny, Doomfist is one of the ones I'm excited for. In the clink he had plenty of fan girls, pining for his release. Hell, I was one of them! I had a doom fist tattoo on my ass cheek, I'd write letters, attach polaroids of me nude, begging that if he got out he'd come to my house and do unspeakable things to my boyfriend before plowing me in bed until my headboard was a fine sawdust. Sure, he may not have an arm but just *picture* how hot it would be to tell my boyfriend up that a guy with ONE arm is better than him! **Potential story:** Cuckolding. Oh yeah. That's bout it.

***Gabriel Reyes, Reaper.*** - Naturally, this will be pre-ghostification. This daddy American with latino background man is probably one of if not is my favorite characters here. I picture a fat, long cock, probably cut, and I picture it fucks what it wants. So, how will he react to a curvy, white bitch wanting his fat donkey cock so far up her ass that she's walking funny when going back to her post for her intern-ship? Let's find out. **Potential Story:** (While I know I didn't really give much to work off of, I'm really, really open. Want to make it a relationship? Absolutely. Lets work together.

***Reinhardt Wilhelm, Reinhardt.*** - Calm down there gramps, gonna strain yourself. Sure, he's strong enough to lift me and cuddle me and fuck me like a fleshlight, but that was back in the day! Now-a-days he might have issues keeping his breath while he pounds that absolute meat-hammer of sex into me while I'm mewling below him. Hopefully he will feel young fucking a younger woman. **Potential story:** Younger girl getting fucked by the decorated protector helps to make him feel young again!

***Lucio, Hanzo, Genji, Torbjorn.*** I honestly cannot come up with anything fun in mind. If you guys have an idea, I'll be happy to add it to this, I'm always looking to modify how fun things get!

***Winston, Wrecking ball (Hammond), Zenyatta, Bastion, Junkrat*** No. Not really interested in them. They can watch, sure.

WHHHHEW. 

So anyways, I've got reference pics for my character in PM's. I play ***Exclusively on reddit*** so you won't really peep me getting off of here much unless you're *very* good or you make me *very* much laugh. (Ie, I do have a discord but I've added THREE people to that in my time.)

adu6ni,0,2019-01-08,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/adu6ni/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! It's a new one, so I'm sure there are kinks to work out along the way, but I really like the concept!

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"

adub4d,56,2019-01-08,Do you know what's sad? This show had a lot of potential,AllieKyle,GossipGirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GossipGirl/comments/adub4d/do_you_know_whats_sad_this_show_had_a_lot_of/,"GG is something I both hate and love. I hate it because it's superficial, outdated, repetitive and inconsistent. And yet I love it because it had so much potential.

I think of this most in Blair. She's such a fascinating character to watch, the kind of 'Mean Girl' trope that I think hasn't been done yet, at least not as well as her in the first few seasons. She starts off as the typical Queen Bee trope but evolves into a mature, intelligent, hard-working woman. She's privileged and spoiled, yet it's revealed that she's not afraid to get her hands dirty (all the work she did to get that magazine internship). She's top dog but she has her moments of vulnerability. But even with all this she's still someone who's cunning and ruthless. It's the kind of Teen!Miranda Presley kind of vibe I expected.

Buuut of course that got thrown out the window. The same Blair who refused to use a woman's affair as blackmail to get into a university ends up...well, using blackmail in the future. The same Blair who rooted for Jenny and befriended/dated Dan practically ended up killing all that development in the final season. The same Blair who plotted with Serena once she reached college because their friendship was strong at that point reverted back to scheming against her. It's sad because you can see her slow burn character development only for them to seemingly forget it during season 5. I hate to say it, but I do know what I'm talking about because I've had upclose and personal experience with this type of relationship, but Blair honestly seems like the sort of wife who would get constantly abused by her husband and still go back to him out of some misguided belief that their love is just 'passionate', hate as strongly as they love, a 'doomed, forbidden relationship' when really it's just toxic and abusive.

And Chair. Oh God. In an alternate universe, Chuck's development would have been consistent. It would have stuck and been fascinating to watch. He would be truly changed and he and Blair could have been the ultimate power couple, both spoiled and cruel but then developing into mature people who may use their evil brains for good, if that makes sense. Instead they're a poster child for toxic relationships. Love or hate Dair or even Chuck and Eva, you can't deny they were much healthier relationships. Well, until they decided to make Dan GG. But that's a whole other category of its own.

Serena could have been an extremely interesting character. We all know the girl in real life who's skated by on her looks and charm, and we've all seen that girl plummet hard once reality kicked in. It would have been great to see the same in Serena. They were heading towards the right direction with the movie plot and that guy who wasn't afraid to point out how privileged she is, which only challenged her into becoming better.  Same goes for the job she had in the Spectator. She was on her way to becoming hardworking, independent, focused on something other than her love life. But for some reason they wanted end-season 5 to resemble a comeback to the first season and like Blair, wiped that all away.

And Dan. Of course, he's the biggest problem. He acted like the viewer, had our thoughts about watching these upper-class kids acting like adults who didn't have any rules. He was relatable. Pretentious, sure. Hypocritical, definitely. But then again, who isn't a little hypocritical, right? At heart he was still a guy always trying to do the right thing...that is, of course, until they revealed he was Gossip Girl. Suddenly that nice, supportive, caring guy actually seems creepy if you really think about it: the number of times Dan's looked at someone in the eyes and lied to them about knowing something (he's GG so he knows practically everything), or manipulated people into thinking he was one sort of person.

I don't wanna throw around the word sociopathy...buuuut since he's a fictional character, it's not far off to imply he could fit into the category of a sociopath: charming, would never seem like a sociopath, manipulative, only cares about people as a means to an end...arguably, the only reason he 'loved' Serena was because she was a representation of the upper class world he wanted to become a part of (very Daisy Buchanan and Jay Gatsby, really). The number of times he's changed his reputation from lonely boy to playboy on Gossip Girl, hinting that all the girls he dated were just girls he used to boost his image. He couldn't have loved Serena or Blair that much given how many hateful words he spewed about them on GG when they were broken up. That shows a lot of bitterness and resentment that is kind of terrifying. If Chuck is the type of billionaire CEO who secretly bangs his secretary and beats his wife (poor Blair), then Dan is that guy who will stalk his wife, guilt-trip her, gaslight her, manipulates her and everyone around her to isolate her, and secretly hate her behind closed doors. I've said this before, but it's quite ironic Penn has took the role of sociopathic Joe in 'You', since it actually fits the darker image of Dan Humphrey to a T.

Basically, the show is just sad. You watch these characters grow and they're actually pretty interesting, until they all regress and the show gets out of hand and suddenly you don't know who is what anymore and you mistake the final season for the first season because all the growth seems to have disappeared. I would argue the show could be an allegory for just that: the fact that the rich and privilege will never really learn from their mistakes and keep repeating cycles. Yet the show presents their ending as happy and good: the gang all get successful careers, are still friends with each other and have families. But the show had plenty of potential to not just expose class differences and injustice (which they sort of touched upon during the first season, Dan acknowledging people will never give him the free pass that they do with Serena or Nate), but to also reveal parts of people, rich or poor, that can be wonderful and disgusting at the same time. It could have been very Great Gatsby-ish, showing that the life of luxury won't matter if you're always missing some sort of fulfilment (whether it's love, career, or anything else). It could have showed that people can change and grow for the better, regardless of their backgrounds and what they've been taught.

A very common theme is for the upper east siders and Dan to not want to become their parents. Yet ironically, it seems they're heading towards that very direction. But it could have easily gone in a direction that said 'you are your parents' child but you are not your parents'.

Anyways sorry for the long rant xD It's just that I get so frustrated with wasted potential and to me GG will always be THAT show that could have been great but just ended up failing."

**Consumerism and what is seen everyday, but not spoken about**

You can find $5 graphic tees and $30 jackets at walmart. To the uninformed, it makes no sense to sell a $25 t-shirt when they can easily go get a 3-pack from Hanes for a lot less. What makes us different from the brands that push 1000s of product a week through Walmart, Target, JcPennys, etc? They sell commodity and we sell emotion. As long as something is cheap, wearable and accessible, most people will buy it. I’ve worked in the backrooms of malls and retail stores, and one of the things I’ve noticed was that Guy Harvey and those random companies that make licensed gear, do numbers foreal. Once a week, we’d get a truck in that brought new product to the store. 

By the time it hit Wednesday, we’d be out of most t-shirts, jackets, hats and small accessories. 100s and 100s of SKUS would seemingly fly off the shelves at what seemed like a slow rate. I used to watch customers look for the cheapest version of whatever they were looking for and blindly buy it, without consideration for different brands. This happened on the day to day basis. They didn’t have the time to go on such and such’s website to read their story, nor did they want to spend 2 hours in the store, it looked decent enough, so they bought it. 

Now think about the mindset you have to have to even care about what fabric your jacket is made out of, or whether you’ve remembered to sign up for a newsletter. God forbid you miss a drop from a brand thats not going nowhere no time soon, or the brand rereleases what you’re adamant about purchasing. I believe that most people that are into streetwear, fashion or alternative clothing in general, lean more on the emotional side than the average person. This mentality is fun and neurotic, so brands have to dress it up with things like positioning and marketing, so that the consumers can receive it as fun and neurotic. How else would you capture an emotional and thoughtful consumer base? 

**Fashion houses and one way they extend their lifespan in the 21st century with assimilation**

Building up a name is one thing. Getting a few flagship stores is one thing. How do companies in general survive and maintain their footing across 50 or 100 years? Despite popular belief, there isn’t a sole designer designing the collections and products that you see on SSENSE or High Snobiety. In most cases, there are several junior designers working under your Virgils of the world, with interns working under them. A bunch of ideas are created (or completely stolen) and brought in to the roundtable before it’s sent to production. So essentially what you have here is a team of people tailor made to devote 8 hours of their day studying and transmuting the brand’s DNA. Hire new people every few years, and now you have a team that can consistently bring in ideas, do curate mood boards and deliver product on a day to day basis. The best of the best gets okay’d and sent to production — months and sometimes a year before its drop date. 

It’s smarter to hire your copycat or your competitor than to crush him. To copy someone, you’d have to have spent a considerable amount of time analyzing them. They could’ve picked anyone to mimic but they picked you. You want this guy or woman on your team because you can play off of each other and use your combined energy to amplify your work. Two minds are better than one. 

Louis Vuitton hired Virgil Abloh not because of his skills as a designer, but because Offwhite makes enough money to show up on LVs radar. Offwhite wasn’t going nowhere, so it was smart for them to bring him on board capture some of his consumer base and hype. It also helps them culturally to bring on a black guy to lead design on a major label. Virgil gets a “legit” client on his resumé and more experience. Win-win for all parties involved.

I’m unsure what to do. 

I’m currently studying at a state university getting a dual degree  in Economics (BS) and International affairs (BA). The economics side of my degree has helped me learned necessary skills like computer programming, excel, research etc. 

I currently have an unpaid internship as a Project management assistant, and I’m hoping in the summer I can either find a part time job (in addition to my internship)  to help defray costs or an internship back home (hopefully paid) while I take online classes. 

I’m expected to graduate this Fall of 2019. 
My current loan is $7,589

The MAX amount of loans I should graduate with is no more than $10,000. 

I currently have a housing scholarship but I still have to pay a semester fee of $980 for groceries and electric/water etc. This is EVERY semester. I have paid $300 of already. So $680 is left for this semester.

In my savings I have on one account:

$3,485

Second: 

$786 

Should I take a $400-$500 loan this semester to pay this semester fee? I’m not in a position to take 5 classes + my internship + a part time job. 

I just get anxiety when it comes finances because I have zero guidance.

Thank you :)

adwdux,5,2019-01-08,Skeptical about reaching out.,BrittneyFett,Adopted,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adopted/comments/adwdux/skeptical_about_reaching_out/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Im sorry for the long post, and I will try to be as clear as possible, but I feel like giving a bit of a back story will help understand why this is such a hard decision..and maybe it will help me finally get it off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

I am the product of an in family adoption, and was told that my birth father was dead for most my life, except, he isn't.

From the time I was little, my birth mother had told me that she did not know who my father was. I spent a few years with her before she had my sister (with another man) and shortly after that when I was about 5 my mother decided she just couldn't handle two kids (Drug addiction, not being able to hold down a job, poor education and just a party mentality didn't help with this) Her well off father decided that the best decision for her was that she give me up to her older, slightly more successful sister who was having issues getting pregnant with her new husband (I found out down the road that my grandfather actually paid my adoptive mother a rather large sum of money to take me) Plans were made and papers were signed and I was off to my new home in Toronto Ontario (I was born in Annapolis Maryland) During the transition My new ""mom"" Had gotten pregnant. She previously had a child (my cousin/brother) with her previous husband and was now having another son with my adoptive dad. My Brother/cousin was born about two months before I arrived, and he was born with an extreme disability (Myotonic Dystrophy) This caused my adoptive mother to go through some extreme PPD and led to a lot of resentment from her towards me (why did her drug addict sister birth a perfectly healthy baby when adoptive mom was an extremely health conscious hippy and birthed a baby barely surviving) So needless to say, the excitement of the new girl was very quickly crushed by the outcome of my brother. And she never let me forget that. She spent the next 17 years of my life letting me know that I was now a burden, scolding me for things I could do that my brother couldn't, keeping me separated from the family and from family vacations and just making my life miserable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Through this time I had incredibly limited contact with my birth mother and almost no contact with my birth sister. My relationship with my adoptive father was somewhat limited, id get a few words of encouragement from him, but no affection,  my relationship with my older brother was strained since he already felt cast out as a step child and my relationship with my younger brother was limited through his disability (even though I spent my life protecting him and loving him despite my adoptive mothers efforts to crush any sort of relationship.. He was and will always be my little Lamb. Through all this I never felt a sense of family or connection, and made my friends my family. But inside I felt very much alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the day after I graduate high school and my adoptive mother tells me she wants to take  an overnight trip with me to Niagara Falls and to pack a change of clothes. I sheepishly thought maybe this was going to be some sort of bonding experience, maybe it would give us time to finally connect. We drove over the border, and she just kept driving, and driving. I knew something was up, and just accepted that no good was coming from this. I didn't even ask her where we were going, I knew better. She drove me all the way to my biological grandmothers house (where my birth mother had been living) pulled up into the driveway and told me to get out.  I grabbed my backpack and made my way up the driveway as she sped off, rang the doorbell and no one answered. I sat on the front stoop in what was a very remote area at the time and just cried. Finally a truck pulled up and a little old lady got out of it, she recognized me immediately and I had seen pictures of her. She gave me the biggest, longest, most amazing hug of my life and told me everything was going to be ok. My birth mother and sister soon came home. My mother was a bit surprised to see me and my sister was not that on board with yet another person entering the cramped household (since, we have grown to be inseparable, she is my very best friend). I settled into a  routine with my new lifestyle. Coming from living in a city just a few blocks from a subway to a small country town with no public transportation and not having a drivers license was a bit of a challenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, my birth mother was either stoned off her ass to the point where she could barely hold a conversation or passed out completely. My grandmother did most of the parenting as best as she could. Id ask her questions about my mom, and my dad and she would give me vague answers or say that it was something I needed to discuss with my mother. Growing up the stories of my dad went, oh I didn't know him, or it was a one night stand and I didn't even catch his name when he was passing through to the final story of, he had died in a car accident and I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want it to hurt you. Eventually I just stopped asking and went about my life. Until one day after I had moved out and was back visiting my mother. My grandmother had passed and I was sitting with my mother, telling her how my heart was broken and how sad I was that our little unit was now only the three of us..and thats when my mother said a name.. My birth fathers name.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back to my apartment, fired up my laptop, and very reluctantly typed the name into facebook. He was the only one. I clicked on it and it opened up a profile of a loving father to two beautiful daughters that looked like younger versions of me. Literally, the oldest of the two could be my twin. He was successful, living in Indiana with a bubbly looking wife who looked like she could have been plucked off the tv screen from a show with the perfect mother. There were photos of birthday parties, holidays, soccer tournaments, graduations, cooking together, celebrating, hugs and all smiles. Everything I had longed for. Everything I never had. I closed my laptop and let it all sink in. I spent the next few days trying to wrap my head around it and battling with how to go about making contact. I came back to my laptop and sent out the first message. A brief description of who I was, who my mother was, where I was born, who had adopted me and that I was trying to find my birth father, not to reconnect, but so that I could learn more about my family health history. He wrote back, he let me know that when he left town his brother had informed him that my mother had been walking around with a baby bump. My father contacted her and she insisted that the baby was someone elses (she actually put her gay best friends name on my birth certificate) and told him to mind his business, shortly after I was born she moved us to Florida. He told me that after that he took her word for it and didn't press the matter, but in the back of his mind he always wondered and that he would like to reconnect with me, he just needed to find a way to break the news to his wife, and than his kids.  We messaged back and fourth a few times and I was excited that I was that much closer to having a real family.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats when I received another message. It was from an older woman, with the last name of my father. It was my paternal grandmother from his side. She said that if I was anything like my biological mother that I was trash and unwelcome in her family. That my presence would destroy his family and rip apart his marriage. How dare I interrupt the lives of his daughters, a life he worked so hard to build for them. That I looked nothing like them and that I was probably just coming around for the money (unbeknownst to me, he had inherited a great deal of it, none of that ever came up in conversation but I could see how the timing looked a little suspect) She told me to pay for a paternity test or get lost. At that time I couldn't pay for testing, I was a broke Intern at the U.S Senate (a small accomplishment) but I took her words to heart. I left his last message unanswered, and carried on with my life. He hasn't contacted me since.  I dont know whether its because he spoke to his wife and it didn't go well, or if his mother played a part, or if me not responding scared him off. Its been 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday my sister called me and told me she got me a 23and me kit. That she wants me to use it, and finally get some answers.

&amp;#x200B;

 Me and my sister consider ourselves our only biological family left. Our mother is out of the picture and we have one bio uncle who has been out of the picture for many many years. We both have grown in the past decade. She has started a family, has a great husband and two beautiful twin babies that make my heart burst when I see them. I found the absolute love of my life, we got married two months ago and bought a home together. We are talking about expanding our family. And I guess my thoughts are, after all these years, have I let too much time go between trying to reconnect to my father? Do I just accept my small family and be happy with what I have? Do I owe it to my future children to have them know their grandfather? Do I spit in a tube and just hope, by chance, that someone out there has done it as well and maybe they will find the connection and reach out to me? Do I sit on my feelings like I have, knowing that me reaching out further could disrupt his home life? what if I went through all this for nothing, and when we do the DNA test, despite the resemblance, I am not actually his daughter. where do I go from there.

2. I haven't gotten in yet, in the process of applying
3. Applying for CS
4. This is the only Uni I'm applying to in the US

I'm just kinda confused as to how the program and internships itself are, like is it difficult getting internships because of any VISA issues or something. And with Trump around, how is the job market looking in 4-5 years? 

Also, it'd be quite an investment for me, so is it actually worth it when I graduate in terms of employability? because I'd rather be there for as long as possible if I'm investing a lot.

And I know Trump won't be around when I graduate but you never know, so is it worth taking the risk (if at all)?"

I’m strongly considering getting my MS in Counseling. I have a Bachelors in Nutrition and Dietetics, working in LTC as a Registered Dietetic Technician. Considering my background, am I eligible? In order to become a Registered Dietitian, I need to be accepted to an dietetic internship. Most dietetic internships have the following concentrations: food service management, community nutrition or clinical nutrition. There are a few dietetic internships with alternative concentrations, including nutrition for mental health or nutrition counseling. They’re very hard to get into. It is highly encouraged to not work while doing the internship. This includes working part time jobs. Not the most ideal situation. I’ve always been fascinated by patients’ histories, to which poor mental health played a big part in their current nutritional status and overall health status. I’m intrigued to see what I can do with both fields. I’m sure there’s a lot more to consider if I were to go forward with this. 



I’m all ears. Fill me in, let me know what you think!

i will try to wrap this up quickly, so let me introduce myself.

im a computer science student, currently 24 years old, who in a month or two, will start prepping up for gaining an internship in one of the big shot companies - amazon, facebook, google, microsoft or similar. before i did that, i wanted to move from ""light a cigarette and brew coffee"" right upon waking morning routine, started exercising (4 weeks now, twice per week, but only cardio - plan to add weights this month) and read more. the effects are great, but only thing i changed for the morning is to eat a breakfast (oatmeal with berries). and none of reading and exercising is fixxated really, i've done reading on daily and exercising on weekly, ""i feel like this now"" basis.

&amp;#x200B;

my current morning routine looks like this:

wake up between 10 and 11am

light up radio

brush teeth

drink water

eat breakfast

whole body with head showering

coffee with cigarettes

go to class (almost always at noon) or do shit

&amp;#x200B;

so, you're probably asking yourself - whats the question?

/\*no actual need to read framed text below\*/

&amp;#x200B;

    well, the question is, if i start waking at around 9am and going to the gym and do stuff after that (starting at noon), will i, in time, increase my productivity or reduce it? by productivity, i mean focus on college and interview prepping stuff
    even if i do so, should i hit the gym every day (and do something like 4 days of cardio + lifting and 3 days of only cardio), since its like first - hour - of the day thing?
    but if i do so, will i be too tired after 7pm when i want to do my interview prepping?
    the things i like about this routine:
    ~9:30 am wakeings
    ~gym + morning routine stuff
    ~12 am class
    ~university stuff until about 7
    ~socializing/interview prepping/some netflix things
    is that i get to go ""somewhere"" every morning on workdays (the bolded questions above remain), will get pretty pumped and in time, probably accomplish my goal. certain fears about it are outlined above.
    
    idea number 2 looks like this:
    ~wake around 9am
    ~light up radio
    ~do morning stuff with added 10-20 minute apartment exercise or running around the block
    ~work on my interview prepping until ~11:30am, for about 2 hours
    ~go to class
    ~hit the gym 2 or 3 times after class
    ~do everything else
    

outlining it like this, idea number 2 looks more suited toward my main goal.

but even if i do so, since i wouldnt really have a timegap between exercise and breakfast, in which order should i do morning stuff?

&amp;#x200B;

example:

wake at 8:30 am

light up radio

drink a glass of water

brush my teeth

eat breakfast with coffee making

do exercise for 10 to 15 minutes (should i swap breakfast and exercise out? should  i get a running machine into an apartment to do cardio for best focus-all-day results? will some basic body or weightlifting have the same result on my focus between those two and cardio?)

take a shower

meditate for 10 minutes (should i swap shower and meditation?

do interview prepping with coffee drinking until 11:30

do messages

noon - be at colleage

hit the gym twice or trice per week after class

&amp;#x200B;

okay, so, outlining it like this, i prefer idea number 2 much better. it seems more realistic.

so the main question is - how exactly should i form bottom line routine to be ""best optimized"" for focus and fitness and goal results?"

I’m currently in the process of doing so but have been very busy because this was my last semester of school and I had a full-time internship. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder about two years ago (I read that these other diagnoses are common with this). I was referred to a psychiatrist for testing to determine the diagnosis which lasted 2 days, and then returned to my primary care physician to receive medication. So I have not seen an actual psychiatrist yet, other than when I was being diagnosed. I’m sure after establishing a relationship with one and processing everything this will become more clear, but I believe it is possible I could struggle with cyclothymic disorder.

I mainly think so because I have noticed my energy/mental health to flip on and off like a light switch. Sometimes I believe this is triggered by certain things, like my anxiety if I have something important looming over me that I need to deal with and am awfulizing in my head. However I really feel like this happens so drastically and doesn’t necessarily always fit with my circumstances. For example, sometimes I will be “manic” when I have a lot to do and will feel like I’m on top of the world for a few days, and in the same or better circumstances I might find myself glued to my bed in a depressive state for up to a week. I always wake up one day and just find my way out of it though, it seems impossible for me to remain in one state for too long. The reason I’m concerned about a diagnosis is because I know that if unacknowledged it can lead to bipolar disorder and my symptoms can worsen, I know that my mental health doesn’t necessarily need to fit into a box for me to deal with it but I’m starting to really wonder if this diagnosis fits my experience.

Growing up, especially in middle school, I would have bouts of self-harm and episodes of depression, but I wouldn’t have considered myself to be depressed if that makes sense. In high school I noticed that depending on the day I would be in the absolute worst mood for no reason, or optimistic and happy. Looking back, Anxiety has always been much more of a constant in my life. I’m also extremely sensitive, and a lot of people have told me that throughout my life.

I’m currently going through a rough time. I’m stressed out about finding a job post-grad and my boyfriend who lives with me is in prison until May. I think that my situation is definitely making me more vulnerable to be sucked into those depressive/manic states, but it still feels like I’m being dragged down and lifted back up by an outside force and that I really can’t help it either way.

Anyways, like I said I am looking forward to talking with a real therapist about what I’m going through—I’m not sure why at first my mental health was being handled by a primary care physician who didn’t know sh** about mental health and just threw medication at me. I want to understand myself better and learn ways to cope, but in the mean time I would greatly appreciate thoughts on this. Does this sound similar to anyone’s experience who is diagnosed? Or does this sound more like my anxiety getting out of hand at times, etc. 

Thank you so much in advance for taking the time to read this and respond! "
adzqd8,1,2019-01-08,"Honest opinions about after graduation plan, please?",chinfoo2,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/adzqd8/honest_opinions_about_after_graduation_plan_please/,"**Warning: If rambling or hearing about students doing poorly triggers you, go away. (tl;dr at bottom)**

So, somewhere along the way I really lost my interest in accounting due to the competitiveness of it how poorly I would do over and over again compared to other students. It was also just a very new environment (even though I was not an on-campus student, it was still overwhelming) and I had zero friends and still had symptoms of anxiety and depression, which also weighed on me a lot. I know it sounds really bad, but I was a terrible student and did not put in the time and dedication that I've seen other students putting in due to how stressed out and frustrated I would feel every time I tried studying for accounting. I'm already very far in (SENIOR!) , and not very confident in my abilities, or myself, unlike many other students. Was one of those people that just went to university because that's what everyone was doing and parents said I have to, college counselors warned me not to do accounting and told me to downgrade but I just did it anyway, yada yada.

In junior year, I didn't get into the main program, but I got into an off-campus one that is still gonna be under the same school name on the degree (they say its the same caliber but its absolutely not in my opinion. there are some bright students there though who earnestly attend that base because it's closer to their house, but i think main campus is a lot more rigorous imo). 

So right now, Major GPA is absolute trash (2.78); Cumulative (3.13). Even if the cumulative is still okay enough to put on a resume, I still don't feel comfortable applying to jobs anymore because of how inferior and unconfident I am in anything I do. I don't feel like my grades actually reflect how poorly I really understood the concepts, and that my classes were heavily curved even with the curve I was still pretty low on the ranks :(... I mean, it's not like I didn't care, I did do my best and felt reasonably prepared for each exam, but obviously wasn't. I have about 122 credits right now and am taking classes this winter and next semester to get to 150... but mainly because they said employers will not want to hire you if you're not graduating with 150.

I've heard so many things about this, but at this point I kind of feel like after graduation, I want to not think about accounting or school anymore, move in with my long distance partner in another state, work some kind of regular job that will be enough to feed me and pay the bills, and just rebuild my confidence and peace of mind somehow while studying for my CPA on my own time. I feel like if I were to just go into another internship in the state I'm in, it would be secretly killing me inside to know I'm really not who I'm pretending to be. The people coming in are just getting more and more advanced, and are crazy driven, super well-rounded while I am just an unsocial good-for-only-the-basic-things idiot.

Will it be harder for me to find work if I put it off til AFTER I get my CPA? Should I just go and apply for another internship right now even though I feel like I will fuck up again and know I am not competent? (I am not the average fuck up and can honestly say I absolutely BOMBED 75% of my accounting interviews). I feel like I kind of need a change of pace, but don't know how badly this will fuck me over in the long run. 

If you read this, thanks and be brutally honest with me. I know some people will read this and get offended or disgusted and downvote me, but I don't care at this point, so go ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

*-move in w bf* 

*-get regular job because im shit accounting student n want a break from the pressure*

*-study for cpa while working*

I'm looking into taking PoliSci at Queens next year, and I'm currently debating between said program and the PoliSci at UOttawa. A big sticking point in favour of UOttawa is their co-op program and their proximity to the federal government, and I've been looking into the options at Queens in this regard.

What kind of internships (I can't seem to find any type of co-op program at Queens, please correct me if I'm wrong though) does Queens have, specifically for PoliSci students? Are these programs worth it overall? Any other reason why Queens is the best place to do your undergrad?

adzzmp,20,2019-01-08,I (m/20) feel like my boyfriend (m/20) is judgmental. Not sure though?,_for_throwing_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/adzzmp/i_m20_feel_like_my_boyfriend_m20_is_judgmental/,"This is a throwaway account since the boyfriend in question is a Redditor.

We've been dating for 6 months. I think our relationship is generally good. We don't tend to argue and are on the same wavelength most of the time.

But here comes the problem. I've been feeling weirdly anxious around my boyfriend lately. I've tried picking apart reasons, and I think it's because of his judgmental attitude. For the sake of clarification, I'm not referring to full-on verbal abuse or name calling. More like minor snide comments that seem personal.

Example one: on Christmas, my boyfriend came over to hang out after our respective family dinners and we all had dessert together. Me, my brother and my mom had probably made too many cakes and sweets, but I was pretty proud of how they turned out and tried three of them. My boyfriend only had one because he was too full. When I came back to the living room with the third slice, he shot me a weird look and asked if I was really on my third dessert. My mom made some sort of a joke about her diet, at which he laughed and said that it was a good thing he'd gotten me to go to gym with him. I felt kind of hurt, even this was meant to be an innocent joke.

I should probably mention that although I'm not overweight anymore, I used to be chubby in high school (which my boyfriend knows), which is why this felt like a personal jab. I'm also under the impression that my boyfriend feels some degree of disdain towards fat people, and that might also be why I sometimes feel judged for what I eat or how I exercise.

Now for another example: my boyfriend never wants to hang out with my friends. When I called him out on that, he said they were too dramatic and provided a single example of my friend telling us about her worries over an internship application. I remember that conversation lasting for 5 minutes tops, but apparently, it made him think she was an overly panicky and irritating person.

When it comes to this, I can't help but wonder if his opinion of my friends extends to me. He's told me multiple times how he doesn't get why I hang out with these ""immature"" people. ""Immature"" because two of them took a gap year before enrolling in college. This is probably related to his negative views of people without higher education. Meanwhile, he expects me to get along with all his friends and tends to think they're flawless, which they're obviously not.

Help me make sense of his attitude. Is this just a lack of self-awarness or actual judgment? Honestly, I'm not sure, and I don't really know how and if to bring it up.

tldr: My boyfriend makes seemingly judgmental comments sometimes that I'm not sure how to interpret, especially in relation to myself. Thoughts?"

ae03lp,41,2019-01-08,"Just graduated, here is my experience and advice",god-of-mercury,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ae03lp/just_graduated_here_is_my_experience_and_advice/,"Hello, I just graduated in the Fall semester and this sub has given me a lot of laughs and help throughout college and my search for a career. So I decided to make this post in hope to give back and help someone else out.

**About Me**

I Started in Fall of 2014 and ended in this Fall semester of 2018. So 4.5 years in college. I am getting my Bachelors in Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting and Marketing. I found a full time job at a local firm in my home town with my own connections instead of the Accounting Forum and Meet the Firm Events. Starting my second semester I always worked at least one part time job. I got a 2.997 GPA. I was apart of the Accounting Forum and the VP of Finance/Athletic Chair for the Marketing Club. I also had a Spring internship while I was in college.

**How I Got a Job (How to get one)**

The resource on this sub is a great starting point. It has great advice on social and networking skills. They definitely taught me how to act in a professional setting. But I felt like I could hold my own when it came to social skills so I decided to focus on my resume. Because in the end, in my opinion, recruiters take your resume for at least 70% of the decision. Some firms have outside recruiters to hire, recruiters don’t remember you, and they probably have hidden requirements to get the job. I do believe that all of the Big 4 will not hire you if you have below a 3.5 (maybe 3.3) GPA. But I am not interested in working for a Big 4, or any large firm. So I focused on my resume instead of my academics or social skills.

First, I worked many many jobs. I have worked 3 on campus jobs, 2 summer jobs, 1 part time job for a year, and 1 internship for a public accounting firm. Getting that internship was probably the most critical learning and professional development I had during college. I learned so much, and made me much more attractive to recruiters. I could go into an interview and actually understand what they were asking for me. I urge any student to get an internship, any internship, ASAP. The pay isn’t bad as well ($24/hour for me with 26+ hours a week).

Second would be the clubs. Join your accounting forum/club. Make friends with the person in charge. Become an officer if you can. That alone will open many doors for you. You will have to put a little effort in but it is completely worth it. Or you can do what I did, find a club you actually liked and become an officer there and do absolutely shit. Doesn’t matter if you did anything impressive, the recruiters have no idea of what your position actually entailed, they only know what your title was. Join and participate in as much as you can. The clubs should be able to fit with your schedule and something you are interested in. Don’t bother if you are not interested in them, the recruiters will ask you about them and they will be able to tell that you have no enthusiasm. Don’t worry about putting ‘lame’ clubs on your resume either. I think recruiters like to see some character in their applicants.

Third, network. I got extremely “lucky” with the job I currently have. My gf is a teacher and was talking with another teacher and that teacher knew two companies that were hiring and put in a good word for me. Never met her and don’t know her name. I put lucky in quotations because I kind of wasn’t. While I feel lucky, in the end networking is what got me the job. Make a lot of solid connections and let them know you are looking for a job and they will let others know about you. Those connections will advocate for you and possibly find a job through them.

Fourth, skills. Software specifically. Do not put Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. down. Unless you know about pivot tables and can create forms out of Word in 10 minutes or less, you don’t know them that well. Its like someone played little league in middle school and who is now 50 years old saying they know how to play baseball. We all know how… but are we good at it? Probably not. This is where the internship comes in. People hiring for internships (should) know that you don’t know what you are doing. But once you are done with your internship you can put down the software you learned in your internship. For example I learned: Prosystem fx, Office Tools Workspace, Excel, and Outlook. This shows companies that not only I know those softwares, I know how to learn software and overall business operations. It sets you apart tremendously even if you know the names of accounting programs.

Also, you should learn software in your spare time. Do it during summer/winter break. Or on the weekends. I was in the middle of learning how to do QuickBooks online when I was hired. Mentioned that in my interview to show that I was trying to develop myself outside of the education system. They seemed impressed.

(Students can use QuickBooks for free for a year, and if you have a library card you can use Lynda.com for free which has a quickbooks class. Use these resources to learn it and then perhaps get QuickBooks certified.)

Oh and make a LinkedIn. Put the web address on your resume. My internship checked my LinkedIn and it probably helped me to get hired.

**How to Network**

Building a resume is very very important. But it is useless if you don’t give it to anyone. So you need to network to give it to people. How to do this? Probably heard this advice before because it is true. Go the accounting events. This includes meetings, coffee chats, field trips, and big events like Meet the Firms. Go to them all. I unfortunately can’t say I did this. Due to my jobs I was never able to go to the coffee chats or field trips. But I always made the time to go to the meetings and Meet the Firms.

Some other advice that I haven’t heard many people give is to make a lot of friends. This might seem weird but having friends is huge. They will be the core of your network. After college they will get their own jobs and careers. If you find yourself left behind and living at home. Ask every single one of those connections if they have any openings or opportunities for you. Chances are that one of them will. Even if you have a job lined up, you might want to switch firms/careers and later in life they could be your golden ticket. Also makes homework and studying easier.

**Tl;dr**: Build your resume and make sure you are in the right place at the right time. Prepare yourself and get in line as soon as you can. If any student needs advice you can message me.

I have a question for all of you in the computer science/computer engineering major.

I feel like I want to try computer science, but I don't know where to start. Would you guys suggest I just continue with my current major for the semester and try out some programming boot camps in the summer when I have more time? If not what classes for CS do you suggest I try to get into for this semester?

Another thing to add is that I have yet to take on an internship for ME, nor do I have ANY experience with coding. I am also not struggling in my major too too bad since my  cum gpa is still decent (3.499), so its not that I want to get out of it because I don't understand the material.

Mostly, because everything was just fine. We go to the same school, so basically we had the chance to see each other every day, spend the nights and the weekends together and we surely made the summer one of the best in our lives.

Maybe it was too good and we should've faced conflict a little earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of November I had to go to the US for an internship, while she had to stay in Europe, since her class is one year behind.

The first weeks were painful, but it also worked pretty well - we were on the phone everyday, sending pictures to each other and so on...

But after that I think she found her way to deal with the distance. By spending even more time with her friends, partying until the late morning, visiting relatives and friends...and suddenly having a lot less time to stay in touch than before.

I don't have so many opportunities to get distracted. It's just our class at the base, and there's not much time left during the week to go anywhere. We do some occasional road trips on weekends, but it's always the same group of people you're able to hang out with, which gets really boring.

So, I just have too much time to think about her, wait for her to call, to text, to send a nice picture...And she does eventually, but when she's busy, she's busy for days.

This led to a lot of conflict and she told me on multiple occasion that she's tired of all the drama I make. She asked me whether it's ok for me if she spent New Year's Eve at her best friend's place, sleeping in his bed. I was not ok with it, so she was so angry at me for not trusting her that I eventually gave in, but she still accuses me of making a drama out of it, and why everything has to be so complicated. It is indeed common in her immensely large circle of friends to have such sleepovers without anything happening. At least, that's the only thing I can assume.

We have such different views on so many things. But I realized that she simply needs more space and I'm trying my best to give it to her, and each time I let go, I realize that it makes her feel good and that it strengthens the love she has for me.

However, I haven't been able to achieve a little more commitment from her side. I once asked about calling each other more regularly, because all of my classmates get calls from their girlfriends at least every other day, or they video chat or something like that. Then she asked why I would compare our relationship to other's and why I'm making a drama out of it and that she'd rather call when she really has the time to do so and not because she feels compelled to.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I said that if the relationship is important, you simply TAKE this time. And it's discussions like this on a weekly basis now.

Now we had a big conflict about her visiting me in the US. She was planning to, and I had already everything arranged, booked the flight and so on...Then she suddenly got a bad conscience because of not spending Christmas with her parents for two years in a row, since next year it's her who's going to the US.

I wasn't mad at her, because I want to handle these decisions together.

I was eventually ok with her not visiting me at all, but on Monday she called me and happily announced that she's going to have 2 weeks off from school and will be able to visit me by the end of January, which totally made my day.

In the evening, the same day, she texted me saying she's not sure whether the place she's occasionally helping out at will be able to switch shifts so she can be 10 days away...I couldn't sleep that night because I was just too disappointed and pledged her to figure a way out with her workplace.

Unfortunately, the timing was bad, because she was stressed from the day before already and she got those messages during the next stressful day, so today she left me several audio messages (which she usually never does), clearly pissed off, that all the drama is too much for her and that the relationship is currently more of a burden to her rather than something that brings joy. She'd take a look whether I'll be able to cause less drama and conflict in the next week, but proclaimed another time how stressed she feels.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided the only thing is to stay calm and don't send any long texts anymore and wait for it to cool down. I talked to her best friend (girl) of her later who also has a LDR and she said that I shouldn't worry to much and that she certainly is in love with me and showed a lot of effort to be able to visit me. She just needs more space.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you evaulate the situation? Is this just a crisis or is it ending? What would the best approach be for the next days/weeks? "
ae0tco,6,2019-01-08,Amaranth Myerscough - Sable,ohhmycroft,SupersRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/ae0tco/amaranth_myerscough_sable/,"###CHARACTER BIO

**Name:** Amaranth “Sable” Myerscough 

**Age:** 21

**Appearance:** [Amaranth](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/16/ad/85/16ad85af239b9bf3dc469d911076f453.jpg) takes care to make sure she looks what the kids call “cool”, because she doesn’t like questions about herself and enjoys the standoffish vibe she gives off. She stands at 5’7, with a figure that is perhaps a little on the thin side. Her fashion sense can best be described as non-existent, or perhaps as charity shop-chic but with a varsity jacket pulled over it. It’s just careless enough to come off as intentional.     
She is perhaps the only superhero for whom it has ever made sense to wear the bathing-suit type of supersuit. She does in fact sport one of those, though she's sewed biking shorts on for comfort. Amaranth’s suit is made out of padded material which helps absorb a couple of blows, but isn’t bullet-proof. It hasn’t got any kind of design on it and is made out of a matte black material. The only recognisable feature she has is her stupidly long yellow scarf. She tends to smear some black eyeliner on to kind of hide her face, but it's more for the aesthetic than anything.

**Personality:** Amaranth is easy-breezy, cool and careless, if you believe what she presents to the world to be fact. It kind of is who she is, but she’s got a lot of pent up righteous rage which definitely doesn’t look “cool”. She firmly believes in making her own way in the world, and making her own success, not relying on anybody else. The girl feels responsible for all preventable harm done, which occasionally troubles her personal life.       
She’s also… not that talkative. Sure, once you get her in a snark-off, she’s fine, but Amaranth is bad at expressing feelings, thoughts, and opinions, and does not think this is much of a problem. On average, she maybe has three facial expressions a week, and all of them are unimpressed. She’s stubborn as hell about it, just like she is about everything else. It’s difficult to impress her, and even more difficult for her to admit that you’ve impressed her.

**Background:** Amaranth was born to the Myerscough family of two parents and four kids. There were three after her, forming a very close-knit family of ten, not counting the several grandparents who also lived in her childhood home. It was a snug fit, and a childhood filled with equal parts too much and too little attention for the individual kids.      
Paradiso natives aren’t strangers to superpowered-humans awakening to their powers in their teens, but it was still a surprise to the family that they had a super in their midst. Even moreso that it was Amaranth, who had always shown the least interest in being a hero out of all of them. Her family supported and encouraged her, though, and after a high-school related internship for its powered students, Amaranth decided to go through with the idea of being a local hero. Thus, when Amaranth was seventeen, Sable was born.       
Unfortunately, she wasn’t quite the hero her family (and her community) expected - by the very nature of her power, she was a lot… bloodier than they preferred. But she was effective, and still is, even though she’s moved out of her parental home and into the university halls to be closer to her education. She’s been slowly but steadily climbing the local hero charts, but still has a modicum of anonymity both regarding her as a hero and regarding her powers, both of which work fine for her.

**Resources:** She’s in college, so… very few. Undecided major, too. She’s been getting minor sponsorships and a couple of offers from hero agencies, but hasn’t been able to make a living off the super stuff yet. She doesn't know if she wants to, either.

---

###POWERS AND SKILLS

**Power Descriptions:**

* Shattered Obsidian: Amaranth can shift her four limbs into obsidian, a hard and brittle type of rock which shatters with extremely sharp edges. She can cause this shattering to occur on purpose, as well. While obsidian, she can use her limbs as normal so long as they are intact (enough) for the intended use. IE: if she has broken off her hand, she can no longer open doors using said hand, as it is just shatters of obsidian. She does not, however, feel anything but impact (no temperature, no pain). When deactivated, the limb shifts back and reforms using all the pieces within a 10 ft radius of Amaranth. Missing pieces result in corresponding missing bits of limb. She can choose which and how many limbs to shift, but cannot contain it to merely one part of her limb - i.e. she cannot just shift her finger or her hand, has to shift her whole arm.
* Obsidian Shard Manipulation: While shifted, Amaranth can telekinetically control the shards of shattered obsidian. She has a range of 10 feet on this as well. These shards are incredibly sharp obsidian, but not particularly hard. They are largely used for blade-storm type effects.
* Telekinetic Resistance: Amaranth’s obsidian shards cannot be affected by telekinetic effects which aren’t her own.

**Power Drawbacks:** Amaranth is one of the more literal glass cannons; able to unleash bullet hell on an enemy, but only for very short amounts of time. Her obsidian limbs only last for 10 minutes consecutively, after which she needs at least 20 minutes of recovery before she can activate her power again. She is not immune to her own body either, and will often get cut by her own shards herself.
Aside from that, her body continuously shattering and reforming is bad for her general health. Prolonged constant use of her power will result in significant loss of her body-mass, as there is always some obsidian dust which will be lost. This presents itself currently as anaemia and frequent exhaustion. When her limbs reform and she is missing large shards, this presents itself as deep gashes.         
She’s a close-combat specialist, but is unable to protect her head and torso in any significant way due to the limits of her shattering. It's also sometimes difficult to maintain her balance if she has more than one of her limbs fully shattered.

**Skills:** 

* Hand-to-hand combat: Amaranth is an excellent brawler, having started in knife fights and graduated to using her own body to cut her enemies up with. She throws an excellent punch. Mean right hook, too.
* Parkour: It’s the go-to for any urban hero; Amaranth can’t fly or anything, so she parkours her way through the worse neighbourhoods of Paradiso to solve crime. It’s more efficient than it is graceful, though.
* Sewing: She made her own suit, and sometimes fixes her own clothes as well. It's cool to sew.

**Equipment/Weaponry:** Amaranth is her own weapon, but she owns a cool flick knife. Because it’s cool. She has a suit, but it’s homemade and not actually that effective.

---

###ATTRIBUTES/FEATS

**Strength:** Amaranth is a strong woman for someone her stature, but not superhuman by any means.

**Agility:** She’s flexible and fast for a human - again, not superhuman, but definitely a force to be reckoned with on the human scale of agility.

**Intelligence/Wisdom:** Amaranth isn’t really a mastermind, and a little too impulsive for her own good. But she is street-smart, so that’s something, and attends Paradiso University, which is another thing.

**Defense:** When shifted, Amaranth’s limbs are obsidian and therefore quite good at defense, but once shattered she has very little means of actually defending herself; it’s impossible to protect your face if both your arms are shards of rock instead of attached to your body.

**Offense:** Amaranth’s specialty is offense: she’s made out of sharp materials, and unless properly armoured, she can rip through opponents with ease. She’s not much use against infrastructure, though, and mostly effective against other humanoids."
ae0x14,5,2019-01-08,[f4m] The intern with the lipstick,justaflirtygirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ae0x14/f4m_the_intern_with_the_lipstick/,"You didn't notice me at first.

I mean, it's the largest law firm in the city. And with that territory, comes a flurry of interns, both law students and undergrads. Some are preppy frat boys whose daddies are old buddies with the senior partners. Some are college girls with tight, sexy bodies, but you can’t seem to get past their shrill laughter.

So lots slip in between the cracks. And for awhile, I did, too. But one day, a fellow senior partner made a crack to you. He mentioned how stressed he was, and made a crude reference to a few things he wanted a certain intern to do. Apparently she arranged a few things for a trial, and she was surprisingly competent, a rarity, even in this prestigious office.

And umf. Her body. But it was something else that drove his mind over the edge and into the gutter.

""She's the one with the lipstick,"" he mentions.

Its late one night, and it feels like all the senior partners are heading into trials or big negotiations. All of the interns are required to work — whether it be fetching coffee or redacting credit card numbers in trial notebooks.

You saunter into the break room to grab a fresh cup of coffee. You open the door softly, and I’m the only person in the room. Your eyes land directly on my ass. Curvy, and accented by a pencil skirt. My waist is narrow, and I can’t seem to reach the plate from the top shelf, even in my heels. My long dark hair is curled bouncing as I stretch. With an exhale of frustration I turn around, and you see a young intern, probably 21, with bright green eyes that widen as I notice you. I'm short, only five three, with high cheekbones and striking dark hair.

And then you notice the lipstick.

I'm looking for a dominant, sure-handed man who knows exactly what he wants from this intern. Yes: rough, daddy, dominance, LIGHT noncon, etc. No gore, bathroom, etc."
ae135b,19,2019-01-08,PGY-4 got bad blood with the PD. Need advice / Venting. Had job offer and about to lose it due to the PD.,SacTus,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/ae135b/pgy4_got_bad_blood_with_the_pd_need_advice/,"Sorry for the long rant. I'm genuinely afraid for my career. Feel like I've been used for past years and can now be discarded. Any words of sympathy or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR: Pissed off PD putting career in jeopardy. However, I might get by easier if I allow myself to be recruited into their toxic health care system, which they're encouraging. Which course of action should I pick? (Scroll to bottom for options)

Hello, I've changed some things within the text to mask my identity. I'm a PGY-4 that's been in the same program since the beginning. I've got 5-6 months left and I haven't been put on probation, but it's getting there. 

When I joined this program there was an attending I often argued with as an intern. Their management was too conservative and I wasn't the greatest at accepting criticism, especially when someone is very condescending towards me. It makes me defensive. I've gotten better over the years, but that person, we'll denote as Dr. Smith still hates my guts. 

The administration (which is really bad) axed my previous program director, whom was awesome and amazing. She was replaced with the other person... Lo and behold comes the person whom despises me. Dr. Smith. 

Ever since Dr. Smith took over, there has been a plethora of changes and a large amount of micromanagement. some for the better, mostly for the worse. This program isn’t like any other program that I’ve seen before now, they treat you like children. 

There is a large turnover rate in both attendings and staff within this program and hospital. It's just a shit show. We've had at least 4 attendings that worked with Dr. Smith within the past 3 years, that either quit or got fired due to Dr. Smith. Dr. Smith is a master manipulator and if Dr. Smith doesn't like you, every small thing that will come up will be used against you. It's happened to all of those previous attendings, and soon if I don't play my cards right, it can happen to me. It's crazy! 

Long story short, Dr. Smith is told by higher ups to encourage the residents to be employed within the facility. I can't be sure if this is an issue. When I try to apply within the system, they highly encourage it. Just within the past month actually. However word got around that I won't be applying within the system and ever since then all this stuff started popping up. Some my fault, many not. I admit I'm not the most stellar resident, but definitely more than capable in my field. (I slack where I can, like not going to lectures, but never at the compromise of patient care)

Anyway I already have a contract and everything with a potential employer but I have not sent in my references. One of them has to be the program director, Dr. Smith. Not even 4 weeks ago Dr. Smith encouraged me to apply to a position within the system. But now that Smith got wind that I'm not applying there, Dr. Smith states Dr. Smith would no longer recommend me for this position? Like I said I don't want to insinuate anything, but something is amidst. 

Dr. Smith also convinced a committee of people whom all previously liked me that because of my past transgressions (I.e. Arguing with some attendings, &gt;6 months ago, I should be rated poorly in all areas of clinical knowledge and professionalism. This is now going to jeopardize whether or not I graduate. 

I know that I will need to follow all orders and such, keep my head low, but I've been trying that! Every small infarct that pops up immediately gets Dr. Smith's attention and that gets added on to my ""file"". Dr. Smith likes to keep track of everything so that it can be used against you, just as Dr. Smith has done to other attendings and residents in the past. 

My fear is that my future employer, whom currently really likes me, and I feel I would get along with them very well, will call the PD and I'm gonna get screwed. I have a plethora of attendings and residents in past years that can all vouch how toxic Dr. Smith is. 

Dr. Smith has asked me which jobs I have applied to so they can can them and which references I have used (most likely so Dr. Smith can push their influence on them) I've tried to defer this for now. 

Perhaps this is just me and I'm just not getting the memo. But I've never had any issues in any of my previous jobs, one of which I had for four years and the other for two years! 

There are many other things I have yet to mention. Like the PD asked me in previous years to help cover extra month of nights stating because I was competent in it and do well with autonomy, (or they just manipulated me to cover it because they needed coverage) but now states that I'm not good at it? Doesn't make sense. 

My options are:
1. Continue trying my best and try not to give any excuses, complete application with my current job knowing my PD is likely going to discourage them from accepting me. Also possibly wanting to make me extend an extra year of residency or something.

2. Discontinue my current job offer that I really love. Apply within the system. At least Dr. Smith will have incentive to graduate me to appease the higher ups that they recruited a resident to stay within the system. 

3. Call my current job offer and tell them I have many references in case there is an issue with the PD in regards to the current work environment. 

Sorry for the long paragraph and any odd inconsistencies due to me trying to be clandestine and I really appreciate any advice. Thanks! "

Update:

I had a moment of clarity when I remembered things “x” said to me within the few hours I had discourse with them. I can only hypothesize their father used aggression upon them to project a type of “dominance” or power over them. At least emotionally abusive. I can assume the mother didn't intervene or tried to diffuse the scenarios with divergence from actual discourse (possibly with “humor” induced conversation or maybe some convoluted positive “gift” whether physical or abstract.. This done instead of acknowledging the issues at hand. Possibly because that would be a longer term situation to correct, or she had fear that it would break up the nuclear family, saying anything negative about her husband. Could have to do with her own fear of abandonment or lower self worth, do to her promiscuous behavior of her past. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Im assuming that instead of criticizing the father’s unhealthy behavior towards his children, she just allowed her children to have free reign on their lives, without any rules or regulations. Some pseudo-transactional exchange. Some abstract moral equivalence to alleviate the guilt she felt. Possibly her busy work schedule prohibited her from fixing the bad parenting of her husband, another possible factor)

&amp;#x200B;

The irregularity of their parents projection, and inconsistency of nuclear family dynamic, this caused “x” to feel confused, and vulnerable. Without consistent values, rules, or regulations (even normal responses to adolescent behavior, possibly within prepubescence) they had to fend for themselves to create a “moral code” or somewhat, deciphering what was morally socially, and figuratively acceptable in the realm of the environment which they were raised, sociologically, interpersonally, academically, environmentally, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side factor: Possible feelings of intermittent self doubt; this due to the fact perceived that they would never fit their father’s standard to adhere the archaic definition of masculinity. This, intern, causing them to do what they perceived were other forms of “hyper-masculine” behavior. Their interests and behavioral patterns may have been lead by the uncertainty of their identity. 

&amp;#x200B;

The inability to fit the normal male subtype of traditional masculinity they searched for other contexts to project an alpha persona.. I.E. verbally degrading people who seemed threatening, or linguistically putting down women (that more so likely due to their disdain for their mother’s promiscuity. This in cause, created a imbedded anger towards her inability to be a parental figure instead of a “friend” like matriarch).

&amp;#x200B;

As well as, sexual promiscuity, (exploitation of women), aggression, and emotional suppression. Though, the sexual promiscuity could be subconscious retainment from mother’s behavioral patterns. Somewhat indicative of a prior Oedipus complex, derived from mother’s high admiration for children, whilst still not following traditional nurturing and appropriate conversational tone, and exploitative dialogue of her past (inappropriate discourse with her children who were not of age to know of sexual encounters) , that children should not have knowledge of. 

 

addition: Do to social groups that they were surrounded by, and their father's disapproval, they denounced any attraction to men. Internalzied homophobia due to provoked behavior. These behavioral patterns manifested in relation to the social circles (within their age demographic) and their father's possible outward homophobia. This  possibly causing, suppression of sexual intrigue in men. Possibly causing internal conflict, and self degradation, mentally. &lt;---- addition probably not necessary, but does increase my empathy. Their nature and nurture, both were inconsistent, and had negative implication on their development in certain aspects.

Today, January 8th, 2019

I think after hypothesizing, I could understand somewhat, why've you acted a certain way too many people

&amp;#x200B;

I am probably biased, because prior to my erraticism, you were respectful to me.  I was more sexually promiscuous to you, so I have similar faults. Mine, just more inconsistent. It probably seemed like I objectified you, and I am extremely sorry for that.  As well as, judging you, and projecting my own insecurities and faults, onto you. I am extremely bad at realizing when my words are biting (wasn't good I kept deleting text messages, just to bombard you over and over. Should've kept them, to know when to stop. Or what I said prior. Drinking is not an excuse whatsoever, to treat someone poorly.)

&amp;#x200B;

I also believe you only objectified women because of the normalcy created within the context to people around you. I don't believe you had ill intentions. I think you genuinely thought that was acceptable behavior, and somewhat couldn't comprehend it's negative psychological damage it could do to young developing person(s). Addiction is addiction, there isn't two ways around it. I have extreme empathy for you. I am sorry for being erratic. If you were searching for an interpersonal relationship, someone who could provide stability, and understanding. I wish I could've been that person. 

&amp;#x200B;

You've had a hard year. I hope you are okay. Find me somewhere if you need comfort without judgement.

-----

Hello DPP! I'm here trying to ~~ride the success of previous posts~~ write something unique and exciting compared to my previous posts! You may have seen me around here before, and if I suddenly stopped responding or if I didn't respond at all, consider the fact that I had one metric *fuckload* of responses. You can compare the amount of responses I got to a pornstar offering to do free cock-rates on a public snapchat account. 

Yeah.

Anyways, I figure that I'll list off heroes/villains of Overwatch/Talon and we can come up with a fun little story where this little intern offers her pussy(And ass and mouth) up to get ploughed!

-----

***Jack Morrison, Soldier 76.*** - While I am aware that Jack Morrison was LITERALLY just confirmed to be gay, that still doesn't change my horny little mind. I picture we can either do *young* Jack or *old* Jack. That fat pale cock is probably a fucking monster in bed, something Ana would dream about as she spied on him using a few well-hidden cameras in the base. It'd be a fat thing, a small dusting of pubes at the base. **Potential Story:** Young Jack Morrison fucking the intern in the shower, Old Jack Morrison plowing her in an alley, Young Jack Morrison fucking her quietly in a work-out room, Old Jack Morrison being taken care of by a nurse.

***Jesse Mcree.*** - This hot cowboy might be on the younger side (For Overwatch, he's still like 37!), but boy does he recognize good pussy. All American county boy with a cock that could break a girl in two, he can really give a girl a good time. He's been known to have complaints that his beard tickles soft thigh tissue, he more than makes up for it by his organ slipping into a girl's holes and giving her the *time* of her life. **Potential story:** Younger Jesse (Deadlock gang) fucking bar babes in route 66. Current Jesse banging the intern in a car, after leaving a bar. (I know, not much difference but I can picture myself giving that fat cock of his a nasty bit of lip-service after downing a few drinks.

***Mako Rutledge, Roadhog.*** - If you can figure out hot to make it hot, I'm super down. I see Roadhog as being a cuddly guy, his hands easily dwarfing my ass. That being said, his bio literally says he's a ruthless killer so--I mean, your call, not mine. **Potential story:** Your call, really. Suggest things.

***Akande Ogundimu, Doomfist.*** - Ignoring the fact that I'm a total snowbunny, Doomfist is one of the ones I'm excited for. In the clink he had plenty of fan girls, pining for his release. Hell, I was one of them! I had a doom fist tattoo on my ass cheek, I'd write letters, attach polaroids of me nude, begging that if he got out he'd come to my house and do unspeakable things to my boyfriend before plowing me in bed until my headboard was a fine sawdust. Sure, he may not have an arm but just *picture* how hot it would be to tell my boyfriend up that a guy with ONE arm is better than him! **Potential story:** Cuckolding. Oh yeah. That's bout it.

***Gabriel Reyes, Reaper.*** - Naturally, this will be pre-ghostification. This daddy American with latino background man is probably one of if not is my favorite characters here. I picture a fat, long cock, probably cut, and I picture it fucks what it wants. So, how will he react to a curvy, white bitch wanting his fat donkey cock so far up her ass that she's walking funny when going back to her post for her intern-ship? Let's find out. **Potential Story:** (While I know I didn't really give much to work off of, I'm really, really open. Want to make it a relationship? Absolutely. Lets work together.

***Reinhardt Wilhelm, Reinhardt.*** - Calm down there gramps, gonna strain yourself. Sure, he's strong enough to lift me and cuddle me and fuck me like a fleshlight, but that was back in the day! Now-a-days he might have issues keeping his breath while he pounds that absolute meat-hammer of sex into me while I'm mewling below him. Hopefully he will feel young fucking a younger woman. **Potential story:** Younger girl getting fucked by the decorated protector helps to make him feel young again!

***Lucio, Hanzo, Genji, Torbjorn.*** I honestly cannot come up with anything fun in mind. If you guys have an idea, I'll be happy to add it to this, I'm always looking to modify how fun things get!

***Winston, Wrecking ball (Hammond), Zenyatta, Bastion, Junkrat*** No. Not really interested in them. They can watch, sure.

-----

WHHHHEW. 

So anyways, I've got reference pics for my character in PM's. I play ***Exclusively on reddit*** so you won't really peep me getting off of here much unless you're *very* good or you make me *very* much laugh. (Ie, I do have a discord but I've added THREE people to that in my time.)

#When you PM, put which character you want to play in your title. Your first sentence should tell me a bit about a scenario you've come up with or which scenario you wish to play.

**Anal.**

**Romance/Involved story.**

**Huuuuuuge dicks. Not like 17 inches, but a fat 14 inch monster is A-O-K.**

**Humor.**

**Dirty talk**

#Regular Kinks.

 *Gangbangs*

*Sloppy oral*

*Being watched while fucking*


#Limits.

*Feet*

*Piss*

*Shit*

For the first couple months I told anyone who would listen about my groups wonderful scientific research, and the great potential. About the unknown possibilities and how we know we can get a paper out of it. Then I started joking. I started adding ""If only B.W. would email us!"" And I would laugh. A bit later I stopped talking about it. And lately I've been resentful. Frustrated. Angry. 

That is until just a half hour ago. 

At 6:45pm I was informed of your passing. Early September. Not only the month, but the week you were going to finalize the continuation of our research. Aortic aneurysm in the middle of teaching. 

When I heard the news, I was speechless. I felt sick to my stomach. I was holding on to all this anger to a man who didn't deserve it. 

You were a good man. You cared and gave your time. You believed in us, even though we were all just incompetent interns. 

As of now I am looking back, and I can mostly think of good things.

If there is a heaven above, considering your will, determination and kindness, you are most definitely there curing cancer.

At exactly 12:01 AM on January 2nd (while the fireworks were still poppin’),  I **finally** turned in my first manuscript to my editor.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the work is far from over, but you know what?

After going through three rewrites (from 90K to 120K to 86K words), I honestly feel like I put my **best** foot forward.

And damn...that felt so good.

But I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for this sub, too.  You see, I spent the majority of my free time lurkin' and scrolling to get some insight. So, thanks for everyone with the passion for writing - and writing in writing - because it helped me with my writing.

Speaking of writing...

Now that I have a little break…and…well...sort of nothing to write about, I wanted to post about my experience. You know - just in case you're lurkin' through reddit for insight, too. (Then again, I don't wanna over-promise. So, if you don't gain insight, I can promise you that I'll at least waste your time). I just wanna write about writing in writing because it might help others with writing, okay?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the first insight?

1. **If you haven't started yet, what the hell are you doing?**

For a long time, I had an idea, and I believed in it so much.

After I became a COO at 24, I wanted to help students earn the positions they wanted. To do that, I was gonna share my personal growth journey and write a business self-help book for interns.  But when I finally sat down and wrote it? God. It was so terrible. I wrote way too seriously, and I didn’t even recognize myself in my own writing.

You might’ve heard of “the ugly first draft”, but my draft wasn’t just ugly, it was pure evil. So evil that I almost lost all hope in writing.

Fortunately, however, one thing led to another, and then? Somehow, I ended up adding fictional elements to my story, writing about video games, and tying that into pieces of my life. Now, it’s NOTHING like I had envisioned before. I mean, it’s still a self-help book, but it's not even the same audience. And compared to my original idea? it was like a holy spirit calling.

In fact, that’s what the entire writing process was like for me. It showed me that ideas are fucking insane. So many times, I sat down with the perfect idea to end a chapter in a specific way, but then, somehow, end up in a completely different direction, thinking “what the hell is this? Did I write this? Holy shit. I wrote this!”

You see, if life has taught me anything, it’s that if you have a wild idea in your head, JUST START ALREADY. Whether it’s a book, business idea, or whatever – don’t wait for the right moment (especially if it’s constantly on your mind). You have NO idea where the process will take you. And the longer you wait, the higher the possibility of losing ideas you’ll never even know you had. Trust me, you might have the perfect idea in your head, but you too might find how evil it is once you let it out. So hurry and let it out. If it's evil, you'll find a way to kill it with something more magical.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** **So you started writing, but you've already come across Writer's Block, eh?**

To be honest, I never really had an issue with writer’s block.

I think a large part of that was accepting upfront that I won’t always have ideas in my head. That I’ll come across times when I won’t know what to write. Or that I just don’t know enough, and I must find answers.

So, whenever that happened, I didn’t stress about it. Instead, I redirected my attention to something else (or, as I like to call it, I used my intentional A.D.H.D.).

But here’s the thing. I made sure whatever I did at least related to fueling my creativity. And fortunately, that wasn’t hard to find with the subject I was writing on. I played video games, watched anime, lurked through reddit, listened to songs, read books on how to write, and more.

Sometimes, I put away all of that, and I read books on marketing and publishing. It wasn’t directly related to the content of my manuscript, but with every new piece of info I learned, the more I envisioned the end product. The physical book in my hands. And with that, it wasn’t hard to get my ass back on the chair and get to work. Motivated to see it through.

If you're dealing with writer's block, try look for inspiration somewhere else. Somewhere that's not on your paper.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.**  **""No time to have you lurkin'. Just get ready to work, work, work, work, work, work .""**

Okay. Obviously, A.D.H.D won't finish your paper.

You still gotta write. And if you’ve got a deadline, like I did for my editor, you gotta write more.

So, what helped me?

**The first thing was learning how to write fast**. With juggling work and other things, I didn’t just have to make time to write, I had to be efficient at it. So, I bought both the e-books and physical copies of “2K to 10K: Writing Faster” By Rachel Aaron and “5,000 Words per Hour” by Chris Fox. Needless to say, they both provided awesome insight, and I went from several hundred words an hour to thousands. More importantly, however, by measuring and testing, I learned when and where is most comfortable for me to write.

I knew learning how to write fast was useless if I let UNintentional A.D.H.D. interrupt me though. That’s why **I had to maximize my discipline** next. The solution? Dressing up. I’m not talking about putting on a suit and tie. I’m just referring to freshening yourself up completely before “going to work”. When I first started writing at home, I wrote shirtless in shorts. I thought it was the fine luxury I had of working with the freedom as the next soon-to-be best failing author. And then, I don’t know remember where, but I read how a particular author dressed up to do work, so I tried it. I threw on some jeans, chuck taylors, and a t-shirt on a Saturday morning at home. And holy crap. That was one of the most productive sessions I had. I don’t care if it’s placebo. The moment I tie up those shoelaces is the moment I feel I’m ready to travel a million steps to satisfy my hunger (metaphorically through writing, of course. I don't have enough discipline to walk that much).

Third, **I did more than just “read out loud”.**  Reading my work out loud was the biggest piece of advice that helped my writing. Hell, even as I’m writing this, I’m talking to myself. It’s a reminder to feel the words I write, and sense if it’s really how or what I’d say in a real conversation. When I wrote my manuscript, however, I took it a step further. I took what I learned from my acting classes, and I acted out loud. With each chapter, I stood up and pretended there was a crowd in front of me, and it was my job to narrate. I threw in emotion, body language, words that weren’t even on the text, you name it.  When something was obviously too painful to narrate, or I didn’t feel any emotion tied to it, I threw it away and made something new instead.

Lastly, **I had to constantly change my perception.** When I first started, I read so many authors dreaded the rewrite phase. Because of this, I spent several weeks writing my first draft with that same mentality. I mentally prepared myself to ""persevere"", but then? I listened to more authors and read more books. Others talked about how magical rewriting can be. How it can be just as fun as writing the first time around, if not more so. And suddenly, my entire mindset changed. I looked forward to every rewrite, looking for redundancies and better ways to say my thoughts. Challenging myself over and over. Looking for more redundancies and even better ways to say my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Sooner or later, however, the biggest lesson I learned was that you're gonna have to finish what you started. So, that's what I'm about to do right now. I'm about to click that ""post"" button and submit this ugly eight draft for the world to see.

&amp;#x200B;

And you know what? That's okay. Because in the end, as long as you comple -"
ae3x3s,1,2019-01-09,(M4F) Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,CelebDPP,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelebDPP/comments/ae3x3s/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

My kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, breeding/impregnation. Other kinks can be brought up in your PM.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Pokimane

Katsuya Moonfox (Craving)

Nonsummerjack (Craving)

Riley Reed

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you.

(I must specify that any roleplay done with other individuals does not promote violence or hatred towards women. I am also only interested in roleplaying with 18+ individuals only.)"

ae5czn,67,2019-01-09,I worked for a corrupt police department and this is my story,Offic3r_Friendly,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ae5czn/i_worked_for_a_corrupt_police_department_and_this/," 

\--The following story is completely factual and true. Noting about this story has been exaggerated or falsely written. I am writing this to make the public aware that police corruption is a thing in the United States of America and some departments go unnoticed; or maybe its that nobody cares.--

\*\*\*Disclaimer: All names are changed to protect the identity of people, and locations/information is withheld because of possible active criminal cases.\*\*\*\*

I grew up in a small town with a population of just under 1,400 people.  It’s just over a mile in all directions and is half surrounded by a river.  A set of railroad tracks (former Rock Island Railroad) also surrounds half the city and a siding (former Chicago and North Western Railroad) cuts the city in half extending through town.  The city has 2 bars, 2 parks, one state park at the south end of town across the tracks, a rural volunteer fire department, a volunteer EMS service (which seems to service the county), a small grocery store, and small meat locker.  It's an everybody knows everybody town.  I grew up on a street that the city limits run on; with me having to live in the county side.  If I had to call 911 for an emergency, the Sheriff's Office had to respond.  Not much happened in the city as far as serious crime went. 

Growing up my father was friends with the Chief of Police named Dan.  Dan was a great guy teaching me all about law enforcement, keeping me on the straight and narrow, and even letting me ride along with him to see the job of a police officer.  He worked hard for many years keeping the city free of crime.  I began to enjoy talking with Dan and wanted to become a police officer myself, working as Dan’s officer.  I eventually moved into town.  Then came the day Dan had made his resignation from Chief of Police public stating he was resigning after being chief for over 10+ years.  He was moving to another Chief position in a bigger city that paid more.  Once Dan resigned and moved away, the officer at that time, let’s call him Bill Smith, was appointed Chief of Police by a newly elected City Council.  Chief Smith was in his fifties, and after being fired from another department for sleeping on duty in a squad car, moved to our small town to be an officer and get away from the previous department to somewhere where no one knows him.  Since the city had no full time officers at the time, Bill hired on an officer named Cory and another, we will call Bob.  Bob was hired to be full time while Cory was a reserve officer.  (As a side note Bob wasn’t able to pass the physical fitness test at the ILEA and had to be put down as a police reserve too, until recently.  He now is able to work full time as an officer because he is a full time EMT now.  He wears a uniform and drives the squad car in the downtime of no ambulance calls.)

Now this is where I come in to the picture.  See, I was attending college for law enforcement and got the opportunity to intern with the police department.  I was as excited as a kid at the carnival.  I was hoping to be able to fulfill my dream of becoming a city officer, for I grew up wanting to work as a cop in my hometown.  So I took the opportunity and said yes to the internship.  I showed up almost everyday and rode with Chief Smith as well.

Now if you walked into City Hall, immediately inside the first set of doors to the left is the wooden door to the police department.  Inside the police department were 2 desks.  The desk to the left is where Chief Smith sat and the desk to the right was given to me.  My desk sat against a wall which on the other side of the wall was a closet.  Behind the other desk were a row of filing cabinets and a window.  The office was small.  My duty was to efile tickets with the clerk of court, check Iowa Courts Online to check on updates to cases, keep a log of calls for service and logs of citations/warnings that are issued, fill out warrants, assist with reports, all the paperwork for the office basically.  All of this was explained to me as I started working.  I got paid for what I did.  The first few days I was shown how to do all this, then I was expected to do it all by myself.  While being shown by Chief Smith, he kept referring to me as his, ‘minion’.  I asked him why he kept saying that, and he stated that all his employee’s, officers or not, were his minions who did anything and everything he asked of us.  I worked in the office every day and rode almost everyday too.

Then came for our first search warrant.  We conducted an investigation and filled out a search warrant.  We made contact with the local Sheriff's Office and several deputies met us at the office.  As the Chief gave a rundown with Bob and the deputies of what was going to happen, I grabbed an inventory sheet to keep record of anything we found.  We then drove to the trailer court.  Chief Smith knocked on the trailer and a female, we will call Nancy, opened the door.  She was presented the search warrant and read it.  I, with Bob, entered the trailer.  None of our officers had body cameras on for the departments were not up to date with modern technology, you could say.

We did a search of the trailer and discovered narcotics.  I noted everything we recovered, made a receipt for everything, and presented it to Nancy before she was handcuffed and placed in a squad car.  We transported her to the Sheriff’s Office where Nancy was booked into jail.  We completed a criminal complaint affidavit and hung out with the deputies for a while before heading back to the office.  The report writing here sucked.  Chief Smith said he didn't want long reports, and just to note what happened.  He always said the extra details aren't required, for in fact this was a small town department.  He ridiculed Dan and other previous police officers stating that they would write reports 5+ pages long for no reason when they just need to note the facts and that’s it.

Then a few days later, I learned of two other people in town we will name Dave and Angela.  Dave I got to know for he was suspected of being a drug dealer as Angela was his girlfriend, who also was a meth user.  We constantly conducted surveillance at their residence in town, sometimes sitting down the road with binoculars.  We worked day and night to catch them, but to this day their drug operation hasn’t been caught.  So I went upon my usual business, showing up everyday and doing paperwork.  I also helped here and there with sitting in my personal vehicle and watching houses or calling if cars left.  This one time I sat outside the trailer court waiting for a truck to leave.  Sure enough it did and I followed it while calling Chief Smith.  He flew around me and stopped the vehicle.  The driver was suspected of having methamphetamines in his possession and consented to a search, which turned up nothing, and was issued a citation for not having a valid driver’s license.  In another instance we heard a sex offender may have been driving with methamphetamines in his truck.  We learned that his registration was expired so I rode with Chief Smith.  We knew what time he got off work and how long it took to get to town from there, so we waited on the west end of town, and sure enough, he passed us.  Chief Smith conducted a traffic stop, and got consent to search the truck.  No narcotics were found, so the driver was issued a citation for operating a non-registered vehicle.  Drugs were a big thing in town.  The citizens didn’t want it, and knew we had a problem. It was the promise of the Chief to clean the town up, putting part of the blame of the drug problem on the former Chief, Dan, stating he was helping the drug dealers and users from getting caught; an accusation I never believed and always will argue.

Then came the day we learned of a couple in town that were doing meth.  We received the information and then planned a garbage rip.  (For those of you who do not know, a garbage rip is where officers come by and take your garbage to search it.  Garbage is considered abandoned property.)  We got in the Chief's personal truck and stopped by city hall to pick up a garbage can that was full.  We threw it into the truck bed and took off for this address.  As we passed the house, we tossed the full garbage can right next to the one out front and threw the garbage can we wanted into the truck bed.  We then retreated to the Chief's house where we laid the garbage in his garage and went through it.  We collected mail with the suspect’s names, who we will call as Leo and Amy (to protect identity).  We found baggies and other narcotics related items that tested positive, with field testing kits, for marijuana and meth.  I took photos of all this and then filled out a search warrant affidavit.  We drove to the judge’s house and presented it to him.  After getting the warrant signed, we made a game plan to search the house.  We called the deputies and planned to hit it at night, when the family was sleeping.

Finally the time came.  We all pulled up in front of the house.  One of the deputies went around back, as another covered the security camera at the front door.  Chief Smith pounded on the front door until Leo answered.  He was detained as he was read the warrant.  Deputies located Amy and detained her as well outside as another watched the children.  Bob and I entered the house and started searching.  I carried evidence bags and wore gloves and ended up filling bags full of narcotic related items.  Also 6 firearms were seized from the residence as well as the camera, for they were used in commission with the narcotics.  I inventoried all items and made a receipt.  As I issued the receipt, Chief Smith spoke to Leo and Amy and told them they would not be arrested, but charges were pending.  He told them that they were looking at serious charges and serious jail time.  He told them that if they gave up information on who gave them the narcotics, then they would only be charged with misdemeanor possession, before we all left.

To my surprise the next day I discovered Chief Smith in contact with the federal prosecutor trying to press charges on Leo and Amy.  Chief Smith stated that since they did not give him the information then they would be charged federally for being prohibited people in possession of firearms (drug users possessing guns, and having firearms in the presence of narcotics) and that sentence carried 10 or more years in federal prison.  Chief Smith even went back over to interview to Leo and Amy and they confessed they regularly used marijuana and methamphetamine.  Those statements were also forwarded to the federal prosecutor.  Then came the day we transported 7 firearms (6 from this case) to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) in Iowa City.  We handed all the firearms to them for they needed information from them for cases.  Meeting them was an honor because I hadn’t ever met a federal agent before and to my surprise, looked different than I imagined.  But handing these guns over was the final nail in the coffin per say for the federal charges.  They were now set in stone.  Now all we had to do was wait for a grand jury to indict the couple.

A week passed by and Chief Smith brought up the idea of hiring me on as a reserve officer since I was doing such a good job.  I was so excited I had butterflies in my stomach.  I would have to be an idiot to say no, since this was the day I was hoping and praying for, so I said yes.  We filled out the paperwork and set up a time for the city council to interview me.  And just like that the day came.  I attended the city council meeting.  My older distant cousin, Larry, was at the meeting for he was the city clerk.  He had previously told me that I would do great, but still I was nervous when they called me up.

I had previously for over the past year been working as an ambulance driver for the EMS service, so I knew I had that going for me.  When I sat down, Jeff, who was my father’s friend, asked me a few questions as well as Roger, my fathers other friend, did too.  I knew every member on the city council, and one of them I served with on the EMS service with.  I answered the questions, and just like that it was over.  The city council took a vote and they all voted me to be appointed.  I was now a reserve officer.  I met with Chief Smith who finished the paperwork that we faxed to the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA).  We waited for a response.

I began to ride around with Bob while he was on duty the days he worked, for Bob was in his early twenties, like me.  I got a long with Bob just fine and became friends with him, although the only downfall is he would tell everything about me to Chief Smith; for Bob admired Chief Smith and Chief Smith always stated that he was preparing Bob to be the next Chief of Police.  There wasn’t an order Chief Smith could ever say that Bob wouldn’t follow.  Anyway few weeks later, Leo and his mother stopped by the police department and dropped off a piece of paper that listed named of drug dealers and people involved in drugs from miles around the area.  Chief Smith interviewed Leo and got all the information he needed.  I asked Chief Smith if we were going to drop the federal charges and file local charges against Leo and Amy, for they had kept their end of the deal.  The response I received was, ""fuck no"".  Chief Smith began to explain that he intended to have them charged federally from the beginning whether or not they helped.  Them helping was just the icing on the cake.  And sure enough exactly one day before I got the go ahead to start working, we received the federal arrest warrants for Leo and Amy.  Chief Smith ordered me to be at the office early in the morning so we could pick them up before Amy left to the school for work, for she was a school teacher.

We arrived at their house bright and early as the sun rose over the horizon.  It was just me and Chief Smith.  He knocked on the door until Leo answered.  Obviously half asleep, Leo was already pissed off that someone was at his door so early.  Chief Smith presented the federal arrest warrant and ordered Leo to call his mother to take the children.  Leo called for Amy before he collapsed to the ground crying. Amy rushed to the door and began arguing, stating the promise the Chief made if they kept their end of the deal.  Chief Smith lied and said there was nothing he could do and said if he didn't take them into custody a federal tactical team would have to be called and a big scene on the block would be publically made.  With that Amy vomited all over the driveway.  Eventually Leo's mother showed and took the children.  Leo and Amy were placed in the back of the 2016 explorer and we took off.  Because the dash cam had no audio, because it was a cheap brand, we could say whatever we wanted on the trip.  Small talk was made the whole trip to Cedar Rapids.  As we approached the federal courthouse, Chief Smith slipped 2 pairs of handcuffs to the back and ordered the couple to place them on each other for they were now under arrest.  We pulled into the sally port and let the couple out.  Federal agents opened a steel door and came out.  They removed Chief Smith's handcuffs and returned them to him before placing Leo and Amy in shackles.  They were escorted inside to holding cells.  This was the last time I saw them.

The next day I was issued a uniform shirt and badge.  Since I had already ordered a duty belt, but it wasn't yet here, I wore a regular belt.  Chief Smith let me drive the squad car this day and I practiced making traffic stops.  Since the sheriff didn't issue a badge number for me yet, I could not use the radio; Chief Smith had to reach over and use it for me.  I was ordered that any calls that came in I had to call Chief Smith, notify him of the call, and then follow the orders he told me for how to handle it.  Finally my duty belt arrived, but to my surprise, I wasn’t allowed to carry a firearm.  I had one to use, but Chief Smith wasn’t able to (so he says; I believe he was just lazy and didn’t want to) get me put through the ILEA firearms course.  If I couldn’t shoot and pass the course, I couldn’t carry a gun.  So Chief Smith had me in the future work by myself without a firearm, and yes people made fun of me all the time even as far as to call me worse than Barney Fife.  Some farmers at the gas station even offered me to give me one bullet to put in my shirt pocket.

The officer on duty usually worked from 10 AM to 6 PM and then Chief Smith would take over and patrol till the bars closed and then go home.  So between 3 AM and 10 AM, usually there was no officer out patrolling town.  After being out early in the morning for weeks, I began to notice an odd vehicle driving around town.  It was an old dodge pickup missing a tailgate that drove slow around the neighborhoods.  I noted the plate and called dispatch to have the plate ran.  Dispatch ran the plate and it returned to a man (who unfortunately passed away in late 2016) named F. who was barred from driving.  I immediately reported my findings to Chief Smith.  His response though shocked me.  He told me to let it go, saying that F. was an older man who was having health problems and would probably die soon.  I told Chief Smith that F. having health problems was more reason to get him off the road in the event he had a heart attack while driving.  Chief Smith ordered me to forget that I ever saw him driving and to drop the subject.  Tension began to build between us, but I let it go and followed my orders.

As I came to work every week, I began to notice a trend of the city council wanting to meet in the police department alone with the chief.  It was not all members, but usually the same ones, and sometimes the mayor was involved too.  If I happen to show up during one of these ‘meetings’ I would be asked to leave and come back later.  If I was in the office working at the time they showed up for these meetings, I would be asked to go home for the night or to come back sometime else.  I was never allowed to hear what went on during these closed door meetings. 

After a few days, while riding with Chief Smith, we received a call about a fight in progress up the road from the police department.  Chief Smith handed me keys to the other squad car and told me to follow him there.  I was excited to be able to fly several blocks with the emergency lights flashing and siren blaring.  We arrived and found several people outside yelling.  Chief Smith immediately handcuffed a combative suspect and put him into my squad car.  Chief Smith learned of what was going on and ended up arresting a female, the arrested male’s wife, and put her in my squad car too; while he arrested an old high school classmate of mine named George (real name changed to protect identity).  Chief Smith placed George in his squad car.  I finally was able to use a random badge number to call in that I was en-route to the jail.   We booked all 3 suspects in for disorderly conduct-fighting in public.  The mayor congratulated us on the arrest when we got back to town.  I ended up just using that badge number as my own and since I had a badge number now I could patrol all on my own…still without a firearm though.

One of the best places I loved to sit to catch traffic violators was right in the police department parking out front of city hall.  It faced the four-way stop intersection in town, and I could run stationary radar for people coming in and out of town in front of and behind me.  For a while we were asked to work weird hours, having us working late into the night. As I was sitting watching for violators one night, I observed a white Oldsmobile come northbound approaching the four-way stop intersection.  The vehicle tapped the brakes then proceeded through the intersection without slowing down.  Upon witnessing the violation, I activated the light bar and sped up to the vehicle.  Ironically the vehicle turned onto the street I lived on and stopped dead in the middle of the road in front of my house.  I walked up and made contact with the driver, we will call Brittaney.  I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle.  I asked Brittaney why she ran the stop sign and she began to argue that she did not.  I asked Brittaney where she was going and she told me home.  That made no sense to me for she lived south of town, the direction she was coming from, not going.  I told Brittaney that she wasn’t making sense and asked where she was coming from.  She was not able to tell me but instead kept repeating, ‘Um, um’.  I then asked Brittaney for her driver’s license.  Brittaney handed me a credit card and when I told my observation to Brittaney, she, while looking at the credit card, began arguing with me that it was her driver’s license.  I proceeded to call Chief Smith and request him to come down to conduct a sobriety test with Brittaney.  The response I got shocked me.  Chief Smith told me to let her go.  He told me she was popular in town and related to the mayor and city council and could not risk getting an OWI (Operating While Intoxicated) charge.  I tried arguing with Chief Smith, but this time he gave an order.  I had no choice.  I handed Brittaney her credit card back and issued her a citation for failing to stop at a stop sign.

Then came the shocker.  The next day we all met at the police department for a meeting.  During the meeting Chief Smith ordered us all, during the hours of 2 AM to 2:30 AM, to be on the other side of town away from the bar and I quote, “so the drunks can make it home.  This is a small town, they don’t have to drive far.  If they get into an accident then you can arrest them.”  I was shocked to hear this and Chief Smith made it known that this order came down after I stopped Brittaney the night before.  Chief Smith stated that the bar funded the city and police department and that the city could not afford to scare off patrons by us arresting them for OWI.  Then came the threats.  Immediately after Chief Smith noted my ‘insubordination’ towards his orders.  Chief Smith told all of us not to cross him.  Chief Smith told us that as long as we stuck to the orders he gave, then we would have a lasting career.  But if we, and I quote “back stab me or my department, I will end your career as quickly as I started it.”  Chief Smith went on further to explain to us how a few years ago a sheriff deputy from the county just north of us, contacted the state about his sheriff.  The sheriff found out and fired the deputy on a technicality in the policy and to this day calls up places this deputy tries to apply at and says nothing but bad things about the deputy to keep the deputy from working anywhere the sheriff doesn’t want him to work.  Chief Smith stated he wouldn’t hesitate to do the same, stating he will call every department we try and apply at and say nothing but bad stuff about us.  Chief Smith stated that we were his minions and we were to do everything he asked of us.  This meeting really made me think about leaving the department after I found out what the city was actually like.  But regardless I felt like I had no way of leaving this department so I planned to keep my head down.

The next night I showed up to the police department to find a meeting taking place.  I could hear talking through the door, but could not figure out what was being said.  I left and came back later to find everyone leaving.  Chief Smith was inside and when I sat at my desk he asked if there was a problem at all.  I stated there wasn’t.  Chief Smith proceeded to tell me if I ever chose to go against him or his department that he would keep me from being an officer again in this state by calling any department I worked for to tell them I was a dishonest officer.  He stated if my integrity ever gets put in question, I could never be an officer again in my life.  I wouldn’t be able to testify again in court because they wouldn’t be able to trust me.  Chief Smith said he didn’t want to do that to me and that’s why I needed to follow his orders.  He told me to be more like Bob for Bob never asks questions when he’s given an order.  Chief Smith even told me that Bob was in line next to become Chief, for he, the mayor, and city council have it planned for when Chief Smith retires.    

But even though Bob follows orders without questions asked and does what he can and all that, Chief Smith still talked shit about him behind Bob’s back.  See, Bob had gotten a girlfriend while employed as an officer.  She was a badge bunny who loved a man in uniform.  Bob had gotten lazy, sometimes not showing up for work on time for he was with his girlfriend when he was supposed to be on duty.  One day I got called by a deputy asking me to stop by Bob’s house and notify him that dispatch had been calling him on the radio over and over with no response.  Sure enough when I stopped by I found a half clothed Bob inside telling me he was with his girlfriend.  I told him to answer the damn radio before I left.  The deputies frequently stopped by the police department and we all made fun of Bob.  Bob never knew about it and because he was an ass towards me, I never told him. 

During my time patrolling town, I began to know people well from taking calls at their residence, or just seeing them all the time.  There was one couple I began to know well for their dog always got loose.  The males name was Derrick.  I gave him my number to call me the next time the dog got loose.  Well one night I got a call.  It was Derrick’s wife letting me know Derrick was drunk and feeling suicidal.  I called Bob and was trying to tell him, but Bob said he was dealing with a lost dog.  So I then went to Derrick’s house since Bob wasn't going to be of assistance.  I called our town paramedic and asked him to evaluate Derrick.  Sure enough our paramedic did and called dispatch to have the ambulance paged.  I drove to the fire station where the ambulance was stored and met everyone there.  We returned and loaded Derrick in and transported him to the hospital to get mental health help. 

Since it was my days off, I returned to the police department when I worked next.  When I returned, and was working on the computer, Chief Smith and Bob stormed in slamming the door shut.  They began to chew my ass for calling the ambulance.  I told them the situation and in response this is what Chief Smith told me I should have done.  He said I should have called Derrick to the sidewalk, and once he was on the sidewalk to place Derrick under arrest for public intoxication.  I explained that Derrick did not need to go to jail but instead needed mental health help.  Chief Smith bridled me about it.  He then stated I had caused ‘enough drama’ to the city.  I had no idea what he was talking about.  Bob then stated that I hadn’t spoken to anyone from the city (no officers, city councilmen, or the mayor) for two days and that I was causing drama by running away for two days.  I had no words to say.  I could not believe they were starting a bunch of bullshit.  I explained that I was on my days off and on my days off, just like them, I stay in my house and watch TV/play videogames.  I was then told since I had started drama with the city and was continuing it and arguing instead of apologizing (there was nothing to apologize about) I would be cut days to work.  Bob was going to work 5 of my days for me.  I could not believe this.  Once they left I the next day went to Chief Smith’s house and apologized (even though I did nothing wrong) for causing drama.  He allowed me to work 2 of the days he gave to Bob.  That’s when I was also told that we would no longer be meeting at the police department for meetings for the city had installed surveillance cameras and audio in city hall.  Chief Smith didn’t want anything we talked about to be recorded so we always had meetings at his house instead.

Chief Smith I believed loved being in control and that’s why he acted this way.  I believe he’s a control freak.  He always yelled at his girlfriend for things she couldn’t do or help.  He treated her like shit.  I even believe he hit her when no one was around.  One day, while riding, we showed up to Chief Smith’s house.  His girlfriend showed up at the same time.  Bill walked inside and asked where supper was.  His girlfriend said she just got home and didn’t have time to make supper.  Bill began to shout and I saw his girlfriend flinch as if she was waiting to get hit.  She began to whisper as she apologized for not having supper ready.  Bill started cooking and made his own supper.  He ate, said good-bye, and we went on patrol.  He then started telling me how useless his girlfriend was for not having supper ready.

In another instance, Dan had returned to town to work on one of several rental properties he owns.  When I was out patrolling and saw his car outside the house, I stopped over.  I stopped in and showed him that I was a town officer now.  While I was visiting him though, a friend of Chief Smith’s saw me there and took a photo of me talking to Dan.  Later that day, while in the office, Chief Smith came in and sat at his desk.  He began to bridle me asking what I was doing talking to Dan.  I told him I was friends with Dan still and I wanted to say Hi.  Chief Smith was furious stating that as long as I was an officer of his, I would under no circumstances talk with the previous police chief.  Chief Smith claimed that Dan had been in the pockets of people who were doing drugs in town (accusations with no proof) stating that Dan would tip drug dealers off whenever the county was gonna do a search warrant.  He stated either I was an officer of his, or a traitor.  I told Chief Smith that I was keeping the peace between Dan and the police department.  That seemed to calm him down, but I was warned not to be friends with Dan anymore or I wouldn’t be an officer long.

Then came the day we made the town newspaper.  We received a search warrant for George’s house.  We knew we would get some marijuana and maybe not much more; but what we found shocked the city.  Upon making entry to the residence, we located a safe that contained over $2,000 cash and several huge vacuumed sealed bags of marijuana as well as other narcotics related materials and a firearm.  We confiscated everything and transported George and his friend to the county jail.  George was charged with several felonies and held on a high bond.  George, as he was being led away, made a comment to us all asking us how we thought of him selling marijuana to kids all across town.  He was the drug dealer we were looking for but didn’t know of.  Later on after we got all the evidence collected, we set it on the city council table at city hall and got our picture taken with it.  Me, Bob, and Chief Smith were all in the photo.  We could have filed federal charges, but decided not to.  In the end Chief Smith worked out a deal with the county attorney, and it was that George would plead Guilty to 1 felony charge and all the rest would be dropped with George serving just probation. But the catch was at any time day or night the police could search the house without probable cause or a warrant.  And if something was found he would surely go to prison for 5 years on the charge he plead to and risked more prison time for future charges. George agreed to stay out of prison.  Chief Smith had that deal made because he intended to catch George again.  George had family that showed up every so often from Colorado and they would bring George the bags of marijuana.  I did feel bad for the situation George got himself into for I was friends with him before all this happened.

Then was the time they made an embarrassment of me.  I was out patrolling and turned around at Chief Smith’s house to pick up a ride along (the person who eventually replaced me as an officer).  While turning around, a car with Minnesota plates and tinted windows flew past me at a high rate of speed.  I then turned around and took off in the direction it was traveling in.  While driving on the road that is on the city limit line (previously stated at the beginning) the car approached me.  This road was a 25 MPH zone and when I clicked on my forward facing moving radar, I received a speed calculation of 52 MPH.  I flipped on the emergency lights and siren as the car passed me and turned around and accelerated towards it.  As I flew onto the main road into town, I checked for traffic and flew through the stop sign intersection and onto the road at 60 MPH.  I came to the edge of the cemetery where the road curved into town and couldn’t see the car anywhere.  I was going 80+MPH and I knew the car had to be going faster than me to disappear like that.  I called it in to dispatch and they called an Attempt to Locate on the car for the deputies and the surrounding counties.  Then Chief Smith called and asked me to stop to his house.  When I showed up, there was the car.  Chief Smith and Bob were having fun with Chief Smith’s new car.  Then Cory called.  He was working as an officer in the next county and heard about the car I was trying to stop.  Chief Smith then became mad.  He called the sheriff’s office and told them he was doing pursuit training with me and forgot to notify me.  He told them to cancel the attempt to locate on his car.  He then told me and Bob that we have a no pursuit policy and not to chase after cars.  Finally the last straw with Chief Smith happened.  I was patrolling town when Dave flagged me down.  I pulled over and Dave pulled up next to me.  He stated that his girlfriend was freaking out at the house.  I went over and called Chief Smith, per my orders.  He stated he was on his way over and not to notify dispatch about anything yet.  He said he was ten minutes out.  I went inside and found Angela yelling at Dave and crying.  Dave was yelling back.  I was in the process of splitting the couple up when I observed Angela’s eyes roll back and she fell face first to the floor and started seizing up.  Since I had already worked hospital security and seen seizures, this is exactly what I had seen in the Emergency Room.  I asked Dave how often this happens and he told me lately it’s been happening a lot.  I got down and helped Angela.  Angela got up after a few minutes and I ordered Dave to call 911 next time it happened.  About that time Chief Smith showed up.  I immediately told him what I witnessed and told him I was gonna call for the ambulance.  Chief Smith shouted, “no”.  He told me he would handle it and ordered me to go home.  I did so.  The next day I went to Chief Smith’s house to pick up his squad car for Bob had the one we drove.  Inside I asked Chief Smith if he called EMS for Angela.  Immediately he started yelling at me telling me to forget that anything happened.  He yelled, “You’re not a fucking doctor, you can’t diagnose that she had a fucking seizure!”  Chief Smith stated that if she did have a seizure, it would be a miracle of God for that meth addict to die for she was a waste of oxygen.  I was then told I was done working until I decided to “be a team player” and that Bob was going to get my hours.  I was told that if I didn’t want to follow orders I didn’t have to work anymore.  A few days later I again went back and apologized (again for no reason) for my actions and got my working days back. As a side note two days after this EMS were called to pickup and transport Angela after she had a seizure and was hospitalized for several days.

On the next days off I drove to a friend house, who was an officer in another county, and stayed the night there.  While staying the night, I received a text from Bob, who asked me if the city had to hire someone to replace me.  I sent back a message asking what that meant and immediately received a call from Cory.  He told me that Chief Smith was furious at me and that I was permanently off the schedule unless I went and again apologized (for again no reason) to the chief.  I asked him what I did wrong and he said he had no clue other than the chief was furious at me.  This was the end of the line.  I got the number for the Iowa Ombudsman’s Office and called them.  I had kept 16 pages of notes in a notebook with all these activities and more with dates and times.  I explained everything.  The lady I spoke to told me to quit from that department.  She told me they were doing shady practices and they would look into it, but it was her advice for me to quit.  I took her advice.  My friend and I went back to town and I gathered all my stuff up.  I turned it in to one of the city council members with a resignation letter I typed up quick.  I also had to quickly explain to my parents what happened in a quick 5 minute explanation as to why I was quitting and moving away.  I blocked the phone numbers of Bob and Chief Smith.  Later on that day, I kept getting voicemails from Chief Smith stating it wasn’t too late to come back and apologize and get a few hours of work here and there.  Then more voicemails asking if I really wanted to end my career.  Finally I received the last one stating if I didn’t call him back that there would be nothing I could do to earn my job back and my career would be over.  I never called him back and how have a new phone and number.

I had intentions of working at the department I am at now.  Chief Smith the next day after leaving the voicemails called the city hall where I am living now, and told them I was liar, my integrity was up for question, and that I could not be trusted.  He tried to spread false lies about me but luckily the city I am at now doesn’t put up with shady departments.  They hung up the phone and told him not to call back.  I did however have one court date left at this old department.  I didn’t feel safe being alone with Chief Smith in the courthouse for there wasn't any security, so I decided to have my father attend court with me as a witness.  We met at the courthouse and waited outside the courtroom.  Sure enough Chief Smith showed up.  He looked at me and my father before retreating to another part of the courthouse.  That’s when I was notified that I wasn’t needed because the defendant had plead Guilty of the charges that morning and a trial was no longer needed.  My father and I left without anything but exchanging looks with Chief Smith.    Surprisingly my cousin one day after my resignation, too quit, retiring early after a whole career of being city clerk.  It was odd that he did this one day after I quit working for the city.

The last thing that ever happened with his department was during the city council meeting, where they discussed my immediate resignation form the police department and EMS service, my father stood in front of the city council and confronted Chief Smith for the way I was treated.  I had no idea he was doing this, but they ended the city council sessions, asked the members of the public to leave as well as the news reporter, and conducted a closed session meeting.  There my father laid out the truth to the city council about what was going on with the department.  The city council members argued with my father as Chief Smith accused me of gossiping and spreading lies.  Roger was the only city council member that believed what I was saying and even fought for me amongst the other council members.  He forever has my respect.  He was one that did not participate in the ‘secret meetings’ the other members did with the chief.  Once the council meeting was over, I then set up a time to meet with the mayor and lay down to him myself what was going on.  Once leaving the mayors church, I planned to cut communication from this city and forget I am even from here.  I am ashamed to say that I grew up in a town that doesn’t even fight for its own."

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

**2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you**

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) You are paying me to sleep with you (at least at first) which is both surprising for someone of your fame and beauty and also just a bit illegal

7) Some combination of the above... most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

I am an intern with a shitton of insecurities. I haven't really told anyone here that I am struggling with mental health problems. Mostly because I am scared of their reactions.  


My parents haven't really been the greatest help either. Last weekend we had a massive falling out when we talked about school. I told my parents that it may take me one year longer to graduate because I needed to focus on my own mental health first. They just looked at me weirdly and basically told me to get over it. I managed to stand up for myself, but I couldn't help but let my emotions get the better of me. I've yelled and cried, and yet they still see my depression as being ' a bit blue ' even though my mom has been depressed and has been taking anti-depressants for years! Isn't that hypocritical??

&amp;#x200B;

But right now I'm at my internship, bad memories surrounding my best friends' death, my failing grades and my inability to start big school projects are all piling up. I can feel this combination of fear and anguish twirling around in my stomach and it's horrible. I just want to go home and draw the covers over my head, sleep for I don't know how many days. But I can't.

ae68gp,6,2019-01-09,Medical internship AFTER grad school?,SweetDorayaki,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/ae68gp/medical_internship_after_grad_school/,"Hello amazing SLP community! This is my first post, but I’ve been lurking on-and-off for a while now. Forgive me if this topic has already been previously asked, and also for the length. I’d really appreciate any insight or direction for this situation!

So, I’m entering what should be the last semester of my graduate program in a couple weeks, which entails a medical internship and the thesis/comprehensive exam.  Unfortunately, it *feels* to me as if the field placement coordinator has “given up” after the school’s list of potential placements have already been exhausted. My own efforts at finding a medical internship have not proven to be successful either.

However, I remain strongly convinced that to be a competent clinician in the future necessitates that I receive proper training in some kind of medical setting. (This is the major portion I’m missing and it also happens to be what I’ve been looking forward to from the start). Needless to say, the process has been frustrating and disappointing thus far, and I’m feeling defeated. It seems I may “need to settle” for any kind of internship just to accrue sufficient hours to graduate on time.

Now for a possibly crazy idea. IF I  didn’t secure a medical internship and still graduated, could I independently seek out internship opportunities after graduation?
Rephrased: is it possible for someone to graduate with a Master’s degree in the field and pursue more internships rather than go directly into the CFY? Is this even a thing that people do?

(If this option is possible, I’d want to find an appropriate med internship for the Summer or Fall to ensure I am more properly equipped for the future. But if it’s not an option, then I’d need to decide whether to stick to my convictions and delay graduation or to prioritize graduating on time and hope I can somehow obtain a CF in medical setting without prior clinical experience.)

Thanks in advance for reading and for any responses you may provide!

ae6o2u,3,2019-01-09,Internship finally broke me,hurrysaresh,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ae6o2u/internship_finally_broke_me/,"Yesterday, I got to know from another intern (friend of mine) from the same project team and he told me his allowance has been raised. I've seen him work, he's good but unfortunately takes very long time to get the job done. 

This makes his stay late with the rest of the project team till late night, on the other hand, I complete my tasks quickly and ensure they are all done before leaving. I usually prefer leave work at 6 and I only stay back when I have pending tasks on my tab.

What surprised me was how I did not get the raise. I've been working my ass off the job as well. My senior, the guy who approves of the raises told me once that my friend is doing his job real slow and he's afraid that he might have to switch him out to a different project team. Which, obviously, did not happen. 

But right now, I feel played. 

The money isn't important to me, but the fact that getting a raise depends on the employee's performance does. This has been keeping me down lately. I keep getting the feeling that I'm underperforming.

What should I do? Do I bow down and lose what little of personal time I have for myself or should I try and ask for a raise?  I feel broken and disappointed as I've been trying so hard. I keep thinking of how much more should I commit to this company. "

I want to calculate wave elevations over a length and a timeseries like zeta = A sin (kx-wt+psi). It is a combined wave of mutiple harmonics defined by k, omega and A (a is complex which takes care of the phases) and timeseries T.

If I were in one place I would just put:

    zeta = combsin (A,w,T);

and be done with it. How do I do this for a set of harmonics with kx-wt? I cant really find a way to use combsin; and loops might fry my laptop.

I wondered whether I could put something in the direction of

    for x = linspace (xmin, xmax, 0.01)
        zeta (x,:) = combsin ((A,k*x/T+w,T);
    end

but for obvious reasons (vector lengths) and less obvious reasons (I think I would fuck up the wave equation) this is not the case.

ae7mxk,1,2019-01-09,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ae7mxk/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! It's a new one, so I'm sure there are kinks to work out along the way, but I really like the concept!

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

 I mentioned in the Christmas story post that my older N-Sis Teedits is a copycat, stealing little bits and pieces of others’ personalities or even memories and claiming them as her own. Over the years, when I’ve shared my experience in this area I’ve gotten responses ranging from “Oh, imitation is flattery, get over it!” to “I had the same experience with (insert friend or relative) and it is maddening.” It’s one of those things I think some people don’t understand until it happens to you. Repeatedly. 

Minor annoyance or no, one of the biggest changes I noticed when I finally cut Teedits off was that I felt so much more at liberty to share things - online and in person - with friends and family. I hadn’t realized how much I’d gray-rocked myself into being nearly totally generic to people who knew both of us. 

Other than the Christmas story, here is a brief rundown of Teedits’ most dramatic thieveries. 

1. The Beach Vacation. 

When I was in my 20s or so, a bunch of our blended family went on vacation for a week to a beautiful island. Teedits and her family declined to come for various reasons. I took a whole bunch of photos and posted them online in an album. There was one really cute one of some island wildlife.

Teedits immediately shared all my vacation photos on her page, one at a time, without giving any credit of course. Then she took the best one and made it her profile pic. Friends of hers were posting comments assuming she had gone on vacation and taken the photos. She did nothing to correct them. It was all very strange and annoying, and I thought what the hell do you do in this situation? If I tried telling her it was weird, she’d just deny it and get hostile…

So what I came up with was I just used the photo I liked the best - the same photo she stole, the best one in the album - and I made it my profile pic. I thought why worry about whether it’s weird for her to have the same profile pic as me? It’s my fucking picture! She actually posted a comment on my pic saying “We’re profile twins!” But shortly after she changed hers. 

Then later that summer, it was time for Teedits to go on vacation. She had planned a trip to a beach she’d gone to before (part of the reason she declined to go with the rest of the family was she’d already planned her own trip). She took her two kids, and they ended up coming home a day early. She just told everyone they were “tired.”

But later the truth came out; she couldn’t keep her story straight about her own vacation. She got caught in a lie and confessed that the real reason she’d come home early was because the “kids were acting awful” after they tried to go on a long drive. You see, after spending the first two days at the beach with her kids, Teedits loaded up the whole family in the car and attempted to drive them to the island during peak season to go visit the same attractions the rest of the family had seen earlier that spring (during off season).

The kids had already traveled from their house to the beach so that was about a six hour trip. Going down the coast to the island was about two more hours, but that was during off-season. When you factor in that she tried to take them on the weekend - when houses flip - during peak season, they were probably stuck in traffic for several more hours. And once they  got there, they discovered that everything requires reservations, and there wasn’t much they could do at all. Both kids were melting down by then, she and her husband got into a huge fight, and all they did was get the kids some fast food and turn around and go back. She blamed her special-needs son for ruining the whole thing and brought the whole family back a day early. 

2. The Career and 3. The Patchouli

This one still cracks me up. Back when I was a freewheeling college student, I wore patchouli a lot because I smoked pot a lot. I just liked it too. 

Early in Teedits’ marriage, in our 20s, she didn’t do the copycat thing as overtly or as hardcore, because she loathed me. She was a seemingly happily-married Republican housewife at that point. I was a hippie-esque college student and everything wrong with the world, which she enjoyed reminding our parents of every chance she got.

So then, life happened to Teedits and she mellowed out some. And that’s when she really started poaching parts of my personality...but since we never really were close, all she had to go on were the older parts from when I still lived at home.

I went back to school in my late 20s to get a master’s degree in something completely frivolous, but fun (to me). Shortly after I graduated, Teedits decided to go for her master’s. The field she went into was close in name but a world away from the field I had wanted to study in undergrad. For example, let’s pretend I wanted to study etymology. Well, my dad and stepmom insisted “There’s no money in that. You’ll never find a job.” I argued with them quite a bit and at some point I realized that they thought I was talking about a different field that sounded the same - let’s say entomology. 

Lo and behold, after I got my master’s, Teedits enrolled in a program to get her master’s in...entomology. I’m not sure she did this just because she heard it was the field I was considering, but given all the other times she’s done crazy shit, I do wonder.

Then there is the patchouli incident, which happened during an internship Teedits did for her degree. She told my mom this story and she preceded it with “You know how I do everything IzFiz does?” Mom said she nearly choked when Teedits admitted that so nonchalantly. Teedits told her that she got herself some patchouli oil, and wore it the first day of her new internship. She was taken aside and asked not to wear that because in the field she chose, usually clients wore it to hide the smell of pot, and it was unprofessional. 

4. Writing

Both me and my mom participate the same type of creative writing. With Mom, she was very active when she attended the local community college in her early 40s. I was active when I was in high school and college. Mom and I attended events together all the time with more or less the same group of people, but Teedits never showed any interest.

Then after my parents’ divorce, Mom moved away, and I graduated and also moved away. Suddenly, Teedits decided to get into this hobby. She started attending the recurring events we had attended. She met people we knew and introduced herself as our daughter/sister. She would brag to both of us about how she “met so-and-so from Hometown, I told them I’m your daughter!” 

She tried to build relationships with these people (see the Friend Steal, later on). Some of them approached my mom (who still lived a few hours away, and visited the area frequently) and mention how weird her daughter was, or how her daughter asked them to meet for coffee and wanted to do nothing but talk shit about Mom or me. 

Like any Teedits copycat incident, Teedits was all-in on this. Whereas me or Mom, being introverted as hell, would not tell you unless asked that we participated in this hobby, Teedits was shouting it from the rooftops. “I’m going to be a WRITEEERRRRR! I’ll just die if I can’t write for a living!” (Well, uh, it doesn’t pay squat, honey). ”I have three novels ready to GO if I find the right agent!” “I’m going to this workshop or that workshop and I’m pitching my novel to an agent!” “I can’t handle getting these rejection notices.” Etc.

At least a year or two after I cut her off and ignored all her attempts to coax me into engaging, Teedits self-published her work and released it on my birthday. The cover she designed looks like my eight-year-old made it out of construction paper and didn’t have scissors available.

I'll post part 2 soon. Thanks for reading! "

* You've been standing in a crowd of young men being taught the ""LDRSHIP"" acronym. All of you look the same. All of you look different.
* It has been... how long has it been? You've been issued tan Army briefs. Harsh lighting of the bunk buildings contrast to the dim light of the clothing issue. Your eyes don't know what to process.
* You get a hair cut and are placed in PTs. You are now among a sea of bald white men wearing PX running shoes.
* You learned the word ""Hooah"" thirty minutes ago. You have been mind-numbingly furious at the use of the word since twenty-nine minutes ago.
* You ask the miserable Drill Sergeant for help. He tells you to ask a particular holdover private for help. You ask him to describe him. He says ""bald white guy.""
* Your wonder is gone. You haven't slept. You're miserable and sleep deprived and the door out is close but also out of reach.
* You called a Drill Sergeant ""sir"". He is now throwing a temper tantrum. You just wanted directions to the latrine.
* Dinner is an Army hamburger, chips, warm Powerade, and a cup of fruit.
* Sleep? You fool.
* You don't know what time it is. A kid next to you hasn't showered. An adult next to you hasn't showered either. You have not bathed in days but you just got here.
* Your group is talking too loudly. A holdover Private screams ""At ease the noise!"". You want to punch him. You do not know why.
* It is shower time. The water is lukewarm yet freezing. A private to your right is shivering. A private to your left is scalded by the hot water. A private behind you turns to casually urinate into the drain in the middle of the floor. A private by himself in the opposite corner is masturbating. You suddenly wish you did not have peripheral vision. However, you don't remember ever turning your head to witness any of this.
* You exit the shower. The sleazy older female civilian is salivating yet calm. Her eyes linger on you. The word ""Dependa"" enters your head. You do not know what it means.
* You are all shivering outside at 0100 after the shower. The Drill Sergeant is taking you to get more clothes. Your hastily chosen bunk in the bay is already full on clothes.
* The DS leaves. Conversation erupts. You hear ""At ease the *noise!*"". You experience a fleeting, uncontrollable rage.
* A middle-aged black woman wearing an unfamiliar NCO rank awaits in the next room. You politely ask what's next. She screams at you to shut the fuck up.
* Another private has called a DS ""sir"". He is going belligerent. But the room is silent; no private had spoken since First Sergeant L\*\*\*\*\* screamed at you.
* You have to use the latrine. One of the stalls has a flooded bowl. The stall to the left has a tower of fecal matter in the bowl. The final stall is occupied. You walk away, before noticing no feet in the stall.
* There are dicks drawn everywhere. But nobody has been issued sharpies.
* A tall black IET is called ""too tall"" by the DS. An overweight white IET  is called ""hubba bubba"" by the DS. A flamboyant gentleman is called ""Cav Scout"" by the DS. You do not know what this means.
* Breakfast is at 0400. It consists of ham, eggs, cereal, grits, and a cup of fruit with warm Powerade.
* You drink coffee for the first time in your life. You are now simultaneously exhausted but your heart rate is skyrocketing.
* The Drill Sergeants are drinking coffee. A Drill Sergeant is asleep on a table. A Drill Sergeant is behind you now, demanding to know why you aren't with your reception group. You look up and the table is empty. Your heart is still racing but you don't remember sleeping.
* You catch up with your group. You're at the back of the line. You wake up with a shove from the DS telling you that you're next. You're in the front of the line. You don't remember falling asleep standing up. You don't remember walking to the CIF door.
* The DS promises you sleep tonight. You lay your head on the hard, moldy mattress and close your eyes. You open them and thirty minutes have passed. The Drill Sergeant is taking you all to immunizations.
* The medic gives you a penicillin shot in the butt. A First Sergeant calls him over. The syringe is left in your butt for five minutes before he comes back to remove it.
* You get blood work done. The intern civilian misses your vein. Thrice.
* You are all in the hallway, sleep deprived and miserable. An older private has ""taken charge"" and is attempting to motivate you all. A holdover private screams ""At Ease the Noise"" from the Hallway. You are filled with murderous intent.
* You have not slept in two days because DS wants ""maximum efficiency, privates!"" You wonder if you have PTSD.
* It has been four days, but you've been awake for 72 hours. You are carrying your clothing to the buses to be sent ""down range"".
* You finish the trip. You are screamed at to leave the bus. You stumble off of it and are grouped with your platoon. The DS insults you, your mother, your light-switch-sized penis, he starts to call you a homophobic slur but pauses and calls you a mouth-breathing shitbag instead.
* The DS moves on. The August Fort Benning heat is the best sign of warmth since you escaped the cold, harsh, melancholy hallways of 30th AG.
* You are marched into your room. The DS door is slightly ajar and there is a Penthouse magazine and a bottle of Crown on the desk.
* The cadre introduce themselves. You begin to hope that they're normal people. A kid calls the DS ""sir"". All of you except the offending private are now doing push ups.
* The Private who was casually peeing in the latrine has a similar last name to you. He is your battle buddy. He smells faintly of urine.
* The PFC who was masturbating in the stall has a similar name to you. He is to your right, and not your assigned battle buddy, but you smell his body odor and are aware that his hand just stealthily exited his pocket, with a wet spot on his trousers. There is not a single source of external moisture that could've caused that.
* You are all undressed and sent to shower. It lasts 60 seconds. You are clean. Your battle buddy stood in the water and did nothing.
* You are sent to retrieve your TA-50. You ask a Drill Sergeant where the truck is to load the gear. He laughs at you and walks away.
* 30 minutes later you collapse on the sidewalk, a mile into walking your TA-50 back.
* You don't know why you enlisted.
* You don't know why you enlisted.
* YoU dON't knOw why-
* ""At ease the noise!"", you hear.
* You immediately arise and punch the offending Specialist in the face.
* You feel alive. A Drill Sergeant chuckles and looks the other way.

Edit: Thanks for the Silver, stranger! Although the replies to this prove that Reception is where hope goes to die and the psychological fuckery begins.

Edit ²: It appears my shitpost/partially accurate reminiscing of June 2008 has me Golded. Thanx!

Also, I dont know where else I could post this, if any of you have a better suggestion of where to post this please do tell me. Post might be a bit long, bare with me.

I am currently a 3rd year in physics, I just have a few (3 to 5) classes in order to complete all my physics requirements. I left all my breath courses for the 4th year to mainly focus on research. I just started researching with a professor, I will be working with black holes. I scheduled my classes that I would give myself to prep for the GRE, apply to grad schools, and focus my time on research. However, I decided that it would be best for me to take a break and not go directly to grad school. My grades aren't that great either (sitting around a overall 2.8 GPA, most of my physics classes are B's, 2 A's, and 2 C's), and knowing myself I won't be able to perform well in the GRE. So, my second option was to find a job that interested me. I kept on shifting my interested, going from working with NASA, to being a astrophotographer, to getting a PhD in astrophysics, and so on. I kept doubting myself and telling myself that maybe physics isnt for me. And I was right. A few weeks ago, when I was talking to my research professor I told them that after I graduate I would want to work for a game company. 

Now that I came to the realization that gaming (which I have done most of my life) was where my true passion was, I only have a year and a half to learn some programs and coding. I know I can just change my major, but it's a bit too late for me. All the time I have been working to get a bachelors in physics would just be a waste. 

I felt like I just wanted 3 year focusing on being something that I cannot be. I should have listed to myself and dug a bit deeper, then I would have saved myself a crisis. 

I'm not saying that I'm not going to use my degree, I would still love to incorporate it in games that I will be working with. 

I'm just a bit hurt and mad at myself that I couldn't figure this all out. 

Focusing on the future, this upcoming summer I will most likely apply to an REU. Either that or apply for a internship with a game company. And maybe I will focus on creating a game or messing around with the programs, I know it won't be enough compared to a student in game design may have, but I won't have an option.

I'm just a bit lost. Sorry.

Edit: I dont know if I should continue researching with my professor and/or take more CS courses? 

The programs that I am planning to learn, are Maya, C+, and unreal engine. I have seen position that require some of these."
aea3ku,3,2019-01-09,How do I [20/F] let a friend [20/M] who was in love with me down easily?,FickleOpportunity,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aea3ku/how_do_i_20f_let_a_friend_20m_who_was_in_love/,"Hi everyone, sorry if the formatting is a bit off as I’m writing this from my mobile account. I know this is a bit long, but there’s a lot of relevant context.

I met Brendan my freshman year of college and we immediately hit it off. I was attracted to him (not in a sexual way, moreso in an emotional way) and we became best friends. And for most of the first year, it was just that— a strictly platonic friendship that admittedly had a lot of emotional intimacy. We have both been through a lot in our lives and were a big source of emotional support for one another. 

However, Brendan and I both live very different lifestyles. I’m a very driven person and balance a job, internship, being a teaching assistant and all of my other extracurriculars on top of my full course load and have managed to make Dean’s list every semester. Brendan is the complete opposite. As soon as he arrived on campus he joined a frat, and became very enmeshed in the culture of the frat. (Not to say all frats are bad/party too much/get bad grades, but this particular frat on our campus is known for these things.) He began heavily drinking and smoking pot, along with doing some harder drugs. He would smoke so much that he wouldn’t show up to his classes at all, or he would show up high. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love to drink, smoke, and have a good time like any other college student. But it’s always been balanced with my other responsibilities. In a not-so-shocking turn of events, Brendan drops out of school because his grades were bad and “college wasn’t for him” (AKA, he has a trust fund and knows he doesn’t *have* to go to college). 


The school year goes by relatively quickly, and then during the last week of our freshman year he confesses that he is in love with me. As soon as he told me this I knew there was going to be an issue. The truth is, I *did* love Brendan, but he always felt like more of a brother to me and I never really saw him in a sexual way.  We don’t want the same things in life, and I felt we were incompatible. But, he treated me better than any guy I’ve ever met and my family and friends were pressuring me to give him a chance.

So I did. I went on one date with him, which ended in us trying to have sex. It was absolutely horrible. The worst sex I have ever had in my entire life. He was way too rough, I had blood blisters on my ass for a week because he kept spanking me (without asking first) and the entire time I felt like I was kissing my brother. We had no sexual chemistry and it was a terrible experience. Needless to say, afterwards I told him this wasn’t going to work. 

That was about 8 months ago, and ever since then I’ve been avoiding him and have only seen him once. And the truth is, I don’t really want to see him. That chapter of my life is closed, I’ve moved on and so has he. We are on different life paths, he has been jumping from bullshit job to bullshit job, meanwhile I’m finishing my degree and chasing my dreams of having a successful career. It’s hard to make time for any of my friends (even those who live on campus as I do) because I’m so busy. Most of the time, when I do hang out with friends we are studying in the library together.  To be honest, I have very little free time and I don’t want to spend it hanging out with him. More than anything, it’s depressing to see him like this (I wanted so much better for him) and I don’t feel I can relate to him anymore. 


He keeps texting me wanting to hang out, and I’ve been blowing him off telling him the truth, which is that I’ve been too busy and don’t have time. He texted me again today trying to hang out and I feel like I somehow have to tell him I need space but I want to let him down in a compassionate and dignified way. I have no idea what to say to him, it’s not like I can say “I can’t relate to you anymore, we live in different worlds and that chapter of my life is closed.” Because though that’s what I’d like to say, I still love him and don’t want to be harsh. Any advice on how to handle to situation and get my point across would be very helpful! Thank you in advance.

TLDR: my best friend from college confessed his love for me, we had terrible sex because I felt guilty for not giving him a chance. He dropped out of college and still wants to hang out with me, but I’ve closed that chapter in my life and don’t want to spend my limited free time with him despite his constant requests to see me. How do I let him down easily?

My dad left my family three years ago and has not provided financially towards us in that time. I have taken out loans to pay for my school, as my mom was not working when he left and has struggled to pay for our house and her own expenses, let alone her kids. I feel guilty asking her for any help, so I have basically become financially independent through various jobs. The issue is my credit card bill is higher than my checking amount. I pay for my rent which goes to my credit card, as well as utilities and groceries and any other expense I have. I'm not sure where to go from here. I don't make enough currently to pay it off and am worried sick that I will be in debt and ruin my credit score and not be able to pay for my rent or college expenses. I am currently out of work due to my class and unpaid internship schedule and have struggled to find a job that fits into the free hours I do have. I've sold old jewelry, clothes, have walked a few dogs here and there, have registered to be a babysitter through a popular website and have had zero luck with that, have considered being an uber driver as I do have access to a car, but I have heard the pay through that isn't worth it for the amount of hours and effort put into it. I don't know where to turn or what to do. I am more blessed than most with the fact that I am receiving a good education that will hopefully lead to a good job come graduation this spring, but I do not know what to do in the meantime.

In May it'll be almost a year since I graduated college. I have GAD and mild depression. I currently work at a doggy daycare, live with my mom and younger brother, and have been on 20 mg of Prozac for almost 4 years now I think. I also own 3 rats and had first adopted rats while in school to help calm me down during panic attacks or overwhelming anxiety.

Anyways the current job I have now is just temporary. My boyfriend [24M] (we've been together for almost 3.5 years) just got done applying to grad schools and is waiting to hear back from them. However once he starts receiving responses we're either going to stay here in Massachusetts or move to Texas depending on what schools accept him. 

The thing is though now that it's 2019 all these major changes are most likely going to happen in the Fall. Because of that I'm trying to look for jobs and internships (I want to work in animal care and management at an AZA accredited zoo) in MA and TX. Unfortunately every time I get into it my anxiety starts overwhelming me and just trying to look for jobs and internships and plan for the future makes me freak out and panic and then I panic even more because this isn't stuff I can keep procrastinating on. I hate it and end up getting mad and upset and anxious over the fact that I can't even do these simple tasks and try to prepare myself for the adult world.

I have no idea if any of this makes sense and I just am currently hating myself and this stupid condition I have. I never feel normal because of it...

tldr: my anxiety prevents me from making a clear cut plan for the near future and I hate it"
aeam4t,7,2019-01-09,Seeking advice: First week in and considering dropping some classes,ajcab819,OMSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSA/comments/aeam4t/seeking_advice_first_week_in_and_considering/,"Hi, everyone! I was hoping to get some advice on my situation as people have been very helpful in the past on this forum. I just started my first semester as a full-time OMSA student.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I did take up to Calculus 3 and Statistics in college and have work experience in Alteryx/Access/Tableau but I lack Python, R, and Linear Algebra. I left my job as an unhappy CPA in November 2018 to start this career switch. However, life happened and I only got to study up on Python and am learning very quickly that my course schedule as it stands is not possible with my current knowledge. Some people here have said I could learn math on the fly, but with already being a beginner on the programming side of things, lacking in math would (and already has) overwhelm me even more.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I've registered for CSE 6040, ISYE 6501, MGT 6203 (waived out of intro course), and MGT 6311 (Digital Marketing) with the hopes of completing all my coursework this year, leaving the practicum to Spring 2020. Because I'm still a beginner at Python, I'm strongly considering delaying ISYE 6501 and MGT 6203 to Summer 2019. This would leave me with CSE 6040 and MGT 6311 and time to take MOOCs on Linear Algebra, R, and brush up on statistics/calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that I really want to graduate by May 2020 since I can only really afford to not be working until then. I'm hoping to find an entry-level job or an internship wherein I can do my practicum, but if not, I would just do the project from GT.

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions in planning out my coursework with a May 2020 graduation date are:

* Is it possible to take 1-2 courses while doing the practicum?
* Should I try taking 4 courses in the Summer or 5 in the Fall?

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my planned course schedule is as follows (based on 2018 course schedules):

**Spring 2019**: CSE 6040, MGT 6311

**Summer 2019**: ISYE 6501, MGT 6203, CS 6400 (DB Systems)

**Fall 2019**: CSE 6242 (DVA), CSE 6250 (Big Data in Healthcare), CS 7641 (Machine Learning), ISYE 6644 (Simulation)

**Spring 2020**: Practicum, ISYE 6414 (Regression), 3rd A-track course

&amp;#x200B;

Best case scenario and what I'm hoping for is that I'll be employable as a Data Analyst or at least an intern after the Fall 2019 semester and then I could take one course per succeeding semester and do my practicum at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd greatly appreciate any advice you have to offer or any course suggestions, etc. Thanks so much!"

aec6bd,65,2019-01-09,That one time when I misused my DM powers,Holllens,rpghorrorstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/aec6bd/that_one_time_when_i_misused_my_dm_powers/,"Greetings mortals,(Sorry for my English, I am not a native speaker and I have dyslexia)

Long time lurker, first time poster.I don’t know if it really qualifies as a horror story, but it was in my opinion the blackest page (yet) of my DM notes. In the end, the players had a good story to tell, but I felt horrible and made a formal apology.

After my D&amp;D group abruptly disbanded I posted a request online and got a group together to play dungeons and dragons. I didn’t have any DM experience, but I loved the game so much that I had to keep playing it (an addict was born). Besides, I enjoyed telling stories, especially horror stories. So, I started writing and made a world where the players could play in: Faelonia was born. The players made their characters and we set a date to start. When the group came together I was amazed how good the group 'clicked' and how friendly they were. After we played a couple of sessions, we all felt a special connection and became good friends.

Story:The players were given an ‘introduction’ area to the world and did some minor quests. They escorted a man to a village, explored some tomb, gain some basic dnd experience (most players had zero D&amp;D experience) and accidentally killed a captured man (due to some unlucky rolls)(important to this story). But you know how it goes, basic things and it was time for the players to enter the ‘heavy plot’ areas of the sandbox world that I made for them. The campaign was designed to be a political adventure; to either join the current ruling king or trying to usurp his throne. Not sexual at all! However, some sexual remarks were made and well... things happened.

They were in a new town and stayed with an aunt of an npc who guided them through the beginning of the game. The aunt, a heavily build woman with more muscles than your average horse, was a couple of feat bigger than the players in the group with a low grumbling voice (she could have been the Viking king, if only she had a beard). But the woman was nice and had let them stay at her house for free, since they helped her niece. They explored the town and stumbled on a tavern with a good looking girl who sang there every night. The bard in the group fancied the girl and I did what all DMs should do with a bard who is hunting tail and let it play out. The bard in an attempt to show his moves, challenged the girl to a musical competition. Some unlucky rolls later, the bard had some 'performance' issues and couldn't show off his skills.

A couple of days later, the bard wanted a rematch with the girl. However, the girl had seen the bard’s skills and his 'performance' issue and was therefore not interested. So the bard decided to sing a song about a famous bard called Avicii who had recently died. I as DM was awestruck when the player at the table started to sing a 2 minute song and decided to reward the bard with what he wanted. The girl who he fancied, knowing the famous bard Avicii and being as awestruck as me got hit by the arrow of cupid and fell in love with the bard. After some 'fade to black' scenes, the girl asked the bard to come visit her at the tavern again and to bring her a gift that would show his affection towards the girl.

A couple of incidents later, the bard came in the possession of some manacle and decided that this would be his gift to her. I was quite annoyed by that statement, since the girl was a nice character who still had a roll to fulfil in the story, but the bard still decided that this item showed his affection best. It was at that point that I reformed the entire story just so I could mess with the bard. That day the bard went over to the girl who was happily waiting for him in her room. At the end of some ‘fade to black’ scenes the girl had trouble moving and thus asked the bard to deliver a letter to the post office nearby. The girl informed the bard that the letter was for her father who would come in a couple of days with her inheritance.I wrote the note myself and handed it to the player at the table.The bard, surprised with this request opened the letter as soon as he was outside. I can still remember his eyes growing big as he figured out who the father of the girl was. A couple of sessions back, they had to rescue this trader who had given up everything, packed up shop and asked the players to be escorted to the city the players were currently in. He got captured by some goblins and was hung upside down. The players following the tracks, came to his rescue. However, the bard’s arrow had missed its target and had hit the trader, who died on the spot. After, the party decided that a dead man doesn’t need money and looted his body. In short, the bard was sleeping with the daughter of a man he was assigned to protect but accidently killed and his party had looted her entire inheritance.

The bard had a hard time coping with this but that week’s session ended and the bard had some time to think about the situation. That next session the bard decided to tell the girl that he delivered the letter to the post office. So I asked him to roll a deception check, which he failed. The girl got suspicious by this and tried to push the subject. The bard, not wanting any of that tried to change topic, but the girl kept returning to the letter and then asked the bard if he knew her father. ‘no’ said the bard…. Deception check…. Crit fail. So I described how his face becomes red and that he says… ‘yes…. wait! No. NO I don’t know your father!’ the bard then decides to tell the girl everything and tries to bullshit his way out of the situation. Telling her that it all doesn’t matter because he loves her.

The girl was obviously upset and only said two words: 'get’ and ‘out'. It was a loud night, but even the people down in the common room could hear the yelling and the loud sounds of chairs and tables being thrown through the room. The bard got out untouched, but he wasn’t happy about the situation. I should have left it there, but I decided to continue and to misuse his bad luck of that evening. He came back to the place where the players had been staying and went to his room. Every player had been given a room and it was quite late.

I felt that I should teach the player in question a lesson to not mess with the stories characters and to teach him about karma. At this point, the twist was hilarious and I was still upset about the sudden change of the story... all beginner mistakes and here is where I failed as the DM:The heavily muscled aunt who saw him coming in knocked on his door and let herself in. The aunt had made some sexual remarks in the past and the players at the table where awfully aware that she was interested in the young men in her care. She told him that she also had a bad night and that they could comfort each other. She stood up locked the door and went into the bathroom. The bard player felt what was coming and quickly moved to the door. He tried the door, only to find it locked. Then he heard the aunt talking from the bathroom stating that he just had to patiently wait and that she was almost finished with the ‘preparations’. The bard grew anxious and tried to force the door. A couple of unlucky athletic checks later he decided to find another way out and tried to run to the other side of the room.At that moment the aunt came out of the bathroom, completely stripped with a strap on around her waist. The bard gave her one look, grasped a chair and threw it through the window. The aunt looked surprised, but tried to calm the player by stating that it would only hurt a ‘little’. After hearing that the bard jumped out the window. His room was pretty high up and he lost most of his hp due to falling dmg. The aunt, who thought of it as a game, jumped after the bard. She had a huge hp pool and didn’t care much for the falling dmg.

Most players at the table started to cringe and I knew I had gone too far. So I decided to salvage the situation by stating that the bard suddenly woke up and that it was just a dream. (Crisis averted right?) After that session, I got a couple of complaints from my players and decided to formally apologise. I now know that what I did was childish and I therefor made some rules for myself (including not using sexual assault in my stories). I just felt slightly angry and annoyed that this player messed up the story this much. Now a day, I don't mind if players mess up the story. I now have the experience to change the story on the spot.

Faelonia is still running, the bard unfortunately left the group for an internship in China. However, I still feel guilty to have put him through it and sometimes feel that he left the country because of this story. As a partaway gift I made his character the barron of the town. He now owns the tavern where the girl sings every night and they... sort of... lived happily ever after. "
aecc0w,31,2019-01-09,Portfolio Review,BIGBiRD710,UI_Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/UI_Design/comments/aecc0w/portfolio_review/,"Hello everyone. I'm fairly new to Reddit (and r/UI_Design). It would mean a lot to get some feedback on my most recent iteration of my personal website.

&amp;#x200B;

[http://www.michaelwatchmaker.com/](http://www.michaelwatchmaker.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Some things to note:

1. I have already noticed some problems in tablet view (will fix soon)
2. I am focused on UX and Product Design
3. This portfolio is mainly to showcase my work for internships I am applying to for this summer and beyond. i.e. I am not looking into freelance right now.
4. It would be great to get some feedback on both mobile and desktop.

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all critiques are welcome.

Enjoy!"
aece6a,1,2019-01-09,Might need to buy a car as a grad student,a_leprechaun,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/aece6a/might_need_to_buy_a_car_as_a_grad_student/,"I'm just about to start the 2nd of 4 semesters of my grad program (graduate May 2020), and after looking back at the year in review financially I realized my monthly spending on fuel and maintenance of my old Jeep is nearly the same as it would be to buy and finance a new vehicle, plus it is getting more and more unreliable with each passing day. My original plan was to hold on until graduation and a job to replace it but now I'm considering a more expedited replacement.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are all the details:

* Currently fuel and maintenance are costing me approximately $350/month on average. I could likely get $1000-$2000 in trade-in value from it today. I estimate a 10-25% chance that it will die completely before I graduate necessitating replacement and effectively no trade-in value.
* This summer I will work for approximately $700-$1500 per week resulting in a net income after expenses of somewhere between $0 and $4000.
* Upon graduating in 2020, I expect to make $80,000-$110,000 per year, with a signing bonus anywhere from $2-$15K, with about $120,000 in student loan debt (undergrad and grad combined) at about 8%.
* I currently have no short-term savings (other than my safety-net). The \~$10K I had saved up between undergrad and grad school went towards my first semester tuition. Other than my summer internship I will have no income until I graduate. But I also have no current debts other than student loans.
* With my credit, I would expect a 3.5-4% rate on any car loan.

Additionally, and I realize this might make me a choosing beggar, my car and driving are a big part of who I am and how much I enjoy day-to-day life. Therefore I'm not willing to part with my Jeep just for a beater car for the sake of saving $100 or so a month when I'd likely be selling it again in a year and a half. Because of that and other requirements (cargo space, fuel economy, reliability, etc.), the used cars I'm looking at are in the $10-$15K range ($155-$246/mo after trade in), and the new cars in the $20-$24K ($318-$409/mo after trade in) range. For all those, I'm estimating about $100 in fuel and maintenance costs. If I buy a used car, I'd likely replace it again within 2-3 years, while a new car I'd likely keep for 5-10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, here are the options I've laid out as I see them:

1. Drive the Jeep until graduating and replace it with a new car once employed or it dies (whichever comes sooner). Put the money from the internship towards tuition/expenses.
2. Drive the Jeep until the end of the summer (if it doesn't die) and replace it (with new or used) using the money from the internship plus trade-in value as the down payment and continue to finance school with loans.
3. Replace the Jeep (with new or used) prior to the summer while the trade-in value is assured, making a downpayment (with SL money) equal to my expected summer savings (which I should know within the next month or so), and then putting my internship money towards tuition next year."
aechly,10790,2019-01-09,"Power hungry president sucks the joy out of a local artist collective, ends up having to leave town.",SisterSist,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/aechly/power_hungry_president_sucks_the_joy_out_of_a/,"Posting from a throwaway. I heard all this second-hand as it was happening, so I'll try to be as faithful to the actual events as possible, with the caveat that I wasn't there. A warning and an apology: this is long.


For background, my older sister, who I'll call Beth, is married to her high school sweetheart, who I'll call Craig. Beth is a pretty laid-back person, but she has one hot button trigger that causes her to have zero chill: anyone treating her beloved Craig poorly. Craig is very quiet and kind, just in general a mild-mannered, good-natured guy who's not great at standing up for himself, so he often attracts bad actors who view him as an easy mark, and because he *always* assumes that other people have good intentions, he's not great at realizing when he's being mistreated. Beth is usually pretty relaxed about things, but she will basically turn into a howling, vengence-seeking banshee if anyone takes advantage of Craig.


Which brings us to ~2-3 years ago. Craig works a white collar job remotely, but he's an amateur artist/craftsman as a hobby. He does wood carving, a little bit of light metalwork, and 2-D art (mainly pencil sketches and pen-and-ink illustrations). He joined an artist's collective/makerspace where he could work on these hobbies around likeminded people, and he absolutely *loved* it. Whenever I hung out with him and Beth around this time, Craig would excitedly talk about the space and his projects there with infectious enthusiasm. His eyes were practically beaming out of his head whenever it came up. Beth joined too to learn/improve on her own hobby of fiber arts (mainly weaving and dyeing), but she was way less into it than Craig.


Some time after this, the president of the makerspace stepped down. It was essentially a volunteer position, though it came with a small (mostly symbolic) stipend. Since the makerspace had no actual staff, being president of the makerspace was a huge undertaking that involved being a one-man show for everything--for a start, coordinating with the board, keeping day-to-day operations going, and chasing the grants that kept the lights on. The current president just couldn't do it anymore with his full-time job, and announced his intention to vacate the role. Craig had come to love the makerspace, and he figured he had the resources to be an effective president. His job is entirely remote and deliverables-based (he can work whatever hours he wants as long as he's meeting his objectives), so he figured he could work out of the makerspace on his laptop and be available there if anyone needed him, and then do the heavy lifting of the role outside work hours. So he threw his hat in the ring.


Enter Jamie, a recent industrial design grad. Jamie was known to be flaky and *very* dramatic, but he'd been a member of the makerspace for a couple of years, almost as long as it had existed, and he felt entitled to be handed the presidency because he had seniority. He lost his damn mind when he heard that Craig had the audacity to go for the same role and complained to several members about how Craig was massively overstepping. This got back to Craig, who didn't really take it seriously, and it also got back to Beth, who, of course, was already irritated that Jamie was shit-stirring, but kept it to herself.


Long story short: Jamie won the member vote by a small margin, which Craig was very gracious about. Craig congratulated Jamie on the victory, then settled back into business as usual. Jamie... was not so gracious. He was enraged that Craig had gotten so many votes, and made it known to everyone that he was trying to figure out who had voted for Craig, and that they ""would pay."" Many of the members who had voted for Jamie passively because he'd been around forever and they didn't really know Craig were shocked by this behavior and started privately expressing regret to each other. But it gets worse. The makerspace had always offered members the perk of sponsoring workshops, meetups, and classes that anyone, members or non-members, could attend; all you had to do was sign up for the space on a first-come, first-served basis and kick up 20% of any profits to the makerspace if you charged a fee. Jamie started preemptively cancelling classes and workshops sponsored by anyone on his shit list by blocking off all available reservations during the regular times certain classes would be held. So Craig had traditionally sponsored a popular casting workshop on Wednesday evenings, and suddenly all Wednesday evenings were booked solid before the sign-up sheet was even available. He tried switching to Thursday, but after just one rescheduled workshop, suddenly Thursday evenings were out too. He tried Tuesdays, but because it was so early in the week, no one could come. Craig was bummed, but was still too good-natured to realize Jamie was intentionally sabotaging him out of spite, despite a righteously angry Beth trying to paint the picture for him of what was going on.


Beth. Was. Pissed. But she wasn't banshee pissed yet. Not until...Jamie selectively told the people on his shit list that member fees were going up. By almost double. He presented this as a makerspace-wide policy, but he made one crucial error. Somehow, Jamie never picked up on Craig and Beth being married, probably because he was never around both of them at the same time. So Beth flew under his radar, and he didn't raise her member fees, just Craig's and some of Craig's known friends, which confirmed to her that he was intentionally retaliating against Craig.


At this point, Beth had steam coming out of her ears and went to go talk to the board, since they have the power to cite or even throw out the president. They were uneasy about what she told them, but they said the president was technically allowed to set member fees, and they'd keep an eye on things. 


Beth didn't really believe the board that they'd be keeping an eye on things, because Jamie was already dropping the ball all over the place, and the board wasn't making a peep over it. He wanted to be president because of the prestige, but he was never willing to do the work, so he just--didn't do it, and things were falling apart. The makerspace was getting late notices on unpaid bills, basic maintenance of the space wasn't getting done, materials weren't being restocked as they ran out, and the record keeping was nonexistent. It got so bad that the previous president who had stepped down because he couldn't handle the time commitment anymore (who had run the makerspace from its inception) quit as a member altogether because he was so saddened and disgusted by how bad things had gotten. He'd put his blood, sweat, and tears into this place, and stepped down from a role he treasured because he believed it was in the best interest of the organization, and now he had to watch Jamie run this place he loved into the ground out of sheer laziness. Craig was also losing his excitement over the makerspace, because he no longer had the space or resources to do the things he enjoyed there. 


Beth, at this point, had gone from furiously angry to strategically angry. Suspecting that Jamie was being shady in more ways than one, she spent a few days being friendly to Jamie and sucking up to him, and then sprung on him the offer to help with the organization's bookkeeping and records. Still not realizing that she was Craig's wife, but knowing that she worked as a project manager in her day job, Jamie saw a chance to get some skilled work done at zero effort to himself, and he happily agreed, and gave her access to the makerspace's Google Sheets (not the most high-tech operation). For a little while, Beth bided her time, bringing the financial accounts up to date and continuing to be diabolically friendly to Jamie. 


After a while of this, she calmly pulled together six copies of documents comparing the official organizational income that Jamie was reporting to her with the *actual* income, which Jamie was completely unaware she was tracking. These documents proved that Jamie was not only skimming money off the top of class and workshop fees, but was actively stealing money from the grants the makerspace was receiving, which is highly illegal. Beth gave the six board members her impeccably compiled proof of what was happening.


Almost immediately, the board ""fired"" Jamie and issued a lifetime ban from the makerspace. They were afraid of losing their grants if news came out about the gross misappropriation, so they didn't report Jamie to the authorities, but instead gave him 48 hours to return the stolen funds, the implication being that they *would* report him if he didn't. He panicked and complied, selling his car quickly to do it and scrounging up the difference in a ton of quick loans from friends, many of whom were makerspace members not aware of what was going on (no, he never paid them back). He's now persona non grata with all of his former friends, and while he still has a clean criminal record, word traveled pretty far in the local artist community, which means he was black listed from most of the industrial design jobs in the area and couldn't use his degree if he wanted to stay in town. As far as Beth and Craig knew, he moved away about six months after all this went down, but they haven't kept up with him, and don't know where he is.


The makerspace board realized their setup was bad, so instead of a single president, they restructured to have a panel of volunteer officers running the operation. Craig is one of them, and has happily thrown himself back into wood working and metal casting. Beth still helps out with the books.


TL;DR: Power hungry industrial designer tries to sabotage my brother-in-law's hobby; gets his life destroyed by my protective sister, who reveals that he's embezzling.

EDIT: OK, so revisiting these events in this post got me curious about Jamie, so I did some internet sleuthing to see where he is now. He lives in Austin, and he's still working in the food service industry, for the same chain he worked at throughout college. Based on the info I've been able to find, it looks like, aside from an unpaid internship he did right before he took over the makerspace, he's never worked a job that used his degree. So there's that.

EDIT 2: Forgot to say: thanks for the Reddit gold! Very unnecessary, but a kind gesture nonetheless."

I'm staffed in a project as an intern into an area that is above my technical skills. The good thing is i have a decent foudnation in the networking basics and so I don't think it should be impossibel for me to get up to scratch on what I need to know to be able to contribute as much as possible to the current project that I am on.

I will be here for 4 weeks.

What I need to improve my understanding is on:

* Out of band management systems, including architceture and design (spine/leaf - CLOS)

* Being able to architect these out of band management systems including understanding of protocols such as STP, VXLAN, overlay/underlay,  MLAG, etc.

My current knowledge:

* Programming / scripting

* Minor AWS stuff (EC2,VPCs, security groups, monitoring/logging etc)

* Networking bascis: DHCP, routers, OSI model, common protocols, etc

I'm probably gonna be posting alot on this sub alot so happy to gild resposnes that are helpful. If anyone is interested in potentially tutoring me (I'll pay per half hour) or providing a quick QA/crash course I'd also consider that, too.

Thanks!"

I was wondering, how does one go about getting an internship without having much knowledge of C++? 

I only know what they teach in class but I doubt thats what they'd want in an intern. I still have a lot to learn.

I ask this because I want to apply for internships but have nothing to put besides the skills I've obtained in recent classes which have been about 3 classes only. "

To be honest, I am very blessed because my school and internship have edit bays available for editing, as well as video and audio equipment to check out. I also edit my own videos reviewing older video games for the most part. 

Seeing as I am about to leave college, I really want to start freelancing as a videographer soon, but before I can even consider what equipment to buy, I really need a desktop computer for all my editing purposes. As one would expect, premiere Pro is abysmal on my laptop. 

While I do enjoy video games, I am not much of a PC gamer. I would like to be able to run emulators and do some screencaptures, but for the most part, I get most of footage off the console and review mostly retro/older titles. If I can find a build that modestly run some video games that would be cool, but I am primarily focused on editing. I would like to be able to at least work with 4k footage, but above all, I want to work with 1080p footage without annoyance. My budget is about 600-800. I believe I have a  mouse and keyboard. Perhaps this sounds silly, but I have some smaller HD televisions that I wouldn't mind using as a monitor. I also have a Windows preference."
aedd21,42,2019-01-09,"Last week, I was at a mental all time low because I’m struggling to find a job after graduation and yesterday, my manager called me.",toospicynoodles,povertyfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/aedd21/last_week_i_was_at_a_mental_all_time_low_because/,"Sorry in advance but this is kinda long! 

I work at a local, but well known local restaurant chain in my city. They have three locations and then there’s HQ where the administrative and other important work is done. 

I’ve been working here since July and my position is essentially a food runner which sucks because I would make at the minimum, make $19 in tips while working 5 hours or at the most, make $160 which hasn’t happened in a long while. For the past four months, my location has been overstaffed so there’s no room for me promoting to server. My time there has also been half miserable because my ex-manager was downright awful to me my whole time (her last day was the 5th and she asked my coworker to “take my shift that day because she didn’t want to spend her last day working with me” is the best to summarize her). Alongside that, one of our bar managers is awful and has been reprimanded multiple times to the point where she cries because she doesn’t understand why people keep reporting her for her bitchiness. So yeah, interesting job. 

I’ve stayed because it has worked with my schedule as a college student and doing an internship this fall. They’ve been super accommodating for classes and a lot of my coworkers are really nice and fun people. My other managers are the same case and I look forward to working with them. However, this time of year blows for everyone on service and has especially hit me hard. 

Luckily my boyfriend of three years makes enough for us to scrape by as a server. 

I graduated college this December and currently have struggled for applying to jobs and programs because most of them ask for my unofficial transcript which I can’t access due to a financial hold on my account due to my fall semester tuition bill. Unfortunately, I cannot pay off this debt within the next few months which leaves me in a rut. 

Yesterday, my manager (who is underneath being a co-owner but above being the general manager and is very involved at all locations. So I guess regional manager???) called me and proposed two ideas. Let’s call him Rick. 

The first one was considering working at the HQ part time or full time in the office which would be a considerable bump in pay. I’d be doing administrative work along with the possibility of working on their social media if I want to. I’d get to work with Rick and the co-owner more who are super fun people who say “Isn’t TooSpicyNoodles an awesome person?” to my coworkers or other managers. 

When this position opened up, he immediately thought of me because he thinks I’d be a great fit at HQ. Which is wild because throughout our restaurants, Rick is known as the strict and terrifying manager due to his eye to detail and the fact that he’s been working in service since he was 15 and is a certified sommelier/our wine director who cares deeply about the restaurants. Not that it matters but I’ve been told to tone down my candor with him because it “doesn’t seem professional” for me to talk about non-work things (which I can’t help! I love finding common ground and talking about it). I guess being myself really helps. 
I’d also get a house account and be able to eat for free with a monthly limit. 

The second is promote to being a server since there will be room now! And if I want to, I can work part time at HQ, say from 10 to 2pm, and be a server from 4-10pm. I was told to pick whatever I want and that if I change my mind, I can.

This is really great to hear because I’ve been feeling under appreciated at my job due to my ex manager and knowing that Rick thought of me being qualified really boosts my self-esteem which has been really down due to almost everything in my life sucking from factors outside of my control. 

I talk to the co-owner this Friday about my interest in the administrative position and I’m really excited because he also thinks highly of me (he can also be known as incredibly blunt). My resume makes me more than qualified for this position so I also have that on my side. 

Nothing is guaranteed obviously but I’m really happy right now. I also went to therapy for the first time today because I had enough for the sliding scale cost for a session. 

TLDR: Depressed because life after college isn’t going too well and I’m stuck working in service. My manager asked me if I’d like to work in our restaurant HQ, with a substantial pay increase.

aeds0o,65,2019-01-09,Creepy Green Van,pbandbsandwich,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/aeds0o/creepy_green_van/,"This happened during the first semester of my sophomore year in college. I was walking back from a lock-in-retreat with an organization I’m in when everything occurred. 

The lock-in was being held at a church less than a mile from my apartment, so I asked my boyfriend if he could give me a ride so I wouldn’t have to pay for parking as my group met on campus originally two hours before the event and then drove as a group to the church. The event lasted until 7am but I received permission to leave early as I had an internship to be at at around 6:30am. My internship was in a city that was about an hour and a half away from where I go to college, so I left the church at about 4:15am so I could get back and not feel rushed while getting ready. 

I had planned on calling an Uber or something to drive me back to my apartment since it was still dark out and it was really cold outside. I was having issues with my phone connecting to anything or getting signal so I couldn’t call anyone to pick me up and a lot of people were asleep so I decided I could just run to my apartment and be ok (stupid I know, but I figured since I only lived less than a mile away nothing would happen.)

I wrapped myself in my sleeping bag because it was freezing out as I only had a light jacket on because a cold front came in. I left the church and was walking back to my apartment and decided to cut through a really well lit public garage because if I went to my left there was the bar district that was a really roundabout way to get to my place and to my right was a dark road and all the street lamps were off. 

I started getting this weird feeling like I was being watched. I approached the garage and I see this dark green van just sitting there in a spot, idling. I don’t know how to explain the feeling that came over me, but something told me in the back of my head to not pass the van. By this time I was at the entrance of the garage and I guess the person in the van saw me, so the van started backing out of the spot. I immediately turned around and I ran. I went to the left of the garage toward the bar district and figured my best bet would be to get off the sidewalk and hide behind a pillar to the side of the garage. 

I was crouching behind the pillar when the dark green van pulls up to the outside of the parking garage and a man gets out and starts whistling. I will never forget that whistling. From the spot I was hiding I could vaguely see him walk out into the street and (maybe?) look to see where I ran. When he turned around to get back into the car, I booked it. I ran so fast to the bar district that I can still remember how hard my heart was racing.

I ran out of energy and decided to start walking. I passed a bar that looked like it was closing up but it had been a little bit since I had seen the van and I was in a well lit area. I was starting to think maybe I was overreacting and that I just had a hyperactive imagination. I still couldn’t shake the feeling I had prior when I first saw the van. 

I was passing an apartment complex when I hear a car turn on the street. It’s 4:30am in a college town so everyone is either passed out drunk or sleeping, so I turned around to look. I see the green van turn onto the street I’m on and is following me. It starts accelerating when it sees me(I’m still wrapped in my sleeping bag which is a bright green color btw so I’m not hard to miss). I’m freaking out inside but my brain just tells me to walk calmly to the apartment complex I was right by and act like I was pulling a key out as if I lived there to get into the gated area.  The van is closer now and is starting to slow down when it reaches the area in front of the apartment. I’m so close to the gate and I’m hoping the person won’t call me on my bluff as this wasn’t my apartment and I had no way to get in if they decided to come after me. 

They slowed down to almost a stop and at this time my hand is on the handle of the key access gate and then the van just peels out and drives away, exiting onto a major street and out of sight. I didn’t know if they would be back and I didn’t want to take my chances again with someone else, so I ran back to the bar that I saw  was closing. I just started bawling and briefly explained my situation, asking if someone could walk with me to my apartment. A guy volunteers and walks me home. 

I got ready for my internship and am a little early so I decide to drive to the area and see if I can spot the van again and maybe get it’s plates. I was too terrified before that I didn’t think to look for any type of identifying information other than “get the hell out of there”. I found nothing and decided to leave so I wouldn’t be late. I did call the police on the non emergency number and they said they would send someone out to check the area.

Later that day, I found out there had been a female around my age that was attacked in the same area about an hour and a half after I was there. The guy had tried to force himself on her but luckily a Good Samaritan was close enough to realize what was happening and intervene. I’m not sure if it was the same person but I really hope the other girl is ok and maybe if I had been more proactive with detailing the van to the police I could I have prevented that from happening to her.

So guy with the dark green van. Lets not meet.

Fine.

Now that is out of the way - let’s ask the real questions:

1.) Who play tests any of these recent DLCs? 

As a community, people have been pretty vocal about account based unlocks. 

Who played this DLC and said... 

“Man! That flight simulator of flying to Ada is awesome. I wish I could do that on all three of my characters?” 

Literally no one.

Ok, moving on.

2.) Who rolled through this DLC, got to this puzzle and said... “Great mechanic!!” 

Literally no sane person would.

Love the game.

Love Bungie.

Stop with the excusing of just bad Q&amp;A/Q&amp;C folks - this is just lazy, blatant stuff and they shouldn’t continue to get a pass. 

Bugs are fine. Fix them.

Risks, gambles and failures are fine. Learn from them.

This stuff is so overtly, frustratingly obvious  (and not new nor unique) that you shouldn’t just be passing out “it’s ok!” - that mindset and a true lack of accountability and realizing that literally one college intern, jacked up on a 24 pack of Red Bull could point out to you.

Stop excusing bad behavior...

Posting because I genuinely need to get all of this off my chest and don't really have anyone to talk to it about.

Basically, I feel like I have been numb, almost oblivious to how fucked up life has been for me for a while. Hoping this may be a bit therapeutic. I think the easiest way to lay it all out is chronologically:

* Summer 2017-November 2017: began working at as an intern during the summer at the business where I now work full-time. It was honestly a very, very fun summer. Although the work was hard, I made good friendships and had a lot of fun experience as the business ""wined &amp; dined"" us to impress us. However, I (very, very stupidly) began sleeping with a married co-worker who was a superior (though not a direct supervisor). It started off with a very drunk night after he &amp; I bonded on a very deep level about some personal life similarities. I was told at the time that he and his wife were separated &amp; in the beginning stages of a divorce. This is not an excuse. It should not have happened. But it did. It was supposed to be fun but turned into something serious. He told me he loved me. I told him the same. I don't know if he meant it. I don't know if I meant it. It doesn't matter one way or the other. It never should have happened. Or, if it did, it should have been a summer fling. But the relationship did not end after the summer. We continued seeing each other for months...He talked about his divorce as though it was a sure thing. I know I probably will not get much sympathy for this (and I shouldn't) but it was a genuine connection and we both got wrapped up in our emotions. However, in about October, he ghosted me out of the blue. We talked almost every day and suddenly he blocked my number. It hurt. But I also knew it was for the best. Then, he showed back up a couple weeks later drunk at my apartment in the middle of the night. We slept together again and he explained why he had done what he did, apologized, and told me he wouldn't do it again. But then, a week later, I was blocked again. I took this as a good thing and decided it should have happened a long time ago. I decided to severe all ties and move on from this stupid decision of mine.

* December 2017: was in grad school and preparing for finals when my dad had to have emergency open heart surgery. Luckily, everything went fine and he survived. But there was a very real possibility that my dad was going to die, and it shook me. We found out he has congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and some other issues. The reality of my dad's continuing health problems is just beyond words. I cannot express the heartbreak of watching a parent's health decline. Living 4 hours away does not make this easier. Knowing my parents' lack of financial planning (in the event that something should happen to my dad) is terrifying. I don't know what to do to help them. 

* January 2018- around the same time, while I was home with family for the holidays, I found out I was pregnant- very unexpectedly. Of course, the father was the co-worker who had ghosted me. I knew immediately without hesitation what I needed/wanted to do. There was never an option for me. I reached out to him and was able to get in contact with him and told him. He was extremely supportive; he immediately said he would support me no matter what decision I made. He did not in any way push me one way or the other. Needless to say this was a very difficult time for both of us. I had the abortion the beginning of January. He was there for me and he tried to check in on me often in the weeks to follow. But I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't want to talk to him. I did not see the point in talking about it- it seemed like a very common sense, easy decision to me. I decided that this was the wake-up call I had been needing to end this once and for all. I focused instead on the end of my time at school.

* Summer 2018- started work at company. I love my job for the most part. It is challenging but I am passionate about it. But, I guess it came as somewhat of a surprise how vastly different every day life at the business was from the internship experience. Co-worker and I had put the past behind us by this pint and were friendly. We rarely had to see each other at work, but it was fine. Then, I find out one night while we were out drinking with colleagues that his wife... is pregnant. Yep, pregnant! Last I had heard, they were separated and preparing for a divorce. Clearly that was not entirely accurate. It came as a shock, but I genuinely decided to be happy for him. And I truly and genuinely AM happy for them and wish them the best. I hope they have worked passed their problems. I hope that he will get his act together and that fatherhood will change him. In fact, this is exactly what I needed to end any potential drunken hookup etc. with him in the future. After finding this out and some very difficult talks with him about it all, there was a period of time when we were actually very close friends and would hang out. He would come over to my place and we would hang out like old times, except completely platonically. It was fine until suddenly the time came where he would show up, unannounced, drunk late at night or early in the morning asking to stay with me. Telling me he loved me and missed me. Trying to rekindle the physical aspect. I never caved on the physical aspect. I think we both realized that the friendship could not be given the circumstances. We have since stopped hanging out, but are friendly at work and will speak on occasion. It is admittedly different and uncomfortable at times. 

* October 2018 - Mom was diagnosed c diff. She was very sick for a while and is not sure yet that she is entirely over it. 

* Thanksgiving 2018- death of a close cousin. Unexpectedly- complete freak accident.

* December 2018- my dad was back in the hospital for two weeks due to heart complications. No surgery this time, but another reminder of his severe health issues. Another reminder that my parents have not planned for their financial future-- no savings (small business owners who did not graduate high school &amp; who have always lived paycheck to paycheck), no life insurance, no real plan. This makes me feel immensely guilty as I, fresh out of grad school, make more than they have ever made. Unfortunately, I have bills/debts of my own so it isn't feasible for me to help them at this time. I am an only child, and I now live 4 hours+ away. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I will do when something does happen to one/both of them...


I know I brought a lot of this on myself. I know that I should not expect sympathy for my actions, and I truly DON'T. I did a horrible thing. I made idiotic decisions. But I will NEVER make them again. I live with my many regrets every single day. I think I have been in a dark place for a while now without realizing it. Idk. No real purpose in writing this. Just thought it might help to get it off my chest. "

&amp;#x200B;

The event was supposed to have went smooth and without any problems, however, that obviously did not go as planned. The banquet was for charity and all sort of professionals were on the guest list. But, damn, they were anything but. They were every negative trait under the sun: vulgar, gross, violent, and lewd. I do not recall any of their names or faces because I blocked it all. So, I started writing in the journal to bring the memories back. It is supposedly ""theraputic"".

&amp;#x200B;

That's what the men in the little white coats told me, especially Dr. Thomas, if I ""write it down you will be able to come back to reality"". In all honesty, I think he wants me to supress more than the others. I am glad I am not catatonic or mute anymore but I think ignoring the event isn't going to help me process. Also, labelling my expierence as a psychotic break is a pitfall, too.

&amp;#x200B;

How is it a psychotic break if there was witnesses? Like my boyfriend and friend? Why do they want to so quickly just say I am insane instead of investigating? 100 people dead is not insanity. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, let me tell ya something, I would rather be insane than be driven insane.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I didn't know I would become crazy after the event I saw. And I'm talking about cat shit crazy. I am paranoid, hostile, and a complete threat to society. Well, if the fucking floaters didn't look like humans, I wouldn't have thought every person I met was one of them. I shouldn't have attacked the girl with the eating disorder in the ""hospital"" but her bony skeleton reminded me of their distorted bodies and I lost all temporary logic. Dr. Thomas, after placing me in the soft room, said

&amp;#x200B;

""The medication is not strong enough. We might have to put you in a nice jacket so you do not harm anyone else.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Fuck you, you damn quack!"" I wanted to tell him, ""Its a straight jacket. I may be fucked up mentally but Im not an idiot!""

&amp;#x200B;

Excuse my language journal. I lost all good manners and proper communication skills when I went mute. The event has turned me from an 18 year old female into a pissed off old man who is short a few crayons and won't take any of Crayola's HR bullshit.

The morning of the event was like any other. I woke up, checked my snap streak(dumbest shit ever now that I am off grid), took a shower, ate some breakfast, and got dressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Hold on, that's not exactly right

&amp;#x200B;

I ate breakfast and then I fed my dog, Papa, whom is the most adorable Jack Russell Terrier that ever walked the face of the Earth. Now, I remember I fed him earlier than normal because he was coming to the event with me. Pets were allowed which I found awesome but slightly strange. But, I can not believe I forgot my little furry savior! I will explain later of how he saved us.

&amp;#x200B;

As I got dressed I called my boyfriend, Seth, to make sure of the time. The banquet was being catered by his mother and we both agreed to help out. I don't think his mom had a clue about what the guests really were but water under the bridge. I don't blame her for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My memory becomes spotty after this. It begins properly working as I am unloading the van with Seth and his nerdy childhood friend....um....we will call him Bob because I can not remember his name. We asked Bob to help out at the wet bar since he was twenty one and is the legal age to serve alcoholic beverages in our state. I remember thinking it was a mistake because he was barely strong enough to lift the crate of beer bottles out of the back. Silly thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

The banquet hall was beautifully decorated with white tablecloths, a mesh canopy engulfing the ceiling, bouquet centerpieces, long elegant tables, and a swan ice sculpture next to a five-tier chocolate fountain. It was extravagent and could comfortably seat 150 people. Sadly, only fifty people really needed the chairs.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, Rachel, can you help me carry in the buffet trays?"" I heard Seth saying from the coat room across from the restrooms.

&amp;#x200B;

""Of course!"" I respond back to my highschool sweetheart with unbridled enthusiasm.

&amp;#x200B;

I will take the time to reflect upon our backstory as filler. Seth and I were considered the power couple of our high school alumni. He was the star athlete of the varisty football team and I was a cheerleader who was super peppy, pretty, and popular. I used to believe our relationship was meant to last. Full of dates, amusement parks, and maybe a white picket fence in the future but, alas, all good things must come to an end. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you writing in the journal, Rachel?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Who in the hell? Oh yeah! Dr. Thomas was escorting me home from the asylum   since my mom was at a neurosurgery facility instructing new interns. I glanced up from the pages to meet his eyes in the rearview mirror and I simply nodded in affirmation. 

&amp;#x200B;

""That is good to hear. Did you know the human mind is like a puzzle?"" I guess he got antsy from driving in silence with a lunatic. His right hand gripped the steering wheel, the ugly silver band on his finger twinkled in the sunlight-

&amp;#x200B;

A silver band with markings drenched in blood on the wooden floor of the hall. 

&amp;#x200B;

""-crazy, isn't it?"" Dr. Thomas was carrying on in the front as I had a flashback and I missed every word that dropped from his tongue

&amp;#x200B;

""Hmmm?"" I quipped 

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, you disassociated again?"" A demented snicker came from his throat, ""I noticed you admiring my ring. I recieved it when I graduated with highest honors from Princeton. The last time I was on campus was ten years ago. I can not fathom how much time has passed since then. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, that's crazy, you pompous ninny.

&amp;#x200B;

Why did I have a flashback after seeing the ring?"
aef2v1,8,2019-01-09,Frustrated by my girlfriend's negativity and lack of drive,stargazer92,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/aef2v1/frustrated_by_my_girlfriends_negativity_and_lack/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for eight months and I can honestly say I never thought I could feel so happy with someone. However, in the last two months I've started to notice some habits she has that are really starting to frustrate me, and I want to get some advice from you guys before I initiate a significant conversation about it. 

It's a combination of complaining about a lot of stuff while not doing much or anything to fix it. I am a fairly positive person who actively works on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and way of approaching my problems, and am quite driven when I want to achieve or fix something. My gf is much more laid-back (which is totally fine) but often complains about the same things over and over or finds a way to keep complaining, regardless of whether I listen and support her or suggest ways we can work on some of those things together. 

**I want to let her know that I find it very hard to be supportive when I don't see her taking steps to address the things she's complaining about, and I don't know how to help her anymore. I'm happy to just listen to her vent or help her find solutions or whatever she needs, but I can't do that well if everything is just ranting or negative comments because I'm starting to get frustrated and exhausted. I don't think she realizes the toll it takes on me to constantly reassure her or provide suggestions, especially when it's the same problems over and over again. She doesn't have very high self-confidence and I want to approach this in a way that doesn't make her feel awful.** 

She is a kind, loving, genuine, and intelligent woman and I love her to pieces. In most aspects of her life she has a good head on her shoulders, and can be driven and productive when she wants to be. She gives back to the community in ways that inspire me. I'm just starting to doubt that we are compatible ambition/attitude-wise and that scares the shit out of me. We have very open communication but I haven't brought this up before because it only started to become a problem recently **Am I being unreasonable or nit-picky and expecting her to be something she's not?** Any advice would be great :) 

&amp;#x200B;

You could stop reading now but here are some examples of what's been going on:

\- She has a myriad of minor but still somewhat concerning health issues, but she hasn't gone to get bloodwork done or see a doctor to help explain or treat these things. They affect her most days of the week, and most days she complains to me about them or muses about their potential cause. 

\- She is nervous about the internship she just started and for the last two months she's been stressing to me about how she's afraid of being incompetent, that it won't be interesting and she won't like it, that it will be too hard, etc. I totally understand the fear of messing up, but she hasn't mentioned once that maybe it will at least be a good learning experience, or she'll make good contacts or something.  

\- I wanted to support her through the application process and wrote the majority of her cover letter while she helped, but I got so fed up when anything I suggested was met with, ""This is hard. I don't know what my strengths are"" (but then with some prompting from me she could come up with some good stuff), or, ""ugh so I finished one letter but now I have to do a different one for each company?"". She procrastinated the whole process but stressed about it the whole time, and I felt it was on me to nag her to do some work on it while she wanted to cuddle or read instead. 

\- She frequently mentions how easy she wishes things were, like becoming really fit and muscly, or good at speaking English, or good at saving money. We've worked out together a few times and she liked it a lot, but it was always with me initiating. We practice her English together by reading books aloud to each other, but only if I suggest it and provide lots of encouragement. I've mentioned I can show her how to make a budget and she downloaded a money tracking app but doesn't use it. 

**TLDR;** my gf and I have very different ways of approaching and working on problems. She can be very negative and frequently complains about the same things without taking steps to fix them. I'm exhausted from having to constantly reassure her or help come up with solutions, and am looking for a productive way to have a conversation that shows I want to support her but I also need to see her do some work on her own.

I recently finished up post-grad schooling and have a fair amount of debt so I am trying to save up some money. And she was recently on a series of internships at various locations so she had moved out of her apartment and back home.

Only thing is, our sex life has come to a complete standstill. I should point out she is a virgin (I am not) and she wants to wait until marriage. I have always been aware of this and it has never been an issue and that part doesn't bother me one bit. I have always enjoyed everything else we do and the intimacy we had. But now we will go weeks or even months without fooling around, making out, or anything. What really sucks is it doesn't seem to bother her nearly as much as it does me. I will try to flirt with her when we are texting or do something to keep the chemistry alive but it always goes nowhere. And if by some miracle we do get alone time I am always the one who has to make the move or initiate things (and a few of those she hasn't felt up to it). I get that it isn't always great timing or she may not happen to be in the mood, but it's so rare we get alone time that if an opportunity opens up it is 100% on my mind and I'm trying to make something happen. 

I love my fiancée dearly, and every other part of our relationship is great. But our current sex life is miserable for me. I don't really feel like we have much intimacy and I feel like I am always the one having to bring it up if anything is going to happen. It just sucks that she doesn't feel the same way, or doesn't seem to be bothered by any of this. I've brought this up on a few occasions with her but nothing really seems to change. So I have started feeling like a broken record talking about it. I know our circumstances are what they are, but it would be nice to see signs that things will change or improve when we move in together. 

I guess I just don't really know what to do. I love her dearly and am otherwise extremely happy with our relationship. But I also don't want to be ""that person"" who goes into a marriage already dissatisfied with how something is in the relationship and magically expecting it to change.

aefbeo,6,2019-01-09,Why limiting access doesn't work,pickyourselfupagain,pornfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/aefbeo/why_limiting_access_doesnt_work/,"For a while I thought the solution was simple, just block access to porn and then no more porn right? If only it was that easy. While I was actually able to set the restrictions on my phone to not allow nsfw content (and change the password enough times that I actually forgot it), tackling the laptop which I use for casual browsing, my job, my internship, and schoolwork, is another beast altogether. I tried multiple extensions for chrome, and tried going into the registry to change my internet options manually, but all those changes were very easily undone, and many porn blockers blocked other websites that I wanted to use (comedy sites and certain news outlets) too.

I've now realized that it is not about limiting access. Sure breaking the connection to the source might be fine for a temporary fix, but I want to change my desire at the root. Not to mention if I block conventional means of getting porn I might in my desperation turn to more shady/risky methods to feed my addiction, which I have done in the past. 

In order for this change to be significant and last it has to be done without restrictions. I am happy to say that I am just wrapping up day one without porn. Today I spent a bit of time in the morning examining why I turned to porn in the first place: rebellion, loneliness, boredom; and tried to address those things internally. I have a good family, and a wonderful gf, and a decent job, and great friends. I will not allow my anxiety and my demons to turn me towards something as shallow as porn to undermine these things. "

The test involves mapping texture to a pattern (which seems pretty simple) and changing the color in an image. There's just two problems with this: 1) I'm still a beginner and 2) I currently can't afford Illustrator right now. Using the computers at my college, the most I've been able to accomplish is mapping the texture, but recoloring is giving me a hard time. I followed some tutorials on youtube but their explanations are working on the assumption that it's a color image.

Do I need to add color to the image first? Should I turn the image into a vector or something? What do you guys think?"

Can you honestly say it was worth it?


I realize no here really is passionate about waking up and working as an accountant, tax, audit, financial analyst...etc (if you are passionate, where did it arise from??). I've been there myself, but in a four month internship in industry and still questioned whether this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. There are computer science majors out there creating and developing new things, scientists researching new things, but for some reason, I always come back to the questions, will it be worth it taking this route as my career? Every since Christmas break, I've been really stressed over what I want to do in my life, because I really don't and it scares me. I'm a year from graduating with so many opportunities for me, and I feel like one bad choice will put in a tough spot ( I saw it happen to my brother 10 years back when he was a new grad looking for full time during the recession, and to my sister who got a science degree and still gets yelled at by our parents for not majoring into something that makes more money smfh...). So yeah, just things that have kept me up at night lately. :/"

I have a quick question before I go more into details. I've been looking for an entry level job in Europe (I live in France) and today I find this job opening from Halliburton for an
""Entry Level Material Conditioner"" position,  the description says ""Performs operations designed to change the physical properties of a wide range of materials - Operates and maintains equipment such as heat treat furnaces, hydraulic presses, various spray painting equipment, and plating baths. Proficient in the use of precision measuring instruments"" etc..

I get the general idea but do any of you know more about this job? I never saw it mentioned in any Oil field or Offshore job list. Is it similar to a Fiel Materials Coordinator except a bit more physical? Depending on what it is I'll apply to it since It does say ""entry level"".

So 3 years ago, I did some research about the jobs in the O&amp;G industry and now I've been looking for an opportunity to get into the industry. I'm a lurker here since last October and I've been spending my time using the search bar, reading post and compiling infos in my notepad and It was very pleasant.

In the past few months I've been checking Indeed and Rigzone regularly for an entry level job as a Roustabout, but fail to find any in my zone that doesn't require experience. I feel stuck, like I miss something and could do more.

On a positive note, I have a few contacts who will try to introduce me to someone they know is working offshore, they potentially could provide me with infos or if I'm lucky, even recommend me for an entry level job; But I have no guarantee they'll reach back to me. So meanwhile I'm trying... 
I don't have any qualification and this industry and the jobs it provide is really the thing I need to get my life back after the shit I went through in the last decade so I'm very determined. 

There is plenty of job opening in the US. I could move pretty much anywhere if logistic allow it (cheap flight ticket, cheap housing etc..) I can get a visa, book a flight and move right now, but that's the only thing I can do with the limited money I have. I don't have any guarantee of working when I get there or getting any housing, plus I don't have a driver licence. I know some company provide internship but have no idea how to find and reach them, I don't know what to do past checking Indeed/Rigzone and praying to be lucky after sending my CV. I'll gladly appreciate any advise or encouragement from you guys on how else I can approach this and widen my search. "

aeiblj,210,2019-01-10,"The Story Of Robin's Intern and the SiriusXM Class Action Lawsuit: ""I Was Injured Getting Howard His Fruit Salad...""",cormano,howardstern,https://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/aeiblj/the_story_of_robins_intern_and_the_siriusxm_class/,"*Hello, Hello. Here's an original rundown of the SiriusXM class action lawsuit circa 2014-2015. If you've enjoyed this, check out my previous behind the scene write ups on the bottom. Thanks.*

On April 24, 2014, Leeds Brown Law, P.C. and Virginia &amp; Ambinder, LLP [filed a class action complaint against SiriusXM on behalf of Melissa Tierney](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/siriusxm.pdf), a SiriusXM intern. In their filing, the firm is proposing a class action lawsuit against the broadcasting company. They argue that SiriusXM has been wrongfully classifying their interns as exempt from minimum wage, when in fact, the students were essentially unpaid employees completing tasks that SiriusXM would have to pay any individual under New York labor laws. Jeffrey K. Brown of Leeds Brown Law, P.C [talked about the filing on the firms website](http://www.internshiprights.com/sirius-xm-radio/). “Far too often, hard working individuals like Melissa take these internships under the belief that it will advance their careers and provide them with educational experiences… However, they get stuck running errands, grabbing breakfast orders, and standing by the copier for no wages, then get no job offer at the end. The only benefit in that situation is for the company that gets free labor.”

“… [Melissa Tierney was employed by the defendants \(SiriusXM\) from approximately August 2011 until December 2011 as an unpaid intern for The Howard Stern Show...](https://i.imgur.com/C6vr2DM.jpg)” according to the complaint. **Before removing her experience from her LinkedIn profile, Melissa listed herself as intern to Ms. Robin Quivers**. Her roles at SiriusXM included “running errands, placing orders, obtaining breakfast orders, delivering food items to on air personality and office staff, reviewing news clips, reporting to on air personalities, compiling data, and obtaining signatures from guests, along with other tasks necessary to the maintenance of Defendants’ operations.” Melissa “… typically worked four days a week, approximately six to nine hours each day.” Although, it was not uncommon for SiriusXM to require that Tierney work more than 40 hours a week without compensation. The complaint states that SiriusXM did not provide academic or vocational training to Tierney or other members of the lawsuit.

Interns were a large part of the company operation. During your average semester, approximately 50 unpaid interns worked inside the SiriusXM Manhattan offices. [During a Newsweek investigation](https://www.newsweek.com/sirius-xms-unpaid-intern-problem-304985), many interns told the same story about promises of paid jobs after their semester concluded. “I was told a number of times that I would be a job prospect there, that I would be more viable in getting hired.” said a programming intern who wished to remain anonymous. At one point, the intern records a conversation with a staffer where a promise of a job is made. He was let go immediately after the end of the semester.  Another, who worked for Judith Regan, was under the impression that her sacrifice would lead to an entry level job. “They led me to believe that that was the direction I was headed to.… I was just shocked when the internship ended, and they didn't want me to come back.”

Tierney described her experience in the law firms press release. **“The only thing I learned when I worked for Sirius XM was what and when Howard and Robin wanted their breakfast and snacks… Howard likes to have specific food at a specific time and from specific restaurants. It was not exactly an educational experience learning how to succeed in radio… My mom says it all the time: ‘I can’t believe I paid college tuition for you to get Howard Stern’s breakfast every morning for a semester and you didn’t get paid a dime,’”.** She continued, “I feel like I was taken advantage of because I wanted to work in the radio and music industry. And this is how I thought I could get a foot in the door. But the company was the only one that got the benefit.”

Before the complaint was filed, SiriusXM described the internship program on their website as the following. “Our internships are unpaid and for credit only. You will be asked to provide proof of enrollment at an accredited college or university and documentation that you will receive credit for the internship. Positions generally require 20-40 hours/week.”

However, Ms. Tierney’s lawyers would disagree with the legality of their program. “The bottom line is that just because you agreed to work as an intern and you received academic credit from your college doesn’t mean you gave up your right to be paid.”

Eventually, several more names were added as plaintiffs.  “Intern Matt” Goldberg from the Opie and Anthony Show was added along with SiriusXM interns Justin Vitetta and Daniel Miller.

On November 7, 2014, the complaint went before Federal District Judge Valerie Caproni. The judge would decide whether or not the potential class action lawsuit would go forward or stop in its tracks. [Adam Klasfeld of Court House News would report from the court room](https://www.courthousenews.com/class-action-notices-to-sirius-interns-approved/). Lawyers for Melissa Tierney would rehash the same arguments in their complaint. Judge Caproni was looking to speed up the argument, calling Tierney a “go-fer” for the defendant. Her lawyers agreed. Attorney Matthew Lampe, representing SiriusXM would go on to argue that the company received no “immediate advantage” from the interns, referencing a 1947 case where a railroad company was allowed to put their workers through a week of unpaid training. Their argument was that the interns were learning and that the company was not gaining an advantage from their internships, rather the opposite. **Judge Caproni wasn’t having it. She stated that without the presence of interns, “Howard Stern Show” staffers could get their “own damn coffee”.** Adam Klasfeld describes how laughter could be heard around the courtroom. Judge Caproni would rule in favor of the plaintiffs. The class action was given the green light.

Virginia &amp; Ambinder, LLP sent out a class action notice to more than a thousand former SiriusXM interns. 1,853 interns would eventually end up joining.

In January of 2015, Melissa Tierney was removed from the lawsuit. In an amended complaint, she would be replaced by intern Justin Vitetta as the named plaintiff. Months prior, [a commenter alleging to be Melissa posted on the website Siriusbuzz](https://i.imgur.com/wUeaVo0.jpg). It was clear “Melissa” was upset at the insinuation that this was some kind of publicity stunt for her blog.

**“For your information, it was not my idea to file the suit, I was filing an unrelated case at which point one of the members of the law firm approached me and asked about my background. I mentioned my internships (including Cupids Pulse, Conde Nast and more) and Sirius XM was among them. I was badly injured while interning at Howard Stern and Sirius was well aware of this and as an intern I received no medical aid or help with my thousands of dollars worth of medical bills. I was injured during my period of interning and was unable to do anything about it.”**

She continued in her post: **“That was why I said ok when the lawyer wanted to file a class action lawsuit, it wasn’t in any way shape or form something I came up with. I enjoyed my time at Howard and yes I was and am a fan of the show, hence why I interned there. I was well aware interns do flunky work and it was unpaid, until I met this lawyer I assumed all internships were unpaid as this author mentioned….that was not my issue, my issue is their lack of response to me being injured on their property while running errands for them. I have nothing against Howard or his staff like I said, I’m a huge fan.”**

As for the criticism regarding this being a publicity stunt: “My blog was created less than a year ago…nothing to do with Sirius and this is no way would help promote, publicize or enhance my reputation. As a matter of fact, I am currently unemployed, and a class action lawsuit doesn’t leave me with any more than $1,000 if that….the money goes to lawyers…not me, so before judging me try getting your facts straight.”

“Melissa” [then posted again later](https://i.imgur.com/ME5SYQZ.jpg), this time more annoyed at the bitter criticism directed towards her by other commentators. **“I was injured getting Howard his fruit salad he requested every morning at 6am…along with the staff’s other multiple breakfast requests from multiple locations which was far from educational, unless my future job was to become a food delivery person and memorize their breakfast orders for years to come, which it might be now since according to you now I will never get a job doing anything else in life. All I can say is I hope in my future delivery job, that the people tip better than those at Sirius because not one person ever offered me a dime after bringing their orders.”**

In the meantime, SiriusXM was drastically changing their internship program. [Descriptions of unpaid 40 hour work weeks](https://i.imgur.com/jKmReN3.jpg) were scrubbed from the website. [It was replaced with the following](https://i.imgur.com/MYEiXIS.jpg). “Our internships are paid and academic credit is optional… Internship positions require you to be able to work 16 hours minimum per week and only up to 20 hours maximum per week.”

On August 3, 2015, SiriusXM had come to a settlement agreement worth $1.3 million. In papers filed with the court, SiriusXM denied any wrongdoing. Rather, they claimed the settlement would cost them less than a lengthy court battle.

As class action representatives, Justin Vitetta was awarded $10,000 while “Intern Matt” Goldberg and Daniel Miller received $5,000 each. The plaintiffs attorneys would collect a fee of $324,337.50.

The remaining 1,853 interns would receive approximately $500 each.

Like the other nominees that have come forth, I am also a nominee for the Assembly of Champions. Let me introduce myself and share my views! 

For some personal information: I’m Izzy, a 21-year old illustrator, graphic designer, and visual communication graduate! You guys may have seen me here before on Reddit, since I occasionally share my fanworks here. After finishing my undergrad thesis, I’ve mainly been playing video games, adding stuff to my portfolio, and exploring and studying lots of other varied media for inspiration for my own stuff. Recently I’ve been watching lots of art restoration videos (Baumgartner Restoration is my go-to), and I’m in the middle of my Horizon: Zero Dawn playthrough ;o; cool stuff! 

For my game history, I’ve been playing ever since June 2017 on PC, during my internship; I interned in a VR studio, and Paladins was one of the games we explored for inspiration that all of us interns liked. Ever since then, I’ve been a huge fan, and I can say I’ve met lots of amazing people and have experienced some fun moments with the community. 

The platform I wish to push forward may be somewhat different – most of my goals towards Paladins is toward its art direction and its general method of visual communication – from things like social media to character design and the general perception of the game. My thoughts are mostly for the game to have a solid goal on how they want to be perceived, as well as focus on who they want their playerbase to be AND identifying how it coincides with their current playerbase. With that, changes can be made on the game, as certain characters and playstyles are preferable to most. 

Sometimes several aspects and decisions Paladins put forth that is more visual can affect how its audience – both Paladins fans and non-players – perceive the game, from design decisions that it makes with its characters to how they enact certain changes. And while visuals and how things are announced and the whole timing of things and stuff like that may just seem like small parts, it can hugely affect how Paladins as a game is treated; the effect of the release of one character with a certain look, nerfs/buffs, and gameplay decisions, can change the game as a whole -- either for the better or for the worse. 

Paladins has lots of potential, and I really do hope I can be part of its path to growth, to becoming an improved game we can enjoy! &lt;3

Please feel free to ask me about things! Just in case you want to talk someplace else or just find me in other sites, I am both in tumblr and twitter (both at @lumenizampel). Thank you for your time! \^\_\^"

aeli81,610,2019-01-10,DH has been lying about his career path,keyofeflat,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/aeli81/dh_has_been_lying_about_his_career_path/,"I've been contemplating posting since shit went down a month ago.  Not a throw away,  he probably knows my UN,  I could care less if he finds this.  Even if I did use a throw away if he,  or anyone else came upon this thread,  I think they'd be able to identify me immediately anyway.  

So I've been with my DH for 8.5 years,  married for 3.5, and we have an almost 1 year old DD.  We've been living with my in laws for the past 5 years while we wait for DH to get his shit together.  You see,  he told us (every single person in his entire life)  that he was in medical school.  Many hiccups and tribulations have been going on with his medical education.  He ""graduated"" And ""completed his internship"" And we were now awaiting his residency.  This entire time I've been emotionally and financially supporting him.  He's been encouraging me to be a stay at home mom if I so choose,  talking about the life we will have when he's making that sweet sweet doctor money.  We aren't materialistic people by any means.  I'm just drowning in student loan debt from going to a high cost school for a fairly low paying career.  I've been working since straight out of undergrad and have been at my current,  high paying for a non-manager job in my forld,  for almost 3 years now.  We just discussed a lot about the nice house we will buy and all the savings we will be able to do and how we will be able to support our kids and pay for their education so they won't start their lives in debt like me.  Basic stuff,  you know?  Nothing crazy.  I've been financially supporting him this entire time; he only got a job and an income last year.  It's a (non-medical)  job I thought to be temporary while we await his residency.  That's the first income he's started to receive,  7.5 years into our relationship while I was about 8-9 months pregnant at the time.   My mental health was starting to suffer living with my in laws as we don't truly have our own space.  We have a kitchenette with a fridge and a bedroom and a living room.  But no actual kitchen or our own bathroom. But I suffered through it because there was a light at the end of the tunnel. I've been in charge of all things financial and I've always been the one to take care of the house hold shit to.  I always have to direct him to do something,  which was also mentally draining me and I already felt alone in the marriage because of it.  

As it turns out... He's not a doctor.  He never went to medical school.  He had the opportunity to,  he just didn't.  He states he was deeply suicidal and depressed and always planned on killing himself anyway.  He said the source if his depression is that he identifies as trans. Our daughter was planned.  I was under the impression he would be having a residency income soon,  so we started trying not realizing I would get pregnant the first month.  He said he wanted me to have someone as I had no family,  and what if I never met anyone else?  

The trans thing is a non-factor in all of this for me.  I don't even know if I truly believe it or it's another manipulation tactic.  He never came clean about the lack of MD,  I had my suspicions and confirmed and called him on it myself.  The depth of the lying,  manipulation,  and gaslighting is what does it for me.  I have no idea where to go from here.  I can't afford my own place due to said student loan debt and living in an I credibly high cost area.  I can't flee the state for a lower cost area due to having my daughter.  He adores her and is a great dad,  at least there's that.  His current job is real; I see the direct deposits and I've been there.  But it pays absolute shit.  He's also in mental health treatment now,  I see the copays being taken out of our account.  I just don't know where the hell to go from here.  I have no where else to go for the time and don't know long term wtf I want to do.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust a single word out of his mouth again.  

ETA just to clarify some details if you didn't see them in my other comments: 
1. He told me he was dicking around the city doing odd jobs or hanging out.  There is a family apartment building too. He used to ""work overnights"" And crash at that apartment building (his deceased grandmothers apartment that was vacant)  to make getting to work die to his ""long hours"" Easier.  I wouldn't doubt he was just staying there most of the time,  probably just playing video games and other nonsense.  
2. I've been looking, it's hard.  I have no family I can go to and no local friends so I'm close to child care.  I live in a very high cost of living area.  I'm drowning in student loan debt.  It's not federal,  as I just refinanced and re consolidated everything with a private company.  I can't defer.  It's already the lowest payment possible.  
3. While I acknowledge and appreciate the people saying he should move out,  not me,  that's a crappy idea too.  Then he gets his own place while I get to stay back where I've been wanting to leave for years.  I want my own place.  And I'm trying.  
4. I found out because I had my own suspicions and confirmed by calling the registrars office.  He actually had the opportunity to come clean in May 2017 when I found an email for a fake diploma.  But instead he photo shopped bank accounts to look like malpractice was being taken out and a fake W2 form.  He had the opportunity to come clean and didnt.  That's the icing on the cake for this shit story. That was before I was even pregnant too.  "

I plan on going back in the fall to get my 150 credit hours so I can sit for the cpa. 

Because I have to take an extra class this spring I couldn’t get an internship for tax season and I also didn’t get any replies from the summer internship openings at my colleges recruitment event. I’m currently looking for a summer internship still but it seems like by now most positions are filled. I’m anxious to get into the accounting field and don’t wanna spend another summer working a non-accounting related job. 

I guess what I’m asking is if I don’t get an internship soon will it look bad? Also for someone in my position what would you recommend I do to get experience/foot in the door. I’ve saved up most of my money from jobs and would even be willing to work as a free intern full-time throughout the summer.

aelt5h,81,2019-01-10,My first experience with an MLM and how it blossomed my hatred for them [LONG],22DramaLlama,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/aelt5h/my_first_experience_with_an_mlm_and_how_it/,"Let's rewind a few years back to when I was a freshman in college. It was my first month of school, I was taking entry level course geared to first year students. The lecture hall was packed with 300 of us waiting for the class to begin. Five minutes before the lecture starts, an older student runs up to the professor and strikes up a conversation. The professor looked rather confused but shrugged and nodded, and the student made his way up to the mic. 

He introduced himself as a fourth year student and told us he found an incredible internship program that has helped him pay for college and build a professional resume. Some other students began handing out slips for ""College Works"" where you fill out your name, major, and phone number. I eagerly filled it out because he told us how the company looks at your degree and pairs you with a project. I thought it was like a temp agency for internships and I thought it would be a great way to get started. 

Flashforward to a month later where I received a phone call. The woman on the other line said they found a project that would be great for me and the average student brings home $10K during the summer they work. I was pumped and quickly asked to set up an interview. She told me I could meet with ""Ryan"" the next week for an interview. 

I really prepared. I updated my resume, practiced questions, and went out for interview clothes. When the next week rolled around and I showed up for the ""interview"" there were four other freshmen sitting around waiting to meet with Ryan too. Even though there were clearly a lot of red flags to begin with, this one really stuck out and hurt for me. 

Ryan rolls in and is a total douchecanoe. His ego was suffocating. In his introduction he just boasted about his success and ignored each of us. I was put off and on guard, but maybe the ""project"" they picked for me was a really good fit and good experience.

He starts giving his presentation and dropping buzz words. ""Management skills"", ""team leader"", and ""over $10K earner in a single summer"". Really selling the ""be your own boss"" and ""look at my money"" points. Alright... my arms were crossed and my engagement changed from ""this is a great opportunity"" to ""who the fuck is this guy""? 

He starts talking about the project, how are main role would be managing a team of three to ten people. Okay..? I asked why I got selected for a management team when my slip clearly stated I was interest in environmental science. His response was textbook and clearly memorized ""any employer will be impressed with management skills no matter what your background in school is!"" That was the point I was really crushed. I was not selected for something that fit me, I was used for something that would work for them.

Well I wasn't about to leave because at that time I was horrible with confrontation and now I was invested in being passive aggressive to this guy. Ryan went on to the business model. We'd be painting houses... Our special project for a college internship was painting houses... WHAT. THE FUCK. 

Apparently, the market is really good and it's an easy way to get into management. You would attend a seminar where you learn to paint and how to price houses, then you'd form a team of painters. Now you had to pay to attend the seminars (the entry fee, transportation, and lodging) and you had to pay $500 to get your starting kit. WHAT IS THIS?

Once your ""three months"" are over, you get reimbursed for your $500. I start losing it a bit and asking questions, apparently too many for Ryan. But before I get into that, I need to talk about the timeline of this project. 

We had our ""interview"" in October and the first seminar was going to be in February. From there you'd meet your director (upline) and they would assign you to a neighborhood. You were not allowed to leave this neighborhood and sell anywhere else. Sometime it would be the same area you lived in, but it could be up to three hours away. Before you started painting in the summers, you had to attend whatever seminars they had in the spring do door-to-door sales where you offered painting quotes. Some people would luck out in rich neighborhoods and people would be interested, but more often then not people ended up in areas where people couldn't afford to hire a team (who are taught to over charge) to paint. So it wasn't a three month commitment at 40 hours a week, it turns into a right month commitment with easily over 60 hours a week.

So my questions really irritated him. I asked why the $500 isn't reimbursed right away or why it's charged at all? ""The company will give the money back at the end of the program when you've made at least $500."" Ahhh so it's not reimbursed, I make that money and you hold it hostage. I then asked what happens if you can't make any money. And he did the classic ""those who don't make any money aren't trying hard enough"". With more prodding I found that College Works takes 40% of your sales and they do not cover expenses at all. You're the one who pays for your gas, employees, and supplies. They cover none of it. 

I then asked how you find employees. Ryan told me that people usually put adds out in craigslist or ask friends. I pushed some more and he said ""that information is only given out to people invited to the ***next*** interview."" So much attitude. That was pretty much his response to all my questions after that, I then asked why he couldn't tell me then and there, and he said ""they only disclose the information with people who they believe are winners and don't want to share it with people who aren't committed.""

So after about an hour of a horrible sales pitch. He turned to each one of us and set up a private phone interview for the evening, including me. He called me at 7pm and I did not answer. He left a message saying he thought I was a winner and had would it took to be successful, and asked to call him back. I did not and now warn everyone I can about College Works because fuck them. 

And this is where my hatred for MLMs began. 

TL;DR: I got suckered into a fake interview for an internship. This ""internship"" teaches you how to be a boss by managing a team. Your project is painting houses... where you recruit your friends to help you paint. You work insane hours and barely make any money. Avoid College Works!!!"
aeltm0,55,2019-01-10,Should I intern abroad even if I don’t want to?,terrorbelle,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/aeltm0/should_i_intern_abroad_even_if_i_dont_want_to/,"Hello internet parents, i’m stuck in a dilemma and it’s really bringing me down as i’m unsure how to proceed.

I study fashion and will eventually work in it, and i’m being presented with the opportunity to intern in Paris for 6 months for a big company. It sounds amazing to everyone, but I don’t feel the same. I currently live in the UK but i’m not from here originally, and at the moment i’ve never felt happier in my life, circumstance wise. However, the internships here aren’t as great.

I don’t think i’m ready to mentally uproot myself again and move countries, but I feel like i’m shooting myself in the foot if I don’t intern in this company, however tbh I only want to intern here because I think it looks good on my CV when i’m applying to jobs in the future.

Upon introspection, my main reason for refusing to go to Paris is simply because I dread knowing that i’m not meant to be in the UK forever; I am on a student visa that lasts til 2020/2021 (if I do a masters), and I hate thinking that I will lose 6 months of a perfectly valid visa surrounded by my closest friends and a happy home life. I don’t have friends in my home country and moving to the UK was a life changer for me, mentally. I always have anxiety about the day I leave the country indefinitely, and have to say goodbye to the life I know.

Sorry for the wall of text, and thank you if you’ve read this far.

I just want to know how to proceed; share me your experiences, if you’ve been in the same place.. will this internship matter in the long run? please let me know if there’s any questions. Thank you x"

Would cost me a lot of money,crisg87,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/aeluji/want_to_quit_my_job_and_pursue_a_masters_degree/,"I’m unhappy at my job, the work itself is fun and my coworkers are cool. I just don’t like what the company as a whole does. I plan on quitting in January 2020 with a year and a couple of months of experience under my belt. I am set on quitting and either looking for a new job or pursuing a masters degree. 

I want to pursue a masters in a different city. My job will pay for my school if I work here, but that involves working full time and having to go to school after work. I am 100 percent certain I don’t want to do that. So that means I’d have to pay out of pocket. The school I’m looking at is $11,000 a year if full time. 

I’m making $68k a year at my current job. Quitting and pursuing my masters means I would not be making money and on top of that I’d have to pay for school. My plan is to pursue internships in the city where the university I’d like to attend is. There is a lot of opportunity in this city and I’m confident I can find a paid internship. 

So basically I’m unhappy at my current job and want to move to a different city to pursue a masters degree. Im going to be pursuing computer engineering. Only reason I’m unsure is because my company pays for school. But I’d only be able to take one or two classes at a time so it’d take me around 6+ years, and I do not see myself working here that long, and having to juggle school and work. 

I’d estimate with a masters I can make around $80-90k a year and it would take 2-3 years to finish. In between semesters I can find internships and those pay pretty well too. 

I am currently debt free, with 7k in savings. If I save at my current rate, I will have 22k saved up by the time I want to quit. Is this plan worth it? It’s a risk because there’s no guaranty I will have a job after graduating, and there’s no guarantee I will find internships in between semesters. My current job is a for sure thing for the foreseeable future, but like I said I do not want to work here. I can seek another job instead of pursuing a masters degree but getting a masters degree is a goal of mine and it would open more doors in my field. "

At the moment I'm doing a full year placement in a company in Spain as a Marketing Assistant, but because of there so much downtime... I use it learn things in code academy and Udemy so I can come back stronger

Although recently I have realized that if I were to go through this path, I would end up to be a corporate slave.. making sure I reach my bonus. So I have been thinking about joining the British army as I've heard good and bad parts but what interested me the most was that it can change the way you conduct things in life. I'm thinking the army/navy can improve my quality of life because it will teach me how to approach danger or confront things as I have a certain type of anxiety

(not like I would be scared of combat, to be honest, I love fighting as I do boxing and muay thai even if I get knocked out... but it doesn't compare with the horrors of war...) but it's the type of anxiety that makes me keep doubt a lot or be conscious of what people think of me and my failures. I'm very athletic, not very tall, and have a bit of intelligence and some common sense so if I do join the navy, they might take me in!

**Proceeding with this decision into the army comes with many doubts and Issues:**

* **My family will disown me-** I spoke to my mother and father about this, and they really dislike the idea of me joining the military as they're pacificist and they always spoke to me about the horrors of civil war that my predecessors had to endure.
* **I have a girlfriend...** I've been with this girl for a year now and to tell you the truth she was the one who red pilled me.... I met her on tinder (yes red flags I know) and I wasn't expecting her to be my girlfriend initially. Everything was great at the beginning until 4 months into the relationship as Work and honestly, some MGTOW videos were giving anxiety about women and the future. Things started to hit the floor after I said to her the magic words "" I love you"", she said back too... but it wasn't long until she began to become distant.  A month after saying I love you, we went to Manchester for her bday and as I was the only guy that was coming to her event it was horrendous. The girls were bitching about me, she wasn't acknowledging I was there and it threw me into a massive depression. It made me think she was going for another guy.. especially when she decided to drop me off home and not speak to me till April.

Between March and April, I was still blue pilled as I was waiting for to call me back and sometimes and it was the worst time! I started taking antidepressants which made me worse she would but very bluntly and sometimes she would ask me to come and see her an hour. By March 27th (a day before my birthday) she told me to meet her at a restaurant and me thinking that she would come back to me was foolish.. she wanted to break up. All I had was rage and vengeance but the next day for my bday she got me a lot of gifts and took me out to eat, plus sex in the end which made me confused.. in the same day I went out with my friends and found another woman. She was younger and much more beautiful, I guess I dated her because I wanted to fill a void.

So fast forward 1 month and a half, this new girl is treating great although some things put me off like her having a higher body count and she was too tight haha... My ex started coming to talk to me and I was still in love with her.. but the worst part is I met the parents of the new girl already... But foolish as I am decided to ditch the new girl for the old one (not fully back though) as I had a conscience for the new girl because I was going to Spain for a year and I didn't want to waste her fertility window for a year so I dropped her. Even though I was kinda back with my ex, I didn't treat her like all white knight like I did before especially now that I have lost weight and feel good about my self and because of it, she keeps making sure that I say ""I love her"" but I find it hard to. And she gets me gifts and stuff there but because I'm so affected by the past I lost so much affection for her.. especially that she gained weight.

On one hand I want to go my own way and travel, invest, save and be the best version of my self and the other, I want to stay with her because the blue pilled mind says ""you'll never find a traditional woman like her in England"", because yes all women are the same... and maybe it's manipulation... but she saved me from **suicide many times and sometimes shes the cause.**

Plus... I want children in the future... I would love to raise my own, and I'm going, to be honest... If I were to have kids I'm going to love them as much as I can, I'm going to prepare them to be men and make sure they're aware of what's going on! I'm going to do what my father could not! But with this gynocentric society going on... even having a child artificially is a risk too....

**Please, fellow brothers, share as much advice as you can. I have a father I try to connect and he does give me advice sometimes but it's only about career perspective. I had to find my way to be a man through the internet which was a bad idea but I had no choice... I learned things in a hard way but it was beneficial in the end**

&amp;#x200B;

But anyways boys, I will continue to self improve! I have been doing a carnivore diet, I do calisthenics every day for an hour and I do coding on the side and read some books! If there's discord for MGTOW I would like to know and if anyone wants to chat about anything deep in their lives, I would love to listen... I think what we miss in this day in age is a brotherhood!

(Sorry for any terrible grammar, I have been slaving from 6 am till 7 pm... the life of an intern every day)

aen52g,3,2019-01-10,Possessive brother [30M] wants to assist sister [20F] on her move to new city for school. Sister does not want this.,BitterPatter02,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aen52g/possessive_brother_30m_wants_to_assist_sister_20f/,"To start off, apologies for the long post.

Just a quick background. We are 9 persons in a joint-family setting based in a metro in India. Everyone in the family has a cordial relationship with each other and my parent in laws are wonderful people. My husband is one of three brothers and a sister. His sister, C [20], is the youngest in the family.

C has struggled with getting good grades in school and because of that, she was unable to get into a good Food &amp; Hospitality College program. After a lot of research, I had her enrolled in a local government institution for a 9 month course on pastry and confectionary. Turns out she was good at it. She did a 2 month internship at a prestigious hotel and that ended in August. Since then she has been at home. Her brother, F [30], had a contact at another good hotel so that C could work a bit more in her field, but due to her poor health for a month and zero follow up by the rest of the family, that internship fell through. Also her certificate is not as valued as a diploma or a degree, so finding work in her field at restaurants has been a task.

C is the youngest and hence the most pampered in the house. She has no idea about personal finances, has never lived away from home and has had no drive to be independent. My brother-in-law, F, is also very possessive about her. Until last year she was not allowed to take a cab. She is still not allowed to go watch movies with her friends. Her brother keeps on asking where she is all the time. So she's also been very closed off to the real world. 

She isn't a 'spoilt brat' though. She helps around in the house with chores etc. But it was killing me that she was doing nothing with her career. My greatest worry was that once my husband and I have kids, who will be there to focus on C? Yes she has her parents. But both of my in-laws did not finish school. My husband and his brothers did not go to college and started their own businesses. Hence no one had any clue of anything else in the world other than 'starting your own business'. Hence C gets absolutely no educational guidance from her siblings or parents. C has a follower personality. I've never seen her take any leadership to do something without being told what to do. Hence starting a business is definitely not her thing.

I did not ever want to look back thinking that we didn't do anything for her future when we could have. Hence I decided that the best thing to do was to enroll her in a Diploma program in another metro in India. This is a very good pastry school and well known in the country. The program isn't cheap but with her poor grades, she has no chance to get in at any government college. So I had a chat with my in-laws and with their approval, we filed C's application and got her enrolled. I am hoping that through this, she will be able to grow as a person and learn to be more independent.  She starts next month.

Here's the problem. I didn't speak to F about enrolling her in this program, because, frankly, I didn't really think I had to. Word around the block was that he was furious that he was not consulted in this decision process. Anyways, I am currently making plans to book flights for C, my husband, my MIL and I to accompany C to help her move in at her residence and familiar with the new city. I have asked a friend in the city if we could stay at his place during this time. However, F, has mentioned to C today that he wants to come with her to her first day and for the move in. Both my MIL and C think that's a bad idea. I think it's a bad idea too. This is C's first time away from home. I want her to settle into the environment without being overwhelmed by strict F. I want her mother to feel comfortable that her daughter is going to be in this new place for the next 9 months and also be able to spend quality time with her. I feel that F will only start placing his disciplinary orders on what to do and what not to do, thus overwhelming C and not giving enough time to sink into this process. I'm not sure if I'm wrong thinking about it this way.

How do I tell F that he should go meet C in a following trip let's say a month after she's into her program? How do I tell him not to come on this move-in trip without hurting his feelings? F is not a bad guy, he just has a different approach of being a big brother (my husband is the 'cuddler' and the youngest brother doesn't care much, so F feels he needs to be strict one).

TL:DR Older brother has always been possessive of youngest sister. Sister is moving to a new city for college. Brother wants to assist with the move to her first day of program. Sister wants to not be overwhelmed and would rather want him to come after she has settled in."

Me 30F finally got a back bone and stood up to my 32M husband. Long story so bare with me please.

We’ve been together for 6 years, married for 2. Everything was fine for the first 3 years. We met at work where I was an an intern, he was a manager. He was so sweet and really supportive of my ambitions and goals as I was of his and we clicked right away. We began dating and as time went on, I started climbing the ladder at my job and on our third year together, I was offered a managing director position....that’s when everything went south.

When I was offered the position. I was over the moon, having been an intern on close to nothing , climbing my way up to a position where I’d earn more than enough money to look after both him and I and our future meant so much to me. When I told him, I thought he would be ecstatic especially as he has proposed to me a month prior and I had said yes, it was a great way to earn more money for the wedding and a house.

His responses was lacklustre and he said oh okay, I’ll have to think about how I feel about this, turned around and walked out the door and left me for over a week. Wouldn’t respond to my messages or calls. I was beyond sick and worried, I thought something had happened to him. He finally came back, over a week later (hadn’t shown up at work either) strolls in like nothing happened and says, If you take this job, I’m leaving you. I was shocked and tried to talk about it about it but he said his feelings were final.

Like an idiot, I declined the job because I didn’t want to lose him. He once again become sweet again and even though I wasn’t earning as much, we were still together. A few months down the track and he starts being critical of my appearance and mental state. He says I’ve put on weight and should be focused on doing more around the house and working out and he isn’t happy with our “average” sex life. This throws me for a 6 but I oblige and start working 9-5, getting up at 6 to go to the gym to lose the 10 pounds I had put on off , cleaning the house before I went to work, coming home and cooking every night and then trying to get more adventurous and sexy for him to spice things up.

I’m exhausted by this, meanwhile he goes to work 4 days a week, does no cleaning, plays video games and criticises every meal I cook. I really start losing self esteem at this point and start feeling depressed. He takes it upon himself to talk to my boss behind my back and then I end up having a meeting where my boss says, I think you’re putting too much stress on yourself and we’d like you to take some time off. I was stressed and exhausted but work was the only place where I could escape. Even though it felt like shit, I decided to take some time off. While I was having time off my husband manipulated my work and kept telling me that I’m not of Sound mind, that I’m hopeless, that I’m a wreck and should quit my job. I told him no but he barraged me 24/7 and told me that there’d be no wedding.....we had already paid for 75% of it and some of that was a gift from my parents, I was scared of letting them down so in the end I relented.


Well we got married, I thought I could be happy but I was the shell of a woman I once was. Jobless, in a constant state of fear of what else he’d say was wrong with me. He took my phone, limited my internet time, isolated me and made me believe I could only depend on him and that I wasn’t worth anything.

The last year has been hell, all I’ve wanted to do is sleep my life away, although I would t dare in fear of his retaliation, instead I spent my day cleaning and cooking, doing everything he wanted and yet he’d tell me I was ugly and stupid and would just demand sex because the least I could do was get him off.

I felt like a used puppet purely there to satisfy him and not be a full person. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I found out I was pregnant, what should’ve been the happiest moment of my life, scared me to death. Some of you may judge me for this but it shook me to the core. I thought about this for a few days , didn’t tell him but decided to secretly abort. I was devastated, I want to be a mom but I couldn’t imagine subjecting a child to this life. I was numb for a while, I just continued on with everything until a few days ago. 

It hit me like a train, he was so abusive in such a manipulative way. I had given up so much of me to make him happy, I had aborted a child because deep down inside, I knew he is a piece of shit.

I found my car keys that he had hidden and my phone. I found a divorce lawyer, called up my old boss, I went to work, I marched in and said to my boss that I’d like my job back. He asked how my husband would feel about it and I said, I don’t care, I know I’m good at what I do and I need the money to leave him. My boss clapped his hands and said welcome back and that the whole team would support me coming back into the work force.

My husband obviously had gotten home by this point and noticed my phone and car was missing, started blowing it up, sending me disgusting messages and telling me to get home now. 

I went home. I walked in, he started yelling and telling me that I’ve abused his trust by stealing “my property” without running it by him, that I should be ashamed. I told him that he can get fucked, we’re over, I’m leaving him and he’ll be hearing from my lawyer. He immediately started crying hysterically and begged me to stay, that we should work things out , I told him that all of these years I thought it was me who was lacking, but thanked him because it was because of that lie that he kept telling me that made me realise, I’m not lacking, I’m an educated, smart, intelligent person, I said but you knew that already, instead of celebrating me, you became insecure and tried to diminish who I was to make yourself feel better. I told him he was right to feel that way, I am better than him and that you can’t polish a fucking turd and walked out, blocked him on all social media, notified all of our friends and family and I’ve never felt better. 

My question is, should I get someone to collect my things from our house or should I just leave them to avoid having to deal with him?


I’m really looking forward to 2019!

TDLR: me 30F finally got a back bone against 32m Abusive husband had made me feel like nothing for years, I finally stood up to him and realised my worth.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management, and have about 10 years of experience working in hotels from different departments --- Front Desk, Housekeeping, and mostly restaurant related jobs. My latest work experience was in a 5 star 5 diamond hotel and was working there for 8 months. I left this hotel because I was seeking for Human Resource related job opportunity since I just started my Master's Program for Human Resource Management. I found this job online that was supposed to be an internship. It seemed very legit because the office was really nice and people are so well-dressed. I came to 2 separate interviews and passed both of them. I gave my 2 weeks notice to the hotel I was working for and told them I found an internship that will help me for my future. They found an immediate replacement whom I trained. During the interview, I have asked a lot of questions but they seemed to be answering them vaguely. Four days within my new ""job/internship,"" there was a lot of what they called ""field work"" and nothing really about the position I applied for. On the fifth day, my trainer told me that he was doing some research about the company. He said that this company we were working for was a hoax and complete BS! They were manipulating everyone and we all fell for it. My trainer at that time told about what was going on and told me that I should just quit and apologized that I got dragged me into it. Now, I left a really great job and won't be able to come back. I am jobless. I have been searching for a any type of job just so I can at least help my parents with anything, and I haven't found any luck. I have gotten calls for job interviews but can't seem to land anything due to how my resume or work experience was setup (No, I've never been fired before). Even when I am telling the truth, it'll be hard for HR to believe me.

aeolme,2,2019-01-10,Want to say my story,helm4hades,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aeolme/want_to_say_my_story/,"I hit rock bottom around the time the girl I lost my virginity to and had been together with for 4 months cheated on me.

She gave me this news and left me on a downward spiral where I hurt her me and other people. At this time when I had real questions about the nature of love my parents marriage fell apart as my dad cheated on my mother. The whole time I was in a cycle of getting intoxicated and trying to have sex with women without developing any amount of connection. When I couldn’t have the sex I would drink and then watch porn and masturbate.

After three months of this and the stress of being a college student and working part time I found myself unable to go to sleep at night without drinking or jerking off. I would just lay disgruntled for 1-3 hours until I decided I no longer wanted to hold out. Then I’d drink a beer and fap.

No nut November came and I made 10 days. I felt my mind was clear. I relapsed into drinking again the night I got was told by a girl I liked that she didn’t like me too.

I really started to have a negative attitude towards love, relationships, and women again. But on 12/18/18 I decided to quit fapping. I’ve been stron once again and am approaching 30 days. I was able to be a great help to my mother as she has pursued a divorce and end the chapter of her heartbreak.

I plan to go into the new year focused on myself. Instead of fapping I want to work to land an internship. I had been in the gym for a decent time before this and yet I want to get bigger and better at lifting.

I want to take the time to improve more and as such I’ve written a bunch of other goals for other aspects of my life as well. 

I wish at the outset I am back to being hopeful about relationships. In the mean time by focusing on myself and self improvement I can overcome my insecurities and anxieties.

I am looking for role-models and will always look to talk to others in their journey. 

I want to use those late night times I am my weakest to instead do sit-ups, push-ups, watch anime, write out my ideas, and read philosophy.

Stay strong."

Though he stepped out for one year to work on “[**Immortal Songs**](https://www.viki.com/tv/32509c-immortal-songs?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=2-days-1-night-pd-opens-taking-changes-show),” he soon rejoined “2 Days &amp; 1 Night.” As he took the helm of the show, he shared, “I’m going to bring alive the natural mentality of wild road variety.”

When asked if he felt excited or pressured when he had received the offer to be the head PD, he answered, “It wasn’t a great feeling of happiness. However, ‘2 Days &amp; 1 Night’ is about continuing on when the situation goes in unexpected directions. It felt like my life was also going in an unexpected direction. I decided to not be afraid and to accept it.” He added that because he had been with the show for a long time, he hadn’t felt any big psychological changes, and that he also could depend on former “2 Days &amp; 1 Night” PDs Yoo Ho Jin and Yoo Il Yong.

Kim Sung elaborated on some of the changes the show had made, such as the captions. He remarked, “‘2 Days &amp; 1 Night’ has captions with its own traditional feel. However, we’re changing the designs. We’ve changed the font from Ming style to Gothic style, and reduced the many colors to just the colors of the logo. It may appear trivial, but from the perspective of a producer it’s a risk.”

He talked about what it was like working with the members, saying, “There’s fun in the wheedling and negotiation between the ‘2 Days &amp; 1 Night’ members and production staff. [**Jung Joon Young**](https://www.viki.com/celebrities/20727pr-jung-joon-young?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=2-days-1-night-pd-opens-taking-changes-show) is particularly scary. He’s extremely smart. He’s someone who sees straight through what the production staff prepares and changes the game. When the production staff have meetings, we also ask, ‘How will Jung Joon Young react to this?'”

Kim Sung mentioned the new year’s first episode, where the CEO of KBS made an appearance. He explained that they hadn’t originally planned on filming it, but he had come and thought that he could give the members some strength.

The PD then commented on Lee Yong Jin joining the show as an intern. He remarked, “Lee Yong Jin hadn’t been particularly close to any of the original members, but he fit so well with them that we didn’t want to lose out on him. No matter who he is with among the six members, he doesn’t block their strengths and rather makes them come alive.”

He continued, “Currently, we’re taking the time to get to know each other so we gave him the title of intern. Since it’s a first for all of us, we don’t have a specific period of time or procedure. We told Lee Yong Jin that we should enjoy the confusion together. I think that the process is more important than the results. I believe that Lee Yong Jin, the members, the production staff, and the viewers will decide.”

When asked if Lee Yong Jin joining the show was due to one of the original members leaving, he firmly stated, “Absolutely not. The original six members all love the program and so none of the members will be leaving.”

On viewership ratings, Kim Sung remarked, “Viewership ratings are important, but the point is to make sure that \[viewers\] watch for the whole hour. Our ultimate goal is to become a variety show where the viewers are curious about the next week. i want to make it so that they want to watch ‘2 Days &amp; 1 Night’ the next Sunday.”

The PD concluded by saying, “Our members know the shortcomings of our show very well. We can’t satisfy everyone, but we will work hard to prepare so that we will receive love from the most amount of people as possible.”

aeppac,4,2019-01-10,I feel like I will never escape them,spammonia,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/aeppac/i_feel_like_i_will_never_escape_them/,"tl,dr: Don't be financially involved with nparents ever. It's a bad idea. 

I wasn't allowed to get a driver's license and I had to fight for it at 25 (parents put limitations for me, a girl, while letting my gcbrother advance in his independence). I had to fight to get a car and pay my own insurance because agreeing to give the title over to my dad and allow him to pay for insurance is a trap to have yet another thing he can hold over me. I paid for it with all my own money. I'm immensely proud of doing this and now I'm 26 and have the means to  be independent. Unfortunately, I needed my ndad's help for something yet again and it is honestly yet another act of sabotage by him.

I just lost out on a private student  loan that I cosigned with my ndad in the worst possible way. I begged him to look at other options for loans, but he chose the most convenient for him and I couldn't do anything because I still live with him and I didn't want to upset him (he's got a temper, used to beat my brother and I as children while my emom would excuse it by saying he was abused as a child...irony).

Today the payment deadlines passed. So now I have to either drop all my classes or pay them. However, I'd be closing my bank account completely  to pay them. That money was supposed to be for rent to get out of this abusive household. 

I hoped to get a private student loan on my own for school with my high 700 credit score (which I diligently worked on improving on my own within the past 5 years) but my income wasn't enough to qualify. I had to get a cosigner and the only person I knew was my dad. 

The loan process consisted of him saying vile things to representatives, leaving one loan application unprocessed and another one incorrectly completed. My university obviously denied the loan when there was a request for disbursement  because of the errors.

How can I get a private student loan on my own without involving him? I don't want to have to deal with his temper tantrums or him telling me I'm an idiot and talking over me. I can't do anything now but pay off my school fees with my own money, since these deadlines passed. I can prepare for future loans though, since I need to take classes to get a certificate for obtaining a well-paying job to support myself.

I feel like now that my savings for moving out is gone,  he'll try to sabotage other aspects of my life. He already screwed over my credit score with his antics, and now I'll have no money to escape him either. Meanwhile, my gcbrother has gotten a car from my parents, money to pay for his college expenses, and now he is in the process of being licensed to practice in his profession so he will move out soon. 

I know I'll have to work another job and overtime to make sure I can pay off this semester, but I keep feeling like it won't be good enough and I'll be stuck living with my parents until I finish school. I feel like every time I achieve something in my life, my nparents are involved in yet another problem I deal with. I just want to avoid them completely.

How do I cope if I can't afford an escape? I have to interact with them daily and I didn't ever want to be in this position of seeking financial help from my parents. I thought I could do it on my own but I can't with school. 

I was going to obtain a certificate to finally work in my field because I didn't get a chance to after getting my bachelor's degree. I had thyroid cancer, so during my last 2 years of college I was getting  treatments and was not as focused on getting a career or internships. I blame myself for not being as competitive a student with my career and wasted my time obsessing over my illness.

I just want some hope that this ends. I am obviously working hard to escape my situation, since I've been working through the entire winter break. However, what do I need to look out for and prevent from happening with my ndad?

I learned my lesson this time, but I don't ever want a repeat of this ever again. I guess I'm a good example of a cautionary tale for this situation."

This is a repost as I had a bit of luck with this one and am eager to try again with it!

Recently I've been listening to and watching anything I can find with a proper Southern Belle from the States. I just love the accent and the slang and how innocent they sound. I'd like to do short rps based around a southern girl exploring her sexuality or being taken by a rough guy who just needs a fuck. I'd love to do multiple scenes that could go from a loving wedding night to a noncon back alley! A few of my favourites at the moment are:

1. Southern girl next door decides to try and make it big in the capitol city and becomes an intern at a news studio, catching the eye of the anchor.

2. Southern girls boyfriend bets he'll win the local Nascar and is so confident he bets his girlfriend against his nemesis on the track, either winning the other guys girl to use as well or losing his girl to him.

3. Southern girl gets bought at an old school slave auction and taken back to the manor to serve her new owner.

4. Southern girls wedding night and her new husband has something romantic and special planned for their first night as a married couple.

5. Southern girls casting interview. How naive is she and how far will she go to land ""the job"".

I'm happy to play out scenes you've got in mind too, I'd just really like to hear from a nice Southern girl, wearing the tied around her chest flannelette shirt and cowboy hat and speaking in that enchanting accent! Reference material appreciated!"

I need some advice on how to secure a BA role.

I graduated in May 2018 with a degree in MIS. Since June I've been working as an Executive Assistant, and I really do not like my job. I find it to be very boring and basic, and it is not something I see myself doing long term.

My longtime girlfriend and I are moving to California once she finishes school, so I've been searching for the past few months for either an entry-level, or associate level BA role. I see a lot of job postings stating the need for ""3+ years experience in a BA role"", which can get a little discouraging at times. While in college, I played football so I did not have time to secure any internships or anything of the sort.

As far as my skillset goes I have a decent grasp of SQL (currently enrolled in online course trying to get a working knowledge with it) and Java. I do also have two certification (CNSS 4013 and CNSS 4016). I got them through a cybersecurity class. 

What are some of the steps I should be taking to ultimatley become a BA? Are there are any Certifications I should aspire to get? 

Any and all advice would be appreciated!

My grandmother is a cool old hippie, my uncle is in the military, and then there's my aunt.

My Aunt is closer in my age than she is my Mom's, and she is so cool. She is everything I have ever wanted to be. She works in the same industry I want to, she has tattoos, plays video games, and watches anime. She's successful despite having blue hair because she's great at her job... everything my Mom had always told me wouldn't happen if I did things like she wanted.

My Aunt is also openly bisexual. My Mom is highly religious and LGBT people are not something she approves of. I've known I was a lesbian since I was around 10, but I have kept it to myself because I know my Mom will disapprove. I can tell she disapproves of my Aunt's lifestyle, but she doesn't want to chase off her biomom by saying anything because my Grandmother is very protective of my Aunt.

All of that said, I find myself fantasizing about my Aunt. She is starting to take me to do cool stuff, wrangled me an internship at her company, and I really don't want to screw this all up with weird feelings of attraction.

We are flying out friday for a work event for her in Colorado in which I will act as her assistant (yes, I AM being paid, too!) I'm just worried I'll do or say something stupid/make it obvious and make it awkward.

Having always been reserved and focused on work throughout the years I made a decision this year I would take more risks to go after females I like(I'm male). In other words, grow some balls and take chances. 

My first goal was to introduce myself.  A great situation occurred when we met outside near our work but to the side of the building. It was quite slow that day. We were able to stand still have each others attention and have a talk. We talked about 10 minutes. Nothing obviously flirtatious. Mostly professional talk, asking each other where we're from, and learning about each other. I offered her my support and complimented her. (For 2 months she worked in different departments and this time to the front door to greet and assist guests, where she said she felt useless, so I showed her some support and said her smile and confidence was a great attribute.) She seemed to cheer up, introduced ourselves and we went back to our respective departments. First goal done.
 
The next day as my shift was ending and hers beginning I went out to her area and gave her a gift of hand warmers to keep her warm during the cold night shift. It was included with a note for her that pretty much said I enjoyed the talk we had, offered her more good luck to her job, and with my number if she wanted to talk more. I also stated I didn't know when/if we would meet again since she gets shuffled around. Since then it's been 1 week and haven't heard from her or seen her at work. 

Objectively I met my goals of what I wanted to do but didnt get the results I wanted. Did I scare her off or she's just not interested? I'm not sure what to make of it. And what do I say if I run into her again in the near future? Do I just move on if we do meet again or try to pursue her more and be even more direct and ask her out?

aerj6b,20,2019-01-10,My brother is in prison and sends me his stories. He wanted me to post this one. [RF],BrodyCollab1680,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/aerj6b/my_brother_is_in_prison_and_sends_me_his_stories/,"An Act

The funeral had been held that morning. Three dozen mourners, most of them his brother’s coworkers. None had had to ask for the day off, even though it was the middle of the week.

Odd how a handful of missed mortgage payments can end a life. Losing your home to foreclosure comes with a loss of dignity that some men just can’t take.

He didn’t have to go home to change before heading into work himself (his work dress was well suited for a funeral service) but he did anyway to light the candles he had picked up at the gas station--and to say a prayer to the Virgin Mary to show mercy on his brother’s lost soul.

To get to work he parked a mile away at an unassuming multi-floored parking garage. In the elevator there he tapped his ID badge to a spot near the keypad and pressed his eye to the scanner. He got out three floors below basement level and took the employee monorail the rest of the way.

Another elevator up. The corridor is mostly deserted, the one used by the employees anyway. An intern shuffled by him, eyes down at her phone, with a stack of papers and her purse under her arm, looking harried.

He checked in with his boss and was handed an itinerary. “Nothing much this morning. Should be up to his usual until lunch, press conference at four.”

“Okay.”

“Listen...I’m sorry about making you work today. There was just no other option. With everything going on, he’s demanding we staff double.”

“It’s okay.”

“How was the service?”

“Okay.”

“Yeah, sorry. Stupid question. Here’s your service weapon. Set your radio to frequency Beta.”

He stood outside the door to the bathroom, waiting for something to happen, trying to maintain the constant vigilance he was trained to, trying to hear without listening. But he couldn’t help but listen.

“Yeah yeah...no the stupid fuckers...shit that’s what you told me anyway...ha! Idiots...Listen...I feel...as much as you can...just wait, you’ll see...yup, got it...hold on.” *Flush.* “Sorry...of course people are pissed...that’s the point….worried? About what? No one can touch me...fucking wetbacks are too stupid to stop it...Alright, Dave...Keep up the good work.”

The weight of his pistol in its holster dug into his ribcage. A memory of his brother’s face. His smile next to his wife’s. Her tears of shock and despair just this morning.

“Ha!” from the bathroom, “‘Pay me! Pay me!’ Losers.” *Flush.* “God damn pussies.”

His brother’s profile picture flashed in his mind's eye: him and his platoon in desert camo, a photo taken the day the IUD hit the transport. The one that took his leg and put him behind a desk. 

His hands moved over the outline of the pistol through his suit. Felt it.

The sink running. “Hey!”

A voice called. *His* voice.

“Sir?”

“See if you can round up some Diet Coke for me.”

“Sir.”

He came back with a glass of Diet Coke, there was always one ready, and walked up behind *him* where *he* now slouched on one big blue couch that faced another in the oddly curved office. He placed in on a coaster that had a seal on it so as not to put rings on the historic end table.

Without turning to look from *his* phone, *he* grunted at him. It may have been thanks.

“God what idiots,” *he* mumbled at the phone, “CNN, MSNBC, all of ‘em all of ‘em. We should just do away ‘em. Useless. Like anyone isn’t getting paid that needs to. Report something else.”

More mumbles and grumbles, disconnected and incoherent.

He stood back a step. Felt his mind detach. His hand took over on its own, doing what it wanted. The pistol. *Him. RIght there.* Fat little hands, sweating out life-ending rants on a whim. His brother’s face, his wife’s tears, words repeating.

“Useless...pussies...cowards...Ha!...Ha!”

A chortle.

*“Losers.”*

His hands found the grip, the solid rubber and steel heft of the pistol. Through his sunglasses *his*  wispy mess of strawberry blonde hair looked reddish, a dark orange. Like a smudge of cotton candy.

He unclipped the leather strap of the holster. A small hand reached out for the glass of soda, and knocked it over, staining the table.

**“GOD FUCKING DAMN IT YOU IDIOT! CLEAN THIS SHIT UP AND GET ME ANOTHER DIET COKE BEFORE YOU’RE FUCKING FIRED!!!!”**

“Sir.”

“What...what are you doing...wait...NO...NO WAIT...HEL----------”

He wondered how many candles would be lit for him.

aerp4z,32,2019-01-10,"[P] All-in-one development container: ""AI Lab""",tlkh,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/aerp4z/p_allinone_development_container_ai_lab/,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share a side project that I've been working on while doing an internship. It's an all-in-one dev environment packaged as a Docker container that works for almost all usage scenarios in doing data science, machine learning or deep learning development (hence the generic name ""AI Lab""...)

**The backstory** (skip if you hate stories)

So, I've been frustrated with setting up environments between various workstations/servers/cloud instances (for both myself and new collaborators). Even things like conda environments are annoying since they can take forever to install (after you figure out the right configuration), so the setup time really adds up. The other way is to use Docker containers but containers like those from [NGC](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/) are a little bit too traditional/limiting in that they don't bundle things like Jupyter which I use pretty heavily. I also find the pre-installed packages lacking and building on top of those aren't easy.

We also have a Kubernetes setup running JupyterHub and containers need to have some additions to play nicely with that, but its shocking convenient once everything is set up properly.

**End backstory**

So my goal here is to be able to launch my dev environment with one command, anywhere! Here's what the workflow looks like now starting from a ""blank"" workstation or instance:

1. Install drivers/CUDA/Docker with script (using another side project... haha)  
`curl https://getcuda.ml/ubuntu.sh | sudo bash` (yes `curl | sudo bash` is bad but it's really thrilling)
2. `docker pull nvaitc/ai-lab:latest`
3. `nvidia-docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /home/USER:/home/jovyan nvaitc/ai-lab`

With those three steps, a fully-configured Jupyter Notebook/Lab pops up and becomes fully available for use with frameworks including TensorFlow/PyTorch/MXNet/RAPIDS etc. Of course, you can use it interactively without Jupyter and also launch it from within JupyterHub.

This makes it really easy to just get started in a new environment anywhere (with an Internet connection)

I'm just sharing this because it has been super useful to me and some members of my team so I'm trying to package this nicely and share it with others! I'm also soliciting feedback and comments so do let me know what you think about this!

For more information and to open issues, please check out [nvaitc/ai-lab on GitHub](https://github.com/NVAITC/ai-lab) and feel free to open issues or pull requests. Some more detailed instructions on usage are also [available here](https://github.com/NVAITC/ai-lab/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

I'm usually referred to as APG, but my name is Alice. I am in my early 20s and in my last term in school. My graduation date should be end of March 2019 with a CSE (computer science &amp; engineering) degree. 

For the past 6+ months I am doing my senior capstone which takes up 90% of my life - it's basically an unpaid internship and I'm working 40+ hours per week for school. So when I get home, I'm usually very 
tired, and don't post as often I would like.

IRL I would describe myself as a hikikomori. I'm very shy and I never go out socially. I like anime, computer/video games, tabletop boardgames, cosplay, Vocaloid, and keeping up with information security.  

I have PCOS and despite me posting lewd photos on here, I am actually very self-conscious about my appearance because of it. I hope one day I'll be as confident irl with how I look as I am when I post as APG.

I've been feeling the pressure to search for and lock down a summer 2019 plan, whether it be an internship or research. For some background, I'll be finishing my first year of college and will have basic knowledge on economics and statistical tests/procedures, as well as familiarization with Python and working with data (intended Statistics/Data Science double major). I would prefer research over internships because I think it'd be an interesting experience, but beggars definitely can't be choosers.

I'm planning on emailing some professors to possibly assist on any summer research they may have. I've also been looking into some school-funded and outside internship programs. The most difficult thing is definitely my lack of expertise in the field, and the fact that I'm a freshman.

That being said, what are your opinions on options and pathways for this summer? Any tips on emailing professors about working on their summer research projects? What career realms can I look into (ex. finance? marketing?) I've briefly heard of companies that hold specific internships for undergrad freshman/sophomores; does anyone have any more information on this? (I've come to a dead-end on researching this) What are your experiences with statistics research during early undergrad?

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!"

What are people’s thoughts on working as an intern within a baseball operations department and do you think it would be better to start off in that role or gain more experience at a software company and try again down the road? 

Below are my thoughts on both positions and the benefits and drawbacks of each. Please let me know what you think.

Baseball R&amp;D internship:

Pros

-More analytical experience than that of a database administrator (building models/analyses in R)

-Direct foot in the door of an MLB franchise

-Additional opportunity to move into other sports (NFL, NBA, etc)

Cons

-Minimum wage salary 

-Year long contract for internship (riskier, less job security)

-Changing landscape of baseball analytics (will I become disposable after so many years)

Full-time position:

Pros:

-More general experience (databases/SQL) can be applied within any role at any company 

-Significantly higher salary

-Greater job security

-Opportunities to potentially move around within company (developer roles, data scientist roles, etc)


Cons:

-Less analytical experience (probably won’t get to work with R or build any sort of analyses within job role)

-Database management experience may not be as useful or highly coveted as more analytical, data science experience

-Harder to go intern for a franchise when you are 35 years old than when you are 24 years old 

Thanks!

aesfgz,0,2019-01-11,31 year old student with family of 4 thinking about taking out more loans for paying bills...is crowdfunding a bad thing?,Pearcenator,povertyfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/aesfgz/31_year_old_student_with_family_of_4_thinking/,"EDIT: Crowdfunding is a bad idea as I was thinking. Just focusing on the idea of taking out more loans.

I'm 31 and am married with a 4 year old and another one expected in July! 

Went to college the first time when I was 18 years old. Did not do well and dropped out after 2 years of C's and F's. 

10 years later after doing the working thing bartending, I decided I needed a change and went back to college. Met my sweetheart right before that and married her a few months ago. Bought a house last year too!

Had to cut my hours down at work to make school possible. I'm an Information Systems major. So, this is a major that 'pays'. $60k-$70k right out of the gates in Arkansas after graduation.

I still bartend but only bring in about $2500 a month. Which would be fine and all, but between mortgage, car payments,  health insurance, preschool ($600 a month), food, and general bills, our bills come out around $3500 a month. My pregnant wife works full time as a medical office clerk and only brings in $1000 a month after taxes. So, incrementally, we keep getting further and further in debt as a few hundred here and there a month has built to $6k on top of our $5k debt for our wedding.

Admittedly, a lot of this has been on my poor planning and real life smacking me in the face with having a family and the $$$ costs of it after being an irresponsible bachelor for 10 years before taking everything on.

My GPA from my first time at college was a 1.1. I've raised it to a 2.1 with straight A's and B's in my 3 semester's since I've gotten back.

But, 2.1 GPA doesn't give much financial aid. This semester, I'm taking out full loans ($4800) and am getting $800 in Pell Grants. Leaves me about $1500 left over.

Considering hitting up a website like Simple Tuition and taking out $10k-$15k.

I would go to a cheaper smaller college for my basics...but I've already done my basics. A second job is difficult because of my classes Monday-Friday. My 30 hour bartending job is done Friday-Sunday. Then, my wife works 8am-8pm, so I have our daughter just myself until 8pm on days she works.

I AM going to graduate no matter what. WORST CASE scenario is swapping my major to MIS if the math classes get too overwhelming. The C++ programming has gone well so far. But, I'm still too elementary in my grasp to get my first internship quite yet (I did interview at Acxiom regardless a few months ago for one, but lacked experience).

But I HAVE to make sure my family is taken care of until I graduate in a couple of years.

It's just frustrating that we wouldn't be having problems if I dropped out of school and took on more work. But, i wouldn't make jack compared to a programming oriented degree if I stay in. I'm already close to $18k in student loan debt currently.

Not really too concerned with the amount of student loan debt because of my major.

What do I need to do for more $$ while I'm in school to help my family? /wallstreetbets is not an option lol"

I haven't had suicidal/self destructive thoughts or a breakdown since the year started! AND I haven't self harmed :)

I tried to kill myself / overdosed multiple times last year. I was hospitalized inpatient for one of my attempts in October-November. There were months on end I would just think about suicide non-stop every waking hour. 2018 was the most rock bottom year of my whole life. 

Long story short the year ended with me ruining a relationship (which was the most meaningful relationship I've had in my life...) that opened my eyes to how bad I was and gave me the push to geniunely want to improve myself for myself. It was the biggest wakeup call in my life honestly...

I feel happier than I ever have in years and I've been putting so much effort!!!
I go to bed on time for the most part and take melatonin to regulate my sleep.
I take showers regularly now.
I eat full breakfasts and lunches.
If I feel too tired to go through a day I push myself and then make the best of it and use positive reinforcement to bribe myself.
I just landed an internship at my school!!!
I'm learning how to cook and play instruments.
I'm trying harder to socialize and help people.
I'm getting more confident everyday.

I keep a bullet journal and it has a mood tracker...most of the days have been filled out as happy!!! I never knew I could be capable of that... :)

I'm getting better. 
I'm so proud of myself. 
❤💛💚💙💜

And if you've ever been in a similar stituation feel free to talk to me for tips or to vent. I gotchu. 😄💞"
aeto9j,3,2019-01-11,"How do I (19M) help my newly girlfriend (19F), help heal/cope with her past childhood/trauma?",_Bibly,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aeto9j/how_do_i_19m_help_my_newly_girlfriend_19f_help/,"Around 3 months ago I've (**19M)** met a girl online **(19F)**, and we've both connected, instantly. We liked the same music and hobbies, and most importantly each other. The one thing keeping us apart however, is our long distance (She lives in California, I live in Denver). Although we're far apart we've managed to text, play games online, video chat, literally everyday. Therefore, around 3 weeks ago I've asked her out to be my girlfriend and we made things exclusive. Since we both communicate everyday, cared for each other, loved spending time together, we've been extremely happy with each other.

**Character Backgrounds.**

Although our personalities and our individual are the same, our **upbringings are not.**

**Me -** Putting things in perspective for me. I'm currently living with my parents attending a University, with no past childhood scars and baggage, working out, being social, and financially stable and happy.

**Her,** lets call her **Ashley -** She's taking a gap year from school to take a break before entering college. She's financially stable, and is living in a safe environment with her best friend. Her past however, she has been through a lot and it brings her down, mentally.

Starting around a week and progressing till now, ""Ashley"" opened up about her past and what she's been through. Albeit, its a long list of past trauma and experiences, I think its important to list them...

**-** As a child her dad (who she was really close with, her hero) left the family for months.

**-** Divorced Parents

***-*** Mild Bipolar

**-** Close Relative Died in a Car Crash

**-** Been Cheated On

Although she has gone through all of this, she's been doing pretty well for herself productively. She works a day job due to her gap year, goes out with her roommate often, and is doing better than she has ever been. Nevertheless, the past still haunts her and her state is still far from OK.

Ashley to me when shes Ashley, is amazing! She's funny, wild, beautiful, and caring. But there are days when she has anxiety attacks from her past, days of depression, feeling worthless, and days of shutting in completely from social interaction.

**Plot**

Shortly after connecting and meeting, there was something there between us. We talked about our lives and we would have endless nights of playing video games, talking, sharing music, it was an absolute bliss to be with one another. Realizing this, Ashley opened up to me about her past traumas and it broke my heart. Apparently to Ashley, only a handful of people know what she's going through: her mom, her roommate, some cousins, and now... me. At the time we were just friends, and having her dump this on me made me feel great sympathy for her and made me realize what I meant to her. Keep in mind, that I really liked her too and we considered each other great friends at the time. I reassured her that life is better now, its going to be a long road, but you will be stronger in than end. I gave her my number, and whatnot telling her that if she needed help or comfort she could just call me.

She would have days of laying in the bathtub listening to music, crying. She would have days of her in bed feeling useless. She would have days of her feeling lonely and having sudden anxiety attacks. It hurts to see someone have to deal with this much pain, especially someone you cared about.

Suddenly 1 month after we've met and talked a whole lot, she opened up to me that she liked me, and I said the same.

In that voice call she told me tears that I couldn't be with her, because she said she was  ""screwed for life and I would drag your life down."" She told me in tears to forget about her and to move on with my life. I didn't, I reassured her again, and this time, I told her how much she really meant to me. Even though she has her moments, most of the time she's amazing to be around with and I actually really liked her too, despite all of the past bullshit, I never defined her like that. After telling her all of it, she told me no one has ever said anything like that to her, and I knew then. I would help her one way or another.

After 2 months of talking, spending time with her, comforting her in times in need, I was in love. I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes with a warning that she comes with a lot of past scars and problems and was afraid of me dumping her because of it.

**Disclaimer**: I knew what I was heading into, a girl with a lot of time investment and comfort to be put in place. This is going to take years of healing and acceptance of what happened. But when establishing lines, I made my point clear that if she's going to be with me then I would want to make her happy and heal her from her past scars and traumas and make us the best people we could be. Its going to a be long road, but its a road I'm willing to take for her. I established meeting with her during Spring Break of school in around 3 months time.

Although she takes a ton of my time, I know what to keep in check: My happiness, academics, internships, friends, and working out. So far, both college and Ashley take a lot of my time, but I still hold up well.

**Problem**

During the last 2-3 months, the way Ashley coped with these feelings of anxiety, depression, and uselessness was just brazing through it or talking to me. Apparently, it makes all the past bullshit fade away and makes her happy. These past two weeks, we have started to talk more actually and cared for one another, but now, she sometimes resorts to alcohol and smoking weed to stop her from hurting. (She didn't do it often before) I don't mind either of those coping mechanisms, but I don't want it to get to the point of her depending on them as a need rather than a substitute. She also has anxiety attacks of how I might cheat on her or something bad happening that could end all.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to help/say/do to heal her in the meantime to stray away from these things?

What can I do from this distance to tell her she has nothing to worry about?

General help for her happiness?

Where do I start?

**General Tips/Guidance**

Thanks!

 **tl;dr:** I'm happy, got my life straightened out. Girlfriend isn't, she holds a lot of past traumas that hurts and interferes with her life. She has days of uselessness, depression, anxiety from past events.  Its going to take years to heal something like this, but I want to help ASAP. What can I do?

aeuh5k,40,2019-01-11,"nmom keeps complaining my grandma with end-stage cancer is being selfish because she won't die, and refuses to let me or my father fly to see grandma before she passes (docs say ~a month) :(( what should I do???",NegativethingsACCT,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/aeuh5k/nmom_keeps_complaining_my_grandma_with_endstage/,"My dad's mother, my grandma, is such an awesome lady. She basically raised me when I was a kid, and she would take me to kindy and make the best noodles and casserole, and always knit me cute things. (Both my grandmas are great, but my Nmom's mother is healthy as ever.) My dad is basically an enabler-- he argues with her about her being ""unreasonable"" but sticks up for my Nmom, when talking about her to me/my siblings or my grandparents. 

My family is Chinese. My Nmom is your typical asian narcissist mother-- she physically hurts me (has smashed a spanner onto my knuckle, needing stitches; held me in place while she sliced my lower arm with a swiss army knife; forced me to kneel on gravel for \~4hrs during winter; throwing boiling tea in my face; etc), calls me fat (I'm 5'7 and 115lbs), tells me no man will want me, is racist and yells slurs at Indians, treated me like a servant all my life, keeps a book of all the money I ""owe"" her for raising/birthing me, has called the police on me, blames me for killing her fetus when she had an abortion a few days after beating the sht out of me, picks my scabs (from her beatings) so they never heal even when I tell her to stop as she just does it when I fall asleep, etc etc etc. 

My post isn't about all that however. Honestly, I thought that I could just be VLC with her, give her money (she basically forces me to give her my internship earnings), visit on holidays etc. But these three weeks with her has seriously been the last straw. She is always talking about how we should ""respect her"" but she seriously deserves no respect. 

My grandma (on dad's side) lives in China, while we live in Australia. She developed lung cancer four years ago, and has, until the last few months, lived a pretty active/normal life. In Nov/Dec, the cancer has spread to her bones, and is currently spreading to her brain. She is in a lot of pain. Chinese hospitals aren't the best (especially compared to western ones) and despite us trying to get her the best pain meds and doctors, my aunt (who lives in China) tells us grandma is still in so much pain and can barely open her eyes/talk right now. It scares me so much to even think about my grandma like that, I always remember her as strong and capable, and it scares me so much to never be able to speak with her or eat her noodles again. My aunt and dad both agree that at least me and my dad should go back to China and see grandma before she passes, and I really do want to. Since the cancer has spread to her brain, she likely only has a month or so to live, and probably less time when she is conscious.  

However, my mother won't shut up and stop making this ALL ABOUT HER. Long story short, she constantly complains to me and my dad that grandma is being rude and disrespectful to Nmom for causing issues and wasting ""more"" money in our family, especially since ""we had to give her so much money for treatment, and now for no reason, what a waste."" She also refers to my grandma as 'annoying"" and my aunt as ""psycho btch slut who fks around and is trying to destroy my family"" because my aunt keeps bringing up that dad and I should come home. She laments about ""if only my btch of a mother in law could die like a cat or something...act happy and normal and then just crawl off alone and die."" She constantly calls my grandma ""ban si bu huo de"" which means half dead half alive literally, but has a negative connotation (lazy, slovenly, slob who doesn't take into consideration other, burden on society). She constantly complains about how grandma's cancer is grandma's own fault, and if that grandma has listened to her (Nmom) she wouldn't be ""a money-draining dead weight"" right now. my Nmom says that grandma's current state (which, recall, is extremely painful terminal cancer) is karma, ""huo gai,"" for what my grandma did to my Nmom-- that is, not listen to Nmom and do what Nmom says. This piece of ""advice"" Nmom seems to believe would've saved grandma was ""come to Australia and keep house for me and raise my kids"" which has nothing to do with curing cancer... Anyway, you get the point, Nmom will just gripe on about how inconsiderate grandma is for ""being half dead and draining my money...ugh why can't she die already,"" about how it is causing her so much stress and adding ""extra tasks into my day"", not taking into consideration that my dad and I are literally in so much distress about losing our mother/grandmother respectively.

No surprise that she won't let me or my dad go and visit grandma before she passes. Nmom says its because: 1. everyday dad is not working is a day we lose $XXXX and my Nmom has expensive tastes, 2. I am already a source of money drain and waste since I go to private college in the US but still subpar (most likely since I spent so much time with slut-auntie and btch-grandma), 3. she can't understand why we would want to go see grandma because in Nmom's words ""it would be boring and yuck, you'll be in the hospital all day."" I suspect she is also jealous of the attention we are (justifiably) paying grandma's situation, since she also whines about how no one is caring about her or talking about how tired she is or the sacrifices she made raising me (bare legal minimum) and keeps sulking ""if you love your precious grandma so much why don't you get her to pay for your college?"" etc. If we forcefully go to China, Nmom says, she will ""drive into the ocean with your sisters."" She has beaten me and one of my sisters unconscious before so I'm pretty sure Nmom is capable of actually following through. 

I don't think Nmom understands the concept of death, and the fact that she one day will die/may be sick and maybe would like family to visit her...Seriously guys I can't go NC on this situation, any techniques to try and get her to say yes to letting us see grandma?? tysm"

The two figures standing in the kitchen could not have been more contrasting.  At a little over 6 foot tall, with the broad shouldered build of a weightlifter, Jay was almost half a foot taller than his, slender yet similarly athletic cousin.  Where he took after their mothers’ side of the family with blonde hair and sharp, blue eyes; Francesca’s features were almost entirely from her father’s side.  Brown, wavy hair currently tied up in a messy bun on the top of her head, with green eyes and skin that tanned easily

“Please?” Francesca clasped her hands together as she looked up at her cousin. “Pleeeaaaase?” She begged again, her green eyes growing more and more puppy dog with each second. 

Jay rolled his own eyes, tired of the constant badgering. “Dude! I said no” he finally replied, frustrated. 

Francesca opened her mouth wide and took a deep, exaggerated breath. 
“Please-please-please-please-please-please-please-please-please-please-please-pleeeeeeaaasss..”

The verbal barrage finally came to an end as she ran out of breath, he voice trailing off to a high pitched wine and her face going red. 

Her cousin watched on arms folded and eyebrow raised, unimpressed with the display. 

“Are you done?” He asked, turning back to stir the simmering pot.  
“You *know* I’m not!” She retorted, reaching up to her hair and pulling it out of the bun. “I can keep this up for weeks” She smiled a confident and cheeky smile. “Or have you forgotten what birthdays were like at home?”

Jay had *not* forgotten what birthdays were like.  His cousin was certainly not spoilt - it was difficult to be spoilt coming from a single parent family living on the breadline - but she was stubborn and determined.  If she wanted something, it was a fairly safe bet that she would get it.   He knew what was coming. He pursed his lips, exhaling loudly. 
“Why? Why do you want it so badly?” He asked, turning around with his arms outstretched, exasperated. 

“Because I want what we used to have when we were younger! Before you moved away and left me!” She tried guilt tripping him, pushing the emphasis back into him. 

“You mean went to university?” The eyebrow of suspicion raised again

“Potato-potahto” she shrugged, changing tact without batting an eyelid. “We had fun and we were really close! It will be fun again”

“We still do have fun! You’re here every other day anyway” Jay responded, no longer riled.  He was accustomed to batting away his younger cousin’s points. She could carry on like this until most people had given her what she wanted and begged her to stop. 

“Yes but how much better would it be if I was *living* here? How ..”

“Frank” He said curtly, cutting her short. “It’s me. So cut the bullshit.  Why does it mean so much to you?”

“I *do* want to live with you.” She started holding her hands out, palms facing Jay as if trying to reduce the impact of her statement. “But most of all I want to live away from Mum.  She’s starting seeing someone so it’s kinda awkward.  Plus I’m 19 and I want my own space”. Her voice was calmer now and her face was different too.  As if she had removed her mask or dropped an act.  “And you know what mum’s like.  She’s overprotective of me. But with you..” she paused, smiling at her cousin. “With you, she would definitely let me move out.”

Jay watched her carefully, softening as he felt her finally telling the truth.  It all added up now.  Her mum was always protective of her, fearing that she would make the same mistakes she did and wanting to stop her from being hurt.   Especially so in the last year, since Francesca’s break up.  He had mistreated her and the way it hurt Francesca only exacerbated her mum’s natural instincts.  But she trusted her nephew, who had spent most of his teenage years looking after his younger cousin while her mum worked double shifts or nights.  So much so that she would likely feel happier with her daughter living with him than at home. 

He sighed, realising how much his cousin had been through and how unjust her mother’s treatment of her was at times. She was a smart and strong young lady, more than capable of taking care of herself. 
He ran his hands through his hair and let them rest on the top of his head, his face half grimacing. 

“You pay *full* rent. Every month, never late.  Any parties have to be cleared with me in advance.  As for guys..” he stopped, struggling to find the right words and deal with the thought of his own cousin having boys over.  He needn’t have bothered trying.  Such was her excitement and relief at Jay finally relenting that Francesca threw herself at him, interrupting him.  

Brown wavy hair blurred Jay’s vision as she bundled into him with enough force to force him back a pace.  Her arms wrapped around him as she buried her face into the muscles of his chest.  His strong arms finally closed around her and she had to stifle a moan.  Feeling safer and happier than anywhere else, she clung on for as long as she could without seeming weird. 

“Next time you want something Frank, just come out and be honest with me ok?”

“I *do* want to live with you!” She repeated, her green eyes glinting as she smiled up at him. *A lot..* she thought to herself.  *more than I should want it*

“But I’m sorry. I promise from now on I’ll be more open with you about what I want..”

“Like maybe a housewarming party? Well not party, gathering! Just the girls?”


____

I hope you liked the intro! Here’s a little info that either wasn’t included, or wasn’t in much detail:

Jay and Francesca are cousins (their mothers are sisters) who grew up in the same neighbourhood.  Both their dads are no longer around and since their mums worked shifts or two jobs, they hung out at each other’s houses a lot.  Jay being around 4 years older meant that from around the of 15 he was often looking after his cousin alone, 2-3 evenings per week. From this they developed a close, almost sibling-like relationship with Francesca often looking up to and idolising her cousin.  They have plenty of jokes and good natured ribbing. 


Francesca is smart, quick witted and caring.   She excelled at school in particular in any debates, where her quick thinking would often tie others in knots. 
She wasn’t part of the cliche popular crowd that is evident in most schools, but had a good close circle of friends, with whom she’s still close. 
She was a good sport at school, part of the track and field team as well as playing some volleyball
She got decent grades and decided against university because of the cost. Instead she works as an intern (not decided that detail yet!)
With regards to her love life, she’s had one boyfriend who turned out to be cheating on her with at least two others.  This crushed her and she hasn’t dated in any way since.   After this her feelings for Jay intensified. She knows that Jay will likely not have the same feelings for her initially. But having seen some of his subconscious glances towards her, she’s confident that she can wear him down. 
She’s very pretty, with brown hair, green eyes and is slightly tanned.  This could be because of mixed heritage (white and black or Hispanic perhaps) or because her father had darker features. Around 5’6 with a slender, athletic figure.  She has toned thighs, a slim waist, wears a c cup and possesses a surprisingly firm and peachy ass. 


Jay is intelligent, sporty and incredibly mature for his age.  Growing up as part surrogate big brother, part man of the house he soon learned to work diligently at everything he did.  It also gave him a steady head when it came to dealing with Francesca.  
He excelled at sports, but because of his good grades and responsibilities at home, rarely was seen as a true jock.

Hey GoG,

I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a while now, although I never really posted anything here. I've been tempted to make a post before, writing it halfway then removing it because I decided ""I didn't need the game that badly, other people out there probably want their games atleast as badly"".

But this is a game I just can't wait for. I've been hyped about it for a while. Almost decided to buy the Xbox 360 version instead, but decided to wait for this to release. 

I haven't been a Tales fan for a really long time, but I've been a Tales fan since I started playing Berseria. (Their previous game in the series). The art style, and story telling are really good. I've always enjoyed the more happy and colourful art style compared to the gritty and grey style a lot of games have. I actually enjoyed the game so much that I ended up buying Zestiria and Symphonia on steam as well. I really enjoyed both the game and the anime(Zestiria), and although the gameplay from Symphonia didn't age as well, it wasn't bad by any means at all.

So I'd like to stick with the franchise and keep playing their games, and if I had any kind of money or time available to me, I'd find a way to go and get it myself. But sadly I'm currently working a 9 to 5 internship 5 days a week. And I don't get paid anything. On top of that my weekends are spend on an admission assignment to continue going to school. Otherwise I'd just try to find a week-end job. On top of that, Christmas recently hit a big hole in my bank account, and its a huge struggle to get breakfast and lunch every day.

Pretty much comes down to broke college student with not enough time to find a job that would hire for that little hours. But I really love this franchise and if someone out there feels like being extremely generous, I'll pay it forward one day. (If there's any further questions, I wouldn't mind answering them!)

Kind Regards,
Dusk

The two figures standing in the kitchen could not have been more contrasting.  At a little over 6 foot tall, with the broad shouldered build of a weightlifter, Jay was almost half a foot taller than his, slender yet similarly athletic cousin.  Where he took after their mothers’ side of the family with blonde hair and sharp, blue eyes; Francesca’s features were almost entirely from her father’s side.  Brown, wavy hair currently tied up in a messy bun on the top of her head, with green eyes and skin that tanned easily

“Please?” Francesca clasped her hands together as she looked up at her cousin. “Pleeeaaaase?” She begged again, her green eyes growing more and more puppy dog with each second. 

Jay rolled his own eyes, tired of the constant badgering. “Dude! I said no” he finally replied, frustrated. 

Francesca opened her mouth wide and took a deep, exaggerated breath. 
“Please-please-please-please-please-please-please-please-please-please-please-pleeeeeeaaasss..”

The verbal barrage finally came to an end as she ran out of breath, he voice trailing off to a high pitched wine and her face going red. 

Her cousin watched on arms folded and eyebrow raised, unimpressed with the display. 

“Are you done?” He asked, turning back to stir the simmering pot.  
“You *know* I’m not!” She retorted, reaching up to her hair and pulling it out of the bun. “I can keep this up for weeks” She smiled a confident and cheeky smile. “Or have you forgotten what birthdays were like at home?”

Jay had *not* forgotten what birthdays were like.  His cousin was certainly not spoilt - it was difficult to be spoilt coming from a single parent family living on the breadline - but she was stubborn and determined.  If she wanted something, it was a fairly safe bet that she would get it.   He knew what was coming. He pursed his lips, exhaling loudly. 
“Why? Why do you want it so badly?” He asked, turning around with his arms outstretched, exasperated. 

“Because I want what we used to have when we were younger! Before you moved away and left me!” She tried guilt tripping him, pushing the emphasis back into him. 

“You mean went to university?” The eyebrow of suspicion raised again

“Potato-potahto” she shrugged, changing tact without batting an eyelid. “We had fun and we were really close! It will be fun again”

“We still do have fun! You’re here every other day anyway” Jay responded, no longer riled.  He was accustomed to batting away his younger cousin’s points. She could carry on like this until most people had given her what she wanted and begged her to stop. 

“Yes but how much better would it be if I was *living* here? How ..”

“Frank” He said curtly, cutting her short. “It’s me. So cut the bullshit.  Why does it mean so much to you?”

“I *do* want to live with you.” She started holding her hands out, palms facing Jay as if trying to reduce the impact of her statement. “But most of all I want to live away from Mum.  She’s starting seeing someone so it’s kinda awkward.  Plus I’m 19 and I want my own space”. Her voice was calmer now and her face was different too.  As if she had removed her mask or dropped an act.  “And you know what mum’s like.  She’s overprotective of me. But with you..” she paused, smiling at her cousin. “With you, she would definitely let me move out.”

Jay watched her carefully, softening as he felt her finally telling the truth.  It all added up now.  Her mum was always protective of her, fearing that she would make the same mistakes she did and wanting to stop her from being hurt.   Especially so in the last year, since Francesca’s break up.  He had mistreated her and the way it hurt Francesca only exacerbated her mum’s natural instincts.  But she trusted her nephew, who had spent most of his teenage years looking after his younger cousin while her mum worked double shifts or nights.  So much so that she would likely feel happier with her daughter living with him than at home. 

He sighed, realising how much his cousin had been through and how unjust her mother’s treatment of her was at times. She was a smart and strong young lady, more than capable of taking care of herself. 
He ran his hands through his hair and let them rest on the top of his head, his face half grimacing. 

“You pay *full* rent. Every month, never late.  Any parties have to be cleared with me in advance.  As for guys..” he stopped, struggling to find the right words and deal with the thought of his own cousin having boys over.  He needn’t have bothered trying.  Such was her excitement and relief at Jay finally relenting that Francesca threw herself at him, interrupting him.  

Brown wavy hair blurred Jay’s vision as she bundled into him with enough force to force him back a pace.  Her arms wrapped around him as she buried her face into the muscles of his chest.  His strong arms finally closed around her and she had to stifle a moan.  Feeling safer and happier than anywhere else, she clung on for as long as she could without seeming weird. 

“Next time you want something Frank, just come out and be honest with me ok?”

“I *do* want to live with you!” She repeated, her green eyes glinting as she smiled up at him. *A lot..* she thought to herself.  *more than I should want it*

“But I’m sorry. I promise from now on I’ll be more open with you about what I want..”

“Like maybe a housewarming party? Well not party, gathering! Just the girls?”

I hope you liked the intro! Here’s a little info that either wasn’t included, or wasn’t in much detail:

Jay and Francesca are cousins (their mothers are sisters) who grew up in the same neighbourhood.  Both their dads are no longer around and since their mums worked shifts or two jobs, they hung out at each other’s houses a lot.  Jay being around 4 years older meant that from around the of 15 he was often looking after his cousin alone, 2-3 evenings per week. From this they developed a close, almost sibling-like relationship with Francesca often looking up to and idolising her cousin.  They have plenty of jokes and good natured ribbing. 


Francesca is smart, quick witted and caring.   She excelled at school in particular in any debates, where her quick thinking would often tie others in knots. 
She wasn’t part of the cliche popular crowd that is evident in most schools, but had a good close circle of friends, with whom she’s still close. 
She was a good sport at school, part of the track and field team as well as playing some volleyball
She got decent grades and decided against university because of the cost. Instead she works as an intern (not decided that detail yet!)
With regards to her love life, she’s had one boyfriend who turned out to be cheating on her with at least two others.  This crushed her and she hasn’t dated in any way since.   After this her feelings for Jay intensified. She knows that Jay will likely not have the same feelings for her initially. But having seen some of his subconscious glances towards her, she’s confident that she can wear him down. 
She’s very pretty, with brown hair, green eyes and is slightly tanned.  This could be because of mixed heritage (white and black or Hispanic perhaps) or because her father had darker features. Around 5’6 with a slender, athletic figure.  She has toned thighs, a slim waist, wears a c cup and possesses a surprisingly firm and peachy ass. 


Jay is intelligent, sporty and incredibly mature for his age.  Growing up as part surrogate big brother, part man of the house he soon learned to work diligently at everything he did.  It also gave him a steady head when it came to dealing with Francesca.  
He excelled at sports, but because of his good grades and responsibilities at home, rarely was seen as a true jock. 
He left town for three years on a sports scholarship and attained a good degree. However regularly returned to see his family and kept up correspondence with his cousin over Skype and FaceTime.  She refers to this as him leaving them, but they both know it’s only a joke
He’s the only one who is allowed to call her Frank rather than Francesca or Frankie. 
He has short blonde hair, piercing blue eyes and a short beard.  Years of sport and weightlifting have added muscle to an athletic and large frame.  He’s by no means a model, but his overall looks make him quite good looking.

aeve1l,2,2019-01-11,Steps to take when deciding my future (within the next week),giraffeman3705,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/aeve1l/steps_to_take_when_deciding_my_future_within_the/,"So I'm facing two dilemmas, one specifically related to Personal Finance, one just slightly related but still relevant,so I'll start with that:
1. I recently got a job offer (NYC, but I live in Long Island) for 80k, 401k, healthcare, dentalcare, 18PTO, 8 holidays, working 9-6 1 hour lunch in the middle. The deadline for the offer is next friday. At the same time, I'm currently at an internship which is looking to hire me (I'm here until the end of January) but I know for a fact that they're planning on offering me less than the first offer I got. I'm on good terms with the boss, so what's the best way to go about telling him the offer I got and seeing what he can offer, without it getting awkward for the rest of my internship? 

2. Assuming I accept the first offer- what are the best steps to take with regards to saving up and planning? Here are some other details I know will be important for people to know:
1. I have around $5,000 in student loans.
2. I will be commuting by train, and i calculated that if I park at a station it will cost me for parking+monthly pass around $4,600.
3. I will be living at home for at least the first year so rent, food, etc. will be out of the equation.

I was thinking of saving up immediately and paying my student loans as quick as possible, and then start putting as much as I can into the 401k and my savings accounts. Is there a certain amount or ""sweet spot"" of putting away at this point in my life?

I appreciate any help that comes my way!!

Any other questions or things I didn't clarify, let me know.

so I'm a pretty introspective guy who came a long way from almost inceldom to the chadness, and I still have some insecurity issues which I deal OK with.

but these last days, I've been feeling like shit for absolutely no reason. 

I'm back into killer workouts after the holidays, lost a lot of fat, back into my internship and into doing my graduation tesis. but something does not feel right

last year was a pretty tough year for me. it started with my first long-term relationship coming to an end, then I had health problems, then job problems, then my brother had to go to a psychiatric hospital after we fought and he broke my nose, I had to take care of the house and my father while my mom was with my lil bro, then I had problems with my parents, then I started another relationship with an awesome girl which had lots of communication issues but seem to be doing fine now.

but I don't know, things are weird now. I don't feel as secure as I was feeling before,  and there's no reason to it. sometimes I get anxious for no reason and my mind start making me imagine terrible things happening to me.

I start remembering being bullied, then I remember some shit my ex gf did to me, then I start thinking my actual gf is betraying me even tho there's no reason to suspect she's doing anything, but that fear just comes outta nowhere. she's pretty outgoing and lives kinda far away, and that kinda scares me because everyone who was ever my friend is an introvert, I don't understand outgoing people. but there's no reason to keep thinking about it. then I start feeling ugly, alone and not desired by anyone, even tho the stacies at work and at gym have been staring and flirting with me even more and I see in the mirror that I'm more ripped than I've ever been.

this shit used to happen when I was younger and had deppression, but I thought I grew out of it. but it seems this week my brain just chose to make me feel like shit and there's no reason why. in the last weeks, life's been sweet. I'm doing alright with my family, my friends, my gf and my gains, so why do I feel bad?

It feels almost like an urge for something really fucked up to happen

maybe it is a self sabotage instinct people who were losers like me have? wtf is happening? I just want to stop torturing myself over things that are not happening."

[SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Koch_candidates,_2016) identifies him as receiving some money directly from the Kochs and endorsement from yet another think tank 'Concerned Women for America'.

And now [here](https://twitter.com/nathanTbernard/status/1083408272579809280) is Ben Shapiro trying to back track on his prior support for King. [Shapiro](https://old.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/9ig7q3/the_kochs_and_the_altright/?st=jqh496em&amp;sh=02117718) has been sponsored by the Koch funded Young Americas Foundation and attended TurningPointsUSA events, TPUSA is also Koch funded.

A. Noblebright and JRPG-esque High Fantasy
---

Highspirited action and JRPG-esque noblebright adventure with a [steely, defiant “*‘Fuck you!’* positivity”](https://www.vidble.com/vgvGIykb9h.png) that explore/subvert/affectionately tease typical RPG and fantasy tropes is my general cup of tea. Think the classic Dungeons and Dragons, Order of the Stick, Skies of Arcadia, Legend of Zelda, or a lighter and softer Final Fantasy Tactics. I'd also be interested in some classic damsel-in-distress roleplay (the classic imperiled princess/priestess, *par example*) in a humorous/comedic, lighthearted and wholly consensual fashion. As I vaguely remember reading somewhere, the desired endgame is ""inflicting"" pleasure on the ""distressed damsel"". Blindfolds, light bondage (bound in silk scarves and fuzzy handcuffs--in more fantastical settings, there can easily be playful eroticism in testing someone's self-control and restraint while thus bound), playful snarky teasing and dirty talk, a few droplets of hot wax dripping across the body while hands and soft/feathery/silken things glide across the skin unseen, use of magic/powers, etc. 

☠ *What I'll Pass On:* ☠ ""Grim and gritty"" Game of Thrones/The Witcher-esque dark fantasy; low or no-magic settings; painfully helpless/naïve/ignorant/defenseless damsels-in-perpetual-distress with zero self-determination or self-agency (sexually and otherwise); sexually naïve/ignorant ingenues who want my character to figure out what they want before they know they want it

◆ A comedic romantic/smutty interlude between two wandering adventurers, particularly involving any of these generic pairings (think any two typical RPG-type classes): High priestess x guardian; priest x sorceress; ranger x cleric; templar or paladin x rogue or bard; warrior royalty x magic-using royalty; Magic user x magic user

◆ A line inspired by either of these two images: [Image 1](https://www.vidble.com/gsA9XOQTcz.jpg), [Image 2](https://www.vidble.com/bpaG1S4ojG.jpg)

◆ A princess/priestess wanting to play the role of imperiled damsel--be it out of a kinky side, genuine curiosity about what it entails or something else--entices her villainous archnemesis or sorcerous lover into being her wicked kidnapper. 

◆ An imperiled damsel/princess/priestess, still imprisoned by her former captor's binds, decides to have a little fun and offer herself to her hero. Or for a twist, the hero ends up fumbling the job and the princess manages to save herself in the confusion (or he ends up being bound somehow); either way, she decides to enjoy her reward.

◆ A kidnapping is prearranged between a princess/priestess and her lover for some erotic kinky roleplay. (Alternately, they try it and it becomes a comedy of errors; perhaps he's inept as a kidnapper or the lady is just horrible at playing the role of a helpless damsel.) 

**Some Desired Canons:** Belle (Disney's *Beauty and the Beast*); Elsa (Disney's *Frozen*); Jasmine (Disney's *Aladdin*); Esmeralda (Disney's *Hunchback of Notre Dame*); Princess Peach, Princess Daisy (*Mario*); Zelda, Cia, Impa, Twili!Midna (*Zelda*); Yuna (*Final Fantasy X*); Cosmos (*Dissidia Final Fantasy*); Princess Ovelia, Celia, Meliadoul, Agrias Oaks (*Final Fantasy Tactics*); Jessica Albert (*Dragon Quest 8*)

B. Older Woman x Younger Male Dynamics
---

There's something to be said about an intelligent, confident--and seductive--older woman (be she a MILF or a silver vixen) with curves taking a capable younger man under her wing so to speak. I would like to explore some older woman x younger man pairings in a relationship full of warmth, humor/banter, passion, seduction, loving sensuality and (at times) playing up the maternal/motherly affection!

☠ *What I'll Pass On:* ☠ Abusive/degrading femdom; hyper-sadistic women who can only achieve orgasm when my character’s stripped of all self-worth or bleeding out on the floor

As for some prompts...

◆ Office shenanigans between a older female boss and younger male employee, or between co-workers. Perhaps a boss gives an interviewing assistant a desk job to perform while they go down on them to test the new hire’s ability to multitask (or vice-versa to test said hire's...linguistic talents). Two frisky employees decide to fool around in the boss’ office when the boss is away on a business trip. Colleagues with unspoken mutual attraction for one another are paired up to work on a long-term project together into  the late hours of the night. Stuff of that nature.

◆ Person B is an intern has a genuine professional respect for the older woman (Person A)'s accomplishments and intelligence (not wanting to jeopardize this golden academic opportunity), and finds himself increasingly attracted  to her. Further, he has a fondness of women wearing stockings or pantyhose. While he doesn’t outright stare, he finds it odd that one  day, he can’t tear his eyes away from the sheathed, long legs of Person A, but thinks he was discreet in his observations. Unfortunately, that  was ill-assumed, as she approaches him with an...interesting proposal. 

◆ Two frisky college students or professors sneak into an empty classroom after school or into the restricted section of the library to hook up. (I'd be open to this being in the *Harry Potter*-verse--would love to find someone willing to play as Ginny, Hermione or Pansy in such a scenario--with all parties appropriately aged up and the inclusion of magic.)

C. A Few One-Shot Prompts (can be added to any of the above)
---

* ""I see you’ve been using the copy machine for...explicit purposes.""
* ""Are you trying to turn me on right now? Because it’s working.""
* ""You wanted to see me about my grades, professor?""
* Our characters have just gotten married and gone away to a private island paradise for their honeymoon. They spend their first night together as a married couple making love on the beach/in their honeymoon suite.
* After a teacher is disciplined by the principal for chronic lateness or some other minor offense, they seduce the loosely-moraled principal to get out of trouble.
* A concerned parent goes the extra mile to keep their child from failing a course by seducing the teacher at an after hours parent/teacher conference.
* Character A wants to impress Character B by baking them their favorite dessert before they arrives home from work. Their significant other surprises them by coming home early and dessert ends up a little messier than planned.
* Knowing that work has been very stressful for his wife as of late, her husband has prepared a dinner meant to make her chill and calm. Various sweet dipping sauces, syrups and frostings, whipped cream, strawberries and all that can be used."

&amp;nbsp;    
Bij beantwoording de datum en ons kenmerk vermelden. Wilt u slechts één zaak in uw brief behandelen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hierbij bied ik u de antwoorden aan op de schriftelijke vragen die zijn gesteld door het lid Van Dijk &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; over het personeelstekort bij de IND.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Deze vragen werden ingezonden op 19 december met kenmerk 2018Z24306.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Staatssecretaris van Justitie en Veiligheid,   
&amp;nbsp;    
Mark Harbers  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden vragen van het lid J. van Dijk &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; aan de staatssecretaris van Justitie en Veiligheid over het personeelstekort bij de IND &amp;#40;ingezonden 19 december 2018, nr. 2018Z24306&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht dat de IND steeds vaker afwezig is in de rechtszaal en daardoor zaken verliest? 1&amp;#41; wat is uw reactie daarop?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, ik ken het bericht. Zie beantwoording hieronder.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat de IND in sommige gevallen, in 75% van de zaken, niet in de rechtbank komt opdagen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het genoemde percentage herkent de IND niet. Uit cijfers van de IND blijkt dat de IND vanaf april 2018 in 20% van de zaken niet aanwezig is geweest bij een zitting. In deze gevallen is een afweging gemaakt om niet ter zitting aanwezig te zijn en is voor de zitting een schriftelijk standpunt &amp;#40;verweerschrift&amp;#41; van de IND ingestuurd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is de standaardprocedure als de IND niet komt opdagen in de rechtbank? Loopt een zaak automatisch vertraging op en zo ja, hoelang?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er is geen sprake van automatische vertraging van de beroepszaak door de afwezigheid van de IND. Een zitting zal ook zonder aanwezigheid van de IND doorgang vinden. Als de IND afwezig is bij een zitting dan zal de rechter in eerste instantie bezien of hij door middel van alle in het dossier aanwezige stukken, waaronder de schriftelijke reactie van de IND, voldoende geïnformeerd is om over de zaak te beslissen. Als dat niet het geval is dan kan er een korte extra termijn gemoeid zijn met het beantwoorden van schriftelijke vragen die ter zitting zijn gerezen en die bij afwezigheid van de IND niet beantwoord konden worden. Doorgaans wordt daar enkele dagen voor gegeven. Ook in zaken waarin de IND wel verschijnt komt het voor dat er schriftelijke vragen worden gesteld waardoor de procedure wat langer kan duren.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoeveel openstaande vacatures zijn er momenteel bij de IND? Kunt u deze uitsplitsen naar type werk en op welke contractbasis het werk wordt aangeboden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
In december 2018 is er ongeveer 50 fte uitgevraagd bij de detacheringsbureaus. Dit betreft functies voor de positie van medewerker voor het behandelen van aanvragen om een verblijfsvergunning bij het primair proces. Het gaat hierbij om zowel extra capaciteit als vervanging van externen die vertrokken zijn. Daarnaast zijn er op dit moment circa 50 openstaande vacatures bij de IND zelf voor allerlei posities. Twintig vacatures hebben betrekking op de functie voor de positie van medewerker voor het behandelen van aanvragen om een verblijfsvergunning bij het primair proces.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Verder breidt de IND de komende periode structureel uit met circa 35 fte procesvertegenwoordigers. Het wervingsproces hiervoor is reeds gestart. De verwachting is dat de eerste nieuwe medewerkers rond februari 2019 zullen starten. Gezien de inwerkperiode, afhankelijk van de werksoort kan het een half jaar tot meer dan een jaar duren voor een nieuwe medewerker zelfstandig en volledig op ingezet kan worden, is de verwachting dat de eerste procesvertegenwoordigers na de zomer van 2019 volledig ingewerkt zijn.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor het behandelen van aanvragen om een verblijfsvergunning asiel bij het primair proces worden in 2019 150 extra medewerkers geworven. Vanwege het absorptievermogen van de IND, als het gaat om het opleiden en plaatsen van nieuwe medewerkers, gebeurt dit in verschillende tranches gedurende het jaar.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe lang blijven vacatures thans gemiddeld onvervuld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
In principe worden alle vacatures vervuld. Het is echter afhankelijk van de aard van de vacature &amp;#40;niveau, intern of extern, de duur van aangeboden contract, vast of tijdelijk, etc&amp;#41; hoe lang een vacature openstaat. De huidige situatie op de arbeidsmarkt maakt het in zijn algemeenheid wel lastiger om snel goed gekwalificeerd personeel te werven. Dit is overigens geen uniek probleem voor de IND.     
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe komt het dat het nog onvoldoende lukt extra personeel bij de IND aan te trekken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is niet zo dat het de IND niet lukt extra personeel aan te trekken. Echter, met het aantrekken van nieuw personeel is tijd gemoeid, niet alleen als het om het werven gaat maar ook als het gaat om opleiden en inwerken. Afhankelijk van de werksoort kan het een half jaar tot meer dan een jaar duren voor een nieuwe medewerker hier zelfstandig en volledig op ingezet kan worden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is er gedaan teneinde het werken bij de IND aantrekkelijker te maken? Zijn de salarissen bijvoorbeeld verhoogd en de secundaire voorwaarden verbeterd? Zo ja, met hoeveel en op welke manier? Zo nee, waarom niet en bent u bereid dit alsnog te doen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het algemeen geldt dat de IND valt onder de cao voor rijksambtenaren. Hierin zijn de &amp;#40;secundaire&amp;#41; arbeidsvoorwaarden vastgelegd. In deze cao zijn diverse maatregelen benoemd die het werken bij de Rijksoverheid aantrekkelijk maken. Daarnaast is de IND in 2018 gestart met het Programma Gezond en Vitaal. Met dit programma wil de IND bevorderen dat het een organisatie is waar medewerkers met plezier aan het werk zijn, vanuit hun vakmanschap weten wat hun toegevoegde waarde is voor de IND, weten wat daarvoor nodig is en daarin worden ondersteund.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De IND is gebonden aan het Functiegebouw Rijk. Alle functies bij de IND zijn, op basis van de criteria uit dit functiegebouw, beschreven en gewogen. Dit bepaalt uiteindelijk de arbeidsvoorwaarden conform ARAR.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De IND vindt het ook van belang om voor externen een goed werkgever te zijn. De IND wil daarom externe medewerkers zo veel mogelijk zekerheid geven en sluit waar mogelijk contracten af voor een langere periode. Daarnaast heeft de IND zowel in 2016 als in 2018 externen die langere tijd voor de IND werkten een vaste aanstelling aangeboden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het, dat de IND om het personeelstekort te dichten vaak onderbetaalde en tijdelijke krachten inhuurt? Waarom? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het, dat hiermee de wet op het uitzendwerk wordt overtreden? Wat onderneemt u hiertegen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8 en 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
De IND heeft te maken met een sterk fluctuerend werkaanbod. Om hierop in te kunnen spelen heeft de IND naast de medewerkers in vaste dienst behoefte aan flexibele medewerkers die al naar gelang het werkaanbod kunnen worden ingezet. Hiervoor werkt de IND samen met detacheringsbureaus.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De IND heeft in 2015 een openbare aanbestedingsprocedure uitgeschreven waarna drie detacheringsbureaus zijn geselecteerd &amp;#40;Yacht, USG en DPA&amp;#41;. Hierin is meegenomen dat de detacheringsbureaus zich moeten houden aan alle relevante wet- en regelgeving op het gebied van de inhuur van Personeel, zoals de Participatiewet, de Wet Werk en Zekerheid en de Wet Waadi. De IND heeft in de aanbestedingsprocedure de bureaus om één tarief gevraagd voor de gedetacheerde medewerkers waarin naast loonkosten ook onder meer reiskosten en opleidingskosten worden meegenomen. Welk tarief de detacheringsbureaus aan hun medewerkers betalen is destijds geen onderdeel geweest van de afspraken. Dit is ook gebruikelijk bij raamovereenkomsten voor externe inhuur. Het vereiste dat de bureaus zich aan de wet moeten houden moet voldoende borging zijn dat de medewerkers ofwel het zelfde loon krijgen als vaste medewerkers ofwel volgens de eigen cao betaald krijgen. De mogelijkheden hiertoe worden eveneens door de wet bepaald en beperkt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat in tijden van krapte op de arbeidsmarkt het niet verwonderlijk is dat er onvoldoende mensen dit uitzendwerk willen doen en dat het daarom van groot belang is dat mensen in vaste dienst en voor hetzelfde salaris in dienst worden genomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals in het antwoord op de voorgaande vraag reeds is aangegeven heeft de IND gezien de fluctuaties in het werkaanbod behoefte aan enige flexibiliteit en zal om die reden indien noodzakelijk altijd gebruik willen maken van het inhuren van medewerkers via detacheringsbureaus. De IND vindt het daarentegen ook belangrijk om een goede werkgever te zijn en goed personeel aan zich te binden. De IND heeft daarom in 2016 en in de afgelopen maanden veel gedetacheerden in vaste dienst genomen.

aex7xw,1,2019-01-11,Antwoord op vragen van het lid Alkaya over de bankierseed,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/aex7xw/antwoord_op_vragen_van_het_lid_alkaya_over_de/,"^(Vragen van het lid Alkaya &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; aan de minister van Financiën over de bankierseed &amp;#40;ingezonden 30 november 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1   
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het artikel “Gezworen Vijanden”? Wat is uw reactie op dit artikel?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Erkent u het beeld dat de bankierseed als effectief middel op losse schroeven wordt gezet door de inhoud van het artikel? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven welke sanctie er staat op het niet afleggen van de eed, terwijl het beroep van bankier wel wordt uitgeoefend?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vragen 1, 2 en 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is aan banken om ervoor te zorgen dat iedereen die bij een bank werkzaam is, waaronder de top, een eed of belofte aflegt en naleeft. DNB en de AFM houden hierop &amp;#40;risicogeoriënteerd&amp;#41; toezicht. Indien hiertoe aanleiding bestaat, zullen de toezichthouders maatregelen treffen, zoals het opleggen van een last onder dwangsom of een boete. Bij bestuurders en commissarissen is de uiterste consequentie bij het niet afleggen dan wel niet naleven van de eed of belofte heenzending, waardoor ze hun functie niet langer kunnen uitoefenen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Begin 2016 hebben DNB en de AFM onderzocht in hoeverre banken en verzekeraars het afleggen van de eed of belofte hebben georganiseerd en in hoeverre de eed of belofte daadwerkelijk is afgelegd. Hieruit kwam naar voren dat banken en verzekeraars veel aandacht besteden aan het goed inbedden van de bankierseed in hun organisatie en dat de eed of belofte kan bijdragen aan verdere bewustwording over de integriteit van de sector. Uit het onderzoek van de toezichthouders bleek dat banken en verzekeraars de invoering van de eed of belofte - ook voor de top - serieus hebben opgepakt en intern uitdrukkelijk aandacht besteden aan het belang, het nut en de noodzaak van het afleggen van de eed of belofte. Zo bereiden instellingen en hun medewerkers zich voor door informatieverstrekking, dialoogsessies, plenaire bijeenkomsten en teamsessies met leidinggevenden. De verdere inbedding van de eed of belofte wordt vaak gekoppeld aan een breder cultuur- en integriteitsprogramma, zo bleek verder uit het onderzoek van de toezichthouders.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Dat ook banken zelf zaken aandragen bij de Stichting Tuchtrecht Banken en deze leiden tot tuchtrechtelijke uitspraken is voor mij een indicatie dat de eed of belofte en het daaraan gekoppelde tuchtrecht bijdragen aan verdere normontwikkeling en bewustwording over de integriteit in de sector.    
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Beschouwt u het aanbieden van veel te riskante financiële producten en zelfs het witwassen van illegaal geld om massaal winst te maken als je “functie integer en zorgvuldig” uitoefenen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het gedrag van bankiers niet bijdraagt aan “het vertrouwen in de financiële sector te behouden en bevorderen”?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vragen 4 en 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik acht het aanbieden van veel te riskante financiële producten en het witwassen van illegaal geld uiterst ongewenst. Integriteit bij financiële ondernemingen moet niet alleen voorkomen dat de dienstverlening wordt gebruikt voor criminaliteit; het is ook een belangrijke voorwaarde voor het goed functioneren van een instelling en voor het vertrouwen in de sector. Het is primair aan de sector om vertrouwen te herstellen. Hiertoe moeten banken, zoals in mijn agenda financiële sector is aangegeven, ervoor zorgen dat ze stabiel, klantgericht en innovatief zijn en deze kernwaarden verankeren in hun cultuur. Daarvoor is het noodzakelijk dat de top het goede voorbeeld geeft. Zij moeten laten zien wat het betekent om een maatschappelijke antenne te hebben, wat klantgericht werken is en hoe er met wetten en regels moet worden omgegaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat heeft u daadwerkelijk verbeterd aan de bankierseed en de Stichting Tuchtrecht Banken sinds de hierover gestelde Kamervragen? Hoe lang zijn de tekortkomingen in de toepassing van de bankierseed al bij u bekend?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de beantwoording van de betreffende Kamervragen is aangegeven dat meldingen van consumenten die niet voor de Stichting Tuchtrecht Banken zijn gekomen in de regel voortkwamen uit een geschil met een bank &amp;#40;en de facto geen betrekking hadden op tuchtrechtelijk laakbaar handelen van een individuele medewerker waar het tuchtrecht voor bedoeld is&amp;#41;. Voor dergelijke geschillen, waar veelal het beleid van de bank ter discussie staat, hebben consumenten andere mogelijkheden. Consumenten kunnen hiervoor bijvoorbeeld naar KiFiD &amp;#40;het Klachteninstituut Financiële Dienstverlening&amp;#41; of naar de burgerlijke rechter. Ik acht het van belang dat ook consumenten de Stichting Tuchtrecht Banken weten te vinden en dat zoveel mogelijk onduidelijkheid over de bevoegdheden van de stichting en de werking van het tuchtrecht worden weggenomen. De Stichting Tuchtrecht Banken en KiFiD hebben in dit kader afspraken gemaakt. De Stichting Tuchtrecht Banken vermeldt, indien daar aanleiding toe is, in afwijzingsbrieven dat de gedraging waar de melding betrekking op heeft zich leent voor de behandeling door KiFiD of de burgerlijke rechter. Omgekeerd is in het reglement van KiFiD opgenomen dat klachten die bij het KiFiD zijn ingediend die zien op tuchtrechtelijk laakbaar handelen worden doorgestuurd naar het relevante tuchtrechtelijke college. Daarnaast heeft de Stichting Tuchtrecht Banken ter ondersteuning van consumenten die een melding willen doen een checklist ontwikkeld die ingevuld moet worden voordat een melding daadwerkelijk wordt ingediend en waarmee vooraf reeds duidelijkheid wordt verschaft over de geschiktheid van de melding voor de Stichting Tuchtrecht Banken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u ervan dat zowel de AFM als DNB het toezicht op het afleggen en naleven van de bankierseed de verantwoordelijkheid van banken zelf vindt? Bent u bereid het toezicht bij de AFM of DNB te leggen, nu blijkt dat de sector dit zelf niet afdoende doet? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De eed of belofte maakt onderdeel uit van de integere en beheerste bedrijfsvoering. Volgens de systematiek van de Wet op het financieel toezicht is de integere en beheerste bedrijfsvoering een aangelegenheid - en daarmee primaire verantwoordelijkheid - van de financiële onderneming. Het is aan banken om ervoor te zorgen dat iedereen die werkzaam is bij een bank een eed of belofte aflegt en naleeft. DNB en de AFM houden hierop al risicogeoriënteerd toezicht en bij ministeriële regeling zijn nadere regels gesteld, maar de verdere invulling van de aflegging en naleving van de eed of belofte is aan de onderneming zelf. Zo kan de eed of belofte aangevuld worden met het oog op de specifieke activiteiten van de onderneming of de functie van de persoon. Deze flexibele benadering bevordert de betrokkenheid van de onderneming en de medewerker bij de eed of belofte en daarmee ook de effectiviteit. Ik zie geen aanleiding hierin verandering te brengen. Dit geldt temeer nu een cultuurverandering niet alleen met wet- en regelgeving bevorderd kan worden. Integendeel, een gezonde cultuur moet juist komen vanuit de sector zelf.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Erkent u dat het funest is voor het vertrouwen in de financiële sector als bankiers en topbestuurders van banken zich niet aan de wet houden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is evident dat wet- en regelgeving moeten worden nageleefd en dat situaties waarin dat niet gebeurt het vertrouwen in de financiële sector schaden. Voor herstel van vertrouwen in de sector is van belang dat de sector laat zien dat zij haar speciale maatschappelijke rol en verantwoordelijkheden serieus neemt. Financiële ondernemingen moeten hun klanten en de samenleving vakkundig en fatsoenlijk bedienen. Ze moeten hierbij niet alleen naar de letter van wet- en regelgeving handelen, maar ook zelf verbetermogelijkheden onderkennen, initiatieven ontplooien die overtuigend tegemoetkomen aan maatschappelijke verwachtingen en hierover verantwoording afleggen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Erkent u tevens dat er door slecht of ontbrekend toezicht en de grote waarschijnlijkheid om niet persoonlijk vervolgd te worden door het niet naleven van wetten er een situatie ontstaat die zich kenschetst als ‘de kat op het spek binden’? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In Nederland zijn diverse mogelijkheden om financiële ondernemingen en personen werkzaam in de financiële sector aan te spreken ingeval van niet-naleving van wet- en regelgeving. Zo zien DNB en de AFM toe op de naleving van bestuursrechtelijke wet- en regelgeving en zullen zij - indien daartoe aanleiding bestaat - &amp;#40;handhavings&amp;#41;maatregelen treffen. Ook het civiele recht biedt mogelijkheden om de financiële sector via de burgerlijke rechter of KiFiD aan te spreken. Zo kan een consument schadevergoeding vorderen in geval van bijvoorbeeld schending van de &amp;#40;civielrechtelijke&amp;#41; zorgplicht. Daarnaast geldt het strafrecht voor iedereen die werkzaam is in de financiële sector. Tot slot kunnen bankmedewerkers ook tuchtrechtelijk aangesproken worden ingeval van tuchtrechtelijk laakbaar handelen.)

aexb7r,17,2019-01-11,"Let's combine forces to take down Jake Steiner's slander, lies and incomplete truths",Evartski,optometry,https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/aexb7r/lets_combine_forces_to_take_down_jake_steiners/,"Hello there. Today i come to you with a bit of a different post. One i hope will stir up a storm - in a good way.  


About me: i'm an optician-optometrist student in Belgium, in my 2nd year (of 3 years in total). Recently, i came across a video of someone trying to ""cure"" their myopia with the Bates method. I researched this (i mean; if there's a method that can ""cure"" myopia, that would be revolutionary!) and quickly found out that it was, to say the least, a scam. 

However, in their update video, they said they found a site called [endmyopia.org](https://enmyopia.org) where they found a new method. Intruiged yet again, i started reading on the site. Not to my surprise, i quickly found out that the site was based on scientific articles that only suited Jake Steiner's (the founder of the project) narrative. He's telling people that too much time reading or on an iPad (too much near work) can cause an muscle spasm in the ciliary muscle - which i believe to be correct. Up until here i have no problem with the site (except for maybe the selective choice of articles - but hey, he's not hurting anyone).  
When i watched some of his Youtube video's however (channel is youtube.com/endmyopia) , i quickly found out he's spreading around lies in them, telling people incomplete truths and just dragging optometrist's name and reliability through the mud (see end of this post). And that's where i have a problem with him and his project.  
I am studying very hard right now to become an optician and optometrist. I grew to love this profession very dearly and i am too proud of my (soon-to-be) profession, i love the colleagues which have taught me so much during internship too much to just see this happen. He's dragging our name through the mud to benefit his own cause. He's lying to people, he's manipulating them into buying his $99 guide to ""end people's myopia"".  
I realise it probably is vague, i'm not the best at storytelling, but please, if you find time in your schedules, read his site and watch some of his videos. I hope you are as repulsed as i am.  


What i'd love to see from you:  
\-First of all, comments/thoughts on this situation on this reddit - what can we, as a unit of optometrists do?;

\- Second of all, i'd love to see any lies and incomplete truths he's telling corrected with links to real, recent scientific articles (you know the drill from school) or trustworthy sites, books, etc. If it's a subject that has still a lot of debate around it, where scientist have not yet found the cause/solution/factors/..., i'd love to hear that as well;

\- Third of all, i'd love it if you call him out for it on social media. On twitter, i started the hashtags #endmyopiascam and #stopendmyopia which i put in almost every tweet towards the @endmyopia twitter account. (If you go look at the tweets, you'll see i'm demanding an apology from him towards us, our profession and his fans - for lying, telling incomplete truths and slandering our name and profession). On youtube, i started commenting everything wrong in his videos. He actually replied to my first comment (in which i made the point that minus lenses do NOT cause progressive myopia, perfect emmetropisation of myopia might cause the progression of myopia - not the same and which is why we're told to give the most positive lens that the patient can bear while still having a good visual acuity) but he deleted it soon after. He certainly knows of my existence and of my goal.  
\- Fourth of all, don't start cussing him out. yes, he's dragging our name through the mud and yes, i'm being harsh on twitter, but i'm not cussing him out. i'd rather call him out using logic and real science than call him out and cuss him out. We're the optometrists, we're the decent people, we're above him. Though that does not prevent you from being hard on him, from calling him out for everything.  


I'd like to end with some of the lies and incomplete truths he's spreading around: 

minus lenses cause progressive myopia, ""\[...\]all an optometrist does is measure the distance until there's blur"" (yes, that's a real quote); we measure the patient's eyes in a dark room so we can sneakily prescribe more minus; we use projectors because the Snellen chart is more blurry then (and then continues to make the point that more minus will make the Snellen letters clearer - which they won't, it's still an error in the projector); lies about the way #7 is (of the 21 point system) is performed (we constantly add more minus upon the habitual correction); he says being able to read about half of the 10/10 line (20/20) is enough (while it is not if we can acquire better); says patients should have demands about the lighting, the procedure etc.; our studies are not rocket science --&gt; saying everyone can just find everything on the internet --&gt; talking down on our studies; says we won't tell our patients what we're doing just so we can prescribe more minus and so on...  


Maybe this is a reach, i don't know, all i know is that i'm pissed off about this. Again, i am too proud of this profession to see it dragged by an ""eye guru"" - yes he calls himself that - on the internet.   
I hope you will stand with me. I will continue my fight for our name, for your name, regardless of what happens to this post.  
Keep prescribin'

(DS’s high school is 5year program, he will graduate with both a HS diploma and an associate’s degree). I asked him about the need for an advanced degree and he said that it wasn’t necessary in IT.

aey270,49,2019-01-11,Everyone my daughter loves goes missing,poloniumpoisoning,PPoisoningTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/comments/aey270/everyone_my_daughter_loves_goes_missing/,"When I became a father, my whole world started revolving around Marie. She was the most perfect, most treasured little thing in my world. We are kind of an unconventional family; my wife Taylor is a CEO, while I’m an artist and stay-at-home dad.

Taylor and my parents are people I cherish and am grateful for, but I felt like I never knew what love was until I held my little Marie in my arms for the first time. I know everyone thinks their kids are amazing and special, but believe me, Marie is amazing and special.

I had no problem living almost exclusively in order to take care of her, raise her, help her and please her. Marie is my whole universe. I was grateful for the precious being I was given.

I woke up in the middle of every night to feed her when she was a baby with a smile on my face. I taught her first words. I put her to bed with a princess story every single night as she grew up into a sweet kid. We became the best of friends, watching cartoons and chasing butterflies together.

Taylor was so thankful to be able to be a mother and still focus 100% on her career. She would come home every night to a hot meal, happy baby girl and overjoyed husband. I never knew a family as happy as ours – until the incidents started.

First it was Marie’s cousin, Victoria. They pretty much were born together, and spent the early years of their childhood constantly playing together and being really close. When Victoria and Marie were 5 years-old, Taylor’s sister announced she would move away to another state; being a single mother, she was too tight on money (even with Taylor helping), and was to move back to my in-laws house.  

Marie found out she wouldn’t be able to see Victoria more than thrice a year and cried her eyes out the whole night in my arms. We fell asleep in my rocking chair next to the break of morning. It was heartbreaking.

I hated seeing my perfect little angel cry; she seemed to be in so much pain. I promised her that we would visit Victoria. Marie would soon start going to school, and I assured her she would make a lot of new friends.

A few days after that, Victoria went missing. Everyone in the family was crazy after her, but nobody was able to find a clue. It was like the girl disappeared in thin air.

Taylor’s sister was devastated at first, but she followed up with the plan of moving away. She soon married a nice man and had another child. Taylor doesn’t talk much with her now because she thinks her sister moved on too fast and completely forgot about her first kid. Victoria was never seen again even after all these years, nor her remains were found.

As a family, we did our best to get over this tragedy together. Kids’ brains are amazing to process everything. After a few months, it was like my daughter was past her loss.

When Marie was in second grade, she was crazy about her teacher, Ms. Martinez. She was a fairly old lady, chubby and gentle, and treated all the kids like their own granddaughters (the school was girls-only). 

Her warm smile could make an adult feel tucked in a comfy bed with a teddy bear. She was the greatest and, despite her lovingness, the girls were perfectly disciplined and had amazing grades. It was like they thrived to keep being loved by Ms. Martinez.

Marie was raised without a constant presence of a grandmotherly figure; I moved from England to marry Taylor, while her parents live in another state and don’t visit too frequently. So you might imagine how overjoyed Marie was to finally have an older lady showering her with constant attention and unlimited affection.

But, being an older lady, Ms. Martinez was close to retirement. She clearly loved her job and was postponing this moment but, when she got sick, she had no option other than take a leave.

Marie freaked out, feeling abandoned and depressed. I assured her she would still see Ms. Martinez when she got better, but she didn’t; the school was more incisive about making her retire, and she had to agree.

Marie’s new teacher was way younger, perfectly nice and adequate. But Marie hated her guts because, in her 8-years-old little mind, she was just an intruder. A usurper.

Ms. Martinez went missing from the hospital just a few days after deciding to retire.

After that, little by little, we moved past against yet another traumatic experience. My heart was shattered to a million pieces when Marie asked why everyone she loved had to suddenly disappear. I could do nothing but promise her I wouldn’t.

I took Marie to a great therapist, and we even went to Disneyland, just the two of us. Marie and Taylor loved each other, but they weren’t super close; since my wife couldn’t take a break from her job often, most of our family fun times were just me and Marie, and they were perfect.

Being showered with all my love, Marie started to improve again, but she only got better when she became friends with Bruna; they were both 9 at the time.

Bruna was a classmate and lived nearby. She was a polite and easy-going girl, and I couldn’t be happier than to see my daughter excited to go to school again, and having such a good company.

This time, I thought the peace would last. Our family had amazing 4 years and 10 months, until Bruna, at age 14, announced she would go to an internship in France. It was her childhood dream and she finally got it. She would study abroad during the entire duration of high school.

Bruna called me uncle and I grew to like her like she was my real nice, but I couldn’t find in me to be happy for her accomplishment. I knew what would happen. I just knew it.

Marie, of course, was devastated. She felt abandoned and betrayed. I gently explained that she could still be friends with Bruna overseas, that they would have so much exciting things to share with each other, and that Bruna still loved her and cherished her as a most important friend, but it was an once in a lifetime opportunity to fulfill her lifelong dream. I emphasized how we should be happy and proud for her, and that Marie could spend all her vacations in France if she wanted.

After our constant talks about it, Marie seemed to deal better with this loss. I never felt more relief than when the day of Bruna’s trip came and nothing happened to her. Some hours later, Bruna texted me “uncle, arrived at the airport. Getting a cab now!”

But she never got in the cab. She simply vanished from the airport.

Up to that moment, that was the loss that I grieved the most. Poor little Bruna, just 14 and full of dreams. This hit Taylor and me really hard but, strangely, Marie seemed almost fine with the disappearance and possible death of her best friend.

Bruna’s tragedy brought together Marie and her long time crush, Ian. Ian was a sweet boy, despite being the sports type. His heart and brains were in the right place just like his muscles, so I didn’t freak out when my 15 years old daughter started to date. I felt so happy for her. She had confided me her passion a year ago, but never made a move. 

When he learned what happened to Bruna, Ian immediately took upon himself the task of cheering Marie up and distracting her from her pain. He was such a nice boy. They were a happy couple for precisely 19 months.

“Ian broke up with me”, Marie one day entered the house screaming and crying. “He said I’m too clingy”.

I raised my daughter to be affectionate, and I see no problem with that, but maybe she crossed the line and became possessive. I suggest we see her therapist and deal with this kind of problems, so she can talk again to Ian and try to fix the relationship. I pointed out that romance takes time and work, and that her mother and I are happily married for almost 20 years because we are always up to become better people for each other.

I tried to calm her down, assuring her that anyone can see Ian is head over heels for her, and that they can improve their relationship.

Marie hated the idea. She felt like the breakup was definitive, and wanted the problem solved right in that moment. She wanted to keep feeling loved by him the whole time. Can you blame her? The first one is the worst one when it comes to a broken heart.

That same night, Ian went missing while out of town with a few friends. Like all the others, he was never found – dead or alive.

By this time, my heart was unbearably aching, but my daughter’s existence kept me going. My love for her hasn’t wavered or faded since I first saw her, it just grew. I was grateful and overjoyed to see my baby maturing into a sweet kid, then into a beautiful and capable young lady.

After Ian went missing, everything was a blur to me for weeks. I was depressed, on heavy medication, and my love for my daughter was everything I felt I had, but I didn’t know if I could carry my heavy heart any longer. 

Eventually, during dinner, Taylor suggested that Marie goes to college in another state. She’s smart and in our city we don’t have such great options.

“Do you want me to leave?” Marie asked, unspeakably hurt. “Am I a bother to you, mom?”

“Of course not, sweetheart. You just deserve better”, Taylor calmed her down.

“Why don’t you and dad move with me then? I don’t wanna be without him”.

Taylor explained she can’t just transfer from her job, and Marie, once again, freaked out. They never fought before.

After that, I was afraid I knew what was going to happen, so I had to call Marie to my studio and talk to her.

“Baby, are you aware of your doings?” I softly asked.

“My doings? What do you mean, dad?”

“I mean that”.

I opened a curtain and showed her a small body, completely surrounded by shiny golden thorns. They were like a cage, enveloping a fragile human being. The tiny body was neither alive nor dead, it was something else. It was cold like death, but showed no signs of decay. No blue dead lips, but no breathing. It was like they were asleep otherworldly beings.

Needless to say, the tiny body belonged to Victoria. It showed up in my studio just after her disappearance and, I swear to god, it was floating. The golden thorns were sheer, but it was impossible to get through them and touch the person.

I honestly spent weeks thinking it was a hallucination, but when Marie started to move on, I finally understood. Every time the missing person related to my daughter showed up right here in my studio, where Marie, Taylor and the cleaning lady never step foot in.

Marie’s feelings of loss and despair make a prison of golden thorns around people she loves and believes to have lost, and they vanish from whenever they are. They were never kidnapped by a person, they are just left unconscious and frozen for the eternity – right here in our house’s basement.

“Dad… I didn’t. I swear”.

She didn’t have to say twice. First of all, she’s my special little girl and I believe her. Secondly, it’s obviously she didn’t have the power to kidnap Victoria and Ms. Martinez without a trace as a little child, and never left home when the other two disappeared in another town, in another country even.

“Whenever someone disappeared I felt better than when they said they would leave me, dad” she simply stated. “Knowing they are choosing to leave me makes me broken and empty, but when they are gone this way, I feel whole again”.

Marie has no queasiness about it. As long as the people she’s losing are gone for good, she will feel better. She didn’t take them, but she doesn’t feel bad about what actually happened either. 

No matter how I assured her that Taylor loves her to bits and wants to be by her side, she feels rejected. So you know what happened to my wife a few days after the discussion.

It all makes me sad, but Marie’s my whole world and I’m not only going to let her feel and do as she pleases – I’m turning the people she loves into art. I want her to keep them untouched as they were before they almost left her, so I’m creating a giant mural with their frozen bodies, peacefully and forever preserved inside a cage of golden thorns."

aey7af,3105,2019-01-11,Sexually harass me and think you're getting away with it? Find out that I get by with a little help from my friends.,Iwritenovels1234,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/aey7af/sexually_harass_me_and_think_youre_getting_away/,"First post, and a **REALLY** long one, I’m so sorry. Obviously on a throwaway.

This was awhile ago, way before the *Me Too* movement, before stuff like this was taken seriously. Additionally I feel a need to re-iterate that this was not revenge wrought solely by myself, but also by some of the fantastic guys I worked with, and the brave women who also stepped forward. They deserve credit as well.

**TL;DR at the bottom.**

\---

I was working and going to college in a high-tourism area in one of the lower states, getting my Bachelor’s in Hospitality. I loved the company I worked for, and my university was practically partnered with them, so initially my life wasn’t super hectic. Go to class, go to work, and go home. At some point though, the branch of the company I was working for started to cut hours, a lot. As a part-timer, this meant I was among the first to have their hours chopped. Around this time, I was also told that I needed a third internship for my degree, and it couldn’t be in the same place I had been in. *(They had already counted that position as internship #2)* Because of this, and helped by the fact that I was barely getting by with my reduced paychecks, I went to the career center to ask about jobs in the area, and they recommended me to a nearby golf course that needed employees.

**Relevant Info:** To explain the backstory on the management of this golf course: it was run by a third party management company, operating under the umbrella of a massive hospitality company. This is not unusual for golf courses, the golf industry was/is hurting and frankly this is the only way for most of them to break even. While I was technically working directly for this third party, I was also listed as a “contractor” for the large umbrella company.

My upper boss, the director, was okay, if not a little oblivious. The assistant director under him was a jerk, and the string of supervisors under him were hit or miss. When I started, I was the only woman on the operations side of the team. You had several groups: The pro shop guys *(also supervisors),* the beverage/snack girls that ran the snack stand and the carts that buzzed around the course, the course starters *(usually older, retirement age, been with the company a long time),* and the ground operations group *(where I was).* Most of the ops guys were wary of me at first, but after they saw that I was willing to do as much of the manual labor as they did, they accepted me. I didn’t love my job, but it was a paycheck and it counted for my degree. It was a lot of manual labor: lifting clubs, baskets of practice balls, running from one spot to another, shifting golf carts around throughout the day, driving big course equipment, and lots of guest interaction. Everything was okay, and I was learning a lot, until one of the older ops guys ***(let’s call him Bob)*** got promoted to supervisor.

Bob had been stellar as an operations guy, but around the time he got this promotion, his wife also filed for divorce. His home life took a steep nose dive, and unfortunately it carried over to his work ethic. We all felt bad for him, and initially tried to help as much as we could. As time went on though, Bob went from being sad and depressed, to being an outright asshole. He was in his mid-40’s and started crashing gatherings with all of us 20-somethings. This wouldn’t have been an issue, except he started aggressively trying to pick up girls wherever we went. He became the textbook case of the sleazy guy that would get roaring drunk, and complain “She didn’t respond to my creepy flirtations, so she must be a b\*tch”. I stopped going to these group outings for this reason, along with several others. His behavior was making a lot of us uncomfortable.

Eventually, his creepy behavior rolled over to work. He would be AWOL for hours, out chasing down the cart girls. When he wasn’t doing that, he was sitting in the club storage area regaling the younger ops guys with his stories of “conquests”. I tried to stay away as much as possible, but there were several shifts where I was assigned to deep clean the rental clubs, or re-stock equipment, and then I couldn’t get away. I won’t go into detail on some of what he did, but it was bad. Major sexual harassment. Some of the lighter instances were suggestive comments about my appearance, or “let me show you what you can do to your boyfriend” –with matching hand gestures. I felt I couldn’t quit because I only had a few months or so left of my time with the job before I graduated, and I needed that internship credit. Going to the director and the guy under him went nowhere, his answer was to pull Bob from the course to “apologize” to me, and then “…go on and give her a hug! See? Everything is fine now!” I felt totally powerless, but got some sage advice from my dad to start documenting **EVERYTHING**. Dates, times, location, witnesses, and what Bob was doing.

After seeing how the director treated his infractions, Bob started getting bolder and less careful. These harassment events were beginning happen in full view of several of the other guys. One afternoon, two of the starters that I had become close with happened to walk into club storage right as Bob made one of his sexually-charged remarks. Bob seemed not to notice them, but I saw both of their eyebrows shoot up. One of the guys started to get visibly angry and had to be quietly pulled out of the room by the other. I made a lame excuse to leave the room right after this, ducking Bob’s grab, and ran outside. The two starters were standing not far away, speaking in low, angry tones. As soon as they saw me, they waved me over, far out of earshot of the other employees and Bob. They asked for an explanation, and I told them everything that had been happening, including how the director had treated me when I went in to complain. They were incensed. Immediately, they physically walked me back into the director’s office, and shut the door behind them. Keeping me between them, they told the director what they had witnessed, what they had heard, and if he didn’t handle it the way he was supposed to, by company policy, they would go over his head and report it to the umbrella company themselves. The director was startled, but calmly told them that one witnessed incident was hardly reason to go to “corporate”, and that this issue had already been “handled”. This was when I finally chimed in, re-iterating that the sexual harassment had only gotten worse, that I had a 4 page word document at home with countless time stamps and witnesses, along with the record of how he previously “handled” my complaint. A document that I would not hesitate to email to whoever needed proof, per the starters’ advice. We saw the blood physically drain from his face, and he asked us to step out so he could make a phone call. I ended up finishing the rest of my shift with the starters, then went home.

When I showed up the next afternoon, the jerk under the director came out and asked that I run back home to get a copy of my reporting’s. He also said that we had to sit in on a group call with the umbrella hospitality company in about 2 hours. During this time, they sent Bob out to monitor the course so he wouldn’t get suspicious. What I didn’t know, and found out during the meeting, is that in the span of one evening and morning, the other cart girls had somehow gotten wind of my report being taken seriously by the director. *(I suspect the starters mentioned it to them)* They came in, nearly the entire female snack staff, to pile on their own harassment claims. It was no longer one minor female “peon” reporting him, it was now a massive group. The director knew they had a problem. The umbrella company requested that I read my entire record during the call, and when I got to the bit about the “hug and apology” that the director had requested, he looked like he wanted to become one with the carpet in his office. When the call ended, the voices in the phone requested to speak with the director alone, and the rest of us *(me, assistant director, starters, and the third party company rep that had been asked to come in)* filed out of the room. After about 10 minutes, we were called back in. The director was silent and pale, and the voice in the phone promised me that I wouldn’t be bothered anymore by Bob, and to contact them directly if I had any further problems.

They sent me out to the other side of the course, to keep me away, while they then called Bob in to the office. I didn’t witness what happened, but I was told later that Bob came storming out of the office after about 10 minutes, kicking golf carts and throwing things as he left. Yelling out to the other ops guys in the vicinity that “all women are b\*tches!” as he went to his car. Not only had been fired, but he was further statused as a no-rehire, **and BANNED**, with/from **ALL** the courses *(run by both the umbrella company and the third party, who owned/operated a sizeable list of properties)* in the area. The director eventually was transferred out to a smaller course, and the jerk under him was moved as well. We got a much better management team in to replace them, and I was able to finish my time with the company with no further issues. I am happy to say that I still keep in touch with the starters and other guys to this very day.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR I was continuously sexually harassed by my supervisor, but was finally able to get justice with the help of my coworkers, and he lost his job while also being blacklisted from all courses in the area.**

Oh my gosh! Silver! Thank you!!

GOLD?! Oh my god. I’m in complete shock! Thank you!!

aeyoh8,14,2019-01-11,Critical Thinking Exam Study Guide,a32dderall,waynestate,https://www.reddit.com/r/waynestate/comments/aeyoh8/critical_thinking_exam_study_guide/,"I keep getting pms for my study guide so I figure that I post it here:

&amp;#x200B;

""Critical Thinking- California Critical Thinking Exam Type B

To premise, I got around an 80? Passing is a 73. The exam is 34 questions, 45 minutes, and $35. The class is a hassle, so really try to take this exam instead.  In this guide, I remembered approximately 20 questions. You honestly don't need to study for the exam, but It gave me stress knowing that what I had studied wasn't indicative of the exam. 

Also, there are two versions of the exam with the same questions. Some of these are verbatim questions/answers. If you would like to send me what you remember, please please do. It'd be really helpful for others. 

The purpose of this study guide is to familiarize yourself with the TYPE of questions asked. 

Good luck! (excuse my commentary, thanks)

&amp;#x200B;

1) if argentina beat japan, and france beat argentina, what is the true statement:

\-france will certainly beat japan

&amp;#x200B;

2) pie chart, one showing a slice with 40%, then one a year later showing 44%. 

what is a true statement— 10% growth

 

3) there was another question with a slice that was asked to be interpreted from 15 to 11%, the answer was a 73% decrease

4) that’s really all you needed a calculator for. then it asked that they tried to increase sales in these two departments using advertisements, what would you conclude- well, they both increased in profits.. so it worked? 

&amp;#x200B;

5) there are 34 people at the airport going to the hotel, and 16 people from the hotel going to the airport, assuming that the bus can carry 9 people, how much rides are needed: (50 people overall/ 9)= 6 rides

6) next question- after the 2nd trip, ( minus 18), 25 more people arrive at the hotel. how many additional trips are needed?

7) public figures use evasive language. michelle obama is a public figure. assuming all of the statements are true, how certain is “michelle obama uses evasive language”

personally, i said certain., or something along the lines of that - also idk why they’re being rude to my girl michelle rn

&amp;#x200B;

8) There’s a question with a graphic on travel— super super easy and just interpreting what the photo says

i.e a question is asked as to what is the first step and then another question asks about what to do if you’re unhappy of your location (answer is to go on the internet and search for different ones)

&amp;#x200B;

there’s a scenario where a man has an intern who’s like, really shitty. that intern is the nephew of the president of the company you work at- the intern keeps lying, but he eventually figures it out. you tell the supervisor that you can’t fire him bc he’s the nephew, the supervisor then says that she’ll fire you if you don’t fire the intern.

Q8) what does the supervisor mean? that she wants to be able to say for certain that you firing the intern was your idea

Q9) your 12 year old daughter says that no matter what, whether you fire the intern or don’t, you will get in trouble-- this is true! The answer is good because those are the only two options given- aka this 12 year old is woke af

Q10) your friend \*that doesn’t work with you\* hint hint said to fire the intern bc he lied to you and doesn’t do a good job and to ignore him being the presidents nephew— answer: this is a bad argument bc he doesn’t understand the nature of your work/ other issues (i.e does not take into account what the supervisor said)

&amp;#x200B;

another scenario- two people want to have a child and do genetic testing, if someone is a carrier, than the child might inherit it. according to the genetics, there is a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier and a 25% chance that the child will be affected

&amp;#x200B;

Q11 )interpret- there are two really dumb choices like 1. they won’t have kids 2. they’re going to adopt. the third and fourth were close. one says that the child will have a disease or be unaffected. the other (which imo was correct) said, the child may have the gene or will be unaffected.

i said the 4th, bc of “may”, whereas the other one is “will”, either way, they both dont take into account the remaining 25% chance that the child will be unaffected.- low-key thought of making a punnet square but na, not worth. Again, tricky question.

&amp;#x200B;

Q12) richard nixon is a disgraced president. people who write self justifying memoirs always have been disgraced.  interpret answer: richard nixon wrote a self justifying memoir- something along the lines of that.- i lol’d over this one

&amp;#x200B;

Q13) 4 phrases. one about people working above the age of people. one about millennials being unhappy with jobs. and then two other phrases. pretty much it’s saying that 3 phrases are trying to prove the 4th one, however, i personally thought that none of them related to each other.. at all. it was an option and i chose it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q14) i would draw a line for this one for a political spectrum- this one took a bit of time tbh, a question like “ if senator J is to the left of senator m and senator m is to the right of senator R, while he is in between j and z, what phrase do you need? or something like that. clearly, you would need a phrase with senator z somewhere in there since it never specifically states. two answers are blatantly wrong bc they’re verbatim stated that its on the other side of what the premise gave you… so…this took a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

another scenario with a few questions ( one of the easier ones)

this one library must be cleaned 5 days a week. if it cleaned on monday, it can’t be cleaned on friday, if it cleaned on wednesday, it must be cleaned on saturday. and like, one other phrase i forgot where if it’s cleaned on this day then it must be cleaned on monday (hence meaning that it can not be cleaned on friday)

Q15)  what is a possible combination? okay well, clearly, any choice with both M &amp; F are wrong, so two are crossed out, and another choice that doesn’t have both W &amp; Sa are wrong too- easy

Q16) the other question is, if the library is cleaned on a friday, what day can it not be cleaned on? the answer is easy— monday.

&amp;#x200B;

the practice exam given to you on the website isn’t the most reliable- it won’t ask you to determine if its an analogy, it won’t outwardly say if its deduction or induction, it will ask you the overall meaning of the passage, 

theres an example of 

&amp;#x200B;

Q17) “russians are lover of poetry” means the same thing as “ if one is a russian then one is a lover of poetry” type of question

it will ask if something is a good argument or not, it will not ask if they’re speaking about the same or different things, it will ask about what something is missing- either a premise or a conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

Q18) something like. there is a company with a new resources division . therefore,  company cares about marketing due to resources division. imo, i thought it was something relating to the company slacking in marketing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q19) there is a phrase ""carnations come in many colors”

this also means—- “ if it is carnation, it has many colors”, “ not all carnations are the same color” “ if it has many colors, it is a carnation” or just some dumb shit that honestly gave my brain a headache and i forgot what i put

&amp;#x200B;

Q20) something about women and smoking cigarettes. the answer is correlation, not causation. evidence based correlation doesn’t not imply causation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q21) something about afterlife, religion, and immortal soul. it asked if it was a good argument. No, it is a poor argument bc it ignores the immortal soul argument. 

&amp;#x200B;

lastly, all i can remember now is 

Q22) there are three cards. a heart, a circle, and triangle

what cards would need to be face up to prove this statement: 

: if there is a triangle on this side, there must a heart on the the other, 

okay so its easy to know that you need the circle present, and that the triangle must show as well

&amp;#x200B;

honestly, the test was full of crockery. just answer quickly. you may have to blatantly guess""

&amp;#x200B;

and that's all folks"
aeyqgp,8,2019-01-11,TL;DR : I never cried infront of anyone since I was 6 but a month ago burst in tears in front of a total stranger and my friends sister saw me,ConflateHuman,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/aeyqgp/tldr_i_never_cried_infront_of_anyone_since_i_was/,"Ill try to make this as short as possible
The last time I cried in front of someone was when I was 6 and fell from the stairs .. I remember clearly my brother laughing about me crying for over a decade and never cried in front of anyone since ( I cry alone in my bed a lot though)

I am a medical student attending a college far from home and live with my as***le brother and I just found out my friend might be a psychopath (ASPD) and he is stalking me (it's the longest story I could ever tell so let just skip that)

Where I study there is an almost complete separation between guys and girls , we have our own building and the girls have theirs..  but we go to the same hospital , I am a preclinical student so we don't and have never talked to the girls (most of us)

A group of medical students are making a research about personality disorders in medical students where they interview the students and evaluate them. 
I thought the interview was done by resident or at least an intern and needed know if my friend is a psychopath (plus he told me he went to the interview)

I Went there and the interviewer was a girl  (I didn't speak to my sister for over 2 months which she looked a lot like her and that started my home/family missing emotional heart ache)

After the interview she explained the results ( she said I had a trait but not a disorder.. not important) told me if I had any questions and I asked her the following
""Can a person lie in the interview and you won't know about it ""
""Yes""
""Which PD is capable of hurting others ?""
""ASPD and .."" I was fearful after that and she saw it.
""Ok thanks"" took my bag and opened half of the door to go out and then she asked
""Do you need help with something? .. our research supervisor is a psychiatrist and he said if a student is having a problem he is willing to help ""

--So here is the dark side about our doctors .. they are a***les to the male students , nice and lovely with the patients and nurses but hate the students , and where I study they hate the male students specifically--

Told her that there is no need but she insisted and said that she can't help me if she doesn't know much 
( In that time I was fearful and I couldn't think straight and needed a professional opinion) , as soon as I started telling her my problem I cried like I never did .. couldn't even speak from my tears , hided my tearful eyes with my sleeve like a 5 year old but had to complete my sentences 
During that another girl came in to take her phone from the charger and quickly went away .. the interviewer girl told me that I must talk to the doctor and his speciality is forensic psychiatry so he knows exactly what to do and she only a student and her opinion is not a professional one ( I thought she was a psychiatry resident when I asked and told her the story)
During a moment of shame and despair I agreed and gave her my number and when I tried to go I wanted to apologise but I couldn't because of the crying 

A week later I went to the doctor wearing a jacket and a beanie trying my best to hide my identity but anyway he knew my name and asked where I am from and if another doctor is related to me ( I guess he knows me very well now)
The doctor said my friend will not harm me and he said and did creepy stuff just to scare and keep me from leaving him. Thanked him and went away and that's it 

Later I googled the interviewer girl name and found her Twitter account took a quick look and found the girl (who came in when I cried) , she turned out to be the sister of my other friend who I asked for help but refused ( he is not a jerk but at that moment he was) and I have never felt this shame in my whole life..
Where I live it's not acceptable for a man to cry and fear another person and above that all it was in front of a girl.
I don't think it's bad or shameful I am totally convinced that my situation was extremely scary and crying and asking for help is ok either in front of a guy or a girl 
But I know my people and I know how they talk and look at a person like me and hid my emotion and feelings a lot in my life but I have never faced this much fear and scare for my life .. I did very well before that I kept it inside and never showed it.
I am not ashamed of what I did .. I feel shame of how they look at me (and talk about me)

I don't want this to be in the be seen by many so if upvotes are high please downvote it.





++What happened not only with the psychopath affected me but also the situation above .. it kept me awake for a couple of nights and I couldn't study like before or interact with others like before .. it affected my social life and my grades 

Where you live this might be totally normal but where I am its not .. "
aeyqq2,8,2019-01-11,Shiatsu and Tui Na training,daveismanta,massage,https://www.reddit.com/r/massage/comments/aeyqq2/shiatsu_and_tui_na_training/,"Hello.

While I am not an LMT or currently in school to become one, I have been training under my Tai Chi teacher (who is a master of Tui Na as well as acupuncture, Ayurveda, and Chinese herbs), for about a year now. She's let me take on some clients, mostly those with hand/arm pain and one client with scoliosis and it has been an honor to work with them and improve my skill. I also gave free back and neck massage and still do to certain people under my teachers guidance. It's something that i'd like to do not just as an intern at her clinic but as a vocation, as this is the first skill in my life that i really feel gives me a sense of fulfillment.

My current full-time job is at a Japanese market as a cashier and, honestly, though i love to meet with people, i don't really want to keep cashiering for even another year. While it's daunting to think about, I turned 24 this last December and I feel i'm called to do greater things with my life, both internally (relating to ethics and meditation) and in the world as not just a job but as a service. I want to go to massage therapy school, get my license, and further develop my skills in Tui Na, Shiatsu, and other ""Eastern"" modalities of body work. My teacher would sometimes mention to me that, in acupuncture school (i think in Taiwan) she learned more about just that: acupuncture, acupressure, and probably Chinese herbs as well. This is a path that i can see myself taking and, out of the interest in sharing experiences with this Reddit community, ***i was wondering what the experience was of other massage therapists and/or body workers on this site relating to continued education, perhaps in different countries, to learn massage specializations outside of the education that received at their massage school(s)***. It's inspiring to me to learn that i could do this as well someday, and really develop a skill. I can see myself learning from, perhaps, a Shaitsu or Anma master in Japan or perhaps a Tui Na master in Taiwan to really hone my skills and that particular field and, therefore, be able to skillfully offer that service to others.

**Side Note that Perhaps Isn't Really Related but Something I Just Want to Get Off My Chest:**I grew up developing virtually no skills or motivation outside just seeking pleasure in food, sex, drugs, hookah, etc. I'm currently paying this, again, as a 24-year-old with only an AA in History and various addictions, namely an addiction to being a hypocrite and not standing in truth, ethics, or generosity. Over the last five years with my teacher, particularly this last year, it's become apparent to me, i think, that the real challenge of being a healer is healing ourselves; purifying ourselves and increasing the quality and magnitude of our own ""vibration""; our own subtle energy that those around us, including our patients, can sense. I'm finding that i need to become this healer and, in order to do this, i need to heal myself.

I (22f) am looking for a place to live in CT that is close to Danbury. I grew up in NYC and went to school in Boston so I am looking for an area that is at least urban-ish and young. 

I will be moving with my boyfriend (24m) who is going to work remote full time. We are not an outdoors type of couple (another reason I'm not very fond of Danbury). Maybe I'll go to a park once a month for a walk. We enjoy eating at and finding new restaurants, bars, and cafes. I would like a place with a young population so that I can hopefully make some friends. 

Currently, Norwalk and Danbury are the only cities on my list. Norwalk is definitely a commute (40 minutes? How bad is it during rush hour?) But I heard it is a younger city with more of an urban area than Danbury. I lived in Danbury over the summer for an internship and I absolutely hated the area so I am not really looking forward to living in Danbury but I am willing to suck it up if the rent is MUCH cheaper. Also I did not have a car that Summer so maybe it will be different with one. 


So people of CT, what are the pros and cons of each city? Is it worth the commute from Norwalk to live in a younger area? Should I suck it up and live in Danbury? Are there other areas I am overlooking?


Thank you so much!"

She is currently working as an intern at a private practice so she has no income at the moment but has been offered a job post school completion. We are in a situation where we'd like to purchase a new home with most assets tied up in the equity of our current towne-home(Bought as investment property 2 years ago which we are living in). The issue is that we purchased a new vehicle after having a baby and have a pretty hefty payment attributing to my dti ratio. I'm trying to get approved for the new home purchase w/ just my income on top of all other monthly payments (e.g. current mortgage, student-loans, credit-cards) but need to transfer the car to her name opening up more leeway with the lender. I guess this isn't technically a refi or loan 'transfer' as my goal is to get the entirety of the car loan out of my name and credit. Being that I need to 'sell' it and transfer the note/title to her, will lenders even approve her without any income at the moment even with her parents co-signing? It seems silly going through the whole application process with 0 income. Wont it just get rejected or will having the co-signer other than myself help? Could we claim house hold income here and still have my name off the loan?

I know selling our town-home is the best solution but we now have another baby on the way and found a new home builder we really like. (Don't want to live in an apartment for 6 months) We have the liquid assets to put down(3%) but cant start the process quite yet due to my dti being too high. Unfortunately, even though we will be selling our current house in the summer, all the lenders i've spoke to calculate that payment in the approval process. Here's a little break down of everything:

Monthly Obligations
Car Loan: $600
Student Loans: $300
Credit Cards: $200
Current Mortgage: $1100

New Home Purchase: 500,000
Current Home Equity: 96,000

Individual Yearly gross Income: 100,000
Credit Score: &gt;780

I'm right at the cusp for some lenders but getting rid of that dang car payment is the only thing I can think of to get approved. Should have waited for that purchase! Oh, and my wife will be hired as an 'Independent Contractor' at her job so that income wont qualify for at least two years, meaning no point in waiting for her to start work (and actually getting paid!).

Any input or ideas would be greatly appreciated!"

3. I could just apply for the job, and hopefully get in.

A heads up that this should be the same editor that seemed optimistic on Big Fish &amp; Begonia. In the end, they were all cases of ""The ones preceding it sucked, this one sucked, and ones following it will definitely also suck, but that's a necessary process in order to one day finally make an animation that sucks less."" In a way, this is what the rest of the Chinese industry has been saying and what I've been repeating, but the shape of the entire landscape sure hinders that.

I won't discuss the implications on the Japanese side of things other than translating the below because the last time I did, it seemed that there were some confused people.

Though, this is actually a fairly rare opportunity to hear from someone involved with the ""other side"" so to speak, as they generally refrain from commenting on donghua at length knowing how vicious and defensive donghua watchers can be, i.e. niuya.

EDIT: Typos

***

Last year, the president of P.A. Works, Horikawa Kenji, asked me this question:  
&gt;In China, what is the ratio of inbetweeners that can be promoted to key animator?

*And here I will add that as far as I know, the higher-ups in Japan typically are not informed regarding the situation of the industry in China. Some would start from production assistant and come into contact with Chinese subcontractors, but the rest wouldn't, and they don't even need basic knowledge of the Chinese industry anyways.*

So Mr. Horikawa's question would feel a bit broad. He might not know how complicated the Chinese animation industry is compared to Japan. The meaning behind the ratio of inbetweeners getting promoted to key animators is different in China and Japan.

But I could also be said to have some level of understanding regarding P.A. Works, and I think I know why he would ask this. So I gave him a number, clarifying that it's something I determined arbitrarily and is not guaranteed to be accurate. It's instead based on his expectations, and would still be worth comparing to Japan's statistics.

He was astonished: ""Why so little? I thought that there were plenty of talented Chinese animators.""

I told him that he was right, and I even know a few. But the problems faced by us is a lot more than one would guess.

We talked some more, and I told him about what those in China have and don't have. But I discovered that the more we discussed, the more relevant his initial question regarding inbetweeners was. It embodied massive amounts of secondary issues, like the training of animators, their salary and career prospects, or an animation company's talent pool, financial management, and balancing between artistic and commercial projects. Looking at the big picture, it's a problem encompassing the structure of the entire industry.

*Each of these problems would be worth writing essays on, but remember, this is just a portion of an article. They can only be addressed generally, others will have to wait.*

Among Japanese animation companies, P.A. is about the most eager to speak out for the treatment of animators. Even President Horikawa has spoken repeatedly about the importance of training young animators at P.A.

Then, how would an inbetweener at P.A. get promoted to key animator? Their official website lays it out very clearly:  
1. Draw 500 douga for three months continuously;
2. Including internship, must have drawn douga for a year. Also should have seen enough genga to understand how to draw genga that keeps douga in mind;
3. Turn in genga assignments monthly.

All of the above would factor into their considerations.

These requirements are not easy at all, and President Horikawa once lamented how low the ratio was. To have more key animators, they could only use the tactic of hiring more inbetweeners to serve as a base. P.A.'s new building was made for accommodating the increased number of inbetweeners. And in reference to the question that Horikawa asked at the beginning, P.A.'s answer was that of the 30 new inbetweeners they hire each year, about four to five might become key animators.

Now here's the question, what happens to the inbetweeners that didn't get promoted to key animators?

P.A.'s stance is basically: the need for speed and savings caused most inbetweeners to not be Japanese animators. They treat inbetweeners well out of the hope of having them become key animators.

P.A.'s supposed treatment of animators is indeed pretty good in Japan. Despite this, a P.A. inbetweener still deplored their conditions in 2016, saying that they were poorly paid and made to leave after three years of not making key animator.

This is enough to show that inbetweeners have it rough in Japan. Many of the reports of terrible salaries for animators in recent years can be said to stem from this situation. *After all, you're not really working, you're learning, of course you'd get tired, and it's very ordinary to fail. You're doing the low-cost work that's typically delegated to overseas, it's simply expected that your earnings will be low.* Regardless of whether it's the ""right"" thing to do or even ""acceptable,"" this is what is happening in Japan.

For inbetweeners, deadlines are tight, the workload is immense, and the pay is low. The need for technical skill is relatively low, so it's low value-added, labour-intensive work. This is the same logic behind other developed countries outsourcing their traditional industries to developing countries.

Yet there is a point of distinction between animation production and other industries, and that has to do with training talent. For example, if you wanted to train a phone designer, that training doesn't have to involve getting the designer to assemble 500 phones monthly. However, to obtain a key animator, unless they're rare prodigies, the **only way** currently known to the industry is through giving them tons of practice. The greatest structural problem faced by the Japanese animation industry is that after offshoring their inbetweening work successfully, they could not find an effective replacement method to develop inbetweener talent.

So, solving the Japanese industry's problem is very simple: find a way to make key animators without having them begin with drawing douga. Of course, no studio, not even P.A., has accomplished this, so despite knowing that they'll be faced with problems by failing so many people, they would still waste money on employing inbetweeners that they don't need and who will complain.

Going big picture again, the Japanese animation industry has shifted to ""high level"" work, but a subsequent shortage of ""low level"" work is preventing them from developing more ""high level"" talent.

This structural problem is the nature of Japan's ratio of inbetweeners becoming key animators.

Returning to the vastly different industry in China, the nature of the problem changes. China has the ""low level"" work that Japan tossed to them, but are lacking in ""high level"" processes.

When Horikawa asked me why the ratio was so low when there were so many talented animators, I explained to him our problem, all these problems ultimately came back to the lack of high level processes - the structural problem of not being able to develop creative talent requiring technical expertise like key animators, episode directors, storyboards, directors, etc.

Without these processes, training low level talent loses its aim and becomes non-systemic. Even more, there is a lack of leadership - the efficiency would be terrible. *Even if you were to produce talent despite that low efficiency, where would you assign them? When the high level work is so lacking, do you even have high level genga for them to work on? When the market is so dominated by works from overseas, how can you ensure that you don't lose your talent as they pursue better benefits elsewhere? Will you be able to provide them with the motivation to improve even more?* It seems that everything involved in promoting inbetweeners to key animators is problematic because of the situation.

Personally, this is a simpler problem than the one faced in Japan. There are no high level processes in China, but there it is in Japan, you just have to go. So you see more and more Chinese heading to Japan to learn animation, make animation. Their personal skills rise, the management skills rise, and Chinese-Japanese communications improve. The quality of so-called ""Chinese episodes"" in Japanese anime become better and better, the best example is SSSS.Gridman #06. And this is the quickest shortcut to solving the problems on both sides, Japan lacks low level talent, China lacks high level talent, the two were made for each other. You will see even more cases like this in future.

To simply begin building a new high level industry in China from low level work is much more difficult. But the forerunners of other industries have shown that the best way to move forward is to concentrate efforts.

And this is why I approve of what Crystal Sky of Yesterday is doing, putting aside its actual quality, I place more importance on the symbolism for the development of the industry when it gathered all these people in the domestic industry together.

Although low level work occupies the majority of the industry, that doesn't mean there are no individually outstanding talent. For Crystal Sky of Yesterday to gather them provides them with high level work and opportunity to put their skills to use. A high level production will refresh audiences' perceptions of the quality of Chinese animation and open up a more welcoming market for better earnings. If the earnings are impressive, then there would be more confidence in claims that high quality will be rewarded with good commercial performance. This will determine a new business model and improve the investment environment. With this investment environment, more capital would be dedicated to funding high level animations to meet the audiences' demands, and this will cause the donghua industry to shift to a high level, achieving a virtuous cycle.

Of course, if you read until here, many of you would think, how could things turn out so well, you're too optimistic.

But this is something that other industries are doing, and it's something they *must* do. Changing industries and economical development requires the donghua industry to make these changes to solve their structural problem of lacking high level talent.

This is supply-side structural reform."

We’re all in the same major. Peter and I work for the same company as non-interns and Maddie works elsewhere. We met in a group where I also met my current boyfriend. Peter and Maddie got together around the same time and all of us have been with our partners since. We got along well and were all pretty friendly.

About a year ago, I found out Peter and Maddie weren’t doing so well (from Peter and other friends)— Peter was pretty much neglecting their relationship and she had accused him of cheating on her with me. Peter and I’s friendship remained the same as it always had been. The last time he mentioned anything about Maddie was that they never wanted to talk about their problems. Maddie started getting more distant from me whenever we all hung out as a group. Although she never overtly mentioned anything to me, I always got a cold shoulder vibe from her since then.

Recently, Peter mentioned that an internship position at our company had opened up that was related to our major because the current intern (Jerry) was moving. I didn’t even know the position existed until Peter told me about it.
Peter is also quitting around the same time and mentioned that it would’ve been really cool if he was able to keep working here, with Maddie taking the internship position, so the three of us can all work together. He mentioned that Maddie hadn’t spoken to anyone at the company about it yet, but was going to ask about it. I didn’t say anything about it or think too much about the internship because my current job pays well and the workload isn’t heavy.

Last month, Jerry and his boss (not my boss) approached me and asked if I wanted the internship when Jerry leaves. They specifically said they wanted to ask me because I was already working with the company and knew it was in my major, and that they were willing to work with my current boss so I could do both jobs. I knew Maddie was interested in the job, but wasn’t sure if she had reached out to them, so I asked if there was a public job posting or somewhere to apply. They just said no and that it was mine if I wanted it. After they went into more detail, I accepted their offer.

A couple weeks later, Peter left the company and had recommended Maddie to my current boss for his position. She of course got the job, and then later asked about the internship position as well. My current boss and my internship’s boss (I guess I have two bosses now) both told her that I had already taken the position and it was the only position. Peter heard I got the internship but didn’t seem upset that I had gotten it.

Since then, I got the impression that Maddie hasn’t been too happy about it. She periodically sends out emails to my current boss and I about some issues that she has offered to fix herself, with potential solutions. The fixes are things that fall into my internship description more than her job. To make matters worse, my internship got wind of some of the issues and asked me to work on them (after she had brought it up) and other issues she had brought up were pretty much ignored.

AITA for taking the internship? By the time I accepted it, Maddie and I weren’t really speaking to each other, not ignoring each other, but just minimal conversation whenever we hung out as a group. After I took it, Maddie started bailing from group hang outs whenever I was invited to go—the pattern was so obvious that a lot of people pointed it out. I reduced hanging out with Peter because I didn’t want to ruin anything between them, even if I wasn’t involved. At one point I even apologized to Maddie for whatever I did and told her if she ever wanted to talk about it, I’d be willing to listen. Maddie has just given me the cold shoulder. It’s been eating me up for quite some time because we used to be friends and I don’t really know what happened."

EDIT: Letters of Rec coming from bio prof and leadership prof. I have great relationships with both profs, and they have agreed to write me letters. They fully respect and understand my decision to transfer.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: I figured that since I took the time to write this whole post that I explain the main reasons why I am transferring. Here goes.

1. I'm currently an in-state student attending a public school. I am also a commuter who only is about a 20 minute drive from my school. My parents plan on moving out of state, meaning I lose my in state tuition and my ability to commute to school. This drastically increases my price of attendance from 16k to over 42k (over 2.5x as much, since I never received financial aid). I don't think it's worth paying that much to attend an public school that isn't known very well outside of the state.
2. Research opportunities are extremely lacking at my current school. Many research opportunities are closed off for older students which I greatly dislike. Why offer shadowing positions during my sophomore year, when many of my peers at other schools would already have gotten positions for actual independent research or research with a prof around the same time.
3. Opportunities at current school aren't as developed or as available as other schools (i.e. lessons for non-music majors, lack of outside help for coaching esports teams, no dedicated uni hospital, etc.)
4. I regret not working hard during my high school years and want to redeem myself. I got rejected from all of my reaches and targets last year, and I want to attend a school that I would actually enjoy being a part of."

He loves me, and I know this, but his means of dealing with any kind of conflict is unhealthy. It's plain to see why -- his mother and father are divorcing after 30 years together because his father is angry and belligerent if his wife disagrees with him (which, they're two very different people). It's fine to me if a couple disagrees -- we can't agree on everything. But it's absolutely ridiculous that if someone disagrees with you, you yell at them and discredit their intelligence and insult them and withhold things from them. My boyfriend does this (to a lesser degree, but still). He doesn't call me stupid, but he throws the fact that he makes more money in my face. When he argues, he doesn't fight to solve the problem -- I can understand getting heated because of a disagreement but he *tries* to hurt me. He *tries* to say inflammatory, near-unforgivable things because it'll hurt me because he's always fighting me, not the problem. We've talked about this dozens of times -- that him being angry with me or disagreeing with me is not a justification for him to talk down to me or tell me to shut up or get as angry as he does. He'll threaten to stop doing something for me that he knows I need to ""punish"" me and always feels like shit, coming back and apologizing the next day, and hating that he said what he did in the moment, but it still hurts me. Then It's always him playing the victim later when he feels bad for himself for the shit he does saying, ""I feel like you'll never trust me again..."" Like no, I never will probably because every time I start to, you throw in my face something evil.

I have no parents. My mom tried to kill me a few years ago and I've been on my own since I was 17. I finish a program within the next 6 months that will make me over double what he does, close to 6 figures (if not that -- my internship at a Fortune 500 or 100 company starts in 3 weeks) as a software developer. I don't have any options now (I'm 22 in March) and I just have to grin and bear it for now, because it's way more attractive than the options I do have, but for the moment, I just feel so cheap. He threatens to leave sometimes when he's mad at me knowing I wouldn't be able to take care of things on my own, and he just did this today. We had sex yesterday, after a long, long spell of him being kinder and working on his actions and more patient. I feel so fucking cheap and disgusting and stupid that I allowed him to with him being willing to leave today at the drop of a hat. I keep falling into his traps and I feel so so so stupid for even loving anyone, because everyone in my life has been like this. People always put themselves first and any attempts I make at doing that(putting myself first), people are sure to see to it that I'm put down. I feel dumb for being kind to anyone because this always happens.

My plan is to get my job (my program has a rate of 95% of students having jobs within 4 months of finishing, if not getting hired on by their internship) and save up for about 6 months and leave if therapy doesn't work for him (He hasn't started yet, will in a month, of his own volition acknowledging these issues, but I'm really losing faith that anything will actually change him). I hate that I'm here. I hate him. I hate that I love him, and I hate that there are people who exist who have no self-awareness or sense of guilt like he does sometimes. I'm working on setting boundaries for the next few months too. I'm not going to tell him now but I'm not having sex anymore. I don't even want to at this point (he'd never force me, I have no fear of that, but I just feel too dirty and bitter at this point trying). A company can hire us before graduation if they'd like, and if they do, I won't be telling him that I have until a few months after I graduate probably.

I just hate where I am. I hate that I have to do this at all. I wish I had someone in my life that was physically where I am (my only friends are all out-of-state and I know no one else in the state I live in now). I wish my life hadn't turned out like this. I wish I had a mom or a dad or anyone that loved me enough to not do this. My fear is that this will be my life and that I'll always be alone. That I could have all the money in the world at this job but I'll still be alone. Still no one will care or know, when I leave him, if I were to get into some freak car accident and die. That's my biggest fear -- that in being alone again and homeless, like I was for years after leaving my Mom, that if I was hurt, no one would even be there to identify my body. I don't have a place in this world and I feel so small and insignificant. I can't stop crying."

af36kt,4,2019-01-11,"[Semi-serious] Hello, it's me, and I'm checking in",TheMattInTheBox,teenagersnew,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagersnew/comments/af36kt/semiserious_hello_its_me_and_im_checking_in/,"Hey guys! I don't know how many of you actually remember me but I left the community about a month ago. Full post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/teenagersnew/comments/a4456w/semiserious_i_think_its_time_for_me_to_leave_this/).

But I thought since it's been about a month and a lot of things have changed in my life, it might be worth the update since a lot of you might find this useful or interesting!

So let's just real quick run through the boring stuff. After I left the community, I started to try to be more engaged with my side projects, like the book I'm trying to write in my spare time. Then my friends came home from uni and we hung out. Then the holidays and all that. 

I went on a four day bender, where I drank every night for whatever reason. I took a day break, then went hard on NYE and ended up jumping off a moving train. 

It was dope, but I easily could have killed myself. Don't do it. 

Anyway, about 2 weeks ago I moved 5 hours away from home to start an internship. I work in Human Resources and have been working on scheduling interviews for student internship candidates for the summer term.

It's a small company, but we actually do a lot of cool stuff. All my coworkers are actually great. Everyone is so friendly and my boss is amazing. All the other interns are friendly and I've already made a few friends. 

I'm also living in a house with 4 strangers. It was weird at first, but after talking to them some more, we're actually starting to become good friends (except for one guy who barely comes out of his room).

I also played myself and have started to fall back in love with my ex, which isn't optimal. But also she's great, so maybe it's worth it. 

I'm living by myself, paying my own rent, getting my own groceries and making my own decisions. I feel bad that I don't necessarily miss my family, but I do love them. Just don't miss living with them. 

I guess the point is, I'm having a good time, even if I'm working an office job. I wear a dress shirt and dress pants every day, but I like it. I have a computer and phone and I'm writing formal e-mails, but I'm actually having a really good time. 

The main point is that it will be okay. You may think a job is boring, but the people will make it fun (and you'll make the job fun for yourself). I'm still in uni and don't necessarily know what I want to do after, but I'll figure it out. 

I'm sure I missed some things that have happened to me, but if you made it all this way, feel free to ask questions or whatever. I'm tipsy and in need of human interaction.

Hope you all are doing great :)"

The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

4)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

5)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+"
af3fvr,2,2019-01-11,SaaS advice,ang__elo,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/af3fvr/saas_advice/,"Hey there, so year ago I quit my pre med path to pursue coding. I took a leap of faith, dropped out, worked hard, and eventually made little SaaS apps that created little revenue (around $30MRR, just launched). 

The problem is I found that selling an app looked more fun than coding. Coding is very complex and takes a lot of brain power/time.  I both like em a lot but selling seemed so natural to me. 


Any advice on what to pursue? Let’s say you have 30k to play around and you want to move to Manhattan and start a SaaS company. 

I have three options: 

1. Should I get a job in sales or programming job first and find a mentor that way?(I have no job experience in both) 

2. Should I work for myself, figure out how to get an audience in YT and sell them some knowledge I know? (I convinced a videographer to work with me)


Should reach out and try to get an internship, shadow someone until I get a position?



How should I plan this? Usually I ask my mentor but he died a month ago. ;(

af3osc,99,2019-01-11,"My husband (28M) is no longer intimate, because I (26F) can't meet his expectations.",nothavingafuntime,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/af3osc/my_husband_28m_is_no_longer_intimate_because_i/,"So, I will first say that I know some of this is my fault, but at the same time, I am struggling to meet his expectations despite knowing these are things we committed to prior to get betting married. We dated for my entire med school tenure and got married prior me starting my internship. In med school, it was easy to maintain a healthy lifestyle, take care of the pets, do my side of the chores, and have more energy. But first year of residency has been a pain, because 75% of the time, I'm working 60-70 hours a week with only a day off. It's constantly left me in a state of being tired when I come home. This has led to other things as mentioned below.

We haven't had sex for 3 months, and when I try to be intimate, he just makes excuses of ""being tired"" or not in the mood. One time, he literally kept his teeth closed when I tried to use tongue. I know he's been getting burned out as well, because he's maintaining the apartment, taking care of the pets, cooking food, while still putting time in to go to the gym and all. He's been alluding a lot about our initial expectations and commitments when we first started dating and prior to getting married. How I have not been meeting them. When we finally talked about it in December, he finally confessed to what's been bothering him.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Seeing me come home and lay on the couch while on my laptop or video games just makes me look unattractive. Especially when I just have my gut sticking out while I sink into the couch, while he is cleaning around the apartment or doing chores.
2. That I've put on 8 lbs in 7 months since we got married.
3. That I do little to nothing with maintenance or being healthy even when I work my shorter hours.

Basically, he understands I'm burned out to do many chores, but if there's one thing he'd wish of me, it's that I still lead a healthy lifestyle. I know he's also mentioned that the gym tends to energize him when he's feeling sloggish, but I don't even have the energy to even go there in the first place. But I said that I would do my best to lead a more healthy lifestyle starting in January. Well, I will confess I have not been to the gym yet or done any home exercises. I haven't done any chores. And I still come home doing the same old things. This first month has asked me to be at the hospital from 6 AM to 6 PM, leaving me too drained 6x a week to do anything. At the same time, I can just see it on my husband's face that he's becoming disinterested in me.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Work 70ish hours, 6x a week. Have put on weight, don't help around house, help with pets, and just play games when I come home. Husband works a 8-5 from home 5x a week and manages everything else. I try to be more active this year, but work just leaves me drained. What can I do?"
af3wz6,5,2019-01-11,"Has anyone read ""Can't Hurt Me"" by David Goggins?",[deleted],infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/af3wz6/has_anyone_read_cant_hurt_me_by_david_goggins/,"This might be the wrong place to write this, but the first challenge in the book is to write down the following:
 A.  the current factors limiting your growth and success.
B.   Are you underappreciated and overlooked for opportunities?
C. What are the long odds you're up against right now?
D. Are you standing in your own way?

This probably isn't the best place to put it, but y'all are very similar to me so you guys might understand better than other people.

A. The current factors limiting my growth and success are definitely debt, my insane lack of drive, being stuck in a situation with seemingly no way out. I know I could do so much if I just put the effort in. I'm in a ton of debt right now, and i just want to get away. I have so many things I want to do but I just don't end up doing them because I always look for the right time, but there never is one.

 B. Somewhat: there are jobs (IT internships, etc.) that I know I have the knowledge for, but they all have qualifications that mean I would never even get an email back. But who could blame them.

C. Just debt, lack of a job, being socially alone. Things like that. I don't struggle with depression or anxiety much anymore, and really, I'm pretty healthy mentally, but I'm a dreamer with seemingly no way to achieve those dreams.

D. Yes, I am standing in my own way. My lack of drive, and my belief that I don't have the ability to make my dreams come true certainly holds me back."

1975?: Gemma (18) meets John Teller and two months later she's pregnant \[In S05E09 Gemma tells Nero she met JT and got pregnant at 18. So there has to be a mistake either in Gemma's birthday or in Jackson's or the anecdote itself is an error.

Really late 2008/Really early 2009: SOA 2nd Season.

Half-sack is killed (prospect to Chibs). Happy is still Nomad. Happy spent a lot of time in Charming during S2, only absent from 4/13 episodes. Small window for a Nomad kill.

We don't know exactly how many days passed between EZ finding the body of his mom and locating the car in the bar parking lot beginning the chase scene. (Kurt’s media interviews where he says Happy was Nomad can be disproved by his own shows. Some intern fucked up their homework. Luckily, Mayans MC does not explicitly state that Happy was Nomad, only Sutter’s interviews. There is time for this to be noticed and not make it into the Mayans MC S2 scripts which would actually mess with the mythology)

2008/2009: Possibly when the Santo Padre charter is born. Marcus Alvarez sends his cousin Obispo Bishop Losa (likely a full patch Mayan from another chapter) and childhood friend Che Taza Romero to set up and run the Border Charter. Alvarez enters a business deal with Jose Galindo around this time?

Season 3 takes place in the first half of 2009.

Happy becomes Redwood S3EP6 “Push”. Tara is 6 weeks pregnant (1 ½  months. I will round this to two months for easy math later), SAMCRO is looking for Cameron Hayes and Abel Teller. S3 Finale, Happy is arrested along with Clay, Jax, Bobby, Tig and Juice for a 14m sentence.

(In between 3 and 4, 14 months pass as the show does a time jump to the clubs release from prison.)

&amp;#x200B;

2010 before summer: EZ is 19/20yrs old? College age. Emily is 17/18?

EZ’s first flashback visiting Emily at her high school, he says he had a break before finals, indicating the end of the semester. He could be at the end of his 1st year or 2nd about before the summer break.

&amp;#x200B;

July 2010: SOA Season 4.

S4EP1 “Out” Happy and other SAMCRO members are released after 14m in Stockton, year changes from 2009 to 2010. Thomas Teller is born during that time.

\*\*Take the approximate month/year of S3 Finale and add 14 months\*\*

~~Early (May)  2009 + 14 months= Mid (July) 2010~~

UPDATE:

May 2009 + 14 months= July 2010 is more likely thanks to Abels birthday.

Clay, Jax, Happy, Bobby, Tig and Juice are released from jail just over mid-2010. (July 7th month of the year)

More proof that SOA Season 4 was in 2010 comes from a scene in Mayans MC from Bishop and Alvarez at the meeting in the casino with the Chinese.

“Look. We're not privy to everything that's happening with the rebels, but this kind of shit is the cost of doing business for the cartel. It always has been. 2010, we saw the same thing happen to Galindo's old man. Lobos Sonora made a play for the border and shipments were being clipped every week. Our business didn't change.”

Source: Mayans MC S1EP 3, “Buho/Muwan”. Lobos Sonora subplot occurred in S4 of SOA when Kozik died.

Technological advances:

S4EP3 “Dorylus” the mention of an Ipad, which was not released until 2010. This fits the timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Season 4 does get wonky because Tara drives a Ford Edge with a 2012 sticker on the LP, but the year is not 2012 for them. Not enough time has passed. Total countable elapsed time in-show days are less than 30 for S4.

Jax’s sons ages this season:

Abel should be 22 months old, about to turn 2 years old. Rounding Tara’s total pregnancy time up by two weeks (stated above) for easy math, at the time of Thomas’s birth, Abel is no more than 15 months older than his little brother.

If Abel was 8m old when Tara was apx. 2m pregnant, with 7m remaining of her pregnancy, Tara gave birth to Thomas at the end of 2009.

Abel 8 months old= ~~Early (May) 2009 + 7 months =  Dec. 2009~~ Thomas is born. If the two boys are 15m apart, Thomas would be 7m old and Abel is 22m (about to turn 2yrs) when SAMCRO is released.

UPDATE:  Abel 8 months old= April 2009 + 7 months = November 2009 Thomas is born.

&amp;#x200B;

2010 Summer: 1st Annual Santo Padre Mayans M.C. Rally.

EZ finds his mother’s body (Happy is the presumed killer at this time, all EZ’s flashbacks are 8 years ago). Coco had just returned from his tour of duty in Iraq. Angel and Coco get a gun for EZ. EZ shoots a cop in the chase with Happy. EZ is facing 20 years for murder. Serves time in Stockton. Emily has the abortion.

&amp;#x200B;

~~If we knew what month in 2008 Abel was born, it could help narrow this timeline down exactly.~~  But given the SOA timeline as it stands 2010 is definitely when EZ was in Stockton.

~~Meaning that Gemma being seen during EZ’s does line up and actually works. She would be visiting near the end of their sentence, maybe even finding out when they will get released.~~ S4EP5 “Brick” Gemma also meets with Otto, so she could be seeing him in that scene during EZ and Emily’s argument which seems the most logical. If that is the case, then SAMCRO would already have been released which would mean EZ and Happy were NEVER in Stockton at the same time.

If SAMCRO were in Stockton for 14m, then EZ and the SONS were only in the same prison at the same time for a couple of months minimum. Some people think that EZ being in Stockton at the same time as Happy is a big deal, but given the timeline and the size of Stockton, them seeing each other wouldn’t be likely...especially since if EZ did see Happy in Stockton there would be no “big reveal” in the Mayans MC S1 finale. EZ had to have never had contact with Happy at all.

UPDATE: SAMCRO were likely arrested in May, 2009 given Abel’s age at the time and the time that passes from S3EP to S3 finale when they are arrested. SAMCRO’s 14th month sentence ends in July, 2010 which would have been around when EZ was arrested. Finale thoughts: EZ was never in Stockton with SAMCRO at the same time. Gemma was visiting Otto.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where shit gets weird in the SOA timeline.... Thanks, Abel!

Still 2010?: SOA 5th Season. Opie Winston dies at age 34.S5 EP1 “Sovereign” picks up a few days to a couple weeks after S4. Clay is out of the hospital last seen in care in s4 finale “To Be Act 2”. Frankie Diamonds, Gogo and Greg the Peg voted into SAMCRO. Jax and Tara get married.

S5EP11 “To Thine Own Self” Romeo Parada signs off on SAMCRO leaving the cartel deal. Mayans take over muling. Jax begins attempts to leave guns.

&amp;#x200B;

Late 2010/2011: Angel, Gilly and Coco begin prospecting terms. EZ is in jail. Emily is in law school.

&amp;#x200B;

June 2013 somehow?: SOA 6th Season. S6 picks up days after S5 finale.

Jax still trying to get out of guns but can't unless they have a replacement pipeline. Les Packer and SAMDINO vote down picking up the Irish slack, “Wolfsangel”. After the clubhouse is blown up, Galen and Roarke allow SAMCRO to leave guns if they get all their buyers onboard with Clay handling distribution “Salvage”. Tara died (finale) in June around what would have been her next birthday, months before Abel would have started school.

June/July 2013?: SOA 7th Season. S7 picks up days after S6 finale. With Tara’s birthday being June 21, 1980, and her death also occurring in June (around her birthday although the show never mentions her birthday occurring) this season picks up around this event. Source: Tara’s gravestone.

S7 Premiere could start late June/early July. Abel starts school in this season (cause he’s 5 now), which typically begins in mid/late August depending on school districts.

Wendy checks out of rehab after 9 days worried about Abel. Jax is in county prison and released after no evidence ties him to Tara’s murder. Tara’s funeral was 2 days ago from his release.

Jax Teller dies at age 35. Jax born in ‘78 and is 30 by S1 soa= 2008. S7EP4 “Poor Little Lambs” Abel is approx 5 given Jax saying so via dialogue in S7 SOA as he has started school. Abel would be in a pre-k/kindergarten program depending on when his birthday falls in the school system. CA school districts “child must turn 5yrs old before or on September 1st for the kindergarten school year. So if Abel was about to turn 5 AFTER Sept 1st, Jax could have rounded up putting Abel in Pre-k as he just missed the cut-off date and 5-year-olds can be in pre-k cause they'd be the oldest in the class after Sept 1st. Source: Am parent.

S7EP9 - “What A Piece Of Work Is Man” Transcript:

Jax: Why don't you all head up to the cabin? Bring the boys.

Wendy: Well, what about school?

Jax: Not today.

Wendy: Abel's struggling, Jax. That thing with the lunchbox...

Gemma: He'll be fine.

Wendy: It's just that the more time he misses, the more he falls behind. And I think that's adding to his frustration.

Jax: He's five years old. He shouldn't be frustrated. I want him with me today.

Wendy: Okay. (o.0)

S1EP1 to S4EP1 is 2 years long (Abel is 22m old turning 2)

From S4EP1 “Out” Abel is just shy of 2yrs old and then jumps to 5yrs in 3 seasons?

One of Sutter’s things that happened with the show was the recasting with Evan and Ryder (the twins that played Abel). Abel’s age was moved up to match the actors who took over playing Abel which fucks with the natural time that passes in-show. To account for this, I’m sure they just wrote the dialogue where Jax says “he’s 5” to make it work.

If we go by Abel really being 5 and ignore the in-show day counts (day/night/next day) then from S1EP1 to S7 Finale... 5 years pass from beginning to end.

SOA Season 7 ends roughly in September 2013.

UPDATE: August 25, 2008 plus 5 years = August, 2013. Abel starts school around his 5th birthday and Jax's dies shortly after in EP13. Early September might still work for the series finale. 

&amp;#x200B;

2017: Emily gives birth to her son. Emily’s son is only 10m old in S1 of Mayans MC (Sept, 2018). September, 2018 - 10m= Cristobal is born in Dec, 2017.

The name “Cristobal” carries meanings like “bearer of Christ” or “holds Christ in his heart” perfectly fits the month of December (the month of Jesus’ birth) and Sutter’s weird fixation with Catholicism.

Emily conceived Cristobal late March/Early April 2017. Emily was described as having an education in law. If she was 18 in 2010, 7 years would be reasonable enough for some law school and dating/marrying Miguel before conceiving. Point being: she didn’t immediately find Miguel after EZ’s arrest and the abortion.

&amp;#x200B;

2017/ Early 2018: EZ had “6 years shaved off his sentence”. EZ is released and does his probation in Hollister (Source: my main man, Hank “Perro/Oc”. ) after serving about 7/8yrs in Stockton and accepting the Confidential Informant deal. 7th Annual Santo Padre Mayans M.C. Rally occurs, Angel has the poster in his house now.

&amp;#x200B;

September 2018: MAYANS MC 1st Season. Almost exactly 5 years after S7 finale of SOA.

Episode “Cucaracha/K'uruch” takes place in September, 2018. Source: Adelita’s laptop date.

Later in episode 9 “Serpiente/Chikchan”, Potter hands Miguel his folder of the deal to sign showing surveillance dates in the month of September, 2018 from EZ’s intel.

EZ Reyes joins Santo Padre. He is a prospect to his brother, Angel Reyes. He still has 8 months left to become a full-patch member.

In “Perro/Oc” Angel, Coco and Gilly discuss bringing EZ in on their Adelita secret. It is stated he is 9m shy of a patch. Later it is stated EZ has “about 8 months” left, season 1 of Mayans takes place over the course of about 2 or so weeks making this totally round-able.

&amp;#x200B;

September, 2018, EZ has 8m left. EZ has prospected for only 4m prior to the Pilot episode off-screen. In the pilot, EZ already knows about the “dresses” insinuating that he has been around long enough to know what the club does for the cartel.

Sept. is 9th month of the year. 9th month- 4m= 5th month of the year. 5th month of the year is May.

EZ began prospecting in May, 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Early October 2018: S1Ep10 Finale: SAMCRO (Redwood Original) is back in the gun business. Alvarez does not have his pipeline through Connor Malone. Les Packer who previously voted against gun running is also having SAMDINO deal. Alvarez retires from the M.C. joining Miguel Galindo as his advisor. Bishop is now EZ’s sponsor. WTF Sutter.

&amp;#x200B;

2/24/2019: Updated timeline info thanks to a comment down below, who found Abel's exact birthday in SOA S7EP13 ""Papa's Goods""."
af4c3r,6,2019-01-12,But I did everything right...,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/af4c3r/but_i_did_everything_right/,"I was just like any other kid in elementary school; I talked about non-sense with any other kid around, I did my school work, I went to all the things my parents organized for me. 

Then we moved a thousand miles away and I got zoned for the worst middle school in the area. I had lost all my friends with no way to contact them and I was bullied pretty hard because I worked hard in school and made good grades. 

I was zoned for a different high school than everyone else from middle school; which while overall a good thing, I once again lost the couple of friends I had made over the previous years. Despite being quiet and withdrawn to avoid restarting the trend of being bullied I added sports to my schedule. I started off uncoordinated and overweight but worked harder than most and became captain on two varsity teams my senior year. With the sports, my grades, and hundreds of volunteer hours I got into a good university for pretty cheap.

And yet again, I move and quickly lose contact with everyone. But I was told ""college will be the best years of your life"" and while they probably were I still feel like I messed them up. I got good grades, I was a model employee at work, I still made time for both sport teams. I even managed to get my first kiss, first relationship, first love. I graduated early with a STEM degree and it was time to take on the world.

It was a rude awakening when I saw the only job openings for my field were unpaid internships, senior level positions, or ""entry level"" looking for at least 5 years experience. I knew I couldn't keep working at a restaurant forever so I made a plan, got in the best shape of my life, and enlisted in special operations.

I easily qualified with the highest ASVAB scores possible and met the highest physical requirements. Boot camp was a breeze and I graduated with commendations. Spec ops training was no joke but everyone there, the trainees and instructors alike, had the aura of a sense greater than self. Then I got hurt. I was getting out of the military or staying in and being re-classed. I, stupidly, chose to re-class. Thinking the military would put me to good use, I assumed I would get my pick of jobs. I was assigned a duty that wasn't even on my list and had absolutely no interest in. I had no choice but to grin and bare it.

During technical training I still applied myself and made the highest marks in the unit. I ended up getting assigned a ""good"" base. I got to my new base was introduced into an atmosphere of hazing just because I was a lower rank. My supervisor found out I had a degree and that only made it worse. I was back to being bullied for doing well in school and I can't say a thing simply because of a difference in pay. A change in leadership swept though and it got better for a moment. They saw how I applied myself and started assigning me new responsibilities that were normally for people above my rank. I saw it as recognition and a chance to prove my self further but it turned out they were using me so they could be lazy. One of those new tasks was to show the new guys the ropes and manage them on the job. I was decent enough at it but didn't have the rank/authority to back it up so I was seen as bossy. That quickly isolated me from people of my rank.

Now here I sit in the barracks alone. Working extended night shifts because manning issues and they don't dare make married people work nights because single enlisted members don't matter apparently. I have been removed from everything and everyone. The long distance and opposite schedules cost me my relationship. I'm not given awards or even a chance to deploy, even though I volunteer for it. I just want out and now they want to try to guilt me to stay in.

Throughout all of that, I have had a voice in the back of my head saying ""you're not good enough"", ""you won't make it"", ""they don't like you"". I managed to tell it to shut up for year after year. I can't anymore. It's right. It was right all along. It won. I have no friends, haven't had a relationship of any degree in years, I can't even bring myself to do things I  once loved, I've just been getting worse all around as a person. 

Even typing this out, I just feel like there's no way out, it won't get better.

tl;dr: I know life isn't fair but this is too much.

Apologies to anyone who managed to read through that mess, writing was never a strong suit."

&amp;#x200B;

I am a hobby photographer, as such I have many r/choosingbeggars stories, it has gotten to the point that I have this on my hobby facebook page.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello everyone,

Wishing you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year.

To get 2019 off to a good start I would like to let people know a few things about my photography hobby, this is mainly due to the massive number of posts I have made to r/choosingbeggars. There are things I will/can do for free and they are within the confines of my location when you request a studio session. The reasons I don't do location shoots are due to people expecting me to spend my money on booking that location, for their insurance and makeup artist. The same goes with wedding events.

I'm not a business and not trying to be the next big photographer. All I have to offer is what I have at my location which is a choice of black/white/green backdrop, lighting, changing and preparation rooms, tea/coffee/biscuits and photo prints (depending on size, editing and amount of copies). It is the best deal I can offer someone who doesn't want to pay for a professional photographer or their professional photographer friends.

Again Wishing you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year.""

&amp;#x200B;

What lead to this was I started to pick up photography as a hobby and just like anyone who has friends in the cosplay community I got asked a lot take photos and I do that mainly for the experience.  When a friend approached me to be a photographer and filmographer at a major event I accepted knowing what they wanted of me and that I would get paid, they also know that I keep hidden from people about my autism for not everyone likes when my ticks become active and there is always some communication understanding problem.  We make a number of promotional videos for the event without incident, the days of the event come, we get situated in a 4 star hotel for three days and I suddenly get hit with having to train two interns on how to use my DSLR cameras, I was told that they would I was in charge of them and they would help me with what ever I needed, this went well to the point where I was doing all the work myself with the added benefit of tell two people who didn't understand what I was asking of them getting in my way and ruining all the filmography work I did (that was 160 hours of combined video footage).  This stressed the hell out me and people say I was having a break down on the last day within the final three hours of the event, it was at that point I was asked by the friend who asked me to do this event told me go out and take some pictures to calm myself down (this does help with how my mind works), as I was taking pictures there were other cosplay friends who saw me and asked that I their picture.  At the end of all this I was ready to go home until the hotel owner demanded I clean up the three rooms that were left in the state where pigs would live.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally get home and I try to destress, to get messages from the cosplay friends, ""when will you be putting your photos up"", to which I said within the next two weeks I have a lot of work to get through.  I finally get through all the media I had and put something salvageable of the event and I start getting messages from my cosplayer friends, demanding that I remove my watermark from photos.  I told them that the event was the first time I had done an event as a professional photographer and to separate my hobby photos from the photos I got paid for I put my own watermark on the photos that were for my hobby so I would get credit for a job I'm still waiting on to be paid.  One person went to the extent to demand that I remove the watermark for I am causing them PTSD, that they acknowledge that I had a break down but what I'm doing with the watermark is considered harassment.  I started to ignore them and when I saw my edited pictures on a prominent Star Wars website, I told the web host that photo is not the original, that it is edited so my watermark is out of the photo and I have no problem with them showing the original as long as I'm given credit for my work, I then sent them a copy of the original photo with watermark, within hours that photo was replaced, I received credit from the web site and received an apology from the web host.  Within hours of that the PTSD girl went on a tirade on how I did the wrong thing and she would do anything and everything to destroy my career in photography, I told her to go ahead and I changed my watermark to include misunderstood and autistic, her reputation in the cosplay community was never the same and neither was mine.

&amp;#x200B;

And to follow up the payment on the event I helped with, I was never paid any money for the work.  So this is my hobby and if people want things for free I have terms and conditions, that way I'm not misunderstood.  


Thank you for your time and thanks for reading."

It reminded me of Albert Camus' essay ""The myth of Sisyphus"", and I realized that a major reason why Sisyphus was happy and had meaningful existence was because he had a boulder push up the hill. It was because he wasn't doing nothing, but becoming the master of his situation.

It gave me the motivation to get out of the dreadful rut of stagnation I was in. Put away the excuses as to why I was unemployed, and applied to get a job as a School bus driver.

I love my new job, and I often refer to it as ""My boulder""

More opportunities came by and thanks to the flexibility of my job, I was able to get training to be a software tester, and I have an internship coming this month.

If any of you know what video Jordan Peterson said that quote, I would love to have the source!

af4u0h,42,2019-01-12,Sequel Idea,pluralizes,SpidermanPS4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpidermanPS4/comments/af4u0h/sequel_idea/,"Curt Connors has replaced Octavius as Peter's science friend. They are researching a means to regenerate lost limbs. Desperate, Norman hires Curt Connors and Peter to perfect the symbiote. Connors has a huge interest in using animal DNA to treat humans, especially reptiles. Realizing that certain enzymes found in snake *venom* have the ability to cure ailments, Connors merges the symbiote with snake DNA. After this, the symbiote seems to be working as intended. Connors engineers it to have a sensitivity to heat and electric shocks, that way it can be easily separated from Harry. It enters Harry's body (who is unconscious through all of this) and Curt's scanners indicate he is gradually being cured. Connors explains all that is left to do is wait, and they return Harry to his chamber. While wheeling Harry and the symbiote back into the chamber, a small amount of it leaks into a cut on Peter's hand.

While patrolling the city later on, Peter encounters a gang wearing high-powered tech suits. Fancy Dan, Montana, and Ox. They are robbing a bank. Spidey swings down and a fight ensues. After successfully subduing the trio, Peter loses control and begins ruthlessly punching Ox in the face, even though he's already down. He only stops when an officer shows up and snaps him out of it. Spidey apologizes and swings away. Back at home, he is overly argumentative with MJ, but explains he's just stressed from all the lab work and goes to sleep.

So this all leads to the symbiote eventually revealing itself. To impress Peter, it takes a form based on his costume. Peter realizes he is way stronger and faster than before. During a fight with Mysterio, Peter is hypnotized into seeing an illusion of Mysterio killing MJ. This sends Peter over the edge. He smashes the glass of Mysterio's helmet and prepares to stab him with the broken shard. He realizes what he is about to do and goes to the lab to separate himself from the symbiote. Using electrodes, Peter exploits the symbiote's sensitivity to electricity and successfully rids himself. He forces the sample that was inside him into a containment unit and returns it to Harry's cocoon.

Sometime later, Connors' readings say Harry is finally cured. Norman is present as Harry is removed from his symbiote cocoon. Harry is taken out of sleep mode and he wakes up extremely shocked by his surroundings. Norman hugs his son and tells him everything is alright. Connors calls Peter to announce they successfully cured Harry, so Peter rushes in. Peter is elated to see his old friend again, however, the presence of Peter causes the symbiote to turn extremely aggressive. It smashes out of the chamber and bonds with Harry. This time, it manifests as a huge monster with fangs and a long tongue (due to the snake DNA) but it keeps certain elements of Spider-Man's suit such as the eyes and insignia. 

This will lead to a pretty big story. In light of the failed attempt to cure Harry, Norman steps in another direction. Tasking scientists to reboot an old Oscorp project that had been scrapped years prior: an unstable recreation of the super soldier serum. Norman will meet with Spider-Man and instruct him not to kill the Venom monster, as his son is inside. Eventually, Spidey will have a final battle with Venom in which Harry inadvertently dies with the symbiote.

Norman's recent projects with the symbiote and super soldier serum have gone way over budget, causing the company to go under. The news of Harry's death causes Norman to have a severe heart attack. While hospitalized, he forces one of his interns to administer the incomplete super soldier serum. This serum mutates Norman into a goblin-like creature (not Ultimate comics style. He stays his normal size and ends up looking more like his 616 counterpart). However, his physical health becomes better than it had ever been. Norman steals a lot of Oscorp equipment including spherical bombs, high tech armor, and the glider. He also wears a helmet (it resembles his purple hood from the comics) that is required to mentally control the glider. With his transformation into Green Goblin complete, he sets out to avenge Harry and take over New York's criminal underworld. "
af50t5,3,2019-01-12,NOC Responsibilities,BaronGoh,NOC,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOC/comments/af50t5/noc_responsibilities/,"Hi All,

I am currently a University Student with a Software Developer Internship at a very small startup. I do have a summer internship but for this spring, I received an interview opportunity for a NOC internship position that is paid and runs through the University's training program. I have never heard of these positions and was wondering if anyone had any insight on whether this would be a position worth taking. 

My career end goal is to run a start-up and my current background academically is more geared towards Data Science. In my internship I am already in so far, I have worked on web development in a full-stack team and will also be doing something similar with a different tech stack in a larger company this summer. If I stay with my current internship, it is becoming more geared more towards SQL training. With all of this in mind, is it valuable or more worth going to the NOC to diversify my skill-set?

I appreciate any input!"

I am a 19 y/o w full-time college student, and I’m claimed as a dependent on my dad’s tax return. In 2018, I worked 3 diff. jobs where I claimed exemption from withholding in all of them; I earned about $3200 before taxes. No income taxes were withheld from my wages, but medicare and social security were deducted. My unearned income is a couple of cents from a savings account. Since I earned less than $6300, I don’t have to file a tax return. Correct?

2. This year, I am still at my third job (ends May 2019) with no income taxes withhheld. Suppose I land an internship over the summer such that I earn over $6300 in total this year, and thus I can no longer claim exemption from income tax—how do I pay the income taxes in the third aforementioned job? 


Remark: I am getting conflicting figures ($6300 or $12000) online with regards to how much I can earn as a dependent before I can no longer claim exemption from income taxes."

af5omd,23,2019-01-12,"No joke, Opie is the alpha:",taint_stuffer,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/af5omd/no_joke_opie_is_the_alpha/,"I’ll give 3 quick examples.

1. Keith reached out to Opie through Twitter for a collaboration with Anthony. This comes across as a ratings grab for CPM, but also seems as a desperate attempt by Keith/Anthony to get ratings, realizing that no one gives a shit about anybody in the O&amp;A-verse without the original crew being re-United.  They have overhead to worry about though. 

2. There has not been a response that was honest from Anthony or Jim since Gregg started opening up about how there were issues with the structure of the show. They originally came out strong, stating how big of a Faggot Opie is. How is was unfunny (true). How he used the soundboard too often(true). Unbelievably, Opie has come out recently with comments about how shitty they were as well, by not showing up on time, as well as being general pieces of shit towards later interns. This was met without a response by baby boy or ANTH.  They lost all ammunition by instantly dumping their dirt several years ago.


3. Compound media had 13k subscribers during Keith/A/O negotiations around the time of the Artie rumors. While these negotiations fell apart, it’s telling that CPM has the subscriber count stated. Anthony also never came out and denied these numbers, which Opie stated were generous at that time. Also worth mentioning Chippers Podacast has been outranked by Opies shitty podcast in several of the most recent episodes.


Tl;dr :  These sopranos Wannabees aren’t shit without Opie, they know it, and want to capitalize on it. Opie isn’t shit without them either. But if Anthony and Opie made things work, The Worm would turn again."

af7105,25,2019-01-12,A character in my DD saved my life,jamesonball,MaladaptiveDreaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaladaptiveDreaming/comments/af7105/a_character_in_my_dd_saved_my_life/,"Preview:

This is my experience with MD and how I am dealing with it. Although everyone's situations are different, hope my 2 cents can help at least 0.1% of ppl out there. I am also writing this to reinforce myself to stay strong. 

Content:

A. Introduction

B. Background

C. My current method to deal with MD

D. Conclusion

...

**A.**

I'm finally making my first post in this sub, in fact, when I join this sub a couple months ago I had already planned to write about how my symptoms and how bad MD has messed up my life. As any MD should know, procrastinate/DD prevents us from finishing the draft but man, I'm glad I didn't post the previous drafts as they were just negative and pathetic as hell.

  
Who thinks it's pathetic? A character (let's call him AAA) recently appears to in my DD. He told me how pathetic I am by creating them all instead of focusing on my actual life. He told me whatever DD I am having is not going to change my current circumstances. He told me all the people I loved is working their ass off in the life and I'm instead just like a tree, no, not even a tree. Trees produce O2 for the world, I'm just creating CO2 and trash. 

It has been about a few weeks since AAA appears and man I did get better and really DD lesser and lesser! 

**B.**  
A little about my background, I was a heavy MD since I was a kid (still am but less heavy), every night I would play music and hang out in those dreams. Whenever I hang out with friends and suddenly entered dream about how my MD characters would show up and pick me up so I can dig my real friend. (So extreme case I would dream about how my DD characters murder my real friends in front of me...I was such an a\*\*hole..) a few years ago when I attended college, I tried a substance that is legal in CA, CO, WA, etc and man I was hooked because it enhanced my fantasy worlds and characters dynamics. I would literally spend 15 hours on my bed just DD...I would also draw out/write out my dream details and wishing whenever I wake up the next day any one of them is going to become reality.., As we all know, those days never came (i have been living for over 8000 days now)... I quit my internship, tried even more other drugs, not reply friend's msg until next day, and just stay at home listening to music and DD and slowing eating all my personal savings...those were the darkest time of my life...But for the longest time, I have been denying that DD is bad...

  
Just FYI, here are a few of the characters I created in my multiple fantasy worlds and tried to draw them out.

(Sadly I lost all my old notebooks with all the old character portraits when I moved couple years ago...)  


Back to this new character AAA. He is a recent character appears in my daydreams and I believe why he suddenly exist is because of the following reasons:  


1. I started to learn more about MD from this sub

2. I started meditation daily 

3. quitting the aforementioned substances (hardest part due to withdraw)

4. I literally hit rock bottom of my life in terms of career and financial

AAA has forced me out of my comfort zone. He made me punch myself in the face, he made me to commit something that could prevent me from having a tomorrow. Fortunately, I survived and man the moment I get back my conscious was one of the scariest things I experienced. 

Eventually, AAA didn't continue to damage me. Instead, He encouraged me to go find a solution. The followings are what I have been doing to minimize my DD as well as dealing with other hardships I am experiencing. 

**C.**

  
Here are what I have been doing to keep my DD in check as well as self-helping.

1. Exercise regularly, and make sure serotonin is high enough (naturally)
   1.  I personally would jog 20 mins for 2 days per week, hike 1 per week, and badminton 1-2 per week with friends. Something as simple as keeping your back and shoulder straight all the time can also maintain your serotonin level and keep you a positive mood.  
2. Instead of listening to music, just listen to podcasts or audiobooks.
   1. Whenever I hike, jog, drive (especially long ride), I would try to avoid listening to music as I know it can trigger my DD. Not listening to anything I would unconsciously DD. So podcast is the only thing I find that can keep my attention. Find something more positive, your interests, or something that can contribute to your real life. Since I am interested in business, I would listen to Bloomberg's master in business, marketplace, and etc. When I just wanna chill, I would listen to Joe Rogen, etc, some light-hearted shows. Audiobooks are also very great and I personally recommend "" 12 rules of life"" by Jordan Peterson. You can see some of the actions I took was due to his influences.
3. Meditation to STRENGTHEN YOUR BRAIN's focus.
   1. This is actually by far the most effective yet the hardest to achieve. I have focused myself to meditate 10 minutes from the beginning. At first, I believe 95% of the time I was still thinking or DD. But I found an app called ""Headspace"" that is pretty helpful for me to learn how to meditate. After the free trial I just continue to meditate on my own and now I do 20 minutes daily. currently, I would still have other thoughts/DD but the rate is down to about \~70%. (I also used the counting method and whenever I realized I was DD I just remind myself). 
4. Eat and sleep at a regular routine
   1. This is another no brainer, what we eat makes up who we are. Try to avoid sugar and crabs, especially in the morning. Making sure to wake up at the same time every day no matter what time you slept last night.  
5. Putting anger toward my current DDs
   1. Just ADMITTING that deep in your heart DD is not going to help your actual life, where are all your DD characters at when you are in a real-life situation like applying for a difficult bank loan, or in your job interviews? They just disappear and let you deal with all those situations alone. They are traitors. (maybe except AAA)
   2. Whenever I realized I am DD too deep, I would slap myself in the face, seriously, slapping myself out of it. Yes, my face gets red but at least I'm actually living. But don't do that outdoor or you might scare people, just pinch your thigh hard.
6. Pick up a new hobby (hobbies)
   1.  Not just any hobby, but a hobby that forces you to think and interact with others. The hobby should also grant you gratification. What I pick are broad games. I recently found a broad game cafe in my area and I have been going about twice a week. Not only that those game keep my focus on thinking/strategies, but I also feel the gratification when I /my team win. I personally would avoid hobbies like fishing as I know I would be DD the whole time LOL
7. Just try to fill up the calendar 
   1. whenever I see my calendar have empty space, fill it up with other activities. For me, I would read books, most informative or educational (i.e. ""Intelligent Investor"" by Graham or self-help books like ""Mastery"" By Robert Greene)
   2. Try not to fill it with watching TV/movies as they just allow you to DD...( at least for me...)
8. Dedicate a certain time to DD
   1. Now I will allow myself to DD after 11 pm (usually sleep before 1). I won't force myself to slap out of those DD. (you will know why I still dedicate certain time to DD down below) 
9. Don't do any psychedelic drugs.
   1. Some might have good experience from it but for me or any people with MD, they all enhanced my MD and made me more comfortable to DD...So just don't 

Last but not least, I still believe my DD will come true eventually but only when I die, when I lost everything but my conscious/soul(?). With only my conscious, I will be living in those fantasy worlds for eternity. 

With that being said, what I should focus now is real people, real places, and materials. I need to learn and experiences the most of my life in order to collect details, data and ideas/inspirations for my perfect eventual fantasy world. I need to interact with more people, especially those who are interesting so I will be able to recreate the closet version or even create a better version of them. 

The same applies to places too. I want to go to Japan, UK, Egypt, Amazon forest, Siberia, and many more in order to get better details for the best eventual fantasy world I will be creating. I also want to buy interesting novels/movies/tv shows/animes/songs in the future for the same aforementioned reason.

For me to achieve the above, I need to make a lot of money. I also need a healthy body in order to see, listen, experience more new things in the future that could improve my eventual fantasy world.  

**D.**

You might be curious how AAA actually looks like as for such important character I must have drawn him out. Well, I don't have to because he looks exactly like me. I think he is my inner voice which I have been trying to avoid all my life. I had been using DD as an excuse to dodge responsibility and reality and yet deep in my heart I know that is messed up. 

So Amit to yourself as MD but not embrace it, instead, turn it as a tool as a motivation to improve me. Just like finance, the richest turn money as a tool while the poor are just slaved/controlled by money. 

Just remember you are not alone there are thousands of people just like you are doing the same trying to fight off MD. If a suicidal junkie like me could get better, I bet most of you can too. You are part of the 21ce society and based on survival the fittest, you must have inherited some strong genes from your ancestors that allow you to be born in this day and age.  So go discover what talents you have. It is not easy to discover but if you try hard enough you will. 

I too hope myself can stay strong in this fight as well. Peace out, the future kings and queens of the world:)))

P.S. Apologize for my grammar I didn't do too well in my English class lol"

I'm 18+ seeking the same for a fantasy roleplay centered on celebrities. This is an old prompt of mine I feel like reviving to try and find some fun. If you're interested, please PM me with your character idea, kinks, and limits. Any reply not containing all three will be ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer to play on PMs or Discord, but do also have Telegram.

Tommy Daniels is one of the hottest young commodities in Hollywood. Despite being under 16, the actor has earned praise from A-list celebrity co-stars as being a talented professional, fun, and incredibly entertaining, Producers are lining up to cast him in movies, and Directors sing his praises. He had, by age 10, already starred in big-budget films as a main character, and doesn't seem to be stopping soon.

&amp;#x200B;

What no one except those around him knows is that the blond-haired and blue-eyed Tommy is a desperate, eager little bottom even in spite of his age. He goes out of his way to find at least one person to fuck him on each film he does - be they co-star or producer or director - and wins them over by indulging their darker sides: their kinks, their secret shames. He'll do anything to get the cock he's picked - and for his newest film, he's picked yours.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

So are you a fellow young actor Tommy has set his sights on, or an older celebrity he's starring with? Perhaps you're the director or producer, or even the college intern who got stuck as Tommy's assistant. Anyone at all is welcome to be the object of the young star's attentions, and so long as you're willing to fuck him, he'll do anything you want to get your cock.

&amp;#x200B;

My only limits are Scat and Snuff, anything else is absolutely on the table, and kinks can be hammered out over PM. I hope to hear from you soon, APP!"
af7zw5,4,2019-01-12,So I got my grades back... it wasn't pretty.,KatConnors,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/af7zw5/so_i_got_my_grades_back_it_wasnt_pretty/,"So I got my grades back. I got a B in Crim, a B- in legal writing, a C+ in Civ Pro and a devastating D in Torts. I stopped reading my books in week 3 when my Dad had a heart attack (I'm very recently semi-estranged from my parents and it was a massive blow). I had just gotten out of their control (they are abusive) but my want to not have my father die while we weren't on speaking terms made me cave in ways I wouldn't have wanted to and he used his position to regain control over a few things which felt terrible to the point where I stopped doing my work and basically everything else.

af86ta,11,2019-01-12,Universities in Egypt.,ItsAmrFawzy,Egypt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/af86ta/universities_in_egypt/,"Hey there, I'm sure you get a lot of these so I'll try to keep it simple.

Basically I'm an Egyptian IGCSE student currently in Saudi Arabia. I have 8 OL A\*'s, three AS A's (Math,Biology,Physics), and I'm currently taking AL Maths.I'm planning to go to university in Egypt next year for an enginering degree (probably ~~software engineering~~ EDIT: Computer Engineering, similar courses different names). I should also mention that I'm looking to travel anywhere abroad as soon as I finish university and probably army service. Pretty much everything is about an hour away from where I live so distance isn't that much of a factor. Here are the universities I've considered so far:

I applied to **GUC** and I'll probably go do the exam soon (jan/feb) but I'm not sure about its accreditation. Some people online mention they got internships / jobs abroad without any issues with a GUC degree but others mention GUC is ""no longer accredited since 2016"". Does GUC offer a degree men barra like other universities? What about their ""year abroad"" system? (ps. do you know if I can wait until july to do the admission exams or will there be no places by then?)

**BUE** sounds like a good choice because I heard they offer a degree from Britain (well, duh) and I also happen to have [100% off the first year's tuition fees](https://i.imgur.com/OWTAZCP.jpg) there. From what I've heard though its reputation isn't quite as nice as GUC. I'm currently applying though and will go there in person to submit the paperwork in June.

**AASTMT** is also a good choice because its degree is accredited and the same tuition fee thing as above, but it's a little further away from me and I don't really like the uniform or the vibe the university gives off or anything there so I'll probably just not apply.

There's **Cairo Uni** and **Ain Shams Uni** which are 7okoma so if I enter those I'll probably enter the credit hours system. Ain Shams has a joint degree program with University of East London if I recall correctly which is good but from what I hear from my friends and their parents (some of them work there) I'd be better off going to a private university. I'll still probably do the tansik unless someone on this post changes my mind.

**AUC** is too expensive :)

That's basically it but I'm still not sure which universities are accredited/offer a degree from another university abroad. The tutition fee thing on BUE and AASTMT is appealing but if I'd be better off going somewhere else then so be it. I'm also looking for somewhere where I can blend in well because I've been in Saudi Arabia since I was like 9 (I go to Egypt in the summer but still). Thanks for taking the time to read this and even if you dont have much to say, every little bit helps so please go ahead and tell me any experience you have with any of these universities or where you think is my best option."

There was LIMITLESS potential with a sequel series and am very disappointed it never happened

Also it's depressing reading through wikipedia articles for shows from 10+ years ago and finding out that every cast member amounted to nothing. I remember seeing an ad for some Disney Channel Reunion of High School Musical and they managed to get every cast member except Zac Efron which was obviously because he was the only one who had a career. I imagined some Disney intern calling them all up and being like ""Hey so we want to do a reunion for High School Mu-""

""Yeah I can come""

""I didn't tell you when it was""

""Oh don't worry I'm sure I can make it"" "
af8vik,4,2019-01-12,Civil Engineering or Construction Job?,Samma124,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/af8vik/civil_engineering_or_construction_job/,"Hi there! I’m a 2nd year civil engineering major, and I need some help. I went to this talk with a construction firm at school yesterday, and I loved this company. They had many benefits I liked, they seemed to have a good working environment, and they seemed to have a lot of clients. The problem was that a lot of heavy civil lessons that I’d learn in the next few years wouldn’t be applicable in the job location I was interested in. The internship would be experience in project management, some vertical construction design (e.g. school lab building compared to bridges), contracting workers and outside companies, and the overall construction process. 

For the last few years, I’ve been heavily considering water resources as my career, but now I’m wondering if I should just go into the construction management side... I do wish to be a project manager one day, and the company said it took only about 5 years to work your way up there (although there are many factors, I’m sure), but I don’t know how to decide now. 

Important: I’m aiming for an internship this summer, but my struggle will be to figure to out what concentration I’d want to focus on during the internship.

So my question is: How did you figure out what concentration you wanted to work in, and what do you love about that concentration (geotechnical, structural, water, transportation, construction, etc.)? "

1. My husband and I are recent graduates and have relocated to a coastal city. This area in general has a high demand /low supply of housing. On average a studio cost 1,000 with no utilities included. 
2. While we both have decent paying jobs ( combined we make around 70k annually) we recently had to pay an immigration lawyer that set us back around 7k . This drained most of our savings.
3. In August , we moved in with an older couple who had too much house. They are great- regularly cooking for us, helping us out when need be and I have developed a great friendship with the women. The husband is an author and is currently on an extended trip to Europe, not expected back until late March. 
4. We pay 700 a month, which includes full use of a finished basement, a private living room, large bedroom and full bathroom. We pay no utilities.

Now it is time for the dilemma.

1. The homeowner, who is beyond kind, asked us a while back if we would mind another guest moving in “ for a bit” . While I am willing to put up with just about anything in order to save money, my husband was a bit apprehensive in agreeing.
2. The individual has just moved in , and is working 4 days a week at a volunteer based charity. He is quiet and seemingly nice, but his arrival has upset the “flow” of routine.
3. This morning, my husband wakes up for work and freaks out when he discovers the roommate and his girlfriend showering in our now shared bathroom. It just seemed like freak timing, but it set him off completely. Mostly because this kid is paying only 150 in rent ( a distant family friend of the homeowners, making no money)
4. The kid is looking for alternative living, but with no income we cannot seem to figure out how he could do this. Regardless, his internship seems to only last two months at the most. 

My request is for advice. We want to start saving for a house, and know we need a good chunk of cash to do so. Living here allows us to save with very limited stress until recently. I don’t want to move, husband claims if this continues he will be miserable. 

Any advice and comments are greatly appreciated!"
afa1kf,27,2019-01-12,Medical Non-Clearance Appeal Denied-Thoughts &amp; Reflections,natsirt0,peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/afa1kf/medical_nonclearance_appeal_deniedthoughts/,"Hey r/peacecorps,

I have a long post here, and thus I have tried to organize it as such. Here it is:

===================================

A few days ago (yes, even w/ the gov't shutdown) I received the news in my medical portal that my medical appeal was denied for serving as a English teacher in Ecuador '19-'21 (staging this Monday, Jan 14th). The reason I was denied was due to mental health and seeing a therapist until this past October. Naturally, I am disappointed, however, I am not broken. My intention of this post is to give a time frame of what happened, and my thoughts, and advice to anyone who might be going through this same process or who might be applying and wondering what to do. I want to make it clear that this is not a pity post, more so that the Office of Medical Services doesn't mess around and that your case will be taken and considered individually as well as by some standard operation of procedures.   


==================================

**Time frame:**

June 30th, 2018: Application/health history form submitted

July 15th-20th: Submitted transcript, other things

July 24th: Interview w/ placement officer

August 5th: Invited to serve!

\-time goes by, duly submit my legal clearance paperwork, the other medical paper work, and visa paper work for Ecuador

October 14th-Medical clearance denied.......

November 16th-Submitted my appeal documents

December 14th-Asked if I would still like to appeal the decision by my nurse (I said yes) and she scheduled it to originally be on 2/27, a month a half beyond the original staging date.

January 8th: Received the message through the medical portal that the appeals committee had met, and that I would not be going. Bummer

===================================

**Medical Denial**

So, many might be wondering at this point what got me originally denied, as I have been somewhat vague and ambiguous about the my mental health condition. To give a backstory, I had some mild anxiety when I was going into my senior year of college (Fall 2017), and I decided to see a therapist because it was covered on my parent's health insurance plan, as well as it being of nice supplemental value. While seeing the therapist was great for me, I want to make clear that it was not truly necessary, as we would meet once a week, but sometimes we would go a month or so without meeting each other due to our schedules, etc..Basically, it was a solid additive to have in my life to deal with the stresses of college and life after it, but it was not my only coping mechanism. However, because therapy was nice, I decided to see my former therapist until this past October, so it was a full calendar year of talk-therapy (Nov 2017-Oct 2018. **All of this of course was done without any** **prescribed medication (i.e., anti-depressants, anti-anxiety)**. I have never been on and never have been prescribed them**.** At the time of course, I was not planning on applying to Peace Corps, nor did I have any idea on how strenuous the medical aspect to the overall process is. 

==================================

**Medical Appeal**

Going into the medical appeal I thought I would have a pretty good shot at making the cut and being part of the 10% of people who do get their medical appeal overturned, but alas, I did not. The Office of Medical Services denied me because they argued that not having talk-therapy while in Ecuador would worsen, exacerbate, and possibly cause me irreplaceable harm to my mental stamina, so they recommended 1 year period of stability. **I would like to note here that I have spent a lot of time in Latin America and speak Spanish fluently so I am very familiar with the culture and customs. I have lived in Chile, Argentina, and most recently studied abroad in Colombia.** 

The appeals package that I put together was incredibly solid, IMO. My former therapist (who was shocked btw, when he found out that I got denied medical clearance) wrote me a great letter, as did 5 other people, including 2 people from Colombia (former boss and internship supervisor), 2 very close family friends, as well as myself who wrote a personal statement. Further, I went and got an independent psychological evaluation, and I submitted all of that in my appeals package in the medical portal.  

================================

**Thoughts and Reflections**

So, some might be wondering, ""why didn't you just click 'No' on the health history form"" when initially filling it out and submitting the application?"" Good question, and it's something that I have thought about before. My response would be that: 

**1**. I had no idea of how rigorous and extensive the medical clearance process is. I thought that I was a shoe in, 100% and that I would have no problems at all. I was clearly wrong and naive to think that. It was my first time ever applying. 

**2**. I'm not one who likes to lie on things like this. While I know some people can easily do that, lying about my medical history and knowing myself as a person, it would likely bring me some unnecessary stress. I find lying can be stressful (because it's immoral, and could come back to haunt you) when you have to lie on something that big. This is not just telling a little white lie IMO. It is much bigger than that. I am not advocating nor condoning that people should be dishonest and lie on their medical history form, more so I just want you all to be aware of what type of route you will most likely go down with the Office of Medical Services

**3**. I am not ashamed of seeking out therapy, in fact a am very proud of myself for doing it and being open about it. It was a great thing to have and I learned a lot of new skills and valuable assets that I will continue to use in my life going forward. There unfortunately is still a lot of stigma in society attached to those who choose to utilize it to their advantage (i.e. Peace Corps), and hopefully one day that will change. I see it happening already in some parts of society, but the federal government and bureaucracies in general are always behind tide when it comes to things like this. 

**4.** It is only a one year wait period of stability that they asked for, so, it really could be worse. Some people may never get to serve out their dream of doing the Peace Corps because of a physical condition (Diabetes, Crohn's, etc..). What sucks is that regarding mental health, it is a wide spectrum and their is a lot of grey, but I consider myself pretty lucky that I don't have an extremely debilitating condition that would knock me out of being a potential PCV candidate in the future.  

**5. This is not a sympathy post!** This post is merely to inform those who are going through the appeals process, or to those who are thinking about applying and have a mental health condition, and to those in general who are unaware like I was in just how important and how serious the medical clearance process is. Be ready for constant email exchanges, having to wait, and constantly visiting doctor's offices to get a test done. Further, I ask all to please be patient with them and most importantly yourself. Be kind to yourself and to the Office of Medical services, try to stay present, and if it does not work out, there will be other opportunities and experiences where this will feel like just a blip in the radar. While I am certainly wishing that I was getting on an airplane to Ecuador this Monday instead of freezing my a$$ off back home, it could be so much worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any questions feel free to comment or PM me, and I will try to get back to you ASAP!

**TL;DR: I got denied medical clearance due to mental health, and just found out I lost my appeal. It's not the end of the world.** "

I will be interning at MITLL from mid May to early August this summer. They offer subsidized housing at around $1000 a month in Northeastern University dorms.

I am looking to live in a place that is within around 30 mins from the lab (including traffic), but also close to the city. I was born and raised in a big city, so I am a city guy at heart.

I’ve only been looking for jobs for the past couple of weeks and I don’t really know what I should be looking for.

My gpa wasn’t great is was around 3.0, I didn’t do any internships or research so I don’t have any experience. People are telling me it’s hard to find a job with just a bachelors, that I should go to grad school which isn’t ideal for me.

I’ve been looking at lab technician and lab assistant jobs near me but most of them seem to require a clinical lab technician certification - which would involve me going 2 years back to school, or Phlebotomy certification- which would take me about 1 year of school.

What would you advise me to do? What jobs do you recommend? Should I just keep looking and apply to places I feel I’m unqualified for ? Or Go back to school and get certified? And which certification  in your opinion is better for finding a job, the lab technician one or the phlebotomy?

I really like and she makes me happy and all that, but I can't help shake the feeling that she's going to get over me pretty quick.

We both go to the same film school and have similar tastes in artsy movies and stuff, but other than that I don't see what draws her to me. 

I don't really have any interesting hobbies outside of watching lots of movies, reading, playing games with friends, and average stuff like that. I grew up in a small town in Arizona and never had many close friends before college, so I don't even have anything interesting to talk about regarding my life before college. 

Compared to her, she's from Shanghai, is fluent in English, travels a lot, and has so many interesting hobbies and interests. I'm always learning new stuff about her (just found out she's been boxing for like 6 years) while she already knows pretty much everything about me. She also manages to land a cool new job or internship whenever she goes back home while I haven't even held a job or internship since I got to college.

I'm also not very well-traveled or adventurous, although we will be going abroad to France together for a semester (kind of why we started hanging out more in the first place), so that could be good. But right now she's back home in Shanghai for break while I'm taking a January term course and every day she's off working at her cool job or doing something fun with friends while I'm here doing practically nothing by comparison. So when we message or video chat I don't really have anything to talk about and I'm mostly asking about her life, which I'm totally cool with, I just think it must be boring for her to talk to me.

I'm worried, perhaps irrationally, that the more time we spend together the more she'll realize I don't have anything to offer. On top of that, I'm not even attractive or charming while she is most definitely both of those. I guess I'm sort of funny to her, she laughs at a lot of things I say. 

Are my anxieties normal? Are they rational or should I just try to get over them?

TL;DR - I guess I just don't see what my new girlfriend sees in me. Her life is so much more interesting than mine and she has so many unique hobbies and talents and she so pretty while I got nothing and I'm not even that attractive. Are my anxieties normal? Are they rational or should I just try to get over them?

I grew up in a small town in Arizona and never had many close friends before college, so I don't even have anything interesting to talk about regarding my life before college.

Compared to her, she's from Shanghai, is fluent in English, travels a lot, and has so many interesting hobbies and interests. I'm always learning new stuff about her (just found out she's been boxing for like 6 years) while she already knows pretty much everything about me. She also manages to land a cool new job or internship whenever she goes back home while I haven't even held a job or internship since I got to college.

I'm also not very well-traveled or adventurous, although we will be going abroad to France together for a semester (kind of why we started hanging out more in the first place), so that could be good. But right now she's back home in Shanghai for break while I'm taking a January term course and every day she's off working at her cool job or doing something fun with friends while I'm here doing practically nothing by comparison. So when we message or video chat I don't really have anything to talk about and I'm mostly asking about her life, which I'm totally cool with, I just think it must be boring for her to talk to me.

I'm worried, perhaps irrationally, that the more time we spend together the more she'll realize I don't have anything to offer. On top of that, I'm not even attractive or charming while she is most definitely both of those. I guess I'm sort of funny to her, she laughs at a lot of things I say.

Are my anxieties normal? Are they rational or should I just try to get over them?

TL;DR - I guess I just don't see what my new girlfriend sees in me. Her life is so much more interesting than mine and she has so many unique hobbies and talents and she so pretty while I got nothing and I'm not even that attractive. Are my anxieties normal? Are they rational or should I just try to get over them?"
afclwv,17,2019-01-12,I (F22) want to break up with my live in boyfriend (M22) but I can’t afford to live on my own,PsychoanalyticalHut,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/afclwv/i_f22_want_to_break_up_with_my_live_in_boyfriend/,"So I’ve been thinking this for awhile and I think it’s finally time I start figuring out what to do.


First a little bit of backstory, my boyfriend and moved out of our home state this past summer after about a year and a half of dating so I could get my Masters. When we first moved I did all the unpacking because I couldn’t stand all his stuff sitting in bags and boxes anymore, despite me asking for help unpacking. This leads me to believe he didn’t really want to move with me in the first place, but I know he didn’t want to do long distance either even though it’s only about a 5 hour drive from our place now to our hometown. 

Once we got down here and classes were about to start, I landed an amazing internship that turned into a full time job, so now I’m a full time student working full time as well. I’ve been so busy I’ve tried asking for help around the house with general cleaning taking our dog out. I’ve begged and begged for some extra support and help but he sleeps all day until about 1-3pm, plays video games all day and I do all the cleaning after work or on weekends. He doesn’t seem to want to go out and do anything either and I end up discouraged from making any plans because he is never awake at a decent hour. 

My boyfriend does not work and relies on student loans to pay rent, and he has missed rent twice because he didn’t have money. He is barely getting through school and dropped out of all but two online classes and failed both of them, one being because he slept through his online final. I pay for most of not all of our groceries, and he eats only fast food and refuses to take care of him self. He’s at home all day but manages to shower about twice a week. 

I’m so fed up with his behavior and I have tried and tried telling him he needs to work on his sleep schedule, get a job and at least try in his classes. I ask for him to be a partner in this relationship and he says he will be better but this has been going on for about 5 months. I’m starting to serious resent him and I want to break up. I hate that I have become this nagging girlfriend and it feels like I am taking care of a child. 

If we break up, he can just go back to our home town and finishes classes but I am stuck here with work and school. I love my job but it doesn’t pay enough for me to live on my own in my current town along with my other expenses such as insurance and car payment,  (looking back I should not have gotten a newer car and stuck with my old Honda). 

What can I do to help get out of this situation and on my own? I’m trying to save money but I will not be able to afford first/last month, deposit and dog deposit for quite some time. I don’t even know where to begin and I’d appreciate any help from anyone who has experienced this before. 

TLDR: I want to break up with my boyfriend because his behavior has lead to me resenting him despite efforts to communicate with him about these problems. I can’t afford to live on my own right now due to school and work."
afd58c,37,2019-01-12,I [20M] got a girl pregnant from a one night stand,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/afd58c/i_20m_got_a_girl_pregnant_from_a_one_night_stand/,"I'm a 20 year old college student. The girl is 19 and goes to the same school that I do. I got her pregnant from a one night stand. She told me she was on birth control at the time, which is the only reason we had sex without protection. She thinks that the antibiotic she was on at the time counteracted the birth control (side note: is that a thing? I've always taken her word for this). The baby is definitely mine (we took a prenatal paternity test) and she has decided to keep it (she is in the second trimester now, so it isn't on the table anymore anyways).

The mother had no intention of telling me. I found out because her mother saw that my Facebook profile picture had my ex girlfriend in it and thought we were still dating. She thought I had cheated on my girlfriend, so she created a fake Facebook account to message my ex and tell her about the situation. My ex then sent screenshots of the messages to me...hell of a way to find out you're going to be a father.

I have been in touch with the soon-to-be-mother since, and we are on good terms. I have let her know that I am here to support her in any way that she needs. She has brought me to multiple doctors appointments, sends me videos of the baby kicking, and all around has been really good about involving me.

As supportive as I'm trying to be, I had no desire to have a kid at this stage in my life. I would have chosen abortion, and I   kindly let her know this back in the first trimester, but she said that wasn't an option. (No, she isn't Catholic)

**I have a couple things I want to get some advice on:**

**First, should I pursue a relationship with this girl at all?** I know we shouldn't force anything, and if we weren't a good fit I wouldn't push it further. But I'd like to at least try, because it would be best for the kid and would allow me to be more involved with its life. I honestly feel like me and this girl have pretty good chemistry. We slept together for a second time the day after I found out about the pregnancy, but since then she has been friendly but withdrawn and I feel as if she has closed the door to any type of relationship between us. Her mom got pregnant at 19 and her biological dad has been pretty removed from her life, so I have no doubt that has impacted her view on the situation and of me. Obliviously a forced relationship could just lead to more emotional struggle, but do you guys think it's at least worth the attempt? 

If not, how do I be the best father I can when the two of us aren't together?

**Second, I'm not really sure what to do about my career.** I am fortunate to have an internship for next summer at a company I really want to work for, and if I don't mess up this internship should convert to a full time offer. The thing is, the hours are famously terrible in this industry, especially at the junior level. I'm talking 80-100 hour work weeks, weekend work, little vacation time, etc. for at least the first two years. After that, it gets slightly better but is still highly demanding. For that reason, most people don't start a family in this industry until their 30s - which is exactly what I intended to do before this happened. I will also be working in a different city from where the girl and my child are for at least 2 years, so I won't really be able to see the child at all. I don't want to be a shitty dad, but I also don't want to sacrifice my career at this stage of my life either. If I don't follow a certain path in my early 20s, opportunities that I really want to have later in life will be closed off forever. That's just the nature of this industry. 

And it's not like she is making any career sacrifices. She still plans to graduate college, and then at some point she still wants to go to law school. Her parents are supporting her in this plan. There's obviously a lot that can change and there's a good chance this might not ever happen, but the point is that she chose to have this kid, and right now she isn't planning to sacrifice anything. It's hard for me to feel like I should sacrifice my dream career when she doesn't intend to.

I'll also only see the kid a fraction of the year anyways unless me and the mother live together, so giving up the job I want to still only be a part time father is a hard pill to swallow. 

I know that if I did start a relationship with this girl, this career wouldn't really be conducive to maintaining it. But my kid would be in my own home so I could play a much bigger role in their life. I'd also put more consideration to switching careers if it meant seeing my kid every day instead of just every other weekend. 

The upside of my career is that it's pretty lucrative. I should be able to fund my child's education and give them whatever they want - which I fully intend to do. But I feel like money is no substitute for being a father. 

Should I switch jobs to something with less hours? If not, how do I make the most of being a non-custodial parent working a highly demanding job?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a million other questions, but this post is already long. I'll accept any advice relative to this situation even if it doesn't have to do with the two above points. I really, really want to get this right, but it also doesn't feel fair for me to sacrifice my dreams for a kid I had no say in having, and one that I still wouldn't even know about if not for the girl I got pregnant's mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I am having a child at 20 with a girl I barely know, and I'm looking for any advice for how to handle this situation.** "

First of all, I want to thank this community for all the knowledge you have given me. As a college student, it can be hard to understand the process of getting an internship/job and everything that it entails. This community has really helped me in that regard.

Currently, I am in my third year at a 5 year MACC program at a top 5 school with a 3.38 GPA. This upcoming spring semester is when the majority of students recruit for internship positions with the Big 4, regional firms, and industry for both Spring 2020 and Summer 2020. I have decided that I want work for the Big 4, but am unsure of whether I should recruit for **Audit**, **Strategy/Management Consulting**, **Transaction Services**, or **FDD**. I have read a lot about audit, tax, and advisory positions, and these interest me the most. My questions for you are:

1. What position would you recommend I recruit for?
2. Is recruiting for different positions at different firms a good strategy? (for example, going for a consulting position at Deloitte and an audit position at PwC) Or is going for one position at all firms a better strategy?

I know that it should be my decision as it is my career, but I am having trouble and am hoping that this post will help to better inform my decision. Any input or advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks.

I'm an intern in a nursing home and I mainly do activities/socializing with the residents. In a few months I will be shadowing Nurses and CNA's as well as OT/PT. 

GI tract symptoms have been becoming very present in some residents starting this past week. To make it worse, this week and last week, a little less than a handful of people who share the office I am in were vomiting or having diarrhea. I worked with two of these people on Tuesday and Wednesday I believe. Friday morning (yesterday) one of them came in and vomited in the bathroom - not the one I use - then left right away. She was also sick the night before. 

I wiped the office down with these Sani Cloth Plus wipes but they did not claim to kill norovirus. The infection control nurse had maintenance wipe the dining area down with bleach this week as well. 

So... I've been so anxious the last day or two especially thinking the norovirus is going to strike me at any given time. I can't afford to miss even one day right now (this was my first week too) because of the amount of hours I need to graduate. 

What can I do to stay healthy? Currently I wash my hands whenever I can, use a bathroom not many people use, try not to touch my face, and I immediately change my clothes and sometimes shower after work. "

I didn't connect with anyone, everyone just kinda steered clear of me, and I did the same. The exception being three girls, let's call them Louise, Victoria, and Danielle. It was lunch one day when they approached, and sat down next to me. They tried to get a conversation going with me, and surprisingly enough I actually enjoyed talking to them. Later they asked for my Instagram, and requested to follow me later that day. I figured they were nice enough and accepted the request. We hung out a couple times after that and I really appreciated having some friends. To show them my appreciation I asked my mom to swing by with a Pizza if I payed, because parents and guardians were allowed to drop things off. I gave them the Pizza which they insisted we split four ways out in a public area. This cycle continued for a while with me getting something for them since my parents lived in town and them being very appreciative, at times even returning with a gesture of their own.

However, about a month into the school year, the girls started changing. They started demanding/expecting things instead of me doing them to be nice. They stopped insisting on sharing, and later asked for me to bring things to their room (boys are prohibited inside a female room) so I couldn't talk or anything. If I got them one pizza, they'd guilt trip me over not buying two. I felt less like a friend being kind, and more like the intern running around getting things for the boss. Like I was bending over backwards for these people I didn't even like anymore. The straw that broke the camel's back finally hit when the girls wanted pizza, but I was out of cash. My family had been going through a rough time and there was far less money to go around so naturally I had less money than normal. Instead of understanding. I got called a “broke ass nigga,” was called a “fake friend,” and was told by Louise to unfollow her or she'd block me.


Flash forward to mid October, and my family's financial situation has gotten better. I had some cash, and tired of the, at this point, outrageous demands, I decided to take the initiative to give them something they didn't ask for. A chocolate bar, the World's hottest chocolate bar (which is 1,000 times hotter than a Jalapeno, and almost 4 times hotter than a Carolina Reaper). My mom had a friend who owns a novelty gift shop here in town so my mom bought three bars and dropped them off for me. I unwrapped them so they couldn't tell it was anything other than regular chocolate, threw them into their own ziploc bags, and dropped by their room with the chocolate. 

I had just returned to my room when my phone started going off like crazy. I had a ton of DM's from Victoria asking what the hell was in the chocolate. I told her, and she lost her shit. Texting in all caps about how they all ate their bar in one bite. Danielle texted me a while later bitching at me for “setting her mouth on fire,” and all 3 promptly blocked me on Instagram.

Since then, all three of them have both unblocked me and requested to follow me, and have mellowed out. They've quit demanding things, and I've sure as shit quit offering them things.

TL;DR I gave some girls a Pizza among other things to be nice, they started taking advantage of me and demanded more than I could give, getting angry when I didn't deliver, so I got them back with some “sweet” revenge. Am I the asshole?"
affs0z,4,2019-01-12,"After years of a ""happy family"", parents may get divorced. My mom keeps confiding in me [24F] and I'm struggling to handle it all. What should I do.",reallylost23,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/affs0z/after_years_of_a_happy_family_parents_may_get/,"My mom took a stress leave from work and it looks like she's headed for an unexpected early retirement. Having more time on her hands, one day she noticed my dad seemed to be behaving weird and she caught him lying about who he said he was hanging out with (a female coworker rather than a friend). He says its just friendship; there's a lot of signs it's not.  He deleted their text conversations which seems suspect to me. He keeps trying to make things up to her by going out with her which is almost harder to see than if he didn't do anything at all.

My parents never used to argue and my dad is a workoholic. He often travels for work and he constantly is out with coworkers. When he's with my mom he basically spends all his free time getting her to do whatever chores or activities he wants to do. She always trusted him and was happy to do whatever he wanted, but I've always felt it wasn't very sustainable.

So now they talk and argue all the time. My room is right beside theirs and they wake me up in the morning. They would lock themselves into rooms in the house for a while, now they talk openly and loudly. I keep hearing snippets about their personal life that are really uncomfortable. My mom tells me information in details, such as emails she saw, and now graphic things from their past relationships. She's even telling me things from her parents' relationship, which ended in her father's suicide (also recently acquired information). She's telling me her comments about how his kids (me and my sister) stress him out. I seem to be learning shocking new secrets every day, both about the situation and her past. My mom will also not stop attacking him, which I'm started to think is useless. He's not going to open up any more than he already has, and her getting angry at him makes her feel worse after, but she can't stop.

I grew up very naive and very trusting, like my mom. Honestly, I was the most childish, innocent, unable-to-read-between-the-lines, ""good kid"" person you'd ever meet entering their 20s (and my friends were the same). I did begin to question how my dad spend his time, as his work gives him random periods of free time, and he would be vague about where he was going. But this is still shocking and I feel alienated going through something like this as an adult rather than a child, realizing my family may have basically been a lie. My mom's radical personality change is haunting.

I feel like this situation could've been a bit less stressful if I got my shit together sooner and moved out. The city I live in, it's very common for kids to live with their parents, and I was in university for most it, but I still feel dumb. I was really good at not being home when I was working but the weird school schedule I'm in means I'm home more often than I'm used to and exposed to the issue constantly.

Life problems aside I'm finishing the final term of my master's with an extra course after working full time for 8-months. The adjustment is already hard. For other reasons I've been finding this entire degree the most stressful part of my life. I've had some pretty severe breakdowns over it and other things going on in my life. My hair has thinned drastically. I can't gain weight. I was really depressed after I finished my undergrad degree without any kind of career path and pushing myself through this degree was supposed to be the thing that got me back on track but I honestly can barely keep it together without having panic attacks. The looming divorce is throwing me over the edge. I don't know if I'm going to graduate. If I somehow do, I'll be so mentally messed up that I don't really see myself stable enough to hold a well-paying corporate job. I feel like my life is shattered.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are

1. Is moving out the way to deal with this? I'm a student and not working but I have money saved from my summer jobs, part time jobs and internships. Technically I could afford to move out for a year, but it would eat up the majority of my savings. Rent in my city is extremely competitive and expensive, it would be very time consuming for me to secure a place especially since I'm not working yet. It would add stress on top of my crazy workload. But I don't know how much I can stand living here and focus on my work. I'm definitely on the edge of a huge breakdown.
2. I don't know how to put boundaries between my parents, especially my mom. She hasn't really told anyone about it and has more time on her hands than she's ever had in my life, so she dwells on it and then talks about it with me. She is also confiding in my sister, who has poor mental health and will probably break down soon. She is another person I've had to emotionally support throughout my life. My mom needs to talk and has no one (she tried to see a therapist but she prematurely closed the case, saying she should see couple therapy instead, even though my mom wants individual therapy first). I'm not sure how to get space because I feel like a bad daughter. my mom has always listened to me when I was upset.
3. What are the resources I should turn to? Like rent, a good therapist is hard to find, expensive, and competitive (e.g., waitlists). My mental health is already bad. I don't know how the hell mid-20s adults deal with divorce when this typically happens when people are children.

\*\*tl;dr\*\* After never really arguing and having a seemingly good relationship, my mom caught my dad lying about who he was spending his time with and I think they might divorce; they fight constantly, she is using me as a primary person to confide in but it's making me really uncomfortable; I don't know if I should move out, how to get resources to cope, and what my boundaries should be in this situation.

It's pretty fun to hang out together but nowadays I can't really connect to them very well. My issue with them has been that they usually only want to talk about sex and dating.

To me it looks like they're kinda obsessed with Tinder and dating apps. When I was learning more about the ace community and becoming more comfortable with it last year, the whole group was going through a bit of a rough patch in general. I had a hard time feeling relevant in discussions with my friends because they usually want to make jokes about how much they're into their 'type', that celebrity that they can't stop gushing over how hot they are, and mostly whoever they've been talking to on snapchat or Tinder.

My friends have other interesting aspects of their lives though: internships, volunteering, jobs, the movies and shows they like to watch. All things that rarely ever come up.

I wouldn't want to be friends with only ace people to feel happy with my friendships. I know plenty of other people who are really kinky and talk about sex but are still interested in talking about other things. I might have just grown apart from this particular group of friends.

I'm curious to know how the friends you guys have are like and how relevant sex and dating is in your conversations."

My girlfriend and I met in the same city and went into a sort of ""romantic friendship"" kind of thing for 5 months because we knew she was leaving across the country at some point. 

We set boundaries and said that we shouldn't have sex, but obviously we did in those 5 months lol. While we were in Orlando together, we weren't dating because it was too much for her. I felt like I was being dragged around because I wanted to be treated like I was important, but it seemed like I was in second place to where she was planning on moving. 

Fast forward to now we started officially dating 2 weeks before she left. She's lived in New York for 5 months, and I'm in Orlando. 

She has a part time job and hasn't found a full time job yet.....her parents paid her way up there, paid for her internship that unfortunately didn't lead anywhere, and they just recently stopped paying for her Uber's and groceries. She shares an apartment with her brother, who was paying most of the rent until recently (she now has enough money to make the rent pay more even).....obviously I'm a little bitter about it all. Here's why.
 
She's always wanted to live in NY and when she moved I still felt like I was second place to a city. But now she wants to come home to be with me and her family. But she won't... She said she wants to give it one year FROM NOW and then maybe come home. She wants to stay there ""for her"" and coming home is ""her comfort zone"" her staying there is ""proving something to herself."" 

She asks why I can't just move up to NY but we've talked about it before and how it's impossible. I'm 3 years from having a degree, so moving is unreasonable for me. And I dont have parents that will pay $5k-$10k within 4 months to move me/support my move. We're not as well off as them.

She has ALL the control over whether or not we can live in the same place because she can move back any time to live with her parents and try to find work from there. 

(Searching for a job in NY)
vs 
(Searching for a job in Orlando) with me

But she is deciding to keep hurting herself and keep hurting me. All of this is so she can prove something to herself and say that she tried to make it. 

Should I wait for her to decide that she wants to come home? I've done everything except beg her to come back. 

I'm honestly breaking apart....


P.s. I admire her for wanting to stay and try as hard as she can to stay, but when it's hurting her and me, I don't get it. "

There’s no making this short, but allow me to try and condense my own background: I am a lesbian college (senior year) student that has had a tumultuous relationship with my immediate family (in part due to my sexuality after being forcibly outed) that prevented me from forming close interpersonal relationships of any sort throughout my childhood and adolescence. My first was with a girl who casually admitted that she was originally planning on using me for casual sex to distract herself from her “break up” from an emotionally abusive ex of 2 years (scare quotes because I later found out they never actually had a formal break up to begin with). I told myself even back then that letting myself fall for her was a bad idea, but I was so desperate for someone to be close to, and told me that I helped her “get over” this ex, and we became inseparable. We moved in after a year of dating. Her ex wouldn’t let her go. They regularly fought, they stalked each other’s social media, the ex stalked mine regularly, and sent both my gf and I anonymous messages via tumblr either berating me, my gf, or making inappropriate sexual comments towards us (asking if we’d consider a threesome etc). Despite this happening, my gf brought up her ex constantly throughout the duration of the relationship. The things she was angry with the ex about, as well as good stories about her and their times together...including graphic details of the sex they had. My gf cried several months (6+ months) into our relationship because she found out that her (bisexual) ex started dating a man. I drove over to her house to comfort her about this and cried on my way there, then acted like it was totally fine and understandable and held her. She justified this by saying that it was “only because she was now dating a guy” and “would’ve been happy for her if she dated another woman”. 

When I finally confronted her about how I was uncomfortable about the way she and her ex interacted, my gf became angry and defensive. I didn’t hear about her as much any more. Suddenly, their interactions stopped...but not really. Being suspicious as I was, I went through her texts while she was in the bathroom one day. Of course, she and her ex were still cycling through trying to be friendly followed by continued arguing about their relationship. This was over a year into she and I dating. 

Things seemed to genuinely get better after she and I moved in together (I know. I’m an idiot). I really thought she was my girl, and that she finally moved past her ex. I bought her the puppy she always wanted. We went on vacations together. We built our little apartment together. 3 years into our relationship, school got really intense for me (I am preparing to apply to medical school this year). She was frustrated that I didn’t have any free time to spend with her and that I was so stressed that I didn’t spend as much time fawning over her like I used to (she used to call me whipped/a puppy dog all the time, because I was. I adore(d) her). In turn, I was upset that she didn’t value how important my goals were to me. I had only spent my entire life building myself up to become a doctor someday. It was a goal of mine since childhood, and I worked hard in high school to get accepted to a good university, where I am working my ass off to make myself a competitive applicant for med school. Regardless—We began fighting regularly, but it always ended with us kissing and making up, holding each other in bed and crying and whispering “I love you’s”. Then we’d fight again over something small. We’d talk about breaking up and question each other if they still loved the other. You know. All that messy shit. 

One day—during finals week, mind you—I was busy, and she told me that she was going to “hang out with one of her guy friends”. I genuinely didn’t think anything of this; she was frequently hanging out with her buddies (verified by her snapchats that it was actually them). We were doing OK. She was gone from 2 pm until 11:15 pm, and texted me almost the entire time. She seemed cheerful, texted me that she loved me. At 11:15, I was studying and started getting ready for bed. I hear a knock on the sliding glass door from the balcony. This isn’t that abnormal; my gf often entered through the side door when she parked her car on the side of our apartment building (we lived on the first floor). I open up the blinds a bit to see the shape of a woman who is definitely not my gf. I open the door to see my gf’s ex, who I had never met before. She explains that she was with her, and that she (my gf) got so drunk that when she got out of the car to come home, she couldn’t even walk. Her ex couldn’t lift her to the door. In shock, I go outside to get my gf. She’s holding herself up on the side of her ex’s car (the car she searched every parking lot we went together to make sure that her vehicle wasn’t there). I try to help her inside, and she immediately collapses on the ground, barely conscious. I carry her to the back porch where her ex and I pick burs out of her hair. The ex is using so much tender care in doing so that I feel like vomiting myself. My gf, almost falling over while sitting up, grabs my shirt mumbling about how much she loves me. I ask the ex what happened and notice that she’s slightly drunk and flustered. She just says “I don’t know”. 
I situate my gf on the couch and the ex leaves. Within seconds, what just happened hits me like a train. I locate my gf’s phone to go through it, where I find flirtatious (although not completely outright condemning) texts. Things like sheepishly asking if she can please see her, a long, motivational text punctuated with “have a good day at work, lil lady” and heart emojis. I come across a picture, from a couple weeks ago, of my gf and her ex snuggled together under the covers in bed. I am sobbing. She realizes I have her phone, and this prompts my gf to make herself stand up, and she physically attacks me. She puts me in a chokehold from behind and then bites me so hard on the shoulder that she left me bleeding, which became welt and a huge bruise. I am bawling at this point and tell her I hate her, I hate that she could do this. 
She’s screaming at me that she didn’t cheat on me. I say she’s full of shit and tell her to go back to sleep on the couch and let me sleep in bed. She refuses and says “it’s her bed” and proceeds to try and bite me again, shove me, and kick me. When she kicks me off the bed, she comes up to me and puts me in a corner to scream at the top of her lungs that she hates me and wants me to kill myself, that she hopes I fucking die. I am crying and telling her to get out of our room and take the blanket and sleep on the couch. She looks at me dead in the eye with almost animalistic hate, and tells me again that she hopes I fucking go through with killing myself. It’s important to mention that I had confided in her multiple times that I had been suicidal before, and at that time, she held me and cried and told me I “couldn’t kill her favorite person on earth”, so hearing her say this was completely shattering. She was my only support system. She was the one who held me when my parents made me feel like I would never be worth anything. 
After screaming at me about how much she hated me, she eventually goes to the couch to sleep only to bust into the bedroom at 5 AM. She forces herself in the bed. I tell her to get out. The same situation basically repeats. She tries to bite me. She shoves. She tells me I had “better fucking kill myself”. This time, she says she needs me to go get her truck, which is parked at the closest grocery store parking lot about a mile and a half away. I refuse. She tells me again to die, and runs out the door to go walk to the truck. It’s not a super safe area, especially at 5 AM when its dark, and she’s 5’3 and still pretty intoxicated and reckless. I give in and drive down the block to find her, get her in my car, and go to get the truck. When we reach the parking lot, she refuses to get out the car. She begs to have me back, that she can’t lose me. I tell her no. She keeps asking and I keep declining. She screams “WHY”! Then catches herself, apologizes for yelling, and tells me she loves me and swears she’d never cheat on me. I decline. She starts saying she fucking hates me again. I tell her to get out of my car. She does, yelling about how much she hates me and hopes I go through with killing myself. She gets in her truck, and starts swerving out of the driveway. She rolls down her window to scream, at the top of her lungs, for me to die, to kill myself, before driving off. It was 6 AM at this point. There were people there. I sit in my car, alone, and cry. I have to work an 8 hour shift in a few hours. 
She texts me about how sorry she is that she hurt me and won’t stop swearing that she didn’t cheat on me, that she reconnected with her ex, but it was totally platonic and she talked about how much she loved me but was sad about how things were between us. She claimed she showed her ex pictures of my trips, and said her ex even vouched for our relationship being viable when she told her that she felt insecure not pursuing a higher education after high school while I was going to become a doctor, that she “wasn’t good enough for me”. 
I go to work and my coworker, who was supposed to be getting off when I had my lunch break, notices that I am torn apart despite trying to hold it together. He offers to take my entire shift and I go home (he’s still a good buddy of mine).  My gf texts me that she “fucking hates me” and that the way I forced her out of bed made her “feel like a cornered animal”, and that’s why she became physically violent with me. I find this really upsetting, because she’s got to be sober by now. I never would’ve foreseen her doing this. This is literally worse than most awful nightmare I could fathom. I go home to talk to her in person. She’s calmed down a little, and I ask her questions.
I ask her how long they’d been seeing each other. She says not that long, they’d only hung out a couple times. I tell her that I noticed that her text logs with her went back months. She changes her story. They’d only hung out 6 times but talked a lot. 
I ask her how could she have not been cheating with me if she was laying in bed with her like that. She says it wasn’t like that; her ex moved back in with her dad and was living in her dad’s guest room, which was too tiny and had nowhere else to sit. I question why under a blanket, then. She says that it was because there was a lot of stuff on the bed and her pulled it up because it was otherwise just a mattress with some junk on it (???). When I press her on why that doesn’t make sense, she cries and screams and it escalates to telling me she hates me again. 
I ignore her and she continuously texts me about how I was her world, how she couldn’t love anyone else, how she regretted everything, how she wasn’t, couldn’t be, remotely attracted to her ex; her ex had grown “frumpy” since they dated in high school, she was “basically straight” because she hadn’t dated another woman since her, and most of all, she had an abortion, which made her extremely ugly and heterosexual, I guess. She talks a bunch of shit about her ex. How she’s in considerable credit card debt, she has gone through 17 jobs in a year, she hoards animals and lives in filth. 
She says she’s gone through all the pictures she has of me, and how I’m so beautiful, and how she can’t believe she would do anything to hurt someone like me, the only true love of her life, the person she wanted to marry and have kids with. She sends paragraphs, essays, of love letters and apologies, and I decide to talk to her after I get off of work.
I get back to our apartment from work, and she’s there with a shit ton of groceries, and says she has gifts for me. She bought me a bunch of crystals from a local hippie crystal store, a beautiful necklace, replenished our fridge with groceries and my favorite sweets, bought beauty products from lush, and some sage to burn to “truly start over and get that energy out of the house”. I immediately want to cry. This wasn’t how she was treating me before. It’s not how she ever treated me. I’m weak and pathetic and I say that she can stay in our apartment for now, but I want answers and won’t truly be with her again until I have them. She sees the massive welt she left on my shoulder, with clear teeth marks starting to scab over. She asks if she did that and cries. She says this was a wake up call, this pulled her out of her shit, that she felt like she was in a weird, dissociative state in the months leading up until now, and she sees clearly that it’s always been me, and she knows what she must do, and will do anything to even get a chance to build up trust with me again. I say she has to answer questions honestly. She agrees. It never goes well. Anytime she’s caught on an obvious lie about her relationship with her ex, it becomes screaming about how “I’m not even giving her a chance”, tells me to go fuck myself, etc. 
A couple days later, things seem fine, but I’m now the one obsessing over her ex’s social media. I find that even now, she’s blatantly liking her ex’s photos on instagram. I confront her on this. She tells me that I’m “fucking crazy” for checking. I break down. Not even because I found this, but because I can’t believe she would sink this low after 4 years. 
I don’t let this go, and tell her that everything is a lie. I ask her through tears why she always chooses her ex over me, even now. She does what she always does. You can probably predict what she says at this point. She also says “I’m being insane” and that she was ALWAYS only friends with her ex and wants to continue being friends with her. Tells me that she never got closure with her, that she had hope that she change, that she was a really good friend to her, and that she never stopped loving her, just stopped loving her in a romantic sense. 
At this point, I really do want to kill myself. I get scared all alone in the house. I find myself in a dazed state on the floor of the kitchen with a knife. I cut deep slices in my hips and thighs. I get really scared I’m going to take it further and call her. She’s all I’ve got, all I’ve had, since I moved out of my parent’s home. She doesn’t pick up. I leave her sickening voicemails, crying, saying I need her, begging her to talk to me. Eventually, she lets me know that me “being psycho” caused her ex to block her and stop talking to her, and that she doesn’t want to anything to do with this. She blames me. She cries and says she really wanted her ex to stay in her life. It pains me to type this, but after I cry about how badly that stings, I comfort her. I apologize. I feel sick to my stomach, but I do it.
I give her permission to be friends with her as long as I can see all conversations with her ex and I am involved and its not private. I do the stupid thing and I try to befriend her ex, I send her a message apologizing for how this has played out and follow her on instagram. I feel completely depersonalized acting like this. I do it, but I feel nauseous the entire time. I feel/know I’m diminishing my own worth. Her ex has none of it. She walks away, presumably never speaking to my girlfriend again. 
Things never get truly better, but my girlfriend and I continue to live together. We cycle between me acting like things are OK, and things blowing up in our faces if I bring anything about her affair up (this includes saying it was an affair, or questioning her in any way, or expressing any hurt related to what she did). She claims that she’s told me all that there is, and she wishes she hadn’t deleted all the messages so I could see them, that she can’t make me believe the truth nor can she go back and fix what she did, but if I keep dwelling we’re not moving forward and there’s no point. I’m scared of her leaving, so I usually drop it. I quietly hurt immensely until it bottles up, I bring it up, we fight, and she tries to leave. I get scared, and so I calm her down and tell her things are OK. The way in which she handles our fights doesn’t get better. She cries, she screams, she tells me to fuck off, she tells me she hates me. At one point, while I’m crying to her about how I hate her lying and how badly it hurts me, she gets really quiet, then tells me through clenched teeth that she wishes she could “punch me in the face right now”. Another time, in my car, we have a fight that ends with her getting so besides herself that she kicks my windshield so hard that it cracks severely, almost breaking and making it so that there’s virtually no visibility on the passenger side. Obviously, all my coworkers ask me what happened to my vehicle. I lie and I tell them that I don’t know; I parked downtown and some drunk guy must’ve broken it or something.  
Two things happen in the weeks following this series of awful, dehumanizing nightmare: I try to reconnect with my family, to see if they can act as my support system. Since being the only member of my family who made it as far as getting admitted to a notable 4 year university, plus admission to the competitive, closed school of natural sciences and pre-med program, my parents had become more amicable to me. I thought that maybe, since they were now bragging to their friends and other family members about “their straight-A pre-med daughter at &lt;insert school here&gt;” and no longer breaking into my car to leave homophobic Catholic brochures about “my lifestyle” while I was at work (that’s whole other can of worms!), we could reconnect. It doesn’t go well, which I really more or less anticipated, but wanted to at least try running somewhere else. I run back to my girlfriend for comfort. She holds me. Tells me I’m perfect. Tells me she’s so sorry for the way she’s acted, and she wants to be better, good for me. Tells me I can go through her phone any time I want. Says she’d do anything in the world to be what I want, to try again. I suspect that this change of heart only happened because her ex cut her off because she didn’t want to deal with this drama. I think this, even then, but I allow myself to fall for it. I become smitten with her over the summer break, when I only have to deal with my jobs and internships and few other distractions. We still have awful fights, but she doesn’t wish for my death. She seems like she’s really trying. I, on the other hand, feel permanently changed. I feel like a piece of trash, less than that. I feel like I lost my sense of self entirely, but I keep up the same cycle of acting like things are OK when I’m really hurting, exploding with hurt and anger, fighting, making up, and going back to normal. I continue this even after I notice that while I’m sitting next to my girlfriend on instagram, she has a conversation going with her ex. She quickly deletes it when she sees that I saw it, and I run off to the bedroom to cry. She told me that all her ex said was “hey”, and she ignored it. I just cry. I cry and then I ignore it to study for my genetics exam and pretend it didn’t happen. 
A year passes. Things seemingly become really good. I still hurt, I still think about what happened every single day and the love I have for my girlfriend is not the same. It’s painful, it’s shameful, but I still want it. I still look at her and think she’s beautiful. I love the way her eyes look at me when I can tell that she’s thinking the same thing about me. It’s pathetic, but I can’t stop adoring her. 
I have a truly incredible six months during the first half of 2018. I’m taking longer than I anticipated to graduate, but I’m excelling and continually performing within the top percentile. I’m a senior officer of the pre-(medical profession I am choosing) club. I receive glowing praise from professors and my employers that ask me—not the other way around—if they could write me letters of recommendation. I take on even more work relevant to my future career. I obtain multiple internships. I thrive when working, it makes me feel alive. I start a position as a undergrad TA, and a couple students request me by name to help them. Students in my own classes that I have never met face to face (or at all) start messaging me on facebook because they need advice on succeeding in difficult, upper division science courses. I feel alive when I’m working or on campus. I feel like I’m worth something, and I feel like my dreams I’ve worked so hard towards are edging very close to reality. As soon as I go home to my girlfriend, though, that sense of worth is drained from my body and I go back to feeling like a 4-year rebound, a pathetic dog. It’s easier to ignore, though, and so I carry on with her with minimal fights. I am a complete idiot, and do this knowing I’m making a poor decision, but I put a deposit down on another house to move into with...with her. I let myself give up and keep my misery and self hate to myself, and go full time pretending that it’s OK, in exchange for having someone hold me at night and tell me they’re proud of me, even if it’s the person that hurt me most.
Almost exactly a year past DDay, however, I come home late from a volunteer shift with the hospital. She’s already passed out in bed, but she left her computer unlocked. Something very primal in me drives me to scourge it. 
I find a chat app with a chat between she and her ex. It’s from 2017, but what I find makes me stop breathing.
There are several nudes from her ex sent to her. My girlfriend responds emphatically to them. My girlfriend complains because she thought her ex was house sitting for someone and wanted to come over without worry of her ex’s dad (her ex is 24, almost 25; I know this makes her sound younger) being around and recognizing her. Her ex sends selfies of her, and my girlfriend is fawning over how cute she is and how much she misses her. A few “I really don’t want to hurt &lt;my name&gt;’s” are sprinkled throughout when the talk is serious about them, but this shit goes back...for months. I wake up my girlfriend and I tell her, calmly, that we are breaking up. That she wasted a year of my time, in addition to the 4 prior years. I stay calm and tell her to leave. 
Unlike last year, she spares me the vitriol and abuse. She just cries and begs and says she’ll delete all her social media and chat apps and wishes her ex would die, that all she ever wanted was me, that things were going so well between us and she loved feeling normal and good with me. She claims that she responded to her ex’s nudes the way that she did because “she just felt awkward” and “knew she had to” in order to keep her ex around, and since she was “in such a bad place”, that seemed like the only option available. When I accused her of cheating this time, she admits it. Later on, she takes it back. She says “she only called it cheating because my definition of cheating was just receiving the photos” but she never did anything “really cheating”, aka physical, with her ex. I message one of her friends, who told me that my gf came to her almost immediately after DDay and told her that she (my gf) was cheating on me while it was going on and it was overwhelming her with guilt. So, to my face, my gf “wasn’t really cheating on me and only called it that because that’s my definition of cheating”, and to this day, maintains that she wasn’t, but when it was going on, she told her friend that she was cheating on my behind my back the entire time. It doesn’t add up. And she still holds on to it.

To make matters worse, my family situation escalated while I was going through this, and they started stalking me and breaking into my home to go through my things. The police were involved at one point, and I had to break my lease and move for my safety (why didn’t I call the police when I was being physically assaulted by my girlfriend? I don’t know, but I regret it every day). I didn’t have anywhere to go, so I am still with this girl. Living with her. Financially dependent on her now, so I can afford to pay for school. I’m so close to being done and I am being told by members of the board of admissions and my employers that I will be a phenomenal doctor. I can’t just quit now, so I am just pretending it’s OK. I am hurting and contemplating suicide every day, and I hate myself for being with her and I hate lying about everything, all the time. I feel like I’ll fall apart at any moment, and the only thing keeping me together is my work and school, and so that’s all I do...but I’m on break right now, so it’s not constant, and I’m really at my wit’s end. I can’t do this anymore. 

I don’t know why I shared this much; I just have no one to really tell and I needed to put it somewhere and this forum felt like the place. I would, however, really like to know if anyone has ever knowingly made themselves small and pathetic and almost intentionally destroyed their self worth and came out of it OK, or is at least on their way to be OK. I would also love to hear from lesbians or other LGBT+ people that have been in a toxic, codependent relationship, which I acknowledge this is. It feels difficult to find support anywhere for it. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

afg9a4,0,2019-01-13,(F4A playing M) A List of Prompts,rk679,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/afg9a4/f4a_playing_m_a_list_of_prompts/,"Hey, DPP! 

**Before I get started, please know I’m looking for someone who will be able to discuss characters and the settings before starting, use either Reddit Chat (NOT PMs), Discord, or Kik, and be able to give more than one sentence/speech only replies. If you can’t do these things, I’m sorry, but we probably won’t mesh well together.**

Alrighty, now that that’s out of the way, we can get to the prompts! Most might be shorter term, but I am open for expanding all of them and making it longer term. Also, I’d love long term partners. We can always move onto another prompt when one has served its purpose!

&gt;**1.)** *Doctor’s Visit.* My character is visiting a doctor for a checkup, preferably seeing a gynecologist for the first time. Anyway, she’s trying to get on birth control. Your character is her doctor (perhaps 30+? Doesn’t have to be if you don’t want him to be!) and he just can’t get enough of how beautiful she is. So, he decides to do a more “necessary” check up. (*Note: I would love to involve impreg with this, and extend it into a longer term RP! She gets knocked up and has to see him for more checkups, or maybe he’s a part time professor at her university, or maybe even a next door neighbor and family friend? Possibilities are endless!*)

&gt;**2.)** *The Intern.* Your character is a partner at a major law firm. He is in dire need for an assistant. My character is hired as an intern, so he seizes the opportunity and has her internship as working as his assistant. Then, he starts to notice how drop dead gorgeous my character is while his wife just gets uglier and less appealing with every year. Plus, she won’t give him any. So, he takes matters into his own hands. I’d prefer this one to lean toward him taking advantage of her or forcing her into a sexual relationship with him, but I’m open to ideas!

&gt;**3.)** *Daddy’s Little Girl.* Your character is going through a divorce. Or, maybe he’s not. Maybe his wife just isn’t the same anymore as she gets older. He’s the professor at the local university, where his daughter happens to attend. She rides to and from campus with him daily to save money. Everything was going fine until a student made a joke to him one day about his daughter being his girlfriend/lover. Then his mind starts to wonder. On the drive home, he decides to act. Also would like this one to be more of a non-con aspect to it, maybe even throwing in that he wants to breed her because his wife refuses to have anymore children. But, how does he do it? Is the house empty so he goes straight home? Or does he go to an abandoned parking lot and pull her into the backseat to fill his desires and her pussy? 

&gt;**4.)** *Kitty.* Your character could be anything. Single guy who never had a family, family man looking for something interesting in his and his wife’s/children’s lives (Sorry, but I wouldn’t include the wife or any female children in the sexual side of things. Sons or family friends, maybe), anything you want really. Whatever his story is, he decides to adopt a neko one day, a cute little catgirl. She’s a delightful pet in the beginning, but then one day.. her heat hits. She has an uncontrollable desire to sit on a cock and get bred, and she’ll be hurting for a while unless you give her release. You don’t want your kitty to suffer, so you give her what she needs. Your cock. Your seed. You give it all, just for your little kitty. 

**All characters 18+.**

Kinks: impreg/breeding/pregnancy, unprotected sex, dom/sub (light), incest, non-con/rape, drugging, blackmail, light restraint, clothed sex, lingerie, short skirts, age differences, secrecy

Limits: anal (anything with the asshole really), bathroom stuff, feet, femdom, gore, vomit, extreme violence"
afgc76,0,2019-01-13,(M4F) Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,CelebDPP,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelebDPP/comments/afgc76/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

My kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, breeding/impregnation. Other kinks can be brought up in your PM.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you.

(I must specify that any roleplay done with other individuals does not promote violence or hatred towards women. I am also only interested in roleplaying with 18+ individuals only.)"

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you.

(I must specify that any roleplay done with other individuals does not promote violence or hatred towards women. I am also only interested in roleplaying with 18+ individuals only.)"

Hello, I'd like to ask for some advice as I will soon be moving to Berlin to undertake an internship. I currently live in ireland, though before I arrive in Germany I am trying to book an apartment through the Internet (nightmare) but I also would like to open a German bank account.
Would it be suitable for me to open an N26 Account as they are German and have German IBAN number?? Even if I register my address as an irish one. Many thanks in advance

afglfs,4,2019-01-13,Question about internships,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/afglfs/question_about_internships/,"How many internships should I have throughout my stay in college? I'm in my last semester of community college right now about to take my second accounting class (mangerial accounting). 

I want to secure an internship right when I transfer to university. How hard will that be? I'm kind of scared to be honest because I know that experience is a major part of getting hired in a firm. 

So, let's say I get hired as an intern during my first quarter of transferring to UC, should I stick with it throughout my whole stay at the UC, or should I have experience at 1-3 internships? "
afhgep,2,2019-01-13,How can I improve my chances in my situation?,BluEch0,jobsearchhacks,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/afhgep/how_can_i_improve_my_chances_in_my_situation/,"So my specific background: 

 - I have a B.S. in aerospace from an ABET accredited institution. I graduated June 2018
 - I was not a bad student but also not a great student. My gpa was just over a 3.0, just under if counting only major related classes. 
 - Id like to claim expertise in mechanical design (not too sure if I really can), but I also know how to CAD, code, and I have an interest in robotics and controls theory (I plan to get a MS and PhD in robotics in the future, but I don’t yet have one)
 - I’m not a US citizen, locking me out of any defense companies or anything that needs a security clearance. 
 - all my relevant experience so far has been from school clubs. I was unable to get any industry internships or jobs. 
 - currently applying mainly to jobs in the aerospace and robotics fields (that don’t require DoD clearance)

Feel free to ask me for any clarifying info. 

I’m just not sure what to do. I’m not getting anything back from employers. I’ve revised my resume countless times, even getting the opinion of people in the industries I’m looking at but I never hear back. I have no connections in the industries I’m looking to enter and I Im honestly growing dejected and tensions are rising at home. 

So I guess the point of my post is how can I up my chances of getting hired, and as an aside, would anyone be willing to take on a mentor/advisor role for me if that would help my career goals?

afj1ng,2,2019-01-13,[Futa 4 A Playing F] The Multiple prompt list. Something for everyone! I hope.. (Multiple prompts) (Open prompts) (Light or dark) (Very long!),Soapydopey69,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/afj1ng/futa_4_a_playing_f_the_multiple_prompt_list/,"Hey people of FRP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

I enjoy playing Futa but only if your character is female. This is important! If you're curious, I tend to play a more 'realistic' character and by that I mean one that isn't HH cup breasts, an ass as big as the earth and a cock the size of the empire state!

My preference of character is one that looks like Jenna Mcdougall (I'm aware she's a celeb, but I'm only using her looks not her status). If you don't know what she looks like, I recommend you google her, she's a petite blonde that should be okay for our RP. If you have a suggestion yourself about a 'natural' looking girl, let me know!

And if you're after a 'Surprise I'm futa!' Scene aswell, this can be incorporated if necessary.

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Tight clothing, CFNM and outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**The threesome with the two sisters:** It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with D over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

**Others:** Free use, throat fucking, breeding, public stuff, raceplay, outercourse. Literally anything. Message me with your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me. Mixing up multiple prompts is also very welcome :)

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary and BONUS points if you let me choose your character)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes;)"

**108,298** Switch Gamers *looking for deals* for **2 years!**

So, you've been saving up for months, and now the day has finally come. You've just bought a brand new Nintendo Switch and you can't wait to sit down and play some Zelda and Smash. You set it up and then you realise, you haven't bought any games or accessories and you haven't got a lot of money left. Well this is where /r/NintendoSwitchDeals comes in! This passionate community of Nintendo Switch gamers is always on the lookout for the best deals on [games](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitchDeals/comments/a2c2ka/civilization_vi_switch_3999_target/), [controllers](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitchDeals/comments/a7p2sb/both_colors_of_joy_cons_5999_at_meijer/), [accessories](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitchDeals/comments/a1z9a6/go_check_your_local_walmart_discount_aisle/) and more, so you and everyone else can save themselves some cash. 


I have personally used a couple of deals from the subreddit and I find their [eShop deals thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitchDeals/comments/9oz8ia/current_nintendo_switch_eshop_deals/), which updates in real time and lists the prices for all the different regional eShops (helpful to me as an Aussie) really useful when buying new games digitally.

&gt;#1. What made you start r/NintendoSwitchDeals?

&gt;&gt;**u/Coraldragon** [Klope62 and I] were originally in r/3DSDeals and when the Nintendo Switch was announced we decided to make a deals subreddit for it as well.

&gt;#2. Are there any deals in particular that you yourself have used?

&gt;&gt;**u/Coraldragon** Majority of my deals were any sales at Best Buy because I had the GCU which gave a 20% discount to any Best Buy deal. Unfortunately they are discontinuing that, but it was the best way to get Nintendo deals since Nintendo tends to not have good deals.

&gt;#3. Why should someone visit r/NintendoSwitchDeals?

&gt;&gt;**u/Coraldragon** We encourage anyone looking for any console, game, or accessory deals for the Nintendo Switch to visit. Deals tend to be more seasonal, but occasionally an amazing deal may pop up. For example, recently there was a Facebook marketplace deal that let you buy the Switch console for $180. This was the hottest deal in our history and made things quite exciting before Christmas.

&gt;#4. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**u/Klope62** Apart from what Coraldragon has stated, I'd just like to say that our sub is very atraditional in the sense that really that only thing that brought us together was the fact that we were just people who liked deals and Nintendo... The growth was extremely unexpected, and every day is a process of learning how to foster an exceptional community of which there are no clear guidelines to follow... I am personally super thankful for all of the work all the team of moderators and other individuals in the community have done to allow us to grow into what we are today, as well as an extended thanks to the community itself for being patient as we ween through our growing pains and continue to work to be the best place for Nintendo Switch Deals on the internet!

Well there you have it folks. If you own a Nintendo Switch **and** you like saving money too, r/NintendoSwitchDeals is certainly the place for you.

afjjhu,2,2019-01-13,What can I do to improve my chances of interning at a Big 4?,jamarhurtt,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/afjjhu/what_can_i_do_to_improve_my_chances_of_interning/,"I am in a unique situation, and would like as many suggestions as possible. So, I am currently a high school senior, who is in dual enrollment (Not at a community college, but college courses in my high school &amp; will reach 62 credits upon graduation); therefore I was accepted to college as a transfer student, most likely with junior standing for Fall 2019. The school I will attend has the only Honors Accounting program in Maryland &amp; most of its grads go to work for the top accounting firms in Baltimore...that's what their website says. Additionally, this school is mostly for working adults; therefore, there it is likely that I will be able to manage a part-time, or even full-time job while still working hard in school (Online &amp; Night Classes). I am wondering, is it smart for me to volunteer for a local companies' accounting firm? I have 2-3 companies and non-profit organizations that I can volunteer for, for my final 2 years of college. I also was wondering what job should I obtain during this summer &amp; college that would be beneficial for achieving an accounting internship. Throughout my 2 college years, I would like to volunteer, internship, work-study, and have a part-time job all in accounting. Will these 4 help me reach a job around graduation? "
afk3wr,41,2019-01-13,Provisionally passed 1/12/2019,Robchi,cissp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/afk3wr/provisionally_passed_1122019/,"I am still in shock. 

(Sounds cliche, but was true. I thought I was failing the entire time. I couldn't look at the results until I was sitting in my car. Keep your head in the game. Stay present. This might be the best advice I can give.)

So here’s my story. I’ve been IT since 2009. Started as a IT support intern. Graduated with CIS Bachelors degree in 2010 with a minor in Information Security. I worked in Data Centers for a few years, then landed a job as a SysAdmin at a good organization. There, I was promoted to IT Manager and then a few years later promoted again to IT Director. That is my current position.

I started to get really interested in the security side of things around 2016. I got the SEC + and CySA+ certs end of 2017. And then I heard about the CISSP.

Around August of 2018, I signed up for a test date in November but after reading a lot online, I decided I didn’t have enough spare time with work and family and other commitments to really put enough effort in, so I picked a date in January and paid the $50 to reschedule. 
Began casually studying about an hour a day back in September/October. In November, I ramped up a little more here and there. Then I went full throttle in December. I had printouts all over my walls in my home office. My wife said it looked like I was hunting down a serial killer. 

Over the winter break I was able to take 2 weeks off of work. I spent the entire time studying.  Anywhere from 8 - 16 hours a day. 

There’s so much to say, about the study process, but I don’t even know where to begin, so I just thought I’d share the resources that I used. Note, I’ve read many of the other ‘provisionally passed’ posts so there so likely a lot of overlap here. BUT reading those posts kept me inspired and helped through the hard times.

Books (I have physical books, but I ended up getting kindle versions of most of them because it is so much easier to search
     * Sybex Official Study Guide (Seems to be most accurate)
     * CISSP All in one - 7th edition 
     * CISSP Official practice tests (I only did ~100 or so of these)
     * CISSP for Dummies
     * CISSP Cert Guide 3rd edition
     * CISSP CBK (I didn’t care for this, but it has the most details)

Videos
      * IT Pro TV, watched all CISSP course videos (We have a subscription at work)
      * Kelly Handerhan - Cybrary, watched all, if not most (The day of the test I watched this one about 3 times in a row 
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-99b1YUFx0A)
      * YouTube - random rabbit holes
      * Larry Greenblatt - I bought his most recent videos (He has older versions on youtube but I wanted to make sure the material was 
       relevant. Plus after watching his free stuff, I wanted to give back. As I found his material interesting, funny and it kept me awake! Also, 
       he offers a 1-1 review on his practice test. I bit the bullet and bought it. It was well worth the investment. We sat in a zoom session and 
       went through his entire practice test in detail. 

Platforms
      * StudyNotesAndTheory.com - Luke Ahmed has a great site going. A lot of good material and his videos are spot on. I paid for a month of 
     access, I might extend to 2 months just to continue learning

 Test Platforms - (I took ~3000 practice questions. I highly recommend this. It’s something that Luke mentions, and I wish I would have caught it sooner!) These are the ones I used ranked starting with best. 
     * Sybex
     * Boson 
     * Larry’s Practice Exam
     * StudyNotesandtheory.com
     * McGraw HIll
     * Kaplan
     * Udemy 

To wrap up, in early December my mindset changed. I decided that I would use any tool that would help me learn this material. So, I didn’t say no to things that cost me money, I considered them all to be investments. I bought the extra book. I paid for access to the sights. I hired the tutor. I also decided I was going to take care of myself along the way. So, I exercised every day. No matter what. I got at least 7 hours of sleep. And I tried to have balance in my life. That meant that every once in a while I had to go out to dinner or treat myself to some type of reward. I could not have done this without the support of my wife, my friends and my family. 
This was a sacrifice. I had to clear my schedule.  And I had to be disciplined.

Lastly, my biggest take away was from Larry, “We are the Jedi Knights”. One of his lectures struck a nerve with me and made me realize this isn’t just a certificate. The is a way of life and a huge responsibility. I decided that even if I failed the test, that I was still a CISSP. That I was going to think, act and live like a CISSP. That I would continue learning and continue taking the test until I passed. I decided that I would commit to this group, this practice for the rest of my life. Okay, is that a little too hokey or sentimental? Give me a break, I’m still riding this dopamine from passing!

You are the manager. Make decisions around the interests of the organization. What will solve problem holistically? 
People are most important.

Welcome to Week 15 of my Catching up with the Manga Discussion Series, a chance for us anime-onlies to get to talk about the chapters following Season 3. Up-to-date readers are also welcome, just please don't spoil anything that happens beyond the chapters discussed. Today’s chapters are 198-201. 

&amp;#x200B;

My commentary:

&amp;#x200B;

**Ch. 198**  
Oh Kaminari, you are so full of your derpy self, and yet I somehow can’t be irritated with you. XD The only reason he was useful in the first place was because he accidentally attached his disc to Shishida. At least the plan he came up with was pretty good though, gotta give him that.

Jirou cracking up over Kaminari’s stupid mode is such a mood.

And I agree with All Might, Midnight’s got some issues....0.o

[WHEY](https://imgur.com/tMNg7Xo) XDXDXD

Monoma is a turd, but I can’t help but love [his flair](https://imgur.com/9hUXrLk). He’s acting a bit more like how he did during the sports festival and a *little* less insane.  *Shameless plug time!* r/CultofMonoma *is now accepting new members! XD*

[Tokoyami’s teeth](https://imgur.com/sgY5KcB) still weird me out a bit. XD Sidenote: Momo is so pretty, as usual.

I like how cordial Kendo is about telling Momo she wants to fight her and how equally cordial Momo is in return. They definitely are best girls.

Koroiro’s quirk seems like a formidable opponent for Tokoyami. I bet he can possess Dark Shadow.

As for my prediction for this team-up: I really want to say that Team 2-A will win because I love all four of them. However, I have a sense that Team 2-B will pull ahead for this round. I feel like they are well-matched against each other. And I feel Komori’s quirk is gonna be stronger than she seems.

I do love the [big sister of Class B](https://imgur.com/2QII4Yr) and am rooting for her, but I'm still rooting for Momo too since she's my best girl. 

Yep, I was right about Kuroiro being able to hitch a ride on Dark Shadow! Kinda seemed obvious to me, but oh well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ch. 199**

Ooh, hello, I wasn’t expecting to see Hawks! XD Can’t say I’m exactly mad the battle has been interrupted, but seeing Tokoyami’s internship makes me feel like he will do something cool in this battle. Still not feeling like Team 2-A will win though. 

What an [adorable flight of windy darkness](https://imgur.com/53erWhk). X3

Oof, taking out the arguably weakest link first. Poor Aoyama.

So Dark Shadow gets to be [all cuddled up](https://imgur.com/6CXK7TM) and helps Tokoyami fly at the same time?? That is amazing. XD

Ooh, at least Aoyama got rescued.

And as I was predicting, Komori’s quirk has potential for strength. Pretty certain their team is gonna win now.  


**Ch. 200** (Can’t believe I’m here already! [\\o/](https://imgur.com/nAd41ts))

The more Momo is covered in the mushrooms, the less surface area she has for creating stuff...smart.

I really like Komori’s design too, she’s got a cute style.

Woah, Manga’s quirk is actually way better than I thought it was. 

Hm, separating Momo is a good idea, but it also allows her to put all her focus on herself rather than her teammates. Could go bad for either side. Yet that pretty much leaves Tokoyami to do all the heavy-lifting...

Okay, reading Shoto talking about Momo’s strengths that he watched her cultivate in their exam is giving my shipping heart the warm fuzzies. XD And to top it off, Tetsutetsu talking up and rooting for Kendo is also making me happy. :3

Now I’m definitely feeling like Team 2-A will win.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ch. 201**

Yay, I was hoping she’d make another cannon! XD

Oooh, a lucky bag! Sounds fun!

I love Komori [even more now](https://imgur.com/c6IPNBz). XD 

So proud of Momo’s quick thinking, even if she still views herself as a novice. Her help could very well turn the tide of the battle, if Team 2-B doesn’t already have another card up their sleeve.

Ah, looks like that card is more spores!

Awww, poor Momo! She really did fight hard. :(

And Shoto being all concerned about her! T.T Proud of him for actually taking time to consider the emotions of a classmate.

Well, at least my prediction was right this time! Komori proved to be as formidable as I imagined, and Manga was actually much more useful than even I had anticipated. Team 2-A’s weakness was honestly Aoyama and Hagakure. They just don’t have very good fighting power, especially once they are in a tight-quarters pinch. Even though I loved T2-A, I am happy for Team 2-B because they were great.  


Next week’s commentary is on Chapter 202-206. I cannot believe I am so close to being caught up! Just a couple more weeks!"

I’m a 20 year old third year college student attending UTC. I’m currently a computer engineering major and live in Chatt. 

I’m trying to look into internships I can apply for. I know of TVA, EPB, and BlueCross BlueShield, but I’m looking for a few more that are tech related that I may not know about. 

To be honest, I don’t have many side projects in terms of computer science, so any type of internship that may take me or suggestions you all have helps!

Thanks in advance "
afpc9q,72,2019-01-13,Spending the night with my co-worker,daddysintern,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/afpc9q/spending_the_night_with_my_coworker/,"This one turned out to be kind of long. This happened on Friday night.

The daddy in the office where I have just begun my internship (the man from my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/aa7puf/my\_first\_experience\_with\_a\_daddy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/aa7puf/my_first_experience_with_a_daddy/)) approached me on Friday and asked if I could stay behind for a while after work to help him with a presentation. He told me to meet him in his office at the end of the workday.

When almost everyone else at work had left for the day, I made my way over to his office. I knocked lightly on his door, and he answered ""Come in!"" He told me to sit in the chair in front of his desk, as he sat behind the desk. He briefly asked me some questions about the job, and then he asked me:

""You really enjoyed yourself last time we met, didn't you?""

""Yes, sir.""

At this point he had moved his hand to his bulge and had started touching himself gently over his suit pants.

""You really enjoyed having daddy's cock inside you, huh?""

""Yes, I did.""

""Then get over here and get on your knees""

I kneeled down in front of him so that I was almost under his desk, while he was still seated in his office chair. I unzipped the fly of his pants and pulled out his cock. I noticed that he now had a black cockring behind his balls and around the end of his shaft, which he did not have before. I started stroking his cock and touching the head.

""We value employees that give their all. Will you give your all?""

""Yes, daddy, I will""

He put his hand behind the back of my head and pushed my head towards him so that my throat could take all of it in. It was somewhat of a challenge since he is somewhere between 7 and 8 inches but just like last time I was able to manage it as my lips almost met his cockring. ""Good boy"" he moaned as he was stroking my hair. I looked up into his eyes as I was working my tongue around his shaft and with my hand as well.

I eventually paused to catch my breath and he told me to sit down in his chair. He now stood next to me as I once again had his cock in my mouth that how had started dripping with precum. His left hand was on the back of my head but his right hand was touching my hard cock over my pants. He unzipped my pants and brought my cock out and started jerking it off quickly. We kept going in this position (me sucking him off and he jerking me off) for quite some time.

""Do you want daddy's cum?!""

""Yes, give it to me! I want it!""

He had pulled his cock out of my mouth and was now stroking it over my face. He let out a quick moan before I felt his warm cum cover my face. Almost simultaneously, I felt how my hand became covered in cum as my cock pumped out more cum for every throb. We both quickly got ourselves cleaned and dressed quickly.

The office had become completely empty by this time. He offered to drive me home. We didn't speak much on the way home but I couldn't help myself starting to feel horny again. I put my hand on his knee as he was driving. He looked at me and smiled.

""You know, we never really looked at the presentation. Wanna come to my place, so we can maybe work on it?"" He said jokingly.

Even though it was a Friday night, I agreed to it, knowing that we won't work on that presentation at all. We both smiled to each other.

When we got to his apartment, where I had had my first encounter with him, I asked if I could take a shower real quick (as I wanted to be clean for him). He handed me a towel and I went into the bathroom, closing the door but without locking it. I quickly got undressed and jumped into the shower where I swiftly got myself cleaned as good as I possibly could. Just as I was finished showering, the door opened.

He walked in, completely naked, and jumped into the shower with me. He started kissing me while I ran my hands over his hairy chest. At the same time I felt how he moved his hands down my back until they reached my ass. He eventually stopped kissing me and told me to turn around. I obliged and turned around so that my ass was facing him. He kneeled down and put his hands on my butt cheeks. It was not until now that I understood that he was going to give me a rimjob. As I had never gotten a rimjob before, I was intrigued by how it might feel and it felt so good! At first I did not feel much but the longer he kept working his warm tongue around my hole, the better it felt. I was so focused on not cumming that I barely noticed that I had started moaning silently.

”You like that, don’t you? You like daddy’s tongue in your tight twink hole?”

”Mhhmm” was all I could get out.

Fortunately he stopped soon after as I felt that I was about to cum. He stepped out of the shower and handed me my towel. We both got ourselves dry quickly while I was trying to think about something else in order to calm down the rock hard boner I had. We made our way to his bedroom. On the bed sheet lay a pair of leather wrist restraints. I was once again intrigued and I obliged when he told me to put both of my hands behind my back. He put on the restraints on my wrists and tightened them so I could barely move my arms. The feeling of being helpless got me so turned on that some precum started dripping from my cock. He sat down on the bedside and I kneeled before him on the floor when he grabbed my head and guided my mouth to his cock. I started licking his shaft and kissing the head with my tongue while I felt him moving his hands over the back of my head, stroking my hair. He eventually started thrusting his body so that his cock kept entering my throat. He kept fucking my mouth with his thick cock and with my hands restrained behind my back, until he eventually pushed his cock all the way down my throat and held it there for a while until I started gagging and he let go. A string of precum was hanging from my lips down over my chin, which he swiftly licked up before kissing me.

He then helped me up on the bed and positioned me so that I was facing the bed frame. I bent over and arched my back so that he could fuck me from behind. He brought some lube he had in his drawer in his nightstand and started massaging it around my hole. He then said that he couldn't find any condoms. Even though I knew that I had some condoms in my bag, I was so caught up in the moment that I told him:

""I want you to do me raw. I want you to cum inside me!""

He smiled and said: ""That's more like it!""

He gave his cock a couple of strokes with the lube before he got up on the bed behind me. This time he did not waste any time with teasing me, instead he quickly pushed his cock through my tight hole. I let out a loud groan out of both pain and pleasure. This only turned him on even more as he started thrusting his cock into my expanding hole harder than before. After a while the pain disappeared and I got this almost euphoric feeling as the tip of his cock kept hitting the spot. After fucking me from behind for what felt like forever, he eventually pulled out and we changed positions.

I laid down with my stomach on the bed so that I felt my hard cock being pushed up against my stomach. He grabbed the back of my thighs to position himself behind me before he once again started using my hole with his cock. He put his hand on the back of my head and pushed it down so that my face met the bed sheets. My moans became somewhat muffled as I bit my teeth into the bed sheet. At this point I knew that I would no longer be able to last much longer. I felt the strongest orgasm I ever have felt at the same time as I felt my stomach and the bed sheet becoming wet with my warm cum. I moaned with my face still being pressed against the bed. He kept fucking my hole as if there was no tomorrow since he did not know that I had already released my load on the bed, but I did not want him to stop.

We switched positions a couple of times. He never seemed to notice that I already came because he kept using my hole for his pleasure as my hands were still restrained behind my back. I had completely forgotten about what time it was, but it felt like it had been several hours ago since I was at work and I had no idea for how long we had been going on by now.

I was now laying with my back on the bed while he was stroking my cock and fucking me at the same time. I felt like I was going to cum one more time and after a while of him stroking me I let out a load over my stomach and on his hand, completely draining my cock of cum. He started breathing more heavily as he continuously thrusted his cock into my sore hole and I realised that he was getting close now.

”You want my cum?! Don’t you? You cum dump!”

”Yes! Cum inside me, fill me up!” I answered him.

Just a split-second later he let out a loud moan as he pushed his cock in as much as he could so that his cockring met my ass. I felt my insides being filled with more and more warm cum for every throb. His load was so big that it felt like his cock would never stop releasing cum inside me. He eventually pulled out and it wasn’t until then that I felt how big his load actually was. A thick stream of cum leaked out of my hole and onto the bed sheet. He moved himself up towards my face and put his cum-leaking cock in my mouth. As I was cleaning it with my tongue he said: 

”Good job!"" he said amusingly. ""Remember to not tell anyone about this, ok?”

”Of course I won’t” I answered, as I had already taken that for granted.

”Good” he said and smiled before he left the room, probably to go clean himself.

It must have been in the middle of the night by now and I was so exhausted that I fell asleep on his bed with my hands still restrained behind my back and with cum seeping out from my sore hole. When I woke up several hours later, he was asleep, completely naked, next to me on the bed and it seemed like the whole bedroom was reeking of cum. I noticed that he had taken the wrist restraints off me and I could now move my hands freely. I got up from the bed and I felt how sore my hole was as I walked out of the bedroom. I checked my phone and saw that it was 7AM in the morning and that I had some missed calls and texts. I rapidly got dressed in the same work clothes that I had worn the day before and left. On my way home I texted him and thanked him for the night and that I look forward to seeing him on Monday morning ;)

I know for sure that I will not forget about this night for a long time! (Btw, we are both on PrEP so no need to worry)"
afpodu,22,2019-01-13,Let's talk: developing a solid foundation for appreciating contemporary music and strategies for finding new things,_I_Have_No_Mouth_,LetsTalkMusic,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/afpodu/lets_talk_developing_a_solid_foundation_for/,"Partially related to the bingeing music topic from earlier. 

So, this time last year I knew practically no music minus what was popular on tumblr when I was in high school. That pretty much amounted to listening to Marina and the Diamonds and Panic type bands on repeat for years and years. In college I met people who were much more interested in music than myself, and they seemed to know and have an opinion on lots of stuff. Before meeting them, I didn't really consider music as something one could have a hobby in finding. After meeting them, I was very interested in trying to be more into music.

Over the summer during my internship, I was pretty much isolated several states away from everyone I had ever known. One of the things I decided to do was get more into music. The way I did this was I committed to listening to practically every new album that /r/hiphopheads upvoted to the front of their sub as I already liked some hip hop and it's the music of the moment. This was pretty effective in introducing me to new music, but I was still missing out on lots of older stuff and artists that were constantly talked about. This leads me to the next issue. 

Of course, /r/hiphopheads and /mu/ and other music sites have big, official guides of music and albums that one ""needs to listen to"". However, even when these lists have hundreds of entries one inevitably will run into certain artists that are talked about very frequently and weren't included on the list for whatever reason. Additionally, sites like /mu/ tend to recommend music that is more niche and might not be as easy to discuss with others. Also, since those lists usually just contain high lights they have maybe one album per musician, whereas I personally like listening to whole discographies. 

So that brings me to my question. 

- What's your strategy for finding new things and gaining musical literacy?

-  Have you found any lists or sites that have good starting places? If so, please share.

- Obviously one can go through music too fast and not really appreciate what it has to offer. How do you know when you've gotten everything you can out of an album and truly appreciate what it has to offer? "
afpsby,12,2019-01-13,Looking for a second CC,packfan711,CreditCards,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/afpsby/looking_for_a_second_cc/,"Hi everyone,

I am currently looking to get a second credit card after having my Discover IT card since May of 2017. My current FICO score is 727, my utilization was a bit higher in the past year (roughly 64%) as I took a well-paying internship but had some expenses associated with it that I put on the card until my reimbursement came through. I am up to a $3k limit after starting around $1.2k and the card will have no balance after this month.

I will be finishing graduate school in and will be anticipating a move, around then I would like to get one of the bigger cards if I can, with bonuses for spending a few thousand in the first few months, but for now my expenses are relatively low. For now, I am looking to get a second card to use before then to help improve my application for further cards and would like some suggestions. I would potentially like to start the Chase trifecta once I begin working so I want to get a second card to help those applications. Currently I was thinking about the BoA Travel Rewards Card or the Barclays Uber card. Most of my expenses are groceries, eating out, some electronic purchases, and going out so that was why I was considering the Uber card. I would appreciate any recommendations, especially if you have any other tips for helping me build up myself for some of the higher tier cards down the line. Thank you in advance for all the help. "
afq0rw,2,2019-01-13,Internship worries?,Tree_Shirt,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/afq0rw/internship_worries/,"Hey guys, was hoping to get some advice...

So just starting a b4 tax internship and I just finished up their week long training. The instructors would say things like, “Even if you’ve never taken a tax class, you’ll be fine.” However, they then proceeded to get into pretty hairy, technical stuff and seemed like they expected us to already have memorized a good amount of the code. Also, going over firm software was a little intimidating... I was taking notes as best as I could but I still missed a lot and certainly don’t have it memorized. I’ve taken one tax class, but honestly the prof made it pretty easy which is kind of worrying to me. 

The instructors kept emphasizing it wasn’t the technical skills that will get us the offer, but having a positive attitude and a solid work ethic. 

I don’t know, I’m pretty stressed out right now. Is this normal? A lot of other kids there had taken 2 or 3 tax classes in MAcc programs and were way better at it than I was. Anyone experience anything like this?

afq47y,2,2019-01-13,21 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,TransformationRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransformationRP/comments/afq47y/21_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

5. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

6. When you message me, please write more than ""hi"" or ""saw your post"". Tell me which post you are coming from and any ideas you have. You do not need to write me a book, just give me more than two words. Poor introductions will be ignored.

7. I am looking for my character to be tfed, NOT tfing other characters. If that is a deal breaker, you have been warned.

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM!

Thank you for reading, and hope to hear from you soon!"

I need some reassurance,fntastk,emetophobia,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/afq7ve/so_scared_to_go_to_work_tomorrow_i_need_some/,"(I'm not censoring words... just a heads up because I see it here quite often. I hope this is okay!) 

My internship is in a nursing home and I share an office with staff who have been sick in the last two days or more. Some residents are getting the sickness too and the nurses are warning us to wash our hands often. Common areas are being wiped down with a bleach solution but it's not enough to make me stop panicking. I ordered hydrogen peroxide wipes for my own peace of mind. 

My supervisor told me that during some outbreaks, residents will vomit in the dining room. I am in skilled nursing so 90% of residents are wheelchair bound so it's not like they can go to a bathroom if they feel ill. They're like 95 years and older. We aren't in isolation yet but I fear when we are - I will have to suit up in PPE and visit sick residents. Ugh... most of my fear is seeing/hearing people get sick.

I'm feeling very anxious about tomorrow. Since this is just an internship I can't really afford to miss many days and I don't want to get sick either. I always end up with stomach viruses but I'm really trying to be diligent this time. It's exhausting :/ 

Anyone ever survive an outbreak in their workplace? I need reassurance and some helpful advice to just calm down "
afqigr,8,2019-01-13,Slasherverse: Crystal Lake Chronicles Vol.2 PART 1!,Maniax80,slasherfilms,https://www.reddit.com/r/slasherfilms/comments/afqigr/slasherverse_crystal_lake_chronicles_vol2_part_1/," Hello my fellow gore fiends, I'm back with some rather good gore for you all. Now as you all know, I've been working on the plot for Vol.2 of Crystal Lake Chronicles for about a few weeks now. I still am but I'm at the half way mark right now having reached Issue #4 of which I am currently working on. A seven issue deal, here is the first three issues of the plot for Crystal Lake Chronicles Vol.2!  


**Issue #1**   
The story picks up right where Vol.1 left off, during a blizzard where we see a red pickup racing down the road through the blinding white. The man behind the wheel is blackout drunk, red eyed, struggling to keep the wheel straight, and drunkenly singing Alice Cooper’s Teenage Frankenstein as he drums his fingers on the wheel. As this is going on we see a pair of very familiar shoes running through the forest in the snow. His lights on, the drunk driver takes another s a swig of beer as he tosses the empty can with the dozens of others on the floor of the truck. Casting the beer down, the two separate panels established for the drunk driver and the unknown individual come together as the man looks up to the road then as a woman comes running across the road. The drunk driver’s eyes bulge out of his head at this then, almost instantaneously straightening up as he grips the wheel and swerves to avoid the mysterious woman with him shouting “JESUS CHRIST!”. However, the driver’s attempt to avoid hitting the woman is too late as the tail end of the truck nails her and sends her like a skipping stone across the road, taking a whole page to display the car striking her.

Screeching to a stop, narrowly ending up in a ditch, the now VERY sober man rushes to the battered lying before him on the ground. Illuminated by the truck’s headlight, around the edge of it while still in the dark, the man kneels next to the woman with tears in his eyes as he looks her over. In next panel, a sort of low-aerial view of the scene, the woman question though is revealed to be none other than Hannah Fiaklov, the killer from Vol.1 and quite worse for the wear. Splayed across the road, the right side of her face is road rashed with it covered in a mix of snow, gravel, blood, and shredded skin, her right leg is bent in a way that it definitely should not be bent with blood soaking through the pant leg covering it, and a massive gash across her stomach which has soaked her black shirt. Looking her over, while although scratched up and likely having a few broken bones, the drunken man notices the giant gash across her shirt and stomach coated in her blood. Horrified by what has happened, the man looks over her as he covers his mouth in shock, the drunk driver notices the massive gash on her stomach as his hand leaves his mouth.

Turning to face Hannah, still on the ground breathing heavily with blood filling her mouth, the driver asks “Jesus lady, who did this do you?”. Painfully turning her head to him with terror in her eyes, with her final breath, she shakily says “J-Ja-Ja-Jason. Jason Voorhees”. The horrified man watches then as dying Hannah as releases that last steamy breath as the man stands up and looks off into the woods then, his eyes now filled with fright. In the final panel of this page, from the shadows, zooming in on it in 2 panels; an outline of the killer looks out across from the woods from behind the man as the final panel goes to black. With the narration at the bottom of the last panel reading ‘I’m sorry’, we an exterior shot of a TV station with the name Channel 93 branded on the side of the building with a caption reading “March 8th, Baltimore, Maryland” a few months after the ‘Fiaklov Murders’.

In a rather basic office, we see then TV reporter Robert Campbell being laid off by his boss. Robert has a sort of broken look on his face then as he more or less demands to why his boss, Mr. Marcus, is laying off. Giving a sigh, Marcus sits up from his desk and puts his hands on the desk and explains that Channel 93 is being bought out by the bigger news networks. Robert calls bulls@#$ though on this though, pointing out that even though their being bought by a bigger news network it doesn’t mean that Marcus needs to lay him off. Marcus sighs then and tells him the truth, telling him that he’d hoped that this could’ve gone better for Robert as he explains that he’s letting Robert go because he just isn’t as popular as he was before with Robert’s rating being at an all time low for the past five years. Robert is shown to visibly surprised, as well as hurt, by this as Marcus explains that he’s sorry that Robert has to go but figures it is better to do it now before the bigger news companies make him do it. Not saying another word, swinging the door open, Robert walks out of the office as two workers sitting next to water cooler. One of the workers, a scrawny blond, looks to the fatter one and asks “What his problem?” with the fatter worker responding “Looks like he just got laid off.”.

Cutting to the next page, then we see Robert sitting in a bar then, his suit and hair disheveled, as he asks taps his glass on the counter as he asks the bar tender for another. Looking at him, cleaning glasses, the bartender takes the glass away and says “No offense Rob but I think you’ve had enough for the night.” as he goes to serve a set of new customer who just walked in. Looking onto one of the TVs on the news then, Robert watches as a female newscaster gives us a recap of Vol.1 as well as revealing that two hunters had also been killed not that far from Hannah’s murders. Revealing something even stranger, the woman states that Hannah’s final words were Jason Voorhees and states that more will be revealed on the subject tonight. Giving a bitter laugh, Robert scoffs at the story saying that they might as well just say that Jason did it. Pausing for a moment, gears turning in Robert’s head, he states then “That it!” as he throws on his jacket and rushes out the door.

Back at Channel 93, later that night, we see Marcus at his desk as Robert bursts in. Surprised by Robert’s sudden appearance, Marcus demands to know why Robert is here as he points out that he doesn’t work here anymore. Robert acknowledges this but asks Marcus to give him a chance and to hear him out as he just thought of something that may just be “Ratings gold.”. Intrigued, Marcus leans back in his chair and says that Robert’s got five minutes. Moving fast, Robert reminds Marcus of how the Fiaklov case is currently big in media right now of which Marcus acknowledges and asks then if that’s what this is about, Robert wanting to do a report on murders? Robert says no as he states that “They’re already beating that story to death, it’ll be yesterday’s news by next week.” and states that he wants to do a documentary. Curious, Marcus asks what Robert wants to do it on then as Robert puts his hands on Marcus’s desk and says “Jason Voorhees.”.

**Issue #2:**   
Continuing off last issue, we open up with some panels displaying a small town and some nature settings as well in the mix. Basically setting up a sort of serene sort of vibe as the next panel now displays a green, wooden town sign that reads in white ‘Welcome to Forest Green County’. A cleaned up Robert Campbell stands now in front of a camera no doubt as he begins his intro speech.   
“Forest Green County, a small peaceful town in western New Jersey, the kind of place you’d see in a postcard or in the movies. But thirty years ago this town went by another name, Cunningham Township, and thirty years ago a series of horrible murders had plagued this quiet, little town before seemingly coming to a close on November 13th, 1984. Now, over thirty years later, terror and murder has struck this once innocent town with the murders perpetrated by Hannah Fiaklov who is believed to have murdered several people in what is now being dubbed ‘The Morgan Family Cabin Massacre’. However with the death of the murderer, Hannah Fiaklov, on Karloff Road on December 13th, her final words left one massive question. A question my team and I hope to answer to what her final words meant. A name, one bone chilling name. Jason Voorhees.”

We fade to black then. We appear then after the scene cut, with Robert asking them if they got it as we expand out to see Larry, the camera man, and boom mike operator Craig. In a van, reading Channel 93, it slides open as Riley steps out from a set of TVs displaying Robert in them with Karen Chui in the process of editing. The girl, like the others in the captions, is read to be ‘the intern’. Robert asks how he did, seeming a bit tense after the performance, as Riley states that he did great but points out that Craig was holding the mike a little too low but points out they can edit it out in post-production. Giving a smile then as he watches himself on the screen, Robert asks Riley if she set up the interviews as she says she was able to book most of them. Robert heads into the truck then as Riley points out that maybe Robert should just wear the white t-shirt underneath the suit for the interviews.

Robert is momentarily confused, asking why and is answered with Larry pointing out it makes him look like he’s selling car insurance. Robert agrees, stating it is best to keep his look simple for the interviews, sliding off the suit jacket and button up before slipping into driver’s seat from the back. At the wheel now, he tells Larry to get up in the front with him as he states that he’ll need him to start filming. Larry, before getting up front, then as he states that he’s never seen Robert this tense or full of energy as Karen points out that this is his last shot and that Robert called in a lot of favors for this. We then get multiple panels with Robert interviewing multiple people on the subject of Jason Voorhees, the panels are listed below in the INTERVIEW PANELS section. Showing Robert driving through town then in the next panel, we get some narration from him pointing out that the mass assumption amongst the townspeople was that Jason may still be alive.  Narration by Robert is given then on the subject, standing outside the Forest Green County Hospital.

“But what does this have to do with Hannah Fiaklov and how exactly does this connect to this killer from over 30 years ago connect to these modern murders. We went here to Forest Green County Hospital to find out.”

The panel cuts then to Robert as he sits down in the doctor’s office with Doctor Tabitha Daniels sitting on at her desk as Robert asks her about Hannah Fiaklov.

“In all honesty, Hannah was always a fragile girl. I was a close confident of the Fiaklov family long before the murders. I was also the one, who-um…Who Hannah came after, after she had lost it.”-Dr. Daniels

“ It?”-Robert

“The-the child. God (Shakes her head), I still remember the look in her eyes when I told her that.”-Dr. Daniels

“What exactly was this ‘look’?”- Robert

“… Emptiness, complete and utter cold. Like her whole entire world had been just…shattered. Believe me when I tell you this, Hannah Fiaklov had a very rough life with her mother having died in 2010 and her father largely being absent not long afterwards\[1\].  I guess all of that with the added of a child just pushed Hannah to her breaking point, I just never imagined that she would do any of that and I take some solace in the knowledge that she didn’t, not all of them at least.”-Dr. Daniels

“(Confused) I don’t understand, what do you mean by not all of them?”- Robert, adjust himself in his seat

“Well, as you know I was there to examine the bodies and the bodies of some of the victims after the massacre.”- Dr. Daniels

“Of course, along with Dr. Philip Richards.”-Robert

“Yes, anyways while doing the autopsies of the victims, it was obvious Hannah only responsible for three of the murders she was attributed to.”- Dr. Daniels.

“How so?”- Robert

“Well with Corey Shepherd, Kevin Hayes, and Deborah Morgan, they were all killed with a small-medium sized serrated blade.”-Dr. Daniels

“The hunting knife found on her body.”-Robert

“(Somberly nods) Exactly and there were multiple indications that these kills were ambush tactics, basic waiting for the right time to strike. However the other four victims, the bodies of Victor Lehman, Ari Palmer, and the Gant hunting party were quite visibly different.”- Dr. Daniels.

“What do mean by that exactly?”-Robert

“Their bodies, the wounds inflicted upon them were from a completely different weapon. A larger, longer bladed weapon much like a cutlass or….”- Dr. Daniels

“Or a machete.”- Robert

“Potentially. Now at first we had assumed that Hannah may have transitioned between weapons between the murders but after further examination and the discovery of John and Steven Gant \[2\] that idea was very quickly out the window.”- Dr. Daniels

“So you believe that another killer may have been responsible for this, a partner perhaps?”-Robert

“Oh I don’t believe that there was another killer, I know, all the evidence points towards this. I can’t say the same about them being a partner but I know for a fact that there was definitely another killer. The bodies of Ari Palmer, Victor Lehman, and the Gant’s all indicate that they were killed by someone else entirely.”- Dr. Daniels

“Interesting but, if I may interject, you mentioned that Victor Lehman among the body count for this potential second party, the body of Victor Lehman though was found with a slashed throat from the hunting knife Hannah Fiaklov had used \[3\].”-Robert

“You’ve read the police reports (Gives a faint smile), well what was left out in the report was what happened after. Now I can agree with you that Victor Lehman had his throat slashed by the murder weapon used by Hannah but that’s not what killed him. From his neck wound we found that he had abrasions around the laceration as well as his own blood covering his fingertips. It was likely that Victor Lehman was trying to hold the wound closed as to slow blood loss. He would’ve only lasted less than 20 minutes still from acute blood loss. But again that’s not what killed him, what we found was that Victor Lehman had died from an extreme forced fracture of the cervical vertebrae or to be blunt, his was snapped in a complete 180 degree motion \[4\]. That’s how I know that Hannah couldn’t have killed Palmer, Lehman, or the Gants, Mr. Campbell; these murders were well beyond her physical capabilities. Whoever killed these men was immensely powerful and judging by the sweeping, arc motion of the wounds, the individual was very, very big \[5\]. ”- Dr. Daniels.

“(Hands together, listening intently) Fascinating.  (Unfolds hands)Now, Dr. Daniels, as a resident of Forest Green, I assume you’ve heard of the story of Jason Voorhees.”- Robert

“(Raises her hand) Stop right there, I see where this is going Mr. Campbell and no. I don’t believe that some local boogeyman from thirty years ago did this.”- Dr. Daniels

“But from what you described, these kills seem to match…”-Robert

“But nothing (Calmly, stands up)! If it is anything like that it is probably a copy cat like back ’89.” –Dr Daniels

“What about Miss Fiaklov’s final words though and the fact that the original Crystal Lake Killer was never really caught, doesn’t that hold some merit Mrs. Daniels?” –Robert

“Get out.”-Dr. Daniels

“I-I’m sorry?” –Robert

“Get out of my office. Right. Now. I don’t have time for this nonsense and would very much appreciate if you didn’t waste any more of my time with it.”-Dr. Daniels

The panel then shows Robert and the team leaving the office as Dr. Daniels looks to Robert then.  


“And a word of warning to you, Mr. Campbell. Don’t go around stirring up old memories, especially not right now, people don’t want to remember Jason Voorhees or what he did over 30 years ago. Just leave it be, just leave it all be.”-Dr. Daniels.

Shutting the door, the camera turns onto a confused Robert before cutting out. We cut then to the next page at the shoddy Hodder’s Haven Motel where we enter the room of F7. Inside the room, Riley gets off the phone stating that the producers love it to Robert’s joy although pointing out that they would like him to spice things up a bit. However, Robert is too excited by this with him pointing out “WE’RE BACK!” with him kissing Karen’s head and offering to buy them all dinner from a pizza place he had saw down the street. Leaving from the door, Robert hollers out into the night that “I’M BACK!” as he exits the room. Larry laughs at Robert, cracking open a beer from the mini-bar and tossing Craig a candy bar, stating that he’s nuts while Riley points out that he’s just happy with Karen agreeing as she points out it has been his a large portion of his. Larry chuckles, falling back into the motel bed, stating that all he cares about is the fact that they’re getting paid earning a resounding “HERE! HERE!” from Craig eating a candy bar.

Outside, we see Robert walking down past the other motel rooms with a smile on his face as someone jumps him from behind. From the motel room, chatting away, the others are alerted to the sound of Robert crying for help as they quickly jump up from their respective spots. Outside pinned against the wall by the collar of his shirt, a man (Strongly resembling C.J. Graham) snarls at Robert as he warns him this.

“Now listen here news boy and listen good cause I’m only going to tell you this once. Leave, pack it all up and leave. Don’t go digging through old wounds because if you ain’t careful then what you’re looking for (Closes in on him), might get you.”. As Robert’s crew rushes in, with Karen threatening to call the police as Craig and Larry tackle the man to the ground, the man gets up holding his now bruised arm as he states that “You’re doomed, all of you, you’re all doomed.” . The man runs off then as Riley makes sure a frightened Robert is alright.

**Panels:**  
• \[1\]: Displays a younger Hannah Fiaklov standing over the open grave of what we can assume is her mother’s.  
• \[2\]: Displays two hunters, dressed in orange-camo hunting suits, dead. With one, a heavier set individual, on the ground with a massive stab wound through his chest and the other, a scrawnier individual, hanging from a tree with his entrails dangling from the branch.   
• \[3\]: Flashback to Victor Lehman’s death, displaying his horrified face as the blade cut his neck releasing a torrent of blood.  
• \[4\]: Narrated by Dr. Daniels, we see Victor crawling across the ground as he holds his sliced neck shut. In the next panel then, we see Victor having crawled to a pair of aged, brown boots as he looks in shock. The figure then, in the following two panels, grips the sides of Victor’s head and twists it around 180 degrees.  
• \[5\] We get the last panel displaying the dead Ari, with the massive gash in his skull, with a figure behind him holding the murder weapon. A blood dripping, serrated machete.  
Interview Panels:   
• A random teen, 20’s at a grocery store. “Yeah, my grandpa was one of the doctors who worked at the hospital when they brought him in ’84.When they thought he was dead anyways.”  
• Hooded teenager with oversize headphones. “That’s the guy who kills people in their dreams right?”  
• An older, blond woman at a local library “Of course, he was the reason why we changed the name of the town in first place. No one wanted to be remembered as the town the Crystal Lake Killer was from.”  
• A couple on the streets   
\- “We were kids back then but yeah, parents wouldn’t even let their kids anywhere near the lake after the murders.”- Aged man resembling Shelly.   
\- “Still don’t, they set a bunch of private property signs around the entire woods. Almost no one goes there anymore.”- Aged woman resembling Tina.   
\- “Not unless you have a death wish anyways.”- Aged man resembling Shelly  
• Old man, resembling Steve Dash. “The one thing you media morons always forget with those movies is that they aren’t real and Jason isn’t dead, he’s still out there.”   
**Issue #3:**   
We open up the issue with a flashback to 1977 where we hear the sobs of a woman in a darkened home. Moving through a hallway lined with numerous pictures, we enter a grey room with the curtains drawn in leaving the room in an almost artificial night. In the room, sitting on edge of a bed, we see a woman sobbing over a framed photo. Moving to the side a bit, we see that it is a picture of a young Pamela with an infant Jason as tears splatter down onto the glass and can assume that it is Pamela looking at the picture. Looking down, still shown from behind as we withdraw from Pamela into darkness, we hear Pamela say this.  
“Oh Jason, my special, special boy… \[1\]What will become of you now?”

We then open a day after Robert was assaulted, with Robert now standing in front of a broken down home in the woods with the sun setting behind him in the distance. Currently being filmed, panning out to reveal it being recorded in the van by Riley and Karen observing, we get some narration by Riley.  Narrated by Riley, of whom we focus on, we get some flashbacks to the night before with Riley explaining that they spent narrowly half the night talking to the police with a majority of them not getitng much sleep. Progressing forward, transitioning back to Riley watching the screen, we get a little info on Riley herself.  
“ I’ll admit that it’s not exactly ideal, being the unpaid intern and all, but compared to most of the internships I’ve had, Robert’s not that bad. A bit of an ego but he hasn’t tried to get into my pants like most of my former ‘mentors’ before. To be honest, I really hope that this all turns out well for him.”

Focusing back on Robert, returning to the camera POV, as he continues with the intro.   
“…But every nightmare has a beginning, an origin, and Jason’s all began with a single woman. Behind us here tonight is the childhood home of Jason Voorhees where we will explore the very foundation that forged the Crystal Lake Killer. The very person that brought him into this world, that had given him life. His mother, Pamela Voorhees.”

With the camera following him, illuminating him in the darkening background as night edges on, Robert steps over the collapsed door to the Voorhees House as he enters (Description of the interior of Voorhees House is provided in Descriptions). The camera pans down to the floor of the Voorhees house entry, covered in developing fungus and nuts, as it transitions back to a smiling Robert who walks through the hallways of decayed house as he narrates.  
“Now everyone knows the story of Pamela Voorhees for the most part, the loving mother of Jason who served as the camp cook at Crystal Lake until the death of her son drove her mad and led her to kill several would-be counselors on June 13th of 1979 before meeting her end at the hands of one of her would-be victims, Alice Hardy \[2\]. A rather simple story but many people fail to really scratch the surface of Jason’s mother. Before she was ever the mother of the Crystal Killer or had ever picked up a hunting knife (Leans arm on wall as he looks at a shattered picture displaying a faded Pamela at the center of the cracks), Pamela was a victim. At little over 18 years old on November 26th of 1951, young Pamela was found alone near Atsion Lake covered in blood \[3\], the sole survivor of a brutal massacre of a madman who claimed the lives of four local teens and the claimed sweetheart of the young Voorhees. Elias Miller \[4\]. The worse though was yet to come when Pamela was taken to a hospital where it was found that not only did she have no recollection of the events but was found to be pregnant from an unknown father, though the authorities did have their theories of course \[5\]. Nine months later in what the doctors had described as the most excruciating and horrific thing he had ever seen,Jason Voorhees was born \[6\].”

Walking down the halls then, we get a view of Robert then standing in the doorway to the kitchen (Roof caved in over table covered in growing plants), the camera following him as he looks in. Going to frontal view of Robert, he continues his narration.

“\[7\]Born with a rare bone disorder similar to that of osteopetrosis, the Voorhees family dealt with many hardships as Pamela struggled to pay for Jason’s medical bills. Despite this though Pamela loved her son but unfortunately Pamela’s paychecks from multiple odd end jobs could only support so much. \[8\] Before long, according to county records, the Voorhees family were faced with being evicted and their home repossessed.  In order to save her home and continue to care for her son’s unique condition, Pamela came to find a job working at the newly started Camp Crystal Lake \[9\]where she worked as the camp cook. \[10\] And the rest, as they say, is history  when on August 20th of 1963 a little boy drowned.”

We exit the flashback then as we get a camera view of Robert with a solemn face, his hand lying on the decayed table. From the camera then we transition to Karen and Riley in the van watching the screen. Watching the screen, Karen is noticeably surprised then when the camera feed begins go static as from the window near the table we can see the outline of a figure staring in. Responding with a “What the hell?”, with Riley noticeably confused by this as to what is the matter, Karen phones Larry and tells him that they’re getting some video static. They get into a brief spat about it, hushed of course as Robert continues on

“Larry, hey Larry?”-Karen

“Here, what’s up?” Larry, lifts walkie up as he continues filming.

“We’re getting a bit of static here, could you maybe dial it back?”-Karen, comes out garbled a bit on the walkie.

“Uh, can you say that again?”-Larry, receiving garbled message.

“(Exasperated) We’re getting some static over the video so could you please adjust the f@#$ing dial!”- Karen, rather annoyed.

“Jesus, alright, alright. (Adjusts knobs on the camera as video feed clears up with Karen and Riley, the figure disappearing) Fuck! There, better?”- Larry

“Crystal, thanks.”-Karen

“Yeah whatever.”-Larry grumbles, following Robert.

Riley smiles at Karen, giving a bit of chuckle as she asks if that was really necessary. Karen gives a smile at this as she states “And make this job easy for him? (Chugs a bit of soda) Never.”

Back with Robert, he asks Larry and Craig to follow him as they exit the kitchen as they return to the hallway. From behind as Craig leaves, we see the outline of a man standing outside the window. From this brief perspective, through two eyes holes, we watch as Craig and the others exit the kitchen and return to the halls. Transitioning then back to Robert, walking down the halls, we receive some more narration.

“And what became of Pamela after her son’s death? Well, much like the house before you today, Pamela fell into disrepair (Stops in Pamela’s room). \[11\] The loss of her son, Jason, had driven Pamela into a deep depression, isolating herself off from the world around her. The cruel world that had claimed the life of her son \[12\].”

Robert rests his hand on the end of the bed frame, looking around the room before looking to the camera.

“You can almost feel it here,ladies and gentlemen, that overwhelming grief here. That excruciating pain of having lost a child.This though, was only the very tip of the iceberg. \[13\] In an interview with Pamela’s former psychiatrist Dr. Andrew Jarvis, in the two years Pamela had been under his care, he believed that the death of Jason had more of an impact on Pamela then anyone could have realized.”

The clip then plays with audio.

“Pamela was a damaged individual from what I could understand in are brief time together. What people fail to realize with Pamela is that she herself was a victim and the death of her son, Jason, it opened a fissure of sorts  for the traumatic memories she had repressed for all those years.”-Dr. Andrew Jarvis

While in the van, monitoring the video feed, Riley receives a call to which she appears genuinely surprise her. We then return to Robert as he releases his hand from the bed frame as he walks around the room.

“And in the worst way possible when on June 13th, 1979, \[14\] all that pain and trauma Pamela had kept bottled up finally was unleashed.(Walks over to Pamela’s dresser, holding a picture of Pamela and a young Jason) A rather tragic story of loss but what truly makes this a true horror story was when her son, Jason, returned…”

The camera then cuts to black then as Robert states

“Alright, that’s a wrap! What you guys say we all get out of here?”- Robert

“I say that’s the best idea he’s had all night.”- Larry, hushed to Craig

“Amen to that, this place gives me the creeps.”-Craig, nervously looking around Pamela’s room.

From Pamela’s window then we get a sort of tease then with it being empty (Build a false sense that Jason would be there basically). Transitioning to the front now we watch Robert exit the house to meet Riley there waiting rather excited.

“Robert, got some news.”-Riley

“Good news or bad news?”-Robert

“I-It’s good news, like really good news. You know how you wanted to interview some of the survivors of the original Crystal Killer murders?”- Riley

“Yeah, most are dead though you said or told us to f@#$ off.”-Robert

“Well...Yeah but I just got a call earlier Robert and you better get started early tomorrow Robert cause first thing tomorrow morning, you have an interview with Creighton Duke!”-Riley, sets her hands on his shoulders, ecstatic as Robert looks at her in wide eyed surprise.

The next page openly displays a panel with the words November 26th, 1951 displayed in italic read. A full frontal view, we hear the sound of repeated stabbing as the body of Elias Miller falls to the ground with his mouth filled with blood. Panning up, covered in blood and holding a kitchen knife, we see that the killer is none other than young Pamela who breathes heavily as she looks down on Elias. Unlike with Hannah, who was a remorseless killer, we see Pamela staring down almost in horror as tears fall down her face mixing with the blood as she drops the knife and looks to her hands. A crack then alerts Pamela that’s there’s someone there as we see young Pamela look on with a terrified expression before zooming in on her pupil to reveal the outline of something monstrous.

**Flashbacks:**

To note with these flashbacks, in the later section some of them very well coincide with Robert’s narration or begin with that narration.

\[1\] Panel turns completely to black as Pamela states, “What will become of you now?”

\[2\] We get a flashback to Pamela’s death with a view of the machete going through Pamela’s neck as her head goes flying off.

\[3\] Watch a couple of kids playing a game of tag ball, throwing a ball to tag each other, when the ball rolls towards the woods. Racing towards the ball, the boy bends over to pick up the ball when a pair of bare and muddy feet step right up. Looking up we see a bloodied and disheveled young Pamela looking down on the boy before collapsing to the ground as the boy runs off from her in fright as he calls for his mom.

\[4\] We are in a classic courtroom then as a man, the assumed killer is being sentenced. The judge, a scrawny old man, looks down upon the man stating that he is tried for first degree murder of Steve Mollin, Fred England, Tiffany Dupree, Sharlene Munson,and Elias Miller and is sentenced to life imprisonment. The man’s face instantly goes pale, panicking then, forcing two guards to restrain the man, he screams this.

“No. No (Man stands pleading now)! I didn’t- didn’t do it (The judge orders the guards to restrain him)! (Man thrashes as he’s dragged off) No! Please, you have to believe me, it’s still out there! The thing in the woods! It’s still out there!”

\[5\] Following Robert’s narration then, as  the man is dragged off we watch as Pamela looks on to the man with tears in her eyes as a man, her lawyer we can assume, helps her up as we reveal her perfectly round belly as she guided off.

\[6\] The panel flashback, with that line finished from Robert, to an older version of Cunningham County Hospital as the date reads above: JULY 13TH, 1952. Entering into a emergency room, with a number of hospital staff are rushing through as screams can be heard from within. From inside the room, we can see the pregnant and pain stricken Pamela giving birth. Holding the hand of one of the nurses, whom tells Pamela to push, she gives one final scream as the doctor below’s eyes widen with shock as we hear the sound of a child crying.

\[7\] We watch then as the doctor hands Pamela the swaddled Jason as she looks down onto her son with tears in her eyes and smile on her face as she looks down on the young boy as Robert narrates thus initiating the transition to the next panel.

\[8\] Transitioning from Jason’s birth to 11 years later, with narration by Robert, see in the background a young Jason running around with a toy plane as Pamela looks down a bit worried at a pile of letters when Jason runs to her, tugging on her arm. Turning to her son with a smile, Pamela joins to play with her son as we see then the letters are all bank statements saying ‘Past Due’ or ‘Final Notice’

\[8\] We watch Pamela comes down the driveway, in a rusted ‘42 oldsmobile with groceries in the back, we see her look through the windshield as we see another car in her drive way already. A cherry red, 1949 Dodge Coronet. Stopping in the drive way, momentarily confused, Pamela turns to see a businessman-looking individual hammering in a ‘FOR SALE’ sign on her lawn. Stepping out of the car, in a bit of a speed walk, the conversation goes as listed below.

“Hey (Notices the man nailing down the For Sale sign). Hey (Quickens her walk to him)! Hey (Grabs the man’s shoulder) What are you doing?”- Pamela

“Nailing in a sign.”-Man, takes Pamela’s hand off his shoulder

“I know that but why?”-Pamela

“Bank’s repossessing the place lady.”-Man, hands Pamela a pink Notice as she reads it with a look of panic on her face as the man begins walking away to his car

“What?! No! No, you-you can’t do this!”- Pamela, following after the man as he gets to the car.

“Sorry ma’am but you should’ve thought about that before this. (Shuts the door of the car) If I were you? I’d start looking for somewhere else to live cause you ain’t living here anymore(Drives off).”

Pamela watches then as the man drives off, looking broken as she looks down onto the paper and then to the window as we see young Jason hiding behind the curtains.

\[9\] We see Pamela at a diner, worryingly holding a cup of steaming coffee with both hands, talking with what appears to be a friend across the other side of the counter whom passes her a flyer for Camp Crystal Lake which reads ‘Help Wanted’.

\[10\] Coinciding with Robert’s narration, we see a hairnet wearing Pamela in the camp kitchen, scrubbing a plate with a faint smile. She turns then to see a police officer enter with some of the counselors, her smile fading then as the officer approaches her. Angled at the floor, we watch as the plate falls to the ground, shattering across it.

\[11\] Coinciding with Robert’s narration, we see Pamela in the dark, barely illuminated by the light coming through the shades, in a child’s room putting away the toys in a wooden box that reads ‘Jason’. Setting a hand on the toybox then, we see Pamela looks somberly down on the box.

\[12\] Coinciding with Robert’s narration, we look to see then Pamela dressed in black in a cemetery. The skies grey and pouring rain, tears rolling down Pamela’s face, we watch her set down a bundle of flowers down on her son’s grave.

\[13\] Coinciding with Robert’s narration, in video documentary style, we see Robert sitting in a rustic, cabin style room in a chair facing a bearded man in a red flannel facing him in a similar chair.

\[14\] We see Pamela back in her bed, tearfully staring down at the picture of Jason as her eyes move to the dresser as unintelligible voices begin to fill Pamela’s head as she over and pulls a hunting knife from one of the drawers. Holding it to her face, we see Pamela’s reflection as her tear stained face now holds a look of rage with her eyes narrowed dangerously. Walking off then we look onto Pamela’s dresser and see a flyer for the new Camp Crystal Lake of 1979.

**tl;dr Right now I'm feeling very proud of myself.  After three years of grad school, I am starting my fulltime position this week. I have worked SO HARD to get here. I had to work through so many demons and obstacles.  I can feel my love addiction pulling at me, but I can't let it slow me down. I will be single while I start this new job.  It is an important job. I am now in control of my future. I know that even my having a health condition will not stop me because my will is now ultra determined. I will hobble to work if I have to.**

Also, I see that there aren't really two lists.  There is only one. The path to recovery INCLUDES the path into codependency. How can I get better without learning lessons from the first list?  You see? My path was what it was supposed to be for me to get here.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else want to create your list for path into codependency and path to recovery?  Feel free to share your own list if you want.  If not, that's okay too.

afr2lf,169,2019-01-13,Serial MastOBetta demands grandchildren after I have surgery (Long post),AnushkaTarasov,Justnofil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Justnofil/comments/afr2lf/serial_mastobetta_demands_grandchildren_after_i/,"It's going to be a ride. Hold on tight. This particular tale sparked FIL into pushing for grandchildren from us even more than baby rabid MIL, who at the time had 2 grandsons from BIL1 and a secret baby from BIL2 they didn't know about yet (that's a story for another day) to fawn over. It's not like DH and I are keeping them from experiencing being grandparents. They now have 6 (plus 1 from Baby Mama3's previous marriage) grand kids total.

Backstory: I have always had severe pain which I thought was normal menstrual cramps. Turns out I have endometriosis and PCOS. I used to double fist ibuprofen thinking that it sucks to be female and nothing more. Until it was so bad I couldn't stand up normally, or sit up without holding back tears. I get an emergency appointment and the RN goes to perform the exam and has to stop because I am screaming bloody murder and crying because it feels like she's trying to rip me in half. She immediately puts in a order for an internal and external ultrasound, tells us the tech was available in an hour so we had to wait. Feels like forever but the tech finally is ready and brings us back, double checks that I'm not pregnant all that jazz and does the external first and sees something but not enough. She tells me to prepare for the internal and her eyes go from normal to 'oh shit'. Next thing I know she runs out of the room to get a doctor and DH is nervously smiling because wtf just happened? A doctor and a horde of interns comes into the room and double checks the screen, looks at me and then at DH with this solemn 'bad news' vibe. Turns out I had a cyst so big that it was twisting blood flow off from my left ovary (about the size of a golf ball), and several smaller ones on the right that were showing signs of starting to do the same. Doctor explains that I needed the next available surgery which was tomorrow at 6AM to remove the cysts as well as some technical word for scrapping away the dead/built up tissues. He mentioned possible cancer, but wouldn't know until labs ran tests on the samples after the surgery. Fertility wise, worse case they have to remove left ovary, and a large portion of the right.

DH and I head to his home (it was about 2 blocks from the hospital) to calm me down after my anxiety made my blood pressure spike enough to see spots. Here debuts Serial MastOBetta! SM is a manly man who thinks boys shouldn't cry. He is also harder on DH because he doesn't fight back. Unfortunately, DH leaves me in his room to go tell SM where he'll be tomorrow and explain what's happened. Before DH moved out, SM would always see if DH was available to drive him home from the bar and this would dictate how much he would drink there verse at home. DH didn't have to pay rent, but this was his 'chore' for living with them while attending college.

DH at the time was still clearly upset with a stutter to his voice and red eyes from crying. This is the conversation:

DH: Hey dad, tomorrow I have to leave early becau---

SM, who recently arrived home from the bar: What the fuck is wrong with you? Someone die?

DH: Anushka needs surgery. She--

SM: The fuck is wrong with her now?

DH: She has a cyst and--

SM: Big deal! It's not a reason to cry you pussy.

DH: But--

SM: Not *your* surgery, not *my* problem.

At this point I can hear him rummaging through the mini fridge that was stocked with his beer and turn on the TV. He stomps around like a bear so even with the door closed I can tell where he is upstairs. Even more defeated DH comes back into the room and breaks down. When he calms himself, we decide its best to go to my house and head towards the car but have to pass SM in the living room who was bubbly from drinks by then and holds one up and cheers, ""Good luck, hope ya don't die"" to me and laughs. We shut the door and leave without saying a word.

 Aside from having 5 nurses hold me down on the operating table while one wiped tears off my face because the IV kept bursting my veins causing me to writhe in agony, they finally just had to knock me out, surgery was not worse case scenario but pretty damn close. It takes me about 2 weeks to recover and feel good enough to leave the house again. DH brings me to the follow up appointment where we're told no cancer! DH takes me out to dinner to celebrate no more pain and stress worrying over results. SM starts to blow DH's phone up to bring him ice cream the entire time ruining any chance at a quiet night. Fortunately, DH told him 'okay' and didn't respond to the flood of messages saying it has to be nooooooow because he's drunk and can't drive himself anywhere. There's a specific place SM always gets custard from (I call it ice cream because it makes him mad) and that's Culvers. If you don't know, they have something called the ""Flavor of the day"" and it's different at every location. DH's home town has 2 locations, so depending on whichever 'FoD' SM likes best, is the one he makes DH go to. We finish dinner and have to drive to the other side of town to get it, but finally show up with SM's ice cream, who instead of eating it puts it in the freezer because ""its not cold enough"". While standing there in awe of the situation SM whips his head around like something out of the *Exorcist* to ask me why I haven't made MIL and himself happy by giving them a grand kid.

Me: What makes you think we're going to have kids?

SM: Why would you have surgery if you didn't want one? The doctor fixed you! BIL1 already has 2 and he's younger than both of you!

Me: I wasn't broken! We don't even want kids. 

SM: Is it because you're messed up in the head? (He used this all the time for everything he didn't like about me. My parents divorced when I was 18, mom attempted suicide and made a full recovery so logically I'm a nut job. Make sense? No. Yeah, that's SM for ya. But! Karma chomped his ass and hard for this 4 years later, so he stopped using it.)

Me: What the fuck! NO! Besides we can't, I don't ha-

SM: Yes you can. You're not trying hard enough.

DH steps in and tells him to shut it, but SM cuts him off with a grunt and shrugs him off. He literally tries to shove DH who was standing 10 ft from him out of the way with a floppy hand shoo-ing motion.

SM: You're not getting any younger, soon you're going to be an old fat hen with no eggs. (He then motions like he's tapping on a watch) Tick. Tick. Tick. Time's a wasting.

I was only 20 at the time, just because BIL1 knocked up Baby Mama1 when he was 18 doesn't mean we have to rush into anything. I still had staples from surgery in 5 different spots and was getting used to not being conked out from pain meds. I am younger than the baby mama's (all 3 of them) by 3 - 5 years but because BIL1 and BIL2 are younger than me by 1 year, I'm the one with an expiration date. Guess I was still out of it because my non reaction confused SM. I remember his face curling up with rage as he was waiting for my response. Before SM can start in again DH grabs my arm and leads me back to the car to take me home, where he crashes for the rest of the week.

To this day SM has brought up having kids countless more times, has now sicked BIL2 on our case because ""the clock is ticking"". It's been 6 years and little does he know there is no clock, it stopped working when I was 20 so I threw it out. Surprisingly, MIL is the only one who has stopped bringing it up after DH exploded at her after she texted him ""so you're for sure not giving me a grandbaby?"" On top of all these shenanigans I have pretty bad tokophobia so we have always used multiple forms of birth control which were kept far away from the in laws because I wouldn't have put it passed them to mess with it. Thankfully, moving has prevented that from happening.

I'm sorry this one got so long, I blame insomnia. Before I end though I do want to stress that DH and I were dating but had discussed our options and where we stood on wanting kids early on. We were both leaning towards no kids before this happened so please don't feel bad! I have many genetic illnesses that would devastate me to pass onto a child. "

afrym6,5,2019-01-13,AITA for yelling at the waitress?,[deleted],AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/afrym6/aita_for_yelling_at_the_waitress/,"I already realize I’m the asshole, but I’ll tell this story anyway. I’m usually a very shy/reserved and unconfrontational person, but recently I cut off my family for being emotionally and physically abusive. I cut off my roommates for being emotionally abusive, and managed to work up the guts to tell them to fuck off for their shitty behavior. Since then, I’ve been an asshole. I’ve been very open with my feelings and more assertive than I’ve ever been before. I’ve changed a lot, I think. I’ve sort of flip flopped. If someone is shitty to me, I’ll tell them they’re being shitty and they need to fuck off with that shit. Before I could have been belittled, put down, and laughed at and I would have gone along with it without making a fuss at all. In fact, I’d laugh a long and act like everything was fine. 

I have a boyfriend and he lives back home so it’s long distance. I’m currently taking classes at Fordham and he lives in my hometown, Houston. He’s noticed that I’ve changed a bit, and has always told me to be more assertive so he was pretty glad about it. 

This might be more of a post for r/relationships, but for background, we’ve been together for four years. I’m not planning on being with anyone else... ever again, and I think he feels the same. So, yeah. This is it. We’re definitely serious. The only issue is that he’s a huge flirt. I get it’s a part of his personality and he isn’t going to cheat and it doesn’t mean anything, I get all that. But it still bugs me. I’ve made comments about it in the past but we haven’t had a fight about it. We haven’t fought about anything before, I don’t think. I’m definitely not the fighting type. At least, I never WAS the fighting type. 

So, I go to Houston during the break and spend the whole time with. The trip has been great, but I’m having an extra bad day. My mom saw me in Walmart and threw a fit. I was rejected from an internship I applied to, and I had my financial aid lowered b/c I couldn’t provide my moms income (which is lower than my dads, which means I get more financial aid.) Basically just a shit day. We joked that I must have broken a bunch of mirrors that morning. 

We live in the suburbs of Houston in a small town so everyone knows everyone else. We’re going out to dinner and the waitress there knows him and is being super flirty. Touching his neck and smiling and just being ***so**** much. She was doing so much. I’m not usually the jealous angry type, but it was too much. After they great each other, I just add, “I’m [insert my name] and I’m [insert my boyfriend’s name]’s girlfriend. We’re on our anniversary today, been four years.” 

For reference, I know this girl. I remember her from back in my high school days. She’s in the same class as me, so she knows this information. But she looks between us like, “Yeah. Okay, sure.” I could just be projecting but it seemed to me she was thinking, “Yeah? Okay? He’s with you? Why?” 

She takes our order and walks off and my boyfriend is like, “Seriously? Our anniversary?” Yeah, it wasn’t true. But it was a good way to tell her that a) he’s not single and b) not only is he not single, but he is in a very serious relationship of four years. I thought it was pretty clever. So she comes back and completely ignores me and pretends I’m not there and keeps making slightly flirty comments at him. I’m just getting more and more annoyed, and my boyfriend notices and is like, “Don’t worry. We’re leaving soon.” She doesn’t tell her to bug off because he loves the attention. Okay, I’m not trying to be a dick. But he really does crave attention. Plus he’s not the rude type. 

So we’re getting ready to leave and she comes back and she’s continues to pretend I’m not here and she’s like, “Are you sure I can’t hook you up with dessert?” 

My boyfriend goes, “No. Next time,” so somehow the conversation changes to, “Come over and I can hook you up with some dessert.” He’s like, “It’s hard saying no to you, so we’ll see. [ insert my name] isn’t in town for much longer so I’ve been spending most of my time with her. Between that and work I’ve been too busy,” and this lady is like, “Cool. Come when she’s gone then. I can hook you up for dessert. What’s your number?” 

When I’m retelling it, my reaction seems like way too much, but in the moment it felt super fucked and I felt super betrayed. I’m just like, “What the fuck is your problem? Are you seriously going to pretend I’m not here and blatantly hit on my boyfriend and ask for his number? What the fuck?” She just looks surprised and my boyfriend is like, “Wow. Calm down. She’s just doing her job.” Which I didn’t expect him to take my side, but still. “Doing her job? She’s not doing her goddamn job. She’s trying to fuck you and is all over you like I’m not even fucking here.” The waitress looks shocked. But I’m sort of glad because she really thought I wouldn’t call her out on her shit? Seriously? Boyfriend apologizes to her immediately and keeps saying I’m having a bad day and I’m not normally like this. He’s “really sorry about that”. He leaves her a fifty dollar tip (because of course he does!!!!!), and drags me out there. 

He’s immediately saying on the way to the car, “What is your problem.... Was seriously the shittest thing I’ve seen you do, and that’s saying something... She was just doing her job, and it’s a fucking tough job, too.... She doesn’t need to take shit like that just because you’re having a bad day...” 

Which I think is so unfair. He is at least half in fault for this happening. He didn’t shut her down. He didn’t ask her to stop. He didn’t discourage her, and she was clearly disrespecting our relationship and he was just fine letting that happen. He even made a comment halfway through dinner saying, “She’s doing a lot, isn’t she?” But he didn’t try to stop/discourage her at all. 

I’m crying at this point because I do feel bad, okay? I’m not a total monster. I didn’t want to have to go off on her, but I just couldn’t hold it in anymore. He made a comment that was like, “Why are you acting so jealous? You’ve never been like before,” and I just asked him to drop me off at my friends house &amp; say I don’t want to talk about it anymore. Before I leave, he told me I should apologize to the waitress because, “I know her and you know her and we our families know each other. It’ll just be better if you apologize. I’m suppose to go over to her dad’s house to to help with this light festival thing, and how am I suppose to do that if you went off on her?” I’m like, “So don’t go? She disrespected me in front of you and know that and you’re going to go to her dads house? That’s fucked.” But he started saying that I can’t tell him what to do and he already promised.

I’m so frustrated about the whole situation. I don’t think he should go!!! I think it’s fucked up that he wants me to apologize, and I’m not going to apologize. He isn’t even pointing out how shitty what she was doing was. So, anyway. I go to my friends house. I usually see him everyday, but we got into it again last night. He texted me about the situation and he was like, “Hey, I’m seeing you tomorrow, right? Today was shitty, but I want you to know that there isn’t any reason to be jealous.” I say, “I just wish you weren’t always so... flirty. You could have easily told her to back off.” He says, “I didn’t know it bothered you so much. I’m not sure where all this jealousy is coming from. And really, are you actually still pissed about that?” I said, “Yeah, I am? You’re going to see her again and I don’t like it.” He says, “Are you serious? We’ve been together for four years. Four years. Jesus Christ. You can take your insecure, possessive crap and shove it, okay? I’m going to be helping her DAD out with something. Her DAD. If I can’t do that, there’s something seriously wrong here.” I say, “I’m not being irrational/jealous here, okay? Stephanie agreed with me and said it was fucked up that you didn’t say anything and tell her to back off. She said my reaction was understandable and that was super shitty of that waitress. And you wanting to help her dad out after all this continues to be shitty.” He’s like, “I’m going to help her Dad with the festival. I’m not going to cancel last minute because you’re being jealous, okay? Because that’s exactly what this is. It was cute for five minutes, but it stopped being cute when you were shitty to that waitress. You should trust me. It’s been four years. I mean, fuck, I’ve thought about it, okay? So sue me. But I’m not going to do anything. You should know that.” I’m an idiot because the only thing I said to that was, “Did you think about it with her?” To which I didn’t get a reply, so I apologized. Still nothing. This morning he just said, “We need to talk ASAP in person.” 

So that’s fantastic. I’ll probably see him tomorrow and talk, but I’m not sure where all this asshole behavior/jealousy came from. I know he’s not going to cheat on me. I know he wouldn’t, but it still drives me crazy. I was on edge that whole dinner wanting to punch that girl in the face. I’m so pissed at him for not putting a stop to it. I’m also mad that he still wants to have contact with her family (and in extension her). I realize I may have overreacted, but I think it was sort of justified? I wanted him to defend me and instead he called me shitty and gave her a fifty dollar tip. Great. But I also don’t know if I have a right to be mad. Is he in the right here? I don’t know. Help. 

Edit: I feel a little shitty for dropping all our texts and stuff on here, but I’d really like to see other perspectives. Kinda of messed up of me to do, honestly. He could so easily tell this is about him and it’s very personal. But it’s also anonymous, so should I be that worried about it? 

Thank you for all the insight. Appreciate it. 

TL;DR: Go to dinner with boyfriend. He knows the waitress. She flirts with him. Inappropriately touching him and asking if he’ll come over when I’m out of town. He laughs it off. I lose my cool and yell at her. He leaves her a fifty dollar tip, apologizes, and calls me shitty. I think it was disrespectful that he didn’t tell her to knock it off and was enjoying the attention. He says I’m being ridiculous and jealous and I need to calm down. "

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a first-year electrical engineering student. Throughout high school, I learned Fusion 360, and I have a 3D printer and had/have access to more 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC Plasma, etc both through my high school and now through my University instead. Anyway, I got quite proficient at using Fusion 360, but it was the first ""real"" CAD package I learned on, and therefore I'm used to all its specifics.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this year I've joined a couple clubs, and had an internship, and SolidWorks is used everywhere pretty universally in this environment. How hard will it be to move from Fusion 360 to SolidWorks?

&amp;#x200B;

There's lots of guides of moving the other way, but I can't find any ""Fusion 360 users' guide to using SolidWorks"" type articles. If you guys have any suggestions or places to look on jump-starting getting proficient in SolidWorks from Fusion 360, let me know. As an EE, I don't think I need to be a god in mechanical CAD, I just want to be proficient in the software used by my peers."

But, I don’t want to go...",Unorthodox_cube,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/afs5c7/i_got_my_dream_job_make_more_money_than_my/,"In 3 days I’m moving 1604 miles away. Albeit, it’s only 3 months... But I don’t want to go.

See as a student I have to take all the work experience I can get. I foolishly applied to the one of the most renowned companies in the world. This is actually my dream place to work, I wanted to work here ever since I was 3 years old.

It took 10 interviews, every interview I went in with the mindset  of “no way in hell I get this internship, but might as well get the interview experience”.

Well on one chilly Wednesday afternoon in early December (last month), I get a call saying I got the job. It was entirely unexpected. 

I come from humble beginnings, poor parents and the whole 9 yards. I’ll be making more money than them combine, and it’s only an internship. 

On paper this seems like a killer deal. I get to move to one of the most popular cities in the US. Work a kick ass internship, at such a cool and renowned company people literally say “wow, that’s amazing” to me. I should have no problem getting a job after graduation. 

You see, I should have a grin from ear to ear. I’m beating poverty, I’m doing it, all my hard work is paying off.

But I’m leaving someone behind. It’s a girl, it’s always a girl. She’s the most beautiful and amazing girl I’ve ever seen. I love her, or atleast I want to love her.

We’ve been in this weird friends with benefits type thing for the past 7 months. But she’s not ready to commit.. She tells me how different I am from all the other guys. She tells me how sweet, genuine and caring I am. The sex is fantastic with her. She tells me she misses me when I’m gone. She makes me feel wanted and desired. 


My three month absence from seeing her will probably destroy any chance of a relationship I have with her.

We’re both young. There’s a lot of time left, and on the grand scheme of things 3 months isn’t that much. But it’s not really about the amount of time, it’s more of the timing itself.

Recently things have been so good between her and I. And I would do almost anything for it to stay like that.. But I can’t not take this job. I just can’t, I gotta go through with it.

I hope it works out.. I hope I can be with her when I get back. My heart has been broken a few times before. And I feel it quivering now.. I don’t want to go through that again.. But it’s a risk I gotta take.

She seemed interested in seeing each other when I get back. She’s not good at talking about her feelings, this she has said, and as well demonstrated. 

While I’m gone, she could find someone better. This is what will probably happen, I can’t blame her.. I won’t be there.

It’s going to be so hard to focus on work while I’m there with her on my mind. I can see it now, as I’m in my 1 bed studio apartment. All alone...

But I cannot fall into that anxiety surrounded void. I plan on keeping my head down and focusing on me and my job. I want to make the most out of these 3 months and make them go by fast. 

Instead of worrying that it might not work.. I’m gonna start thinking the opposite. Maybe all my hard work will pay off. 

If you wait for me, I’ll give you the world. I promise ❤️ "

Basically just a shit day. We joked that I must have broken a bunch of mirrors that morning. 

We live in the suburbs of Houston in a small town so everyone knows everyone else. We’re going out to dinner and the waitress there knows him and is being super flirty. Touching his neck and smiling and just being ***so**** much. She was doing so much. I’m not usually the jealous angry type, but it was too much. After they great each other, I just add, “I’m [insert my name] and I’m [insert my boyfriend’s name]’s girlfriend. We’re on our anniversary today, been four years.” 

For reference, I know this girl. I remember her from back in my high school days. She’s in the same class as me, so she knows this information. But she looks between us like, “Yeah. Okay, sure.” I could just be projecting but it seemed to me she was thinking, “Yeah? Okay? He’s with you? Why?” 

She takes our order and walks off and my boyfriend is like, “Seriously? Our anniversary?” Yeah, it wasn’t true. But it was a good way to tell her that a) he’s not single and b) not only is he not single, but he is in a very serious relationship of four years. I thought it was pretty clever. So she comes back and completely ignores me and pretends I’m not there and keeps making slightly flirty comments at him. I’m just getting more and more annoyed, and my boyfriend notices and is like, “Don’t worry. We’re leaving soon.” She doesn’t tell her to bug off because he loves the attention. Okay, I’m not trying to be a dick. But he really does crave attention. Plus he’s not the rude type. 

So we’re getting ready to leave and she comes back and she’s continues to pretend I’m not here and she’s like, “Are you sure I can’t hook you up with dessert?” 

My boyfriend goes, “No. Next time,” so somehow the conversation changes to, “Come over and I can hook you up with some dessert.” He’s like, “It’s hard saying no to you, so we’ll see. [ insert my name] isn’t in town for much longer so I’ve been spending most of my time with her. Between that and work I’ve been too busy,” and this lady is like, “Cool. Come when she’s gone then. I can hook you up for dessert. What’s your number?” 

When I’m retelling it, my reaction seems like way too much, but in the moment it felt super fucked and I felt super betrayed. I’m just like, “What the fuck is your problem? Are you seriously going to pretend I’m not here and blatantly hit on my boyfriend and ask for his number? What the fuck?” She just looks surprised and my boyfriend is like, “Wow. Calm down. She’s just doing her job.” Which I didn’t expect him to take my side, but still. “Doing her job? She’s not doing her goddamn job. She’s trying to fuck you and is all over you like I’m not even fucking here.” The waitress looks shocked. But I’m sort of glad because she really thought I wouldn’t call her out on her shit? Seriously? Boyfriend apologizes to her immediately and keeps saying I’m having a bad day and I’m not normally like this. He’s “really sorry about that”. He leaves her a fifty dollar tip (because of course he does!!!!!), and drags me out there. 

He’s immediately saying on the way to the car, “What is your problem.... Was seriously the shittest thing I’ve seen you do, and that’s saying something... She was just doing her job, and it’s a fucking tough job, too.... She doesn’t need to take shit like that just because you’re having a bad day...” 

Which I think is so unfair. He is at least half in fault for this happening. He didn’t shut her down. He didn’t ask her to stop. He didn’t discourage her, and she was clearly disrespecting our relationship and he was just fine letting that happen. He even made a comment halfway through dinner saying, “She’s doing a lot, isn’t she?” But he didn’t try to stop/discourage her at all. 

I’m crying at this point because I do feel bad, okay? I’m not a total monster. I didn’t want to have to go off on her, but I just couldn’t hold it in anymore. He made a comment that was like, “Why are you acting so jealous? You’ve never been like before,” and I just asked him to drop me off at my friends house &amp; say I don’t want to talk about it anymore. Before I leave, he told me I should apologize to the waitress because, “I know her and you know her and we our families know each other. It’ll just be better if you apologize. I’m suppose to go over to her dad’s house to to help with this light festival thing, and how am I suppose to do that if you went off on her?” I’m like, “So don’t go? She disrespected me in front of you and know that and you’re going to go to her dads house? That’s fucked.” But he started saying that I can’t tell him what to do and he already promised.

I’m so frustrated about the whole situation. I don’t think he should go!!! I think it’s fucked up that he wants me to apologize, and I’m not going to apologize. He isn’t even pointing out how shitty what she was doing was. So, anyway. I go to my friends house. I usually see him everyday, but we got into it again last night. He texted me about the situation and he was like, “Hey, I’m seeing you tomorrow, right? Today was shitty, but I want you to know that there isn’t any reason to be jealous.” I say, “I just wish you weren’t always so... flirty. You could have easily told her to back off.” He says, “I didn’t know it bothered you so much. I’m not sure where all this jealousy is coming from. And really, are you actually still pissed about that?” I said, “Yeah, I am? You’re going to see her again and I don’t like it.” He says, “Are you serious? We’ve been together for four years. Four years. Jesus Christ. You can take your insecure, possessive crap and shove it, okay? I’m going to be helping her DAD out with something. Her DAD. If I can’t do that, there’s something seriously wrong here.” I say, “I’m not being irrational/jealous here, okay? Stephanie agreed with me and said it was fucked up that you didn’t say anything and tell her to back off. She said my reaction was understandable and that was super shitty of that waitress. And you wanting to help her dad out after all this continues to be shitty.” He’s like, “I’m going to help her Dad with the festival. I’m not going to cancel last minute because you’re being jealous, okay? Because that’s exactly what this is. It was cute for five minutes, but it stopped being cute when you were shitty to that waitress. You should trust me. It’s been four years. I mean, fuck, I’ve thought about it, okay? So sue me. But I’m not going to do anything. You should know that.” I’m an idiot because the only thing I said to that was, “Did you think about it with her?” To which I didn’t get a reply, so I apologized. Still nothing. This morning he just said, “We need to talk ASAP in person.” 

So that’s fantastic. I’ll probably see him tomorrow and talk, but I’m not sure where all this asshole behavior/jealousy came from. I know he’s not going to cheat on me. I know he wouldn’t, but it still drives me crazy. I was on edge that whole dinner wanting to punch that girl in the face. I’m so pissed at him for not putting a stop to it. I’m also mad that he still wants to have contact with her family (and in extension her). I realize I may have overreacted, but I think it was sort of justified? I wanted him to defend me and instead he called me shitty and gave her a fifty dollar tip. Great. But I also don’t know if I have a right to be mad. Is he in the right here? I don’t know. Help. 

Edit: I feel a little shitty for dropping all our texts and stuff on here, but I’d really like to see other perspectives. Kinda of messed up of me to do, honestly. He could so easily tell this is about him and it’s very personal. But it’s also anonymous, so should I be that worried about it? 

Thank you for all the insight. Appreciate it. "

PLOTS


**Rags to Riches**

They had been friends from the start. They both lived in the same crappy apartment went to the same crappy school. Till both his parents died in a car crash, He had to move to his uncle a very successful man of his time. His uncle wasn't a legal businessman he was a Mob boss that owned most of the city with only one enemy the law. His uncle was killed and he soon had to take over under the stipulation he had to marry so he would have an Heir to their empire but who but his old friend is all that came to mind. 

His best friend he left behind had gone to college to get her degree and be more successful than her parents. That was harder then she thought would ever be. She soon had two jobs and was struggling with college. 

What shall happen next when he walks into her life. 

**Crushing**

She just started her first internship. He parents wanted her to work at their Law firm but she wanted to work at a local Software company where the CEO was her age. Her intentions were pure but she never knew he would be so kind and sweet. What will the CEO when he receives a girl's doodles about her having a crush on him in the morning's meetings.

**Secrets**

He had been recruited out of highschool for a special assignment for the military but he had to leave his life behind Specifically because his parents had passed away when he was young and his aunt seemed to not care so much about what he did or didn't do. He had enough time that before he left he did something to his girlfriend to get him to hate him before he left. 

Now he's tired of the life and decided to come back home half expecting to find his girlfriend had moved on after 10 years but surprised to find her still single and a single mother of a 10-year old that if wasn't mistaken looked like him. 

Note I will listen to other plots. I know this isn't a lot of plots because I'm rebuilding from mine. 

**Friends with Benefits**

Muse A and Muse B met at a Gala filled with VPs. Both had a rough day at work and ended up in each other’s bed by the next morning. Though it didn’t stop there they began meeting for casual sex every moment after that at first it was a once a month need then it got to whenever they could get away but they kept secrets from one another. Muse A was twice Muse Bs age for one old enough to be Muse Bs father but that wasn’t all Muse A was a boss of one of the biggest Crime Organizations in the city and he was most of all Married to the mother of his two sons.

Muse B she didn’t deal with crime but she was an Heiress to a large fortune and the CEO to her own company and didn’t want the world to know she was having sex with an older man casually. She was his mistress she didn’t want gifts or things she just wanted his company and affection from time to time.

After a year of fooling around work gets tough for them but what makes it worse. muse b just found out she’s pregnant. She doesn’t know if she should keep it or confront Muse A


** Hurt ** 

He was a CEO of a company he built from the ground up. He had it all the cars the house and the wife. She was his high school sweetheart and he never once tried to do anything to hurt her. If she wanted something he bought it. If she wanted time at home he made it happen. Though the past year she’s been distant and finally he found out why. 

He was a mess finding out she was cheating but to make it worse she’s pregnant and he doesn’t know if it’s his because they have still been having sex too. 

His secretary has been watching him fall apart this unable to attend meeting or events for the company. The company should be falling apart just as he was but she stepped up to the plate. Kept the paparazzi away from him went to the event spoke in his meetings. She was doing his job for him while he try’s to find himself. A month was more then enough time but she knew the pain finding your spouse with someone else. So she decided to try to help. She planned to take him out somewhere to have fun. "

I'm about to graduate and am looking for a job. I have a year of internship experience working with FPGAs.

I was asked how I would do Gaussian elimination in an FPGA. I told the interviewer that I didn't know the mathematical method (I have a poor linear algebra background) and he proceeded to whiteboard the process in a pretty poor manner, taking a few pauses while he figured things out and rewriting the example he was using to demonstrate as he made corrections. Anyway, after about 10 minutes of trying to understand his explanation I told the guy that I wasn't really following what he was doing and we moved on to another question. 

I feel that this probably hurt my chances the most, as I did well with the other interviewers that day and the recruiter who rejected me told me I was lacking in the systems design area."

I am looking for a detailed female rp with little to no limits for an abusive roleplay including domination from my side. The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)The wrath of a God: This one is a bit more creative and will take place in ancient Egypt. Your character can be Cleopatra, or any other persone you would like who is celebrated for her beauty. However, this beauty was a gift from the God Anubis, in order to spread his word. But since you used your beauty to be wrongfully know as a God, you will have to fave punishment 

4)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

5)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

6)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo"

Recently I have got into TRP and I’ve been observing the material ever since. Even went to buy rational male book by Rollo Tomassi. Also, what’s your idea on YouTube content creator Coach Red Pill?

So, I’m 26y.o. have been spinning plates four years ago (I  didn’t know the term. It seemed natural) but then settled for a relationship with a crazy chick. She had a bipolar disorder and drove me nuts. To the point where I didn’t recognise myself as I stopped going to gym, seeing my friends and got a major depression crisis upon our break up. This happened three years ago. 

Luckily, I have great parents who saved me (from my death wish) and let me to pursue a master’s degree, now I’m in a final year, finishing my internship. However, ever since my depression I have not been with a woman. Something changed in me and I don’t know how to explain it. It’s like I already faced the worst and I cannot feel apathy towards girls. 

My parents wants me to come back home after my internship ends because I wouldn’t have a job soon but at the same time they are worried. I understand and respect them, so I will comply for the moment. 

I don’t want to sound like a special snowflake and I know you brothers have lots of shit of your own to handle. What I ask for is some love and acceptance. Also, any kind of advice would be useful. It’s even hard for me to put it in question. I feel lost but at the same time happy to have discovered TRP

All the best

A few of the senior residents were kinder and more understanding and since we spent most of our rotations with them, they helped ease the workload. However, there was a junior resident we interns despised and finding oneself working with her was torture. She treated us interns exactly as the senior paediatrician demanded.


I was prone to recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and also suffering from allergic rhinitis/sinusitis (and whatever friends they invited). I started picking up infections easily and but kept up with our crazy schedule.


However, I one time woke up with severe sore throat, a fever and unable to swallow. I couldn't speak and when I peeked into a mirror, I found my throat having an angry red colour with massive tonsils. For the next few days, I struggled, getting little sleep and basically drooling because it hurt so much to swallow and oral meds were not helping. I was not allowed time off.


I barely made it to the ward for a major round on a Friday and the senior paediatrician berated me then demanded my excuse. When I kept trying and failing to speak, only managing some hoarse croak, he scolded me again, asking if I was special with my throat because he too had a sore throat and yet he was working. He ordered me to keep on working.


I kept silent and attended the round. 


Later on, after he had left, I was in the midst of doing a round in the neonatal unit (while wearing a respirator because I was desperate) when a senior resident heard me cough. Dude ordered me off the ward and to the nurse's station where he had me examined then proceeded to prescribe some nasty IV antibiotics, painkillers and bedrest. The nurses inserted the line and gave me my first dose.


As I left the ward, I wound up meeting the dreaded junior resident, who reminded me that the next day's weekend call was with her and I was meant to be there early and ready to work. 


Nothing I tried to say could dissuade her, not even the IV cannula on my hand or the list of medications. She threatened to report me to the senior paediatrician.


I was on the ward before 8am the next day, got another dose of my prescribed IV medication and proceeded with my call, having this junior resident ordering me about.


I fainted one hour later.


When I woke, I was on a bed with so many people complaining. Apparently another paediatrician had found me just as I had fallen and had seen the IV line. She was demanding to know who was making me work. The junior resident lied that she had told me not to come and when I woke, she even started scolding me. 


I was too dizzy to start arguing and only wanted my bed. They let me go after making certain that I was stable and told me not to report back until I was recovered. 


I foolishly returned to the ward on Monday, still with my IV line present because I truly feared the senior paediatrician and when I was spotted, they called me in for a meeting to ask how I was and if I had finished my medications then got sent back until the dosage was complete.


I found out later that along with my collapse, another resident (one of the good ones), had apparently picked up some infection and convulsed while on duty on the same day and that these two reports were causing panic.


The residents called a meeting for the interns and started encouraging to go to them if we needed help, if we were unwell, if we had any problem...blah blah blah. Evil junior resident was quite verbal and even apologetic for us having misunderstood her actions. I still don't know what punishment she received (we were too low on the food chain) but she mellowed out a lot. Senior paediatrician acted like we didn't exist and would only focus on the residents during the rounds. 


I won't say that the rest of my rotation was smooth sailing but it was certainly better than before.


TL;DR Got a sore throat but ordered to work. Proceeded to work while on IV antibiotics and fainted.


PS: I know that working while ill especially in such a department is a big NO but unfortunately at the time, the senior paediatrician had frightened us so much and we knew we could not pass without his approval.

afxfse,1,2019-01-14,[M4A](Playing Female) Office Sex (10+ Ideas inside),mjd931,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/afxfse/m4aplaying_female_office_sex_10_ideas_inside/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc 

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me 

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.


THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)  


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

 

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

afy5br,1,2019-01-14,About my parents - long post,rayforever,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/afy5br/about_my_parents_long_post/,"I want to share my feeling of loneliness that has been festering inside of me for years. Right now, at the age of 28, I'm slowly accepting that both my parents are abusive and don't love me unconditionally. When I was growing up, I thought it was just because I was ""behaving badly"", since that is what they've been feeding me. But i'm realizing their behavior is not right. In k12, I followed a strict rule. School was Mon-Fri from 7am-4pm, then private classes from 6 pm-8pm. Then go home and study/do homework for the next day. I tried to be a good student to make my parents proud. That wasn't enough for my dad. He claimed that if I was smart enough, I won't need to take private lessons. My dad likes to yell, call names and humiliate me in front of public. He also frequently abuse my mom verbally. Constantly criticizing her cooking, making fun of her makeup. My mom is a sweet lady but a doormat with no backbone. When mom + dad gets into a fight, mom likes to pretend that she is dead to get attention from me. Mom likes to make me feel guilty and hold me responsible for my happiness. Both parents pin me against each other a lot.   


At age 13, mom told me dad likes to flash himself to other women. I did not believe her at the time. Mom told me to wake up at a certain hour to ""see for myself"". And there I saw my dad flashing himself. At the age of 21, my dad confided in me that mom cheated on him early in their marriage, so he in turned started banging other women. He took no responsibility of lack of self control.

Despite this, the one thing they are good at is making money and paying my college tuition in full. Including room + board + books. I had a part time job throughout school but only enough to cover food + entertainment.

Yes, I've tried speaking with them about how their actions make me feel. They say that when I feel bad, it is because I am too sensitive, therefore it is ""my fault"" that I feel anxious/ depressed.

I went for a HS year aboard in US when I was 15 and lived with a total of 5 hostfamilies until I was ready to find my own place. I graduated HS at the age of 16 and got a bachelor at the age of 20. Right after graduation (in graphic design), I had to intern for 32 hr/week no pay and do freelance work at night so I can get paid. I did this to add to my resume. At this time my mom threatened to stop funding me and that scared the shit outta me. Then I found a FT job at a local family business, earning 36K/year. I live in a big city, so I was living paycheck to paycheck for a while. To save money I rented a room in a shared house, it was. Told my mom, thought she will be happy that I found a job. But she instead made comments on how low my pay were and how she was expecting me to give her money.   


After I started working professionally, my mom constantly try to guilt me into sending her money. She called me an ""investment"", which hurts me a lot. I truly just want them to be proud of me. Even 1 word from them can mean so much. But they never give it to me. I have an older brother who still lives with them at home. He is 3 yrs older than me, he has a degree but makes nothing of it. Refuse to find a job or start a business. He is running my parents into the ground, but my mom likes to focus on pressuring me for money. At one point I told her I can prostitute myself to send her money, then she got mad. But I was serious.. I would do anything for my parents if they really need to. Thankfully it never got to that point.

Anyway, my mom would gave an oscar-winning performance on poverty, but then brag about how she is doing renovation. When I come to visit my parents, my mom demanded list of things to give, such as jewelry, gold, diamonds, watch, leather handbag etc. She also wants me to buy extra handbag so she can give it out to her friends. I was poor at the time (still making 36K), so I can only afford a few things, like the leather handbag and some jewelry. I also gave her money on top of all of the gifts. While she is demanding things, she is planning a wedding for my brother. But I still want to think the best of her and not think too much of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, something big happened. My fiancee and I, decided to get married (court wedding), then plan a bigger wedding later. At this time, my dad already stopped talking to me due to differing opinion on politics. He thinks his opinion &amp; feelings are more important, when I disagree, he lost his mind, called me names. The night before we did the court wedding, I called my parents, just wanting to talk to them. It was a happy time for me, I was about to marry my best friend. My mom warned me not to talk to my dad. I didn't care, because I wanted to hear his voice. What happened after was eye-opening. It wasn't the warm, sweet conversation that I was hoping for. Instead he yelled, called me names, told me that I disrespected him because my Fiancee family did not give dowry for marrying me. He called my Fiancee parents bad names. He hung up. My mom called me and cried on the phone with me. She wants to comfort me, but she blamed me for calling dad. ""I told you not to talk to him"". She still defended his action to this day.  


Emotional, both my Fiancee and I talked to his parents. His mom calmed us down and assured us to go through with the wedding. It was hard getting up the next morning to get married after being told I am a worthless trash by my beloved parents.

&amp;#x200B;

This event happened about 1 year ago, and since then I've grown to distance myself from parents. I am happy with my husband and everything we have. We are both healthy and responsible. but I am still not happy with myself. I still feel like a worthless trash. Being criticized makes me feel anxious. I'm still depressed/ anxious from time to time and seeing therapist regularly. My life is great, but I am still stuck thinking that I am a failure, despite my life's successes (graduating finding honest work, finding a soulmate, owning a cat). I feel extremely lonely that I have no parents that support my choices. Anyway, thank you so much for reading, this is a very long post. Hope you guys have a good day."

They all comes with windows 7 pro license. I have a recovery DVD that comes with the machine. There's also the same image for download.

I don't have Volume License and boss won't buy one for these old machines so I have to work with what I have, the OEM license.

I read the reimaging right pdf and I'm still confused. It state that 
&gt; Yes, you may use an OEM recovery image on devices shipped by that OEM if the device is appropriately licensed

There are some questions.

1. The most basic thing, am I allowed to use the recovery ISO/DVD to install on the machines?

2. Am I allowed to load that ISO into MDT, unmodified and deploy to multiple machines?

3. Am I allowed to load that ISO into MDT, put windows updates into task sequence and deploy to multiple machines?

4. Am I allowed to install that ISO on a machine, sysprep a new image and deploy to multiple machine?"

I suffered depression and social anxiety which lead to a decrease in my grades and I hate myself for it. 

I knew I had the symptoms of depression but it took me such a long time to realize I need help and longer time to actually ask for help.

I feel like I missed out on many good experiences because of my social anxiety.

And right now I feel like this is it. Like that was life and its over and from now on everything will happen so fast that I will wake up and realize I'm 35 with kids and have done nothing my entire life.

I'm looking for jobs in HR right now because I had 2 internships in HR so its easier to find jobs but what I really want is to be a therapist,however to do that I need masters and for masters I need money since my gpa is 2.82 scholarship is not an option so yeah I feel like the person that I was when I was depressed fucked up the rest of my life.

And there is no way out of it."
afz9c1,9,2019-01-14,How do you keep yourself from oversharing?,dashestodashes,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/afz9c1/how_do_you_keep_yourself_from_oversharing/,"I grew up with no boundaries, where leaving out any detail--no matter how innocuous and unimportant--was considered ""lying by omission."" So I got in the habit of sharing everything, since I knew I couldn't keep anything secret anyway. My mom was an oversharer as well, and she had a tendency to share about my personal information to absolutely anyone. 

Well, now that I'm trying to be professional and get my first ""real job"" (in my last semester of college and hopefully starting an internship soon), I know that I have to dial it all back like *a lot*.  My husband has been helping me by pointing out when I get a little too detailed about stuff other people don't need to know, but I still have a huge issue with it. 

We've come up with some good responses for when people ask about my family, which is mostly just deflecting and directing their attention to my healthy relationships (i.e., my marriage), and we agreed that I won't mention my disabilities (I have more besides CPTSD) unless I'm directly asked or it's 100% relevant. 

How do you guys manage this? How do you determine what is and isn't okay to share, and to whom? If I'm trying to be friendly and make connections with coworkers, where do I draw those lines? And who do I talk to about this stuff (family issues, disability issues, personal problems, etc) if it's supposed to be private? I can't just bottle it up, cause that's not healthy. But my husband and therapist already know what I'm dealing with, so it's not even worth bringing up sometimes cause it's not any fresh perspective or anything like that. "
afztbq,3,2019-01-14,"Today I remembered something that I thought wouldn't bother me anymore now that I am an adult, but it happened and I am more hurt than I care to admit.",senjohitagi,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/afztbq/today_i_remembered_something_that_i_thought/,"And that is how people often don't like me, most people probably.

I have this so called friend at work who I thought I had a good relationship with. Even though we don't have to we are always helping each other and know a lot about each other personal lives. We used to walk to the train station everyday together, which is 30 minutes away.

  
But one day I got this nauseating feeling that something was off. She started to be dry on her answers and more professional, only saying the necessary. One day day she said she had something to do so she wouldn't be able to walk with me to the station. Another day she said she was trying another bus that was closer to her home. So I went home alone. This went on for a few days.

Up until this point I thought it was weird but didn't make much of it. But today something happened:  
We are both interns and we leave at the exact same time. But she said ""I have this other bus which is closer to my home, so I won't be able to go with you"". She explained a little about the location of this bus stop (it was located on the opposite direction of the train station). I expected something like this, she had told me that already. So I said goodbye and left.

After walking for a bit I decided that I was a bit tired, so I sat down on a bench on a street nearby. 

About ten minutes later I see this friend walking on the same path towards the station that we used to go. She passed by me but didn't notice me, but I noticed her. I decided not to make a big deal out of it, so I just got up and went to the station. When I got there she was there, waiting for the train. 

Well maybe she changed her mind. Maybe the bus had a problem. Maybe is none of my business.

But she looked at me and I could see her embarrassment. She mumbled something  but I could see in her eyes, she knew that I figured out. 

Maybe I am being silly for caring about this so much, but it really ruined my day. I thought I could develop something with this person but she decided it was better to lie and wait 10 to 20 minutes everyday rather than talking to me.

This hurts. I liked her a lot.

ag0243,7,2019-01-14,Any validation that I’m not crazy?,wizarding97,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ag0243/any_validation_that_im_not_crazy/,"Hi, I’ve been subscribed to this sub a while after some suspicions about my parents. I’m not sure if my mom is a narcissist, but I need advice.

So, I’m in my last semester of college (university) and I’m trying to plan out what to do next. My mom is adamant about graduate school, but I’ve never been certain. Every time I’ve tried to say no, she freaks out and starts crying and tells me she won’t let me ruin my future. The stress of this alone has made me put off applying, and now a lot of deadlines have passed and she’s freaking out about that too.

So today, my favorite professor (a man with a phd who has worked in my preferred industry successfully for a long time) gave me some advice. He said something along the lines of: 

“Don’t make a fear based decision and go to grad school just because you think you have to. There are a lot of opportunities out there that I think you should explore. You’re smart and talented and the only reason you don’t have any skills, despite all your years in school? It’s certainly not your fault. It’s a reflection of the failed education system against you.

Anywhere I’ve worked in the industry, no one has had any idea what was going on. You learn as you work, as is the case with everyone. After you’ve had a few internships and jobs you’ll have experience necessary to get a higher position.

Consider all your options before locking into anything that concrete. Don’t make a decision just because you think it’s what you should do.”

So, this made me really excited! Someone with a ton of industry experience and schooling giving me advice about how I should approach it! I felt like I finally got advice from someone who knows real life things about my industry!

I went to tell my mom (making sure not to rule out grad school at any point in the convo). The whole time I was beaming and excited. But my mom, as usual, had to make it about how it affects her. 

She said something along the lines of:

“Oh, so you’re going to get all your life advice from some hack teacher who has no idea what he’s saying? Everyone has told you to go to graduate school. And I am not going to sit here and let you RUIN your LIFE.” (At this point, she starts sobbing)

“I am not going to sit here and watch you fail! Graduate school is the only route to make you successful. Everyone has had an internship. That isn’t going to set you apart. You just want to take the easy way out because you don’t want to go to school anymore. How could you do this to me? I am so stressed by everyone, how are you going to sit here and sabotage yourself? I will not let you do that. I will NOT, no matter WHAT let you end up as some loser in a dead end job. Don’t even say things like that to me.”

This whole time, I’m just staring blankly and unsure of what to say. She’s done this to me for so long. When I was applying to this college, she freaked out and started screaming and crying when I considered even APPLYING to a more arts-focused school (I have a major in the arts) and got so angry at me because it was “less prestigious” than the one I’m going to. The school I’m going to also happens to be where she works, so that’s great.

Now she’s pressuring me especially to go to grad school here. And I do not want to. I need to get away, and she’s already told me she’s not going to support me financially anymore after I graduate (she still supports my almost-30 older brother though). 

I don’t know what to do. She invalidates any opinions that go against her own (she often says that she is always right, and she means it) and makes me feel crazy and stupid for considering something else.

She is making my life all about her and I don’t know what to do. I know I need to make my own decision, but I love my mom very much and we are very close. As I get older though, I see more and more of how she is and how unstable that is for MY life.

I don’t have much of a support system at all, very few friends and family, and I quite honestly would be very lost if I had no one. I love my mom so much, but I can’t do this anymore.

Sorry if I’m being rambly. I can provide more examples after I’ve calmed down. I just need advice. I need validation that my preferred plan of action isn’t a crazy, guaranteed way to fail. Please.

Thank you."

# Questions

To get a better overview of Arena &amp; Assault habits (and giving ideas to other players wondering whether they should intensify their efforts or opt for build/team tweaks), here are questions anyone can answer.

    **What is your current situation in Arena (usual tier(s), score/ranking range)?**  
    **How do you aim for your highest affordable score in Arena (units, merges/builds, deathless)?**  
    **What are your main weaknesses/threats &amp; improvements you have in mind for Arena?**  
    **What is your current situation in Assault (usual tier(s), score/ranking range)?**  
    **How do you aim for your highest affordable score in Assault (units, merges/builds, deathless)?**  
    **What are your main weaknesses/threats &amp; improvements you have in mind for Assault?**  

With this, we would have a depiction of various game level profiles, from high-tier players to more casual ones.

Corrections will be progressively done over time. Thanks to everyone contributing to this tracking initiative."

No answers? Actually, it's the feeling that companies may've not bothered to look at your case.

It wasn't a joke or a riddle, though. And it's not a copypasta since it's still relevant.

Now that Aether Raids is scaled with Arena seasons, data collection will be easier. No more one-day gap, and I can easily regroup data collection for all thresholds.

As always, I need as much accurate information as possible to pinpoint estimates or precise cutoffs, so ideally take the time to comment here with your scores + personal ranks + ranking thresholds and update your data if possible. **Do NOT post scores on the other threads linked in this post, else data analysis will take more time.**

**Template** (for better comprehension &amp; easier post-session recheck)

    **Assault Top Yk**

&amp;#x200B;

My Background:

When I started studying for the CCNA I had no prior experience in networking/IT.  Held a bachelors degree in Music Education. Had a close friend who was a very successful network engineer recommend this career path.  I signed up for classes at a local community college and went through the NetAcad program for CCNA.  I passed the ICND1 in May of 2018 with a 934/1000, earned a summer internship at a NOC just down the road from my community college and gained some experience in real world networking. (The stars aligned for me.)  The internship turned into a career and really lit my fire once I was exposed to the the high levels of knowledge and technical experience real network engineers have.

&amp;#x200B;

Study Materials used:

Cisco NetAcad through local community college, CBT Nuggets with the great Jeremy Cioara, Cisco OCG, and Boson Exam prep.

About the exam:

I would easily say I over studied for this exam.  But when you're betting on your future and many many hours of preparation, it was worth it.  I honestly thought I was not going to pass during the actual test.  Though I did not let this discourage me, I continued to push through and answer every question as best I could.  In hindsight, I would say the Boson practice exams and the Pearson Vue OCG ICND2 exam practice questions were much more difficult than the actual exam. I would recommend going through multiple practice exams through either vendor, and lab/research any question you miss.  Both Boson and the OCG have great explanations following each question.  The day before the test I was scoring around the 700's for the Boson tests, which really had me discouraged.  I would recommend Boson over the OCG practice exams, just because of the simlets and other features not included with the OCG Pearson Vue software. Bottom line is don't give up, if you want to make things happen and move into a thriving career then continue working toward that everyday.

Future plans:

Ordered my OCG for CCNP Switch, should be arriving next week.  Will jump into that straight away, because why not :)"
ag0lrc,1648,2019-01-14,University Will No Longer Discriminate Against Male Students In Need Of Financial Aid After Federal Complaint,ScatterYouMonsters,KotakuInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/ag0lrc/university_will_no_longer_discriminate_against/,"Thought I'd do a quick thread about this... basically, Tulane University - after being sued by a title IX attorney - has made an agreement with federal government to stop discriminating against men by offering several female-only scholarships &amp; financial aid. To quote:

&gt; The policies were found to be in violation of Title IX, the anti-sex discrimination statute from 1972. Margaret C. Valois, a Title IX attorney in Virginia, filed a complaint with the Education Department’s Office For Civil Rights (OCR) alleging that six scholarships listed on Tulane’s website were discriminatory against men because they were only offered to women. Her complaint was accepted for investigation by OCR on August 20, 2018, according to PJ Media:

&gt; Scholarships under investigation include the Landor Lewis and Shirley Gauff Awards, the Grace Hopper Celebration Award, and the school’s Summer Internship Funding Grant, which offers up to $2,000 annually for female students to take on unpaid internships. The full scope of ""financial discrimination"" by Tulane is unknown. The six scholarships listed in the Title IX complaint may only comprise a small fraction of all female-only scholarships at the school, as private universities typically do not list all scholarships on their website.

Men apparently account for 41% of Tulane's student population, and are less likely to graduate than women.

&gt; Late last week, Tulane quietly entered a resolution with OCR to stop their discriminatory financial aid practices. “By September 6, 2019, the University will ensure that it is not treating male students differently on the basis of sex by providing different amounts of financial assistance, limiting eligibility for financial assistance… or otherwise discriminating with respect to financial assistance,"" the agreement said, according to Airaksinen. Tulane will provide updated training to its financial aid officers to ensure “nondiscrimination in financial assistance.” It will be interesting to see if they actually follow through, since colleges and universities still favor women even though they make up the majority of students and graduates.

&gt; ""I am optimistic that Tulane, and other schools as well, will recognize the need for change across the board in their academic programs, and that this agreement can serve as a road map to that change,"" Valois told Airaksinen.

PJ Media also talked with a spokesman for the university, Michael Strecker, who said:

&gt; ... the resolution was not an admission of guilt on the part of the university and that it may still provide “sex-restrictive scholarships.”

&gt; ""This resolution agreement contains no admission of liability, non-compliance or wrongdoing by Tulane,"" Strecker said. ""This resolution agreement does not impact sex-restrictive institutional scholarships. Title IX allows for sex-restrictive scholarships as long as the total pool of scholarship money is fairly distributed between men and women.”

&gt; Valois is the mother of two sons, and her efforts to end institutional discrimination against men at Tulane via scholarships is similar to an effort launched by Kursat Christoff Pekgoz, a doctoral student at the University of Southern California. Pekgoz is also targeting specific schools, including Yale University, for providing female-only scholarships and professional assistance even though women outnumber men on college campuses and among graduates.

PLOTS


**Rags to Riches**

They had been friends from the start. They both lived in the same crappy apartment went to the same crappy school. Till both his parents died in a car crash, He had to move to his uncle a very successful man of his time. His uncle wasn't a legal businessman he was a Mob boss that owned most of the city with only one enemy the law. His uncle was killed and he soon had to take over under the stipulation he had to marry so he would have an Heir to their empire but who but his old friend is all that came to mind. 

His best friend he left behind had gone to college to get her degree and be more successful than her parents. That was harder then she thought would ever be. She soon had two jobs and was struggling with college. 

What shall happen next when he walks into her life. 

**Crushing**

She just started her first internship. He parents wanted her to work at their Law firm but she wanted to work at a local Software company where the CEO was her age. Her intentions were pure but she never knew he would be so kind and sweet. What will the CEO when he receives a girl's doodles about her having a crush on him in the morning's meetings.

**Secrets**

He had been recruited out of highschool for a special assignment for the military but he had to leave his life behind Specifically because his parents had passed away when he was young and his aunt seemed to not care so much about what he did or didn't do. He had enough time that before he left he did something to his girlfriend to get him to hate him before he left. 

Now he's tired of the life and decided to come back home half expecting to find his girlfriend had moved on after 10 years but surprised to find her still single and a single mother of a 10-year old that if wasn't mistaken looked like him. 

Note I will listen to other plots. I know this isn't a lot of plots because I'm rebuilding from mine. 

**Friends with Benefits**

Muse A and Muse B met at a Gala filled with VPs. Both had a rough day at work and ended up in each other’s bed by the next morning. Though it didn’t stop there they began meeting for casual sex every moment after that at first it was a once a month need then it got to whenever they could get away but they kept secrets from one another. Muse A was twice Muse Bs age for one old enough to be Muse Bs father but that wasn’t all Muse A was a boss of one of the biggest Crime Organizations in the city and he was most of all Married to the mother of his two sons.

Muse B she didn’t deal with crime but she was an Heiress to a large fortune and the CEO to her own company and didn’t want the world to know she was having sex with an older man casually. She was his mistress she didn’t want gifts or things she just wanted his company and affection from time to time.

After a year of fooling around work gets tough for them but what makes it worse. muse b just found out she’s pregnant. She doesn’t know if she should keep it or confront Muse A


** Hurt ** 

He was a CEO of a company he built from the ground up. He had it all the cars the house and the wife. She was his high school sweetheart and he never once tried to do anything to hurt her. If she wanted something he bought it. If she wanted time at home he made it happen. Though the past year she’s been distant and finally he found out why. 

He was a mess finding out she was cheating but to make it worse she’s pregnant and he doesn’t know if it’s his because they have still been having sex too. 

His secretary has been watching him fall apart this unable to attend meeting or events for the company. The company should be falling apart just as he was but she stepped up to the plate. Kept the paparazzi away from him went to the event spoke in his meetings. She was doing his job for him while he try’s to find himself. A month was more then enough time but she knew the pain finding your spouse with someone else. So she decided to try to help. She planned to take him out somewhere to have fun. 

**Gift**

He was strong when his father had passed their race was considered weak slaves to humans. He began to change that when he became king making them regret. His soon became the Grand world Conquer. People feared him and his people. He got respect and his people lived a good life. ( you choose his race ) 

One day a troll merchant came in baring a gift from his hoard. A chained maiden her eyes that of amethyst and her hair darker then night. She had a power buried inside her that seemed to be locked away with the enchanted chain. “ Milord” he bowed pulling her forward forcing her to her knees. “ I being you a gift worthy for a king like yourself this women I present you is the last of her kind a Dragon that had ripped through the great city of Gradamir she landed in my hoards forest and we acquired her thinking she might be of use for you” "

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science. As part of my final year of study I'm required to complete a large project in the area of my choice. I've had experience working with logistic regression as an intern and I've worked with neural networks for personal projects and I've really enjoyed it so I wanted to complete a project in this area.

One area that has really interested me is using Convolutional Neural Networks. I've done some research and I'm really excited to work on a project in this area. 

The only issue I'm having is what ""problem"" to solve with a CNN. From my research, companies really like working with facial recognition so I've been thinking about something in this area. My ideas so far are:

* Person recognition - Recognise a person in an image, an output node for each person the network is trained to detect.  The application could be used for a secure method of accessing a system, tracking movement of people around a secure building etc.. 
* Mood detection - The CNN has an output node for each mood, the network will be able to predict the mood of the person in the input image. Although I'm not sure what this would be useful for... 
* Driver distraction detection - Predict whether a driver is paying attention to the road, sound an alarm if the driver looks away for too long

I'm struggling to think of any better applications of the software. If anyone has any ideas of what I could use this for I'd be very grateful!

Thanks in advance! "

ag2wil,2,2019-01-14,My [25M] spouse [24F] is leaving me after 9 years while I'm in grad school,Steak_Traps,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ag2wil/my_25m_spouse_24f_is_leaving_me_after_9_years/,"We have been together for 9 years, married 4. We are high school sweethearts and have been madly in love ever since. When I got out of high school I joined the National guard and I was gone twice for a total of 2 1/2 years while she finished high school and started her first year of college. She has graduated college recently and has a good job in the town where I'm going to school for my doctorate. We had just purchased our first home together and we have had plans of moving to Oregon after I finish school in 2020. We are both wanting to wait until our mid 30s to have children so we can travel and explore the world together. We have gone on several big trips since we got into college and have had a blast each time. Her family is basically the family I've always wanted and they love me like a son. I am not too close with my family due to their dysfunction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I went to Washington state to complete a 2 month internship that we both decided on so I could get my foot in the door in the PNW. While I was gone, our communication tanked and she stopped responding to my texts and calls like she normally did. She was spending late nights out with friends and I was happy that she was enjoying herself, but I had suspected that she was seeing someone else while I was away. Fast forward to when I come home, she is acting strange and is hiding her phone from me. I soon learn that she had an affair on me while I was gone that continued while I was home over winter break. I tried to work through the affair with her but she could never give me an answer on whether she wanted to keep trying or not. On new years, we decided that we should split up since she still didn't know what she wanted to do. She told me that she had been unhappy ever since I started trying to get into my 3 year doctoral program. I remember her telling me about her unhappiness and I always tried to work on things. Looking back, I have a hard time believing she was as unhappy as she said she was because we were always doing things together and making memories. This last summer was the best summer I can remember because it was just us, our three dogs, and our friends. We were always outside enjoying our time together whether it was cuddling in the grass or doing yoga in the park. Looking back I know we had our issues but I don't understand how we got to this point. Everyone in our life envied our relationship and I felt so lucky being with her.

&amp;#x200B;

So the last month has been very difficult for me...  I'm currently in school again full time with 20 credits in a medical program and I cannot seems to keep up because I cannot sleep and I am always distracted in class. I'm currently looking for a new place to stay and trying to figure out my finances since I now have to pay for my school out of pocket (my GI bill has been used up). She is currently staying with the other guy at his place and they have plans to move to Idaho this spring. We are both trying to be mutual about everything and fair. We plan on splitting everything 50/50. She is going to be taking over the mortgage since she has an income and plans to sell the house before she moves. We will then split the profits or losses 50/50. At this point, it seems like shes already moved on while I'm still here trying to move on but I want her back more then anything in the world. We have decided we want to remain friends since we have been best friends for 9 years. She says she still loves me but hasn't been in love with me for the last few years. She said she had the affair as a means of getting out of the relationship and didn't expect me to be as understanding and fight as hard as I did when I found out.

How to I move on from this? I've been reaching out to all my friends and am currently seeing a therapist. I have tried to be a single college guy for the first time in my life but I has blown up in my face. I have seen 3 women for hookups but each time I couldn't get an erection and completely embarrassed myself. I wasn't even interested in having sex to be honest, I really just enjoyed sleeping in the same bed as another woman since it felt so familiar. Now I'm too insecure to try to hook up with anyone. I'm also having a very difficult time keeping up with school because of my emotional state and all the things associated with the divorce. I'm trying to stay busy with school but I find myself just staring off while trying to do my work. I find myself drinking a lot more on the weekends with my friends and I am also having thoughts of suicide even though I have no desire to actually kill myself. Part of me is excited to be single for the first time and go explore the world, but it's hollow because I had already had these plans when I was with my wife. My dreams haven't changed and neither have my wife's. She still wants to explore the world, but not with me. I'm completely devastated and I'm terrified by the long road ahead. I'm afraid that I've going to be grieving for years to come because I had always seen my future with her. My biggest fear in life was that I would die before she did and that she would be alone and that I would never know how her story ends.  I just don't know what to do at this point. "
ag35v9,6,2019-01-14,"I am 25 years old and lost, be convinced to go the computers/programming route. I'm taking actions, but scared and overwhelmed at the moment. Feel like a tiny fish staring at an ocean of sharks. Hear me out?",niceloner10463484,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/ag35v9/i_am_25_years_old_and_lost_be_convinced_to_go_the/,"So I was diagnosed at 14. Parents tried to get me into computer science when I was applying to colleges, but I found 1-2 courses I took about computers in High school to be boring and pointless, never caught onto that stuff. They have CS backgrounds so that's also where some of the motivation came from.

So I decided to go for Engineering instead. 2 years into the degree I decided on Industrial Engineering, since I found the concept to be cool, heard the classes aren't too difficult, and there seems to be plenty of industries. I have found industrial engineering to be a HUGE mistake. After an internship, and a year at a job (this past year at a place where most of the workforce didn't speak English), I've just found that Industrial Engineering like jobs are at their core VERY people and management heavy. You have to sell the fact that you're trying to improve, like selling a car. I am not employed there anymore, it was a dysfunctional place and I never got my footing down. 

Now I am unemployed, living at home and really scared about what to do with my future, and just scared about if I'll ever make it in a professional line of work. At times I have seriously become suicidal in thought.

Due to my parents' backgrounds and them living in a Tech Hub, I've come to the idea (not spearheaded conclusion) that I could go the computers route, but it all feels like a Maze right now.

I have taken Course-era courses on SQL and python, some new excel courses, and currently taking one called Programming Foundations with CSS, HTML, JS. 

I am also considering getting an MS in software engineering at a local commuter university, though I will have to take pre-reqs. Right now, I read so many of these stories of self taught people, or people who make career changes and this is where the 'fish in the ocean of sharks' feeling comes in:

They ALL (including ppl on this sub) talk about how they did this stuff for fun since middle or high school, all these technical programmer/dev terms of platforms, portfolios, creative ideas, etc etc. And how they pretty much went at it like med school while working FT that type of intensity. I have NO clue where to start, at all. 

My father does have one idea, I'll start working with him on that. 

But the imposter syndrome I feel going into this is TERRIFYING. And could induce lots of panic attacks and tears. See even right now I am rambling and dunno where the direction my thoughts are going as I am typing this. I just want a career that has less chance of interaction related disasters like I've had so far (i also worked in car sales in college for 2 months, yes that was horrible). So far outside of part time fast food work my life's work history has been filled with places I had no clue wtf I'm doing, due to my lack of relation iq, emotional eq skills, knowing how to get through work with lots of ambiguous instructions, etc. 

SO MANY things on the internet and IRL say that this is the direction for people like me, that i'll make good money and have a WELL DEFINED daily task at hand, and that I can eventually move elsewhere in the country for work (I anticipate I'll be living at home for quite some time).

IDK if I covered everything going through my head in this rant, I'm simply reaching out for advice of people perhaps have gone through similar situations. I know, I know the internet is saturated with so many 'self taught, passionate about it since my teens' type stories. It's saturated with that info, which further adds to my ""IDK where to start"" mindset, that frankly I've rambled on about for too long now. OK i'll stop.:-/ Thanks for reading all this :)

FYI: this is the first 'website' I created, check it out: https://codepen.io/lostyoungen/pen/VqVWqR

PS: I have looked into going to meetups for the sake of networking and meeting others. What sorts of experience do you have with that, that you'd like to share?"

Sneaking your hand into mine when we’re walking or at the movies 

Surprising me with kisses

Taking pictures of me and you hyping me up 

Telling me I’m beautiful everyday even when you don’t see me (“I don’t have to see you to know you’re looking beautiful”) 

How much you care for me and make sure I’m okay

Whispering how much you love me or how adorable I am when you think I’m asleep 

I could keep going, but the list is ever lasting. 

I love you so much, darling.

My boss invited me to join him on to a conference in Las Vegas.  I am just an intern at the company but was thrilled to go.   Once we got to our hotel  room we settled in and my boss just came out and asked me to suck his cock.   I sort of asked him what and he gave me that what his wife didn't know would hurt anyone and then he basically said he knew we where going to have a good week.  Needless to say I did end up blowing him and we did have a good week.

This class is generally 5-8 students with business and IT majors working together with local small business owners on projects that they have submitted to us or that we bring up as options. 

Still wanting to try to work with this realty company I've set up a meeting with the owner to talk about project options he might want help with. This can be anything from setting his company up with better marketing materials, to creating an organizational structure, or planning for scalability. The only limiting factors are that it needs to be able to be done within a semester (roughly 15 weeks).

But next week I start the job. I plan on keeping my head down and being determined and focused. Totally focusing on my self and the job. Will go to the gym with the same tenacity.

I want to do this for myself. And not just her because I don’t know if she’ll be there when I get back.

I just started an internship  at x company and they learned that over the summer I would be interning at y company and company x wants me to sign a non-compete (after already signing an NDA) which would prevent me from working at company y over the summer. Company x and y are direct competitors which is why they want me to sign non compete.

I’m not sure what to do.

What questions I should ask?
Are there repercussions for not signing a non-compete even after signing a NDA?
Why is it necessary to sign an NDA and non compete? 

It feels pretty shitty working my ass off to find a summer internship to have this happen. ☹️


Clarification: I wasn’t asked to sign a non compete when I first started working — just a NDA

I have taken an interest in programming and am about halfway through MIT's Intro to Computer Science with Python course, as well as having taken a VERY small glance into the world of C++. I would like to create some sort of space-related project once I am done with the course.  I have done a bit of googling to see if it is possible to simulate satellite orbits using Python, but it seems that I do not yet have the mathematics/physics experience necessary to understand the ins-and-outs of satellite orbits.

I figured it wouldn't hurt to come here and ask you guys for some suggestions in regard to what type of program I could write in Python or C++ that would do something related to spaceflight or aerospace in general.

###Introduction

---
---

With Taiwan's economy performing exceptionally well after currency reform, and the removal of labor barriers for entry into both markets on both sides, the Office of Trans-Strait Affairs is prepared for the next move. Chinese and Taiwanese banks now operate on both sides, and are able to provide mortgages, business loans, contributing to an increase in business performance. The OTSA has looked at what feeds the economy on both side of the straits, and the ultimate rallying cry for every politician known to man: *Better Education, Better Jobs!*, but how? When investigating the circumstances on both sides of the strait, the OTSA found alarming problems in the Taiwan labor market and educational field, and has moved to resolve this issues. [Appropriate wages for graduates in Taiwan](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-youth-struggle-to-find-well-paying-jobs) is still extremely scarce. This has made it harder and harder to match the wage demands by new graduates in local Taiwan companies, but why? While Taiwan offers its people a very affordable higher education, the long term costs to their economy have become apparent. It has lead to the gradual [over-education crisis in Taiwan](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/fears-over-over-education-in-taiwan/news-story/aeae2a2d83898f684fd0ac5aaffd5816). Many graduates are leaving university without an internship, a job, or good proficiency in English. While other Asian nations [have moved to ban internships for Taiwanese students and graduates](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190107175952304), the graduates have been left confused with no other place to turn to but unemployment, while the government struggles to compete with the massive output of graduates. Many experts have cited the [over-education issue forming](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/world-view/higher-education-crisis-taiwan) overtime, and the resolution has eluded them for a long time. Students have resorted to taking jobs they feel undervalued in, and underpaid, which has fueled [massive job dissatisfaction in 90% of the workforce](http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201901140019.aspx). Others have [looked to the mainland for further education](http://time.com/4906162/taiwan-brain-drain-youth-china-jobs-economy/), and [employment opportunities over the years](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/taiwan-battles-a-brain-drain-as-china-aims-to-woo-young-talent-away/2018/04/13/338d096e-3940-11e8-af3c-2123715f78df_story.html?utm_term=.0cb9388cb84e) to provide for themselves and their budding families. Who could blame them? After China [removed required work permits for Taiwan residents to work in China](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-work-permits-no-longer-needed-taiwan-hong-kong-macau-residents/), the appeal has been stronger than ever while the Legislative Yuan stagnates. However, the OTSA sees a better option to fix the employment and over-education issue. The OTSA feels that a mutually beneficial education and employment reform on both sides would contribute to resolving this situation, leading to popularity from the mainland's maneuvers.

###Books

---
---

Moving in the same direction that the mainland took with the currency and economy reform with Taiwan in recent years, the OTSA has proposed a formal union of the two Ministries of Education into a greater Ministry of National Education, and falling below it, the Taiwan Ministry of Education. However to make such a bid attractive to both sides, both sides will have to make sacrifices. To do so, the OTSA has analyzed both education systems and has proposed this as the operating system in both Taiwan and the mainland:

**The Ministry of National Education Plan**

*As Proposed by the Office of Trans-Strait Relations in 2028*

*Foreword: The objective to provide a competitive education, and cultural understanding for all Chinese peoples.*

This proposal has been split into several articles as follows:

* Article I: Term Dates
* Article II: Age-Grade Structure
* Article III: Curriculum by Grade
* Article IV: Requirements of Teachers
* Article V: Student Health
* Article VI: Internships
* Article VII: Recognition of Education


**Article I: Term Dates**

In China, the school year is divided into two terms. The first term usually runs from the first Monday in March, to mid-July with the summer vacation from mid-July to late-August (elementary and secondary schools) and from mid-June to late August (higher education institutions). The second term usually resumes in late August and runs until mid-February. The winter break is from late December to late January. There are two weeks of school (elementary and secondary schools) in February. Then there is a two-week-break before the new academic year starts in March.

Classes Schedule By Institution

Institution | Times | Class Length
--- | --- | ---
High-School | 8:00am to 4:00 pm | 50 Minutes
Middle-School | 8:00am to 3:30pm | 45 Minutes
Low Primary School (1-3) | 8:30 am to 2:00 pm | 40 Minutes
High Primary School (4-6) | 9:00 am to 3:00 pm | 40 Minutes

High-Schools can hold teacher-rotational, non-mandatory study hours until 9:00pm.
School under no circumstances, will be held on Saturdays.

**Article II: Age-Grade Structure**

Institution | Level/Grade | Typical Ages
--- | --- | ---
Nursery School  | N/A | 0-3
Kindergarten  | N/A | 4-6
Primary School | 1st | 7
Primary School | 2nd | 8
Primary School | 3rd | 9
Primary School | 4th | 10
Primary School | 5th | 11
Primary School | 6th | 12
Middle School | 7th | 13
Middle School | 8th | 14
Middle School | 9th | 15
High-School | 10th | 16
High-School | 11th | 17
High-School | 12th | 18
College/University | N/A | Ages vary, 4 years in total


**Article III: Curriculum by Grade**

* Kindergarten: Necessary Skills, Reading and Writing, Manners, Mandarin Chinese (4 elements of language), Early English (4 elements of language)

* Pre-Grade 1 Entrance Examination: Behavioral Interviews

* Grades 1-2: Math, Mandarin Chinese (4 elements of lang), My Chinese Family (Learning, living, and elements of Chinese Culture), Fine Arts of Young Chinese (Reading, Writing, Dancing, Singing, Art)

* Grades 3-6: Math, Mandarin Chinese, English, Science, Social Studies, Ancient Chinese History, Physical Education, Music, Politics in China (History of CPC and KMT)

* Pre-Middle School Entrance Examination: Math, Chinese, English (or Japanese), Science, Social Studies

* Grades 7-9: Mandarin, English (or Japanese), Science, Math, Social Studies, Physical Education, Music (Core), Programming, Communist Party/KMT History, Technology Applications, Chinese Culture, Economics, Robotics, Painting, Calligraphy, Ceramics (Extr.)

* Pre-High-School Entrance Examination:  Mandarin, English (or Japanese), Science, Math, Social Studies

* Grades 10-12: Mandarin, English (or Japanese), Science (2 years), Math, Higher Topics in Chinese Politics (1 year), World History (1 Term), Post Empirical History (1 Term), Technology and Programming Basics (2 Years), Chinese Culture (Core), Cooking, Raising a Family/Sex Education, Sino-Asian Relations and History, Medical Science, Veterinary Science, Aviation (Extr.) (Self-Study Hours by Choice)

* **Note about High-Schools:** Depending on interests, students can test into Science Schools, Foreign Language Schools, International, and Art Specialty Schools.

* College Entrance Examination (Gaokao): Mandarin, English (or Japanese), Math, Science, Chinese Politics and History, World History, Programming Basics, and two electives of choice

* College/University: Varies by School, will remain completely covered by the Ministry of National Education.

* Optional Military School/University: *Classified*

The College Entrance Exam is the most important exam in the Chinese education curriculum. This has lead to the popular demand for Self-Study Hours to improve chances to get into a prestigious school.

**Article IV: Requirements of Teachers**

The Ministry of National Education is responsible for carrying out this proposal, providing certificates, examinations, and the hiring of teachers. The qualifications are largely up to the Ministry of National Education, but the bottom line is to have a strong Academic Background (at least a Bachelor's Degree), and a certification. Teachers will meet a two-year tenure requirement before offering the full contract.

**Article V: Student Health**

By majority concern, Sexual education is provided beginning in the 10th grade, but can be opted out of. No grade is given in this course, and Electing to not take the course will not penalize the student in any way. The schools will be provided with a proportional amount of nurses and one doctor on staff, as deemed necessary by the school. Internet will be guaranteed to all schools, for the sake of student utilization and school management, with unrestricted access, unless instated by the institution. A school uniform is also nationally required, consisting of from Kindergarten to High School: navy blue pants and white button-up shirt for boys with a red scarf worn below the collar, hangs from the back and tied up front. Girls will wear a navy blue skirt, at the shortest two and a half hands above the knee, a white button up shirt with a red scarf worn below the collar, hangs from the back and tied up front. Boys will wear black dress shoes. Girls can wear black dress shoes, or black heels. The school will provide adequate physical activity wear as needed. Girls' hair cannot be worn any longer than midway down the students back, and Boy's hair cannot be longer than is acceptable by the school administration. No piercings or tattoos will show, except two ear-piercings for females, and a single piercing in the nose mouth region. 

Mental health is also a growing concern, and amends can be made at a needs basis via a request from the school doctor, conditional on the approval of the Ministry of National Education.

All Students, starting in 3rd Grade, until graduation from High School are able to elect to be a member of the Young Communists, a childhood subsidiary to the Communist Party of China. The students will not be forced to join, and must be their own personal choice. They can choose to leave it at any time without repercussions.

**Article VI: Internships**

At any point in time from High-School graduation, students can begin to search for internship opportunities that best suit their interests and future demands. Students will not be limited to internships in their geographical region and can cross the strait at their own desire, or go abroad. These internships are required to be paid *and* provide the student with university credit if they are a student during the internship. To increase the flow across the straits on all educational matters, including internships, there will no longer be a required student or work visa between Taiwan and China.

**Article VII: Recognition of Education**

On both sides of the straits, the certificates of education are considered entirely equivalent and will not be required to be checked for equivalency. As of March 1st 2028, all mainland and Taiwan education documents are considered fully and entirely equivalent. A student cannot be denied employment across the straits due to the origination of their education, given it being either on the mainland or Taiwan.

---

###Jobs

---
---

The OTSA has proposed the free flow of business and jobs to complement the education reform. This will allow students, graduates, or prospective employees on both sides of the strait to move freely between the two when seeking changes to their lives. This means that students, workers, and the sort cannot be stopped and required a visa if they originate from either side of the straits. They cannot be denied employment or education due to their location of origination. Taxing on income made on either side, regardless of the companies origination, will be uniform under tax laws, and currently states that taxable income is at 35%.

---

###Reception

---
---

On both sides of the straits, the education reform, and the short job reform will remove extensive pain-points in the freedom of education, and employment. This will mean that over-educated Taiwan residents can continue their studies or seek employment on the mainland. Mainland students and workers can move to Taiwan to work or study that will boost Taiwan's internal education infrastructure and give it a sharp financial boost. Ideological studies have been completely removed from mandatory education, and if is mandatory is required to explain both sides of the issue equally. This will help diffuse a lot of the political tensions for the coming generations and promote a new reformist society that President Xi seeks to create. In the long-term this will decrease hostilities exponentially and promote a unitary identity between the mainland and Taiwan. The new STEM-focused education will help fuel the economy while the options of arts will provide all students the opportunity for their personal values to flourish. All entrance examinations will be standardized under one system to prevent confusion. Educational uniform policies have been standardized rather than the split uniform system that currently exists. Students will now have on campus doctors, nurses, therapists, counselors and other resources to help them through growing stages in life, and with self-identity and ultimately dream realization. This action and standardization of educational policy will likely provide a big push to unity from the younger generations as this aims to specifically solve their problems the government has been ignoring for years. Over-Education can finally seek other venues for employment and opportunities, younger students still in education will have new choices for classes and a new amount of faculty support to assist them in the years to come. High-School education has been tailored more to STEM and the career interests of the students that does also include the appreciation for arts that Chinese culture thrives from. Ultimately, this will make students and younger generations on both sides of the straits more prospective for their futures, and feel they have the support to accomplish their desires. Classes for cooking, and family studies have been added to help the students make logical and educated choices in their future, while teaching them necessary realities of life. Maoism, except for unbias discussion has been entirely removed from the education system due to its propagandist nature, and tendency to discount events during the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution and underplay the disadvantages experienced during the era. This will create a more balanced education system where students are more open to speaking their mind and feeling they have a choice about internal issues, which ultimately leads to the creation of good citizens, and good families. A healthy understanding is the best understanding.

ag5mnt,58,2019-01-15,Lektionen der Gehaltsentwicklung bei IG Metall Firma,finanzen34,Finanzen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finanzen/comments/ag5mnt/lektionen_der_gehaltsentwicklung_bei_ig_metall/,"Da gestern wieder ein Thema zu IG Metall Gehaltsthemen auftauchte, möchte ich meine Erfahrungen der letzten paar Jahre mit euch teilen damit ihr nicht die selben Fehler begeht. Außerdem würde mich interessieren, ob diese inoffizielle Regelung der Gehaltsentwicklung für sämtliche IG Metall Firmen existieren oder das nur ein Einzelfall sind.

Zu mir, Ingenieur-Masterabschluss, langjähriger Werkstudent in München, Direkteinstieg IT in München mit EG9 in ein Förderprogramm mit guten Schulungen (Teambuilding, Projektmanagement, Projektleitung, etc). Einstieg war durchaus unter Wert, allerdings haben die Inhalte des Programms das gerechtfertigt. In den zwei Jahren habe ich gemerkt, dass das Feld in dem ich arbeite durchaus vom Fachkräftemangel betroffen ist, da Stellen mit AT Gehältern ausgeschrieben wurden, aber nicht besetzt werden konnten. Desweiteren sind 90% der direkten Kollegen ATler. 

Zum Abschluss des Förderprogramms gab's die EG10A für alle Teilnehmer. Anschließend habe ich mich intern beworben auf diverse offene Stellen welche AT bzw. EG12 ausgeschrieben waren. Da ich gut vernetzt bin kannte ich die meisten Chefs auch, so dass mir von denen auch signalisiert wurde, dass sie mich auf den Posten sehen. Allerdings habe ich an diversen Ecken schon gesagt bekommen, dass meine Eingruppierung (EG10) Probleme machen könnte.

Als eine passende Stelle gefunden wurde, ging es in die Details. Bei der Ansprache vom Gehalt meinte der Chef ganz offen, dass sie Geld bis EG12 haben, allerdings EG Sprünge bei der HR nicht machbar sind. Deswegen peilt er die 11 an und über eine Neubewertung dann die 12 nach 3 Monaten. So weit so gut dachte ich mir, dann machen wir das so.

Der Zeitpunkt der Versetzung rückte näher, so dass er mir dann in der Woche vor der Versetzung mitteilte, dass die HR einen Wechsel zur 11 nicht zulässt, da ich erst vor einem Monat in die 10 gewechselt bin. Deswegen können sie mich nur mit der 10 aufnehmen und dann nach 3 Monaten gehaltsneutral unter Wegfall meiner Leistungszulage in die 11 stufen. Man bedenke, die Stelle ist immer noch die selbe, sie ist EG 12 eingestuft und ich erfülle alle Anforderungen.

Mein erster Fehler war, darauf vertraut zu haben, dass die vereinbarten Sachen so umgesetzt werden wie besprochen und per Mail bestätigt. 

Mein zweiter Fehler war, mich in Zugzwang setzen zu lassen. Da ich mich versetzen lassen musste konnte ich nicht nachverhandeln.

Nach der Versetzung habe ich mich direkt mit der HR zusammen gesetzt. Ich legte meine Argumente dar und fragte nach den Hintergründen, welche eine Hochstufung verhinderten. Die sehr dreiste aber doch offene Antwort war: Wenn ich von extern gekommen wäre, hätte ich direkt die EG12 bekommen, aber intern gibt es eine Absprache zwischen den HR Abteilungen, dass es keine Sprünge von EG Stufen gibt. Dazu muss man die Firma verlassen.
Das wollte man mir natürlich in keinem Fall schriftlich geben. 
Dass eine HR die Fachabteilungen so zur Geißel nimmt war mir nicht bewusst.

**Fazit:**
Wenn ihr als Berufseinsteiger in eine Firma geht, dann macht euch klar, dass ihr eure gehaltliche Entwicklung maßgeblich durch euer Einstiegsgehalt bestimmt und ihr später fast keinen Handlungsspielraum habt. Förderprogramme von Firmen sind meist ein guter Weg Hochschul-Absolventen anzulocken. Für Bachelorabsolventen OK, Masterabsolventen verkaufen sich unter Wert.

Ist eine solche HR Politik ein Einzelfall?

I am looking for a detailed female rp with little to no limits for an abusive roleplay including domination from my side. The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)The wrath of a God: This one is a bit more creative and will take place in ancient Egypt. Your character can be Cleopatra, or any other persone you would like who is celebrated for her beauty. However, this beauty was a gift from the God Anubis, in order to spread his word. But since you used your beauty to be wrongfully know as a God, you will have to fave punishment 

4)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

5)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

6)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo"
ag5rg5,1,2019-01-15,[M4A Playing F] The Multiple prompt list. Something for everyone! I hope.. (Multiple prompts) (Open prompts) (Light or dark) (Very long!),Soapydopey69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ag5rg5/m4a_playing_f_the_multiple_prompt_list_something/,"Hey people of DPP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**Outercourse:** Lap dances, tittyfucking, handjobs, assjobs, pussyjobs.. You name it and it can happen! Maybe you're a concerned friend or a professional dancer that just can't help make me cum but something is stopping you from having full on sex with me!

This RP can be played in the nude or with some over the clothes fun! Think of a tittyfuck in a bikini, or an assjob in a pair of leggings!

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Tight clothing, CFNM with outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**The threesome with the two sisters:** **(Major bonus points for this one)** It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with D over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

**Others:** Free use, throat fucking, breeding, public stuff, raceplay. Literally anything. Message me with your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me. Mixing up multiple prompts is also very welcome :)

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary and BONUS points if you let me choose your character)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes.."
ag5rwv,20,2019-01-15,The value of making decision and not being afraid to own up to mistakes,ratzy88,Adulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/ag5rwv/the_value_of_making_decision_and_not_being_afraid/,"TLDR: each choice you make will have consequences. It’s better to take time and weigh the outcomes of the choices before making a final decision. 

Being upfront and honest especially about mistakes saves everyone involved time (maybe money as well)

So today after I saw on a Linkdin that a college classmate is an intern pro scout for the Arizona Coyotes, I relooked at decision I have made in my life

To fully understand the story we have to go back to grade 11 where I dropped U math (I’m Canadian) because I didn’t like the work I needed to put in (missed a shit load of grade 10 math class). This became the start of my terrible decisions and the reason for me to quit on things

Flash forward; I rushed into University (for business). Thinking of business class was cool in high school I love it. That was not the case. More research would have shown me that. Do to my parents putting an importance of school (both a blessing and a curse) I was terrified to tell them after the first semester I didn’t like it and wanted to leave. So I wasted both their money and my time doing another semester where I dropped 4/6 courses. 

That one year  would have been very different had I done 1 of 2 things: looked into school and realized I hate business or owned my mistake and talked to my parents about hating school after first semester

Over the summer I again I rushed into school. This time I go to school an hour away from my hometown (I go to school in Toronto for sports management). Honestly I am depressed. Having to leave to come back to my school house every Sunday at 7pm it’s a fucking sad thing. Just because I said “I didn’t like my first business program so a 3 year supply chain management program at the same school I did business at (legit 20 minutes from my house) would suck compared to sports management an hour away. 

This is just my school decisions but that I have learned is never ever rush a decision. If you have the option to take time and think about it. (Even an hour is a good amount of time) do it. Had I taken time I wouldn’t have spent a year wasting time and money or being depressed for 3 years as opposed to mediocre for 3 years. 

Now let’s talk financially and how IMPORTANT FINANCIAL LITERACY IS

so this started last year where towards the end of the school year I could only pay off part of credit card bill. All through September I knew I would need to work (at my dads factory) during the school year (not a fan of it, as we learned when I dropped grade 11 U math). So first semester goes by with me saying (everything will work out in the end. It always does). Ya it never does. Come winter break where I had to work 2 full weeks of my 4 week break and spent another week for surgery (fuck groin hernia). What was suppose to be a delightful relaxing break turned into the start of hell for me (thanks gambling problem). And it became worse as I replaced and spent $1300 (that I didn’t have and charged in to my credit card bill that will be due in Feb). So now I have the amazing opportunity to work 24 hours at my dads place (every week in Jan then 16 every week starting in Feb until the end of March) and with this work, I also get to do an unpaid 250 hour internship for school this semester (another 20 hours a week at a ski hill) then you get to factor in annoying group work and class. Oh what fun hell is. 

So the importance of financial decision is (at least for me) just because you can spend money on something you think you want (for me it was micro transactions is video games) doesn’t mean you should. 100% you are better off waiting some time to decide it it’s the best idea. 

So the importance of decision making. Take time to consider the positive of decision of the choices. Whatever choice you make will have an impact on your life, mostly likely one of the choices will be more negative than the other choice. 

As for the importance of owning your mistakes. It’s much better to be up front and honest and admit your mistake than you wait until it is forced out. You will save everyone involved time (and money)


Feel free to add the time I completely destroyed a great friendship of mine over jealousy on here to my list of regrets (I have). It started after my baseball game and she texted me about her new boyfriend (me being impulsive and irrational) replied with an offensive term (slut)! She got mad told me not to talk to her again. I waited a week. Her still being mad I dug the whole even deeper by being a huge not ok douche (I lied about being terminally ill) which work until I felt bad and came clean a week later. Making a small hole a larger hole. Then I did more stuff such as harass her (luckily she never pressed charges. Thank god!) and make this now large hole into a fucking colossal pit. (Btw this was when I was in grade 10, I’m now 4 year of college or 22 in 2019). I message her last year as I do every quarter to try and make admen’s she responded with “me being a complete psychopath and lying to her about everything. 


So if we chalk that friend situation on the decision making board. Waiting after my ball game before deciding how to respond to her texting me about her new bf would have definitely saved our friendship instead I made my decision immediately and have been paying the consequences of it ever since

So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

I enjoy playing Futa but only if your character is female. This is important! If you're curious, I tend to play a more 'realistic' character and by that I mean one that isn't HH cup breasts, an ass as big as the earth and a cock the size of the empire state!

My preference of character is one that looks like Jenna Mcdougall (I'm aware she's a celeb, but I'm only using her looks not her status). If you don't know what she looks like, I recommend you google her, she's a petite blonde that should be okay for our RP. If you have a suggestion yourself about a 'natural' looking girl, let me know!

And if you're after a 'Surprise I'm futa!' Scene aswell, this can be incorporated if necessary.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**The threesome with the two sisters:** It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister.

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D and C [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with Demi over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night in. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** **(I'm unsure what ageplay we could use for this one, but if you have an idea please shoot it my way)** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me.

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes;)"

I am a dual Canadian-US citizen and I'd like to apply for an internship at rocket lab and I had a couple questions:

1. I looked on the website and I can't find any postings for internships? It seems like all of the positions are full-time, can someone redirect me to the summer 2019 applications?

2. Has anyone here interned there before? What is it like?

3. What are they looking for in an intern? All of my experience is in software engineering (degree and previous internships) and I was wondering if they accept software engineering interns.

Thanks in advance!"

Ethical hacking is also known as penetration testing, intrusion testing is used to find the loopholes in an IT system and break into it. An ethical hacker is a computer and a network expert who attacks a security system on behalf of his owners, seeking vulnerabilities that a malicious hacker could exploit.

This work is ethical because it is performed to increase the safety of the computer systems, but only at the request of the company that owns the system and specifically to prevent others from attacking it. With the increasing use of the internet, it has become an important part of the IT security industry today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/16kthaa6zja21.jpg

**Industry status**

With internet use mounting worldwide and cyber crimes increased as well, ethical hackers have become an integral workforce of any IT security industry today. Last year ethical hacking was estimated to be a US $ 3.8 billion industry in the US alone. According to Nasscom, India will require at least 77000 ethical hackers every year whereas we are producing only 15000 in a year, currently. [**Ethical hacking is growing at a tremendously and offers a lucrative job opportunity in India**](https://www.livewireindia.com/ethical_hacking_training.php). Hence, the scope for a fresher is lucrative not only in India but globally.

**Growth areas**

[**The information security industry in India**](https://www.livewireindia.com/ethical_hacking_training.php) is going at a current worldwide growth rate of 21%. There are 2.8 million Information security professionals in worldwide which is expected to increase to nearly 4.2 million. The need for information security for security compliances in India is mandatory for all companies with an IT backbone. The requirement for such personnel is especially high with organizations in the IT/ITES space.

A fresher may work as an intern for a couple of months and can start with a minimum of ₹2.5 lakh per annum. With one year of experience, one can expect up to ₹4.5 lakh per annum. Those with work experience five years or more can rake in anything between ₹10-12 lakh per annum.  
 

The various roles in which an ethical hacker can work in a company are:  
 1. [**Network Security System Administrator/Manager**](https://www.livewireindia.com/ethical_hacking_training.php)  
 2.  Security Investigator  
 3.  Network Security Engineer  
 4.  Systems/Applications Security Executive  
 5.  Web security Administrator/Manager

ag7til,6,2019-01-15,"She's an amazing girl(22), but i (M22) can't bring up the effort anymore, and i don't know if i want too.",SubjectHelp,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ag7til/shes_an_amazing_girl22_but_i_m22_cant_bring_up/,"Also, this is a throwaway account, because some of my friends, and hers, browse reddit and know my profile.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start of by saying this, we've been together for almost 3 years, and it started great. We met in college (and we still attend college). She looked like the perfect girl for me, and i really wanted to move further in life together with her. But around 6 months in, she got very depressed, i tried my hardest to get her moods up, but the world didn''t seem to agree, she failed her classes (even though she knows more about some subjects than me, who passed them), her grandfather died, her dog got very sick... And to top it al off, she had to get on meds to regulate her serotonin levels because something, somewhere got screwed up. (she attributed it to a fall she made while horse riding, this is important later) I supported her through all of this, as this was the first relationship i really wanted to last, i've dated 2 girls before, but i was her first relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

We had nights she slept over, and just got angry for no reason, she just started flipping out, she apologised to me everytime, and i knew it wasn't personal, that i was just the only one who had the time to listen to her, and so she just let it all come at once. When it happened at her house, i understood, her parents were very demanding, but not rational in their demands (go to the store to pick up groceries, but don't use the car because i MIGHT need it, even though their grocery list required at least a car, if not a semi). But when she was at my house, she got angry for the smallest reason, not right away, but when we went to bed that night, i knew i would be up untill 2am just to get her to calm down.

&amp;#x200B;

This went on for a few months, untill i couldn't really take it anymore, and i decided to put our relationship on hold whilst i recovered my energy during the summer (our second summer together)  (we live an hour train drive from each other, which for some reason tired my out every time i went over). I spent the summer working at a local restaurant and was happy to do some mindless labour. She went on a vacation with her best friend (F) and really worked on herself. In september that year, we decided to meet up and see of the relationship was worth continuing, and we did.

&amp;#x200B;

It all went fine for some time, untill she started really tiring me out. I tried to do stuff for her, but it was always 'not enough'. She stopped her riding classes, because she couldn't afford them anymore, some time later she stopped her dancing activity (all the girls there treated her like an outsider, and i've met them... not a happy bunch). So i was happy and sad, sad for her horse riding, happy for her that she stopped meeting those B-words.  


The nights were she got angry came back too, she wanted to be herself again from before she fell of that horse. She felt like everything went to shit after she fell. but she couldn't really tell what was different with who she was now. It really tired me out. It got to the point where i just couldn't stand being with her for extended periods of time, because i dreaded the moment she would break, and blame most of the stuff on herself, and then on me that i didn't do enough for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

My birthday and hers aren't that far apart. I wen't over to her to celebrate hers. But when mine came around the corner, i just couldn't. I'm not a party person in general. My birthdays are preferably calm, just me, some friends and a beer is more than enough. She always celebrated them with decoration and stuff, which i didn't mind, her birthday is her thing right? But she nagged me about going to her place so we could celebrate together, i just couldn't bring myself to saying i didn't want too... She was having such a hard time outside of that. I got kinda scared of doing anything wrong.

The entire day was just spend stressing out and having a generally bad day. The last 45 minutes before my train left on the day of my birthday i cracked... I broke down and asked my mom to call her and say i'm sick. Instead of the answer ""oh no, hope he gets better"" i get: ""Why doesn't he come?"" in an angry tone. (these were my mothers words, she wants the best for me, but i kind off accuse her not approving the relationship after we had our first pause, and working behind the scenes is nothing she wouldn't really do, because it think she has a hard time letting me go)

&amp;#x200B;

This didn't made me feel any better.

&amp;#x200B;

June comes around, and we study for our finals, i pass some, she passes some,  i went back to the same restaurant again, the first month of summer but i felt a gnawing feeling that i wouldn't problaby hold on much longer. the second month i went over to study at her place, she lives much closer to college than me,. We spent some time together, some studying, some doing other stuff. She got her results back from college and she didn't pass the one class she REALLY wanted too (the one i passed earlier) and all her dreams of doing her internship abroad were thrown out of the window. I got my internship approved, but she told me she tried to be happy for me but she couldn't really because she felt like she had failed.

&amp;#x200B;

I smell the thunderstorm coming, and decide to do a last ditch effort to get her mood reset before the schoolyear starts again. I plan a trip abroad (citytrip, 4 days, one of her nieces lives there and it was a fun surprise visit). She spent almost the entire trip, not mad, but very cold and distant, she had her moments, but it felt awkward sometimes. On the trip back she looked very frustrated, which made me very frustrated because of all the effort that went in to planning this trip. And at the end of our journey, she got on my nerves, i politely asked her to stop doing what she was doing, and she got angry and didn't speak to me untill we were back home.

&amp;#x200B;

The schoolyear starts again, and it goes up and down between us, i try to get through but it doesn't help. One day she isn't in class, and ask her were she was when i met her at lunch, she gets angry and just straight up leaves. One of her friends gives me THAT look, and i decide to follow her. She goes on a rant that i didn't call her to see where she was (she has a habbit of being late, so i just assumed that) and that she wouldn't be missed anyway if she were to kill herself. I called the suicide hotline but there wasn't anyone available at the moment. I skipped my class to calm her down and went and got her something to drink at a local café. I think that is the moment i knew i had to end it, but i couldn't. what if i pushed her over the edge by doing that (she told me somtimes i was the only thing she lived for --&gt; not healthy, i know).

&amp;#x200B;

Christmas planning starts, and in my family we have a tradition, christmas eve is spent with our family (Me, mom, stepdad and siblings) but her parents decided that they were going to celebrate on the same day. Which obviously led to a big argument where i couldn't really pick a side, my mom got angry at me, and my GF got angry at me. My stepdad, even though he rarely said anything important, told me he supported whatever decision i made (i think he knew i would brake up).

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks before christmas, i couldn't handle it, and went on a rant towards her were i told her how i felt, and that she would just need to become someone she wanted, and not get angry she couldn't be someone form the past. I was about to break up, when i find out i couldn't, something made me take pity on her and i just left, told her it would be okay. A week later, stuff hadn't changed, but i was tired and i was getting hopeless for change.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with her (some pushing from my family gave me the courage) i was devestated, she too. She stopped by all my classes to talk to me, and to be completely honest, i felt weak and thin. I just wanted it to stop, but i made it worse. I didn't sleep because of the stress. So a week later, we talked and i decided to give it one last try.

Christmas break came, and we decided to keep it a secret, as to not get to much attention. I tried to study, she tried to, and we spent the holidays apart. My first exam came, i wished her good luck, went back home to study for the next (i only had 2 days in between). My second came yesterday, and i flopped it. I came out of the classroom and she was sitting there, waiting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

We talked a bit, one of her friends was there too. Her friend went home, and we decided to get a drink, she felt distant and cold, and i knew i was in for a lecture. She explained ot me how i felt like a chain, and she had some friends over during the holidays, and talked with them. She became jealous of their relationship and sex-lives (ours went down the drain since the citytrip, a little bit before that, because she didn't feel like it everytime, she had no libido) because her libido had finally shown up. She had changed her hair (which i liked a lot, she looks a lot more like herself now). She told me she felt like i was a chain holding her, and she wanted to know if i was about to be more than a ghost (TBF, i didn't text a whole lot because these were supposed to be my final finals ever). She got mad i planned my internship without her, she got sad everytime i mentioned it before, and it's the first big thing that i'm capable of doing myself, so of course i planned it without her.

&amp;#x200B;

She started about how she finally saw that the reason our relationship was so bad, was not her, but me, and my lack of ambition and energy. And that she had been getting some fantasys about other men ( i don't judge, as long as it's only fantasy i don't really care) because i didn't invoke lust in her anymore. She then went on about me having to fight for her if i wanted to keep her, as she felt herself love me less and less. (it hurt). and how good of a deal i would be wasting if i let her go, and that it was my final shot. I broke down, partly due the stress of just having flunked a very important exam, partly due to being sleep deprived, and partly due to her. i'm not ashamed admitting i cried.

&amp;#x200B;

She went on about how, with her looks, she could easily get a new BF while i was away during my internship, and that she wanted to know if i wanted to fight for her, because otherwise 'those 11 weeks would be wasted"". This is all coming from a girl that refused to have sex, and had no libido 6 weeks prior. Which hurt me too. It gave me the feeling i'm not good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I left and asked her if she still loved me, and she said a little. She didn't love me enough to trust me anymore, and she told me explicitly 'trust does not go away in one go, you've been losing my trust for a very long time'. I haven't broke her trust once, and 'ive always tried to be there when she was down. So no need in saying that one hurt as wel.

We had tried something new and sent some explicit photos to each other during the break, but that quickly died down when she wanted me in real life, not on photo. Which i understood, she was, problaby is, still anti masturbation on herself, idk why. We told each other to delete the photos, which i did, and she told me she did. When i was about to leave and asked her, she told me she kept them as defense if i were to leak her foto's, which i had proven before i deleted.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i'm stuck, i don't want to lose her, but i'm tired AF of the constant back and forth, i still like her, and she is a great girl, hot as wel. But i can't go on anymore. She just drains my energy. And i'm not someone who will give up easily, and let things come to him mentally, but i've cracked. My best friend saw me break down, but he told me to reflect on myself, not  on her. But i just can't anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid she's right. What if i don't find someone as good as her. What if i blew it all already? I have one chance left to win her over again. But i don't know if i want to, or if i can. I know i can't change myself anymore, i'm to stubborn/lazy/rational/numb/... whatever you want to call it. And i don't know if i'll eve be 'good enough'. I don't want to try today and fail again next year. 

When i'm sitting here on my computer at home (i should be studying) i can think rationally, but i don't know what to do. When i'm with her, i can't even think. I'm pretty sure if i gave up, she'll be with one of her friends in no time ( i know the guy and he's a great stand up dude, one i could be friends with if i had the time.), which i wouldn't actually mind THAT much.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. i can provide more info or background, but i'm just so tired.

I just want some peace of mind, with her, or without, but i don't know how. i really should focus on my finals but can't.

Pardon my writing, I'm on the verge of breaking down right now. Some strong language. Triggers may include self harm, suicide, being cheated on, trauma. Thanks for reading, take care everyone! &lt;3

I recently (a few days ago) found out that I showed signs of being traumatized since early childhood. 3 years old early childhood. I thought that situation was like in Kindergarten or something because I could remember it vividly. The fear of angering nmom. The anxious little guy I was, not wanting to disturb his lawn-mowing mother. So I made myself a bread with jam. Was too scared of the knife. And while this is a nice little ""funny"" anecdote my nmom always likes to tell everyone (also likes to remind me of it) only I remember the vivid feeling of being lost. Of being anxious. Of having similar thought patterns and fears as I'm having now. I also developed tics (motor and verbal) that still act up when I'm stressed (which is almost always, more or less.)

In third grade I had severe OCD which got worse in 5th. No confidence, no friends, no one to talk to. Suicidally depressed. Couldn't feel a damn thing when I got an aquarium. Thought what was wrong with me. She trained me to believe that my illnesses are character flaws and that I was a bad person because of it. Never told her about any pain after I tried for years. Almost ruptured appendix because I didn't want to make her sad/angry. Didn't go to doctors much because I feel like a burden and I don't deserve it. Got kicked in the face on a festival last summer and my buddy literally had to drag me to the nurse because I lost consciousness for a moment but I didn't want to go. I didn't want to bother anyone. Their time is valuable and I'm not.

Self harmed since pre-kindergarten. Knocked the back of my head against walls which left a slight deformation of my skull. Punched my legs and arms because I couldn't get rid of the stress/fear/hate/sadness. Never cursed at my mother until 11th grade. Always told that I was disrespectful.

Found first real and friendly social contact between 10th and 11th grade. Found friends that I'm still very close to. Went to therapy for my OCD in 11th grade. Got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Cut up my whole right leg pretty severely when I had a requiered internship. Only slept 1-2 hours or so daily for half a year. Told therapist about family situation and my frequent extreme mood swings. She said I can't be bipolar e.g. because I  haven't spent a lot of money during my ups. I was raised to save money and I get adrenaline rushes when I buy something for 10 bucks that I didn't ABSOLUTELY need. Constantly being told that I'm too expensive yadda yadda.

Moved to university, got way worse, got cheated on (got daily flashbacks and nightmares for over a year), moved in with the person who cheated on me, dropped out of university.  Wrote applications, didn't work in any way (some because of qualification, some because of utter bullshittery.)

Moved back in with my parents because I thought it got better. GREAT MISTAKE. Been here since June/July and got the whole register of narcissistic buttfuckery shoved up my ass. You can see that I'm pretty furious right now.

Went grey-rock and it worked fine because nmom didn't have any fuel for her fire. But my nmom is... special.

Just had another discussion/argument/row. Every possible way of belittling, ridiculing, name-calling etc. You name it, she did it. I broke. I insulted her once. She went on and on about it and yadda yadda. I got out of the kitchen and calmed myself down because normally I'm a very reasonable and logical person. She thought I went upstairs and I listened to the whole ""he has everything. He's so expensive. we pay for his water. and food. and electricity. he should move out!""

She never has the balls to directly tell me to move out because she's DEVASTATED by me moving out. Just another tactic to keep me in. So I participated in this cesspool of ignorance she calls discussion until she had to go for her ""Manicure Appointment."" So yeah, I'm the expensive one because I shower every day but you were able to get shiny nails and smoke since you were 13, even when you were pregnant with me, you 52 year old sack of parboiled rice.

I'm broke. I have no job but I'm self-employed now (little pay but only thing possible with my panic disorder etc.) and studying medical fitness. The love of my life broke up with me but that's okay, I'm difficult right now. I have no place to go.

But it's decided. I will move out. I'm going to sell the majority of my stuff. Crash couches for some time. Go to a psychiatrist (mental health plummeting, extremely suicidal the last few weeks), maybe go to a hospital even. Work my ass off for money so that I can afford a roof over my head and health insurance. Go to my first and second seminar of my studies (first one in July, second one idk yet.) Fuck it. I am the master of my own fate."
ag8pik,3,2019-01-15,Wanting to improve digital marketing CV - how?,bp5678,digital_marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/ag8pik/wanting_to_improve_digital_marketing_cv_how/,"Brief background:

I'm 24, went to university to study something non marketing related.

When I graduated, I did a 9 month paid marketing internship at a large company. Absolutely hated it mainly due to how the company was ran, poor management, learnt nothing etc. This put me off work to be honest.

I then worked for a friend who was the store manager of a couple of shops. I did the marketing for them for a few months as they never employed a marketing person before. This was the complete opposite of my previous job as I was learning as I went along (very small company compared to a massive international company in the previous job). I learnt a fair amount in a short space of time but the pay wasn't good so it was a short term fix just to get me 'enjoying' work again and learning.

I'm now working as a Marketing Executive in a fairly small company (a couple of people in marketing and about 50 people in the whole business). Enjoying it a lot although I don't really have any marketing based qualifications. I do things like copywriting, email newsletters, social media, website maintenance, ad hoc tasks etc... it's sort of a little bit of everything.

I would really like to specialise in one area to improve my CV and get paid more in the long run. I've self-taught myself the basics of Google Analytics, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, SEO etc but it's all fairly basic.

I know qualifications don't really mean much as it's good to learn through experiences but it just makes my CV a little weaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know of any UK courses you'd recommend I do to enhance my CV, make me more employable in a higher-paying role? I know there's a lot of courses that are not practical in the ever-changing marketing world too so I'd appreciate your input on what's relevant and up to date.

Some things I've found:

* I'm looking at Google course. I think a Google Analytics or Google Ads course could be best. Any recommendations? Would this be worth it?
* Advanced MS Excel course
* Facebook Blueprint
* Some sort of data driven, data centric course to add value to business/customers? Any recommendations?
* Some sort of SEO course? Any recommendations?"

After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! It's a new one, so I'm sure there are kinks to work out along the way, but I really like the concept!

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"
ag9adi,53,2019-01-15,I just need some encouragement,MollyThreeGuns,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ag9adi/i_just_need_some_encouragement/,"About 2 and a half months ago I went from being a completely healthy 32 year old with a pesky stomach ulcer to having stage IV stomach ccancer that had spread to my chest wall (though they said they ""cut that out"" during a laparoscopy?) and Lynch syndrome.  This is all really a lot to take in.  My boyfriend and I had just moved to the midwest so he could earn his MBA. We bought a house and are in the middle of a remodel. I'm the only one working because he has school full time (though he will have a very well paid internship during the summers) and I'm missing a lot of work because of the chemo.  Thankfully my company is 100% working with me and I know my job is secure. 


I'm going through chemo and immunotherapy(Keytruda). It's not nearly as bad as I expected. The nausea is negligible, just a little off on the day after chemo and my only real side effect is exhaustion. For 4 days after the chemo I am utterly and completely exhausted. I've done 3 treatments so far. Still have all my hair but I'm shedding a lot more. But beyond this I feel normal, I feel fine.  The heaviest toll has been my mental health.  I had generalized anxiety before I found out about the cancer.  Now I can't get through a day without dwelling on it.  I just can't wrap my head around feeling so normal and being so sick. 


I want to fight this. I clearly CAN fight this but I can't help but wonder if fighting will even do anything at this point.  My doctor seems hopeful(?) but he's hard to read. He feels optimistic about the keutruda. I want to. My 4th treatment is Friday and then I have another PET to check what's going on. I'm so completely overwhelmed and scared for my future. "
ag9qga,3,2019-01-15,I can't stand how employees work/live,Rektifire,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ag9qga/i_cant_stand_how_employees_worklive/,"I'm currently an intern at a company, I'm writing this right now because my supervisor is not around. ""SHE"" hasn't been around the whole day because apparently there is work she has to do. Which begs the question... why the hell am I here wasting my time and mental/physical health and for what... (the internship is graded by the school and I need it to graduate) but it seems like it is very unnecessary for me to come here everyday.

So basically, where I'm from, a student like me doesn't get paid for their internship because we mostly have no professional background. I can understand that, but what I wanna rant about is that no one in the right mind would want to work here, not that the working conditions are bad but they must wake up at 6:30 in order to prepare their lunch and breakfast etc… commute to work then work for 10 hours  and commute back home which takes 1 hour minimum. 

so sitting here all day, very bored and tired I noticed that people who worked here put up the energetic, smiling, laughing façade and having a ""good time"" while I, the grumpy intern feel like I'm just a lazy person. Am I really ?

Why do these people act like this... it will ruin them. they are definitely rewarded with a good salary but at the same time their jobs ruin their social life. they literally can't go out after work or else they will be extra tired the day after. the only time they have is in the weekends but of course it is time to rest then.

So rarely going out, no time for personal development, no time for working out, barely anytime for kids if they have kids that is. It just doesn't sound like a life anyone would want to live so why are they here? are they trapped? I am definitely trapped but it temporary, and it is ruining my brain. I honestly hate this industry.

So are you one of these people or are you like me? I would love to see your point of view regarding this topic."

I had a job when we met, and he had an internship that paid less than half of what I made. Then we moved to Australia, he got a job before I did, I got one a couple weeks later. We both made a decent amount (it's much easier to make enough over there). He does digital marketing and I do graphic design, or basically anything creative.

We spent the majority of 2018 living with my parents in the US after moving back from AUS, because he couldn't work until we got him a green card, which took over 6mos. and we also had a wedding to plan. After getting married, we took everything we owned in my car, and drove to California to try settling down for longer than the usual 1 year. It was a rough start, finding a house felt near impossible, but we did it, and he was lucky to get a good paying job starting the day we moved in. I, however, have not been so lucky.

While job searching, I've been doing freelance work and also trying to get our online business established so we can eventually live off-grid and be mobile. (both of our dream) 

In the area we live, design jobs are few to none. I've applied to every one I match up to, with only one interview so far, and I didn't land it. The hiring process seems to take 2-8 weeks around here. He's suggested making changes to my LinkedIn profile, but honestly I don't think that's the problem. Besides, if I could get a job being someone I'm not, I know I'd be even more depressed than I already am. I wouldn't mind working as a shelf stocker or other low paying job, but what I've found has only been night shifts, and we only have one car right now, which means I have to find something near his job until we can afford another car, which narrows my search even more. Buses don't run here and Uber would rack up quick.

The truth is we have enough money with his income to meet our needs, so it's not completely about the money. But he has certain expectations of me that are currently not met, because I'm not doing the **same** work he's doing, and he resents me for it. I do everything else I can. When I'm not designing, I'm keeping the house clean and in order. I offer support and companionship whenever I can. But in his mind, I'm in debt to him. Because I haven't been lucky as him, I'm the ball and chain now, and I'm faced with his loss of respect for me every day, which only makes this harder.

He tells his family and friends I'm relying on him as if by choice, and that he really doesn't like it, he doesn't like being the provider, he feels cheated and taken advantage of. Seeing him feeling let down by me makes me hate myself, and in a way makes me hate him for resenting me, because I know I'm doing everything I can. It's been less than 4 months of this, and he can't even look at me anymore. 

On one hand, I can't wait til the day I finally land something, and end up making more than him again, so I can rub it in his face and ignore his feelings and tell him every day that he doesn't live up to my standard and he's not pulling his weight, and see how he likes it. But I won't. Because I have a heart.

I know this will pass one day and it will be a low place to look down on with gratitude. But being in the middle of it, it's taken a toll on us as a team. It's gotten between us, which hurts. I've always hated material money and it's ability to destroy priceless things like friendship and compassion. I hate that he values my ""potential to work a paying job"" over anything else about me. I want to leave, to show him what he'd be missing, other than another paycheck, but I can't do that until I have some money saved up, so obviously the shackles are on tight. I don't even want to leave, I want him to simply value me as a person. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? Any advice on what we could do to protect our marriage from the misfortune of unemployment? Anything we could use as hope? Am I with the wrong partner?? I know that's only for me to answer, but some support would be nice..."

These positions deal with the ground-level networking including working on campus ethernet, fiber optics, wireless, and infrastructure devices. Unlike typical student worker positions on campus, the pay is marginally better with opportunities for promotion, as these positions are classified as internships.

**Background:**

I am a sophomore, almost junior, in college. During my first semester of freshman year, my good friend from high school, Veronica, (we attend the same university) and I became good friends with two girls, Rose and Tara, who are roommates. We all decided to room together the following semester. We chose a place in the on-campus dorms that had two shared rooms and a connecting bathroom. Things went super well for the first month and a half. Then, the drama started.

Tara has had some issues with her mental health. We supported her by providing a shoulder to cry on, fun distractions, a listening ear, and also by trying to get her to get some professional help. None of these were problematic at first, but things started getting much worse. Basically, a guy she went on a few dates with told her that he didn't see things moving forward with them, and it devastated her. For the next three days, she was catatonic and crying all the time. She was basically on self-harm and suicide watch. It got to the point where Veronica, Rose, and I had to drop whatever we were doing to go help her.

Near the end of the semester, I started dating one of our good guy friends. He and I were happy. Rose was so happy for us when she heard, but Tara immediately was like, ""Oh, now I need to find a boyfriend so that I will not be alone forever!"" It often seemed like she was trying to compete with me due to some of our similar struggles with mental health issues. Things became so stressful to the point that Rose was losing hair, and the drama with Tara was starting to affect my relationship with my boyfriend (we are still happily together :D ), and Veronica had basically started living with her boyfriend because of the hate that Tara gave her for the smallest things. It was a huge mess. One night when Rose, Veronica, and I were at the store, I received a text from Tara asking if I had an ice pack. I said I didn't and I thought that was that. When we got home, Tara had (what was obviously make up) smeared around her eye in an effort to look like a black-eye. She was like lol it's a joke, but I thought it was really weird and messed up.

Things kind of died down a little, and then the semester ended.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Issue**

Before the semester ended, Veronica, Tara, and I had decided to room together the following semester (Rose would be doing an internship that semester). But the more Veronica and I thought about it, the more we realized that rooming with Tara would be a problem and that we needed to focus on our own sanity. We confirmed with the apartment complex that we would be able to switch rooms, and then we called Tara together. We talked to her a bit and asked how she was doing. We then brought up rooming. I said something along the lines that I think it would be a good idea if we didn't room together because of the drama last year, and that it would be better for our friendship. Tara was like ok yeah I get that, then she had to go.

The next day, Veronica and I saw that she had unfollowed us on Instagram and told Rose that she was no longer on speaking terms with us, and that we betrayed her.

A little after Fall semester started, Veronica and I contacted Tara to see if she wanted to meet up. We met up at Starbucks and caught up. Veronica and I thought things went well, and we had talked about meeting up again later. Turns out that Tara had just wanted to see us for closure and that she was done with us. She removed us from social media and basically shut us out of her life. This really hurt me because I didn't think I had done anything wrong, and it made me feel like an awful person. She ignored my texts, so I stopped trying. Are Veronica and I the assholes here or is Tara just overreacting?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

My friend and I changed our minds and decided to not room with our other friend who had caused a lot of drama that had started to affect our own health. She cut us out of her life after.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Veronica and I called her to tell her in June. Fall semester started in September, so we gave her a heads up as early as we could so she could change things around with housing if she wanted. "

I have no debt as I had scholarships and help from my parents getting through undergrad.  
My degree is in Exercise Science, as I was a strength and condition coach throughout undergrad.  I left that career for financial reasons during my senior year. 

I’ll be able to save around $15,000 prior to enrolling, if I were to enroll full time in the autumn.
The cost of attendance would be around $5,500/semester.  I would file the FAFSA as an independent, so I might be able to get additional financial assistance. 

My plan would be to go a branch campus and take a few of the pre-major requirements, then transfer over to the main campus, where I would finish the pre-major requirements and apply to the major.  Since I have degree, I wouldn’t have to apply to get in, nor live on campus the first year. 
Due to my first degree, I think I’ll be able to get out of the GE’s, but it will still likely take me around four years to complete.  Are employers less likely to hire me if I don’t graduate until I’m 28?
I will try to stay with family in the area for the first year to save money, while working on campus, and look for an internship after freshman year in order to get more money.

I don’t have any responsibilities outside myself, and no debt, so I think the time to do it would be now, and the thought of going back to school to pursue this interest is exciting.  I also think I’ve grown a lot having to work in the real world, and would do much better in university this time around (I only managed a 3.3 GPA the first time). 

My opportunity cost for not attending is fairly low, as my degree and my desired area of study (technology) are unrelated.  I’ve looked into the Oregon State University extended Campus Computer Science degree, but I feel like I would have more opportunity at my alma mater.  

The thought of debt scares the living hell out of me, but I think a degree in Computer Science would justify the cost long-term. 

Do you all have any advice about keeping debt low, or any other pieces of wisdom you could share? 

Thanks!

agdgy1,7,2019-01-15,Life advice?,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/agdgy1/life_advice/,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 23 year old gay male and kind of struggling right now with my life. I could really go for some advice. 

I recently returned to Seattle after some complications involving getting my Bachelor's degree. I worked really hard to complete it in four years but it didn't end up going my way and I kind of had a burnout. I have been stressed out for a while and need some time to think for myself. I moved back with my parents and I am somewhat at a loss. I will  most likely be returning next year to complete my Bachelor's degree. However, in the meantime I need to sort out some questions. Advice/help would be greatly appreciated.

\-Career: My bachelor's degree, when it is completed, will be in history. I don't have any internships, however and am kind of at a loss what I want to do. In the Netherlands, where I got my degree, there wasn't of opportunities for internships during my Bachelor's. Although I really like history, I don't want to do my masters in it. The Bachelors felt too stale and mundane and I was constantly sitting down and reading articles. Ideally, I would like to go and do a masters in the U.S. where I could set my own path and own direction and make valuable connections. My interests are wide, but are all related to people. Some of these things include: History, Politics, Social sciences, Technology, Management. I am not a huge fan of business, but I like management because it involves people and leadership. I want to be able to help people. Any advice on this? 

\-Place to live: So I was born in the Netherlands, but have also lived in the US for a while. My mom is American and my dad is Dutch. I have lived and moved ten different times in my life, across two different countries, so I have seen a lot. I can deal with a lot of change. However, I am also constantly searching for a place to settle down. I have lived in the Netherlands (Hoorn, Haarlem, and Nijmegen) and in the US (Florida, Texas, and Seattle). I moved back to the Netherlands because I didn't think I was really American. However, after moving back to my country of birth, I quickly realized that I was more American than I thought. None of the places I have lived in before I really loved. Seattle is nice but the weather really gets me down and it can be hard to meet people. Florida and Texas were fun but too hot. I have never been to the Midwest so maybe I should give that a try. I do prefer the East coast to the West coast, though.

\-People: I am a natural extrovert and have a hard time holding back at times. I can be intense for some. However, because I've moved around so many times, I don't have a lot of friends and I have lost contact with many of my friends over the years. I naturally desire to connect with others, so this can be really hard. I often feel lonely because I don't have the opportunity to sit still and be tethered to a certain place. College in Europe was tough too. It was hard to connect with others, though this also has to do with myself and personal problems in regards to my family. What do you think are the best places for people who desire to connect with others and where it's easy to make friends? 

\-Gay stuff: Ok, so let's also have a topical paragraph. So I am gay and have known that I was gay since I was around 14 or so. When I was younger I always liked to be around boys and people in general. I am a very touchy feely person as well. I was a very sensitive kid and I always thought that this was what made me gay. I realize know that I am sensitive and emotional and the gay stuff is really an add on. That doesn't mean I'm not logical. But everything I do is connected to people. I have a hard time dating when I was in college because I desire to connect but have a hard time holding back. I can be very passionate. Gender roles have really held me back to a certain extent. It is very often not accepted if a man is too emotional and shows that, even though it is what I most desire. I simply desire to love others and motivate them and make sure they feel included. The type that I usually go for is a straight shooter/go getter. I like masculine, professional, type A personalities. I guess I like this because it is in many ways complementary to me. They help me look at things from a different angle: they usually help me with the stuff I have a hard time with. Does anybody have any recommendations where I could find this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you everyone. I hope someone can help me out.

agdjsr,2,2019-01-15,[m4F] Weekend femdom getaway,Rex_dpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/agdjsr/m4f_weekend_femdom_getaway/,"It was a bit of a scandal when we went public with our relationship. Me, a 34 year old engineering manager in a relationship with a 22 year old recent intern. We really did wait to officially date until your internship was over, but there was plenty of discreet flirting for the six months you interned with us. Fortunately, you worked in a different department, so our relationship didn’t violate any company rules, although it did raise quite a few eyebrows.

I’m a totally in control manager. My organization runs like clockwork and I’m almost always on time and close to on budget with development projects. I’m a little distant at work. Generally I don’t socialize with people I work with, and never with people I manage. I don’t want a personal relationship getting in the way of my business decisions. Probably because of my work personality, and our age difference, people assume we have a DD/lg relationship. Of course, nothing is further from the truth. In our personal life, you are totally in control.

On Friday you come breezing into my office during lunchtime. My admin is on her break, but I always work through lunch. You only stay a few seconds. Just long enough to place a box on my desk and then lean over the desk, giving me an amazing view of your cleavage and the leather bustier under your blouse. You tell me that you have rented a cottage at the beach for the weekend; a very isolated cottage. You also tell me that you’ll be by at 4 and that we will be leaving directly from work for our weekend getaway and that you expect me to be wearing everything in the box by then. Watching your perfect heart-shaped ass sway as you leave has my cock stirring even before I open the box, which contains:

* A cock cage, with the lock unlocked but no key.

* An anal plug, that I recognized as remotely controlled via your cell phone.

* A satin g-string.

I moan to myself. It’s going to be an intense weekend. I waste no time in slipping out the bathroom and into a stall to follow your instructions. The base ring barely fits over my balls, and I have to push and pull vigorously to force my swelling cock through it. This is the kind of base ring that is so tight it acts like a cock ring, keeping me hard and throbbing. With just the base ring on my cock, I lube up my ass and start to work the plug in. It take a while. The plug isn’t huge, but large enough that I can’t fully stifle my groan as it spreads my ass open before popping past my sphincter and nestling in my ass. Fortunately, pushing the anal plug in killed my erection most of the way, so I can slide the cage over my cock and lock it to the base ring. It’s a good thing you insist that I get a full Brazilian waxing every four weeks, or this cage would be pulling my hair. I pull on the satin g-string, at least it helps support the weight of the cage, and fold my boxers and slip them into my trouser pocket.

The afternoon is a complete waste of time. I can’t focus on anything except my cock which is straining at the cage and my ass which throbs each time I move. A meeting pops up on my calendar at 3 called “performance evaluation.” At 3:10 the plug starts vibrating. It’s subtle, but insistent. Rolling up and down in intensity and switching between different patterns of short and long bursts of buzzing. All I can do is stay in my chair and try not to moan too loudly. The throbbing in my ass has my cock swelling and straining at the cage. I slip my hand into my trousers to adjust how the g-string is holding me and realize that my cock is releasing so much pre-cum that the g-string is soaked through. I stuff some tissues down my pants to try and keep the pre-cum wet spot from showing through to my trousers. All I can do is wait for you to come get me, and then work whatever devious erotic plans you have for the weekend.

Hi DPP. A loving but not necessarily gentle femdom scene here. Kinks are pegging, chastity, spanking, verbal domination, cunnilingus, rimming (giving), edging, tease and denial, probably a bunch of other things I can’t think of right now. Feel free to try anything not on my limits list.

Limits: underage, scat, forced bi, vore.

I like some public humiliation, but it has to be realistic. If you want to include in the scene a stop at Good Vibrations where you have a long discussion with the sales clerk about dildo harnesses and dildos for pegging while I stand by looking embarrassed, go for it, but if you want to bend me over the hood of our car at noon in a Safeway parking lot and peg me I’ll probably feel that that is just not realistic enough for me to imagine in real life. (On the other hand, bending me over the hood of our car in a dark corner of a parking garage might just work.)

I play long term, usually posting one long response a day. I won’t ghost and if I’m going to take longer than 24 hours to respond I’ll warn you.

agekq6,4,2019-01-15,[Event] The Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration,Erhard_Eckmann,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/agekq6/event_the_chinese_arctic_and_antarctic/,"##The Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration

**May 2028, Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration, Fuxingmenwai Ave, Beijing**

###Statement from the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration

The Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration is proud to announce a new excursion to Antarctica after voting on the Chilean proposals. The goals of the excursion is to establish a small [claim area](https://imgur.com/a/0nX4c9C) for research into how Antarctica affects the climate of the world and unique wildlife research. Specifically, the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration has set a goal to gather samples from sediments buried deep in the Abbot Iceshelf, which is in very close proximity to land that can be dug out on Thurston Point. The claims will be remaining of minuscule size so that the research can be conducted, and strictly prohibiting military use in the claim area- citing it as an unnecessary escalation that will be avoided.

The Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration has reason to believe that setting up a base and claims in the unclaimed area will provide the Chinese and the [Scientific Community on Antarctic Research](https://www.scar.org/) extensive knowledge into a widely unknown and seldom explored piece of the region. At this time such research will be targeted as stated above to Geoscience that can give the Scientific Community a deeper understanding into the history of Earth, and provide useful insight into what direction the climate of the Earth is headed, in addition to Life Sciences research on the unique inhabitants of the extreme conditions on Antarctica.

The CAAA believes that making the area exclusive to Chinese research is not fair to the international scientific community, and will be cordially inviting the Republic of Korea, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Cambodia, Myanmar, Brunei, and Laos to create an East Asian Antarctic Research Facility. This proposed facility will host scientists from these respective nations that have a keen interest in forwarding their knowledge of the region, and create a cooperative greater East Asian understanding on the origination of Earth by studying its furthest reaches.

In addition, the CAAA will be creating their own research facility within the claimed region, called the Nanfang Wildlife and Geo-sciences Research Center that will focus on similar efforts to advance particular interests in scientists to Chinese interests. The Nanfang Wildlife and Geo-sciences Research Center will be hosting graduate students, scientists, and interns from Taiwan, and the mainland who wish to research and carry out specific projects and experiments to further their own studies, and the national advantage on a larger scale.

Two Type 272 Icebreakers will depart from Shanghai on May 14th for the claimed region, along with one Type 645 Oceanographic Research Ship to set up a perimeter along the claimed region of small flags to signify the border of the research claim. Then the engineering and research team will begin to set up the Nanfang Wildlife and Geo-sciences Research Center, along with the East Asian Antarctic Research Facility, and a small cleared runway in between the facilities for ski-based research aircraft and cargo vessels. Both facilities will be placed on a dugout rock terrain on the small Thurston area, with the runway on top of the ice between the two facilities.

The CAAA has also opened up applications from foreign research institutions who are interested in creating their own bases of research in the area that will help forward the international scientific community.

**Wildlife of Scientific Interest**

* Notothenioidei, and other related Icefish
* Weddell seals
* Belgica antarctica: the only insect on the continent
* Warty squid
* Antarctic Microorganisms
* Antarctic Pearlwort
* Various Fungi, and the two types of flowering plants native to the Antarctic
* Antarctic Sea Urchins

**Geo-Science Interest**

* Sediment Network Movements
* Human-Impact
* Ice-dating
* Geochemistry of Antarctic pelagic sediments
* Particle Sizing
* Preventing Glacial Run-off and Erosion

**Future Interests**

* Astronomy- lack of human pollution provides good settings for studying the stars

ageln4,2,2019-01-15,I've Hit A Metaphorical Brick Wall,FelazorWithers,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ageln4/ive_hit_a_metaphorical_brick_wall/,"Today wasn't the greatest day for me: I now understand that my mental health issues are consuming me, I'm going to struggle in college, I've not lost any weight and one of my friends not-so-secretly hates me. 
I'll start with the weight as it's the issue approaching the fastest. Obesity has been an issue for most of my 18 years on the planet, and a few years ago I vowed to lose weight. It went pretty well as I lost 40 pounds in a few months just from a diet. My weight hovered in the upper 220s for a very long time and I gained a few. With an off and on diet for the last year or so, I haven't lost any more. I planned on being normal weight by graduation which isn't going to happen; this is worse because one of my friends lost weight and it only fed my poor self-esteem. Anyway, I've also realized that some mental health problem is making me always want to be right and extremely sad when I'm not. Perhaps it's just narcissicm and just wanting to always be correct, but I spent a while arguing over a tiny thing with my friends. Meanwhile, my anxiety and location prevents me from being open about my sexuality to the one person at school who would possibly date me. And to top the shit cake: college. I do have free tuition and FAFSA to cover books and fees, but I don't have the money to pay for housing. The school does allow opt-outs which I plan on doing with friends but I have no qualifications to get an internship at one of the companies around the area in my field (computer engineering). So I'm left with living with parents, those of which just called me fat the other night as a joke.

TL;DR: I haven't lost the weight I wanted to for graduation, I have something wrong with me mentally that is driving my friends away (sadly I can't afford to get help), and I'll either have to live with parents I hate or live on campus and go into debt.

Sorry for the rambling. I'm not going to proofread this so I won't delete it all."

agfddx,58,2019-01-15,"The idea that the most ""successful"" people are the hardest working people is complete bullcrap.",RealNameIsTaken,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/agfddx/the_idea_that_the_most_successful_people_are_the/,"Forgive my grammar as English is not my native language.

Sure, there are many successful people that are damn hard-working and deserve everything that they have (not to imply that others don't deserve what they have). But, the large majority of people that are highly-successful have been able to do so because of their families, and not necessarily because of they worked harder than those below them.

I want to start off by saying that I don't want to consider anything like overall happiness in success because that's both difficult to measure and can be quite subjective.

Probably the biggest advantage that people get is coming from a stable, and wealthy family. As someone who is currently pursuing doctoral studies (and also working for a lucrative company in industry), the only thing that I have noticed is that nearly everyone comes from a wealthy family. It is incredibly more difficult to benefit equally from higher education if you do not have a strong financial backing. You cannot take things like unpaid internships, which are highly-valued for employers, and it is difficult to participate in clubs or other extracurricular activites because of work to pay for the schooling. This idea that employers love the fact that you worked through college is not true; what they truly value is relevant experience -- most of them don't care if you worked at a gas station 50 hours a week simultaneously if another applicant took an unpaid internship or summer courses. 

Of course, this is pretty anecdotal, but it's hard to ignore that the further I climb, the higher the concentration becomes of people coming from wealthy families, or at least families that are able to financially support them. I left my parents home and had no financial support at a young age and I not only put myself through school but I also gave my family money and took care of other family members to some extent. Most people that I work with or have done research with (mid to late twentysomethings) have, at some point, boasted about paying for their own rent, or that they finally pay their own cellphone bill, or ""adulting."" I don't want to sound snide because there's nothing wrong with that (I'd do the same for my kids).

I know that I've only talked about career prospects as it relates to education, but I'd make the same argument for trades and other fields; having a financial safety net simply makes it easier to fail and remain on your feet. 

Anyway, my point is that it is much easier to get further in life for these people and this whole idea that all you *need* to do is work harder is simply not true, it is all you *can* do."

I need to preface this whole post with the caveat that I am 4.5 months pregnant and will only be able to work through the first or second week of May before I go on maternity leave.

I just graduated from the college of business at the University of Missouri - St. Louis in December 2018 with a bachelor's in information systems. I have two internships under my belt. One with Enterprise Rent-A-Car as a software engineer. The other was with a small web development and marketing company where I did a little of everything including customer support, web development, project management, and some creative work. I also completed a 20-week coding and web development intensive in St. Louis at a place called [Launchcode](https://www.launchcode.org/lc101).

Previous to going back for my bachelor's degree I obtained an associate's in network engineering and had my CCNA. Utilizing that degree I built data centers and did networking and desktop support for a large school district and a company called World Wide Technology.

I have years of customer service experience from working in restaurants and retail as well. Working in tech is my true passion and I hope to build a career in software development as well as project or product management.

Hey, APP! 

**Before I get started, please know I’m looking for someone who will be able to discuss characters and the settings before starting, use either Reddit Chat (*not* PMs), Discord, or Kik, and be able to give more than one sentence/speech only replies.**

Alrighty, now that that’s out of the way, we can get to the prompts! Most might be shorter term, but I am open for expanding all of them and making it longer term. Also, I’d love long term partners. We can always move onto another prompt when one has served its purpose!

&gt;**1.)** *Doctor’s Visit.* My character is a fourteen year old girl visiting a gynecologist for the first time. She’s trying to get on birth control, even though she hasn’t had sex and really doesn’t know what it is. Your character is her doctor (perhaps 30+? Doesn’t have to be if you don’t want him to be!) and he just can’t get enough of how beautiful she is. So, he decides to do a more “necessary” check up. (*Note: I would love to involve impreg with this, and extend it into a longer term RP! She gets knocked up and has to see him for more checkups, or maybe even just a next door neighbor and family friend? Possibilities are endless!*)

&gt;**2.)** *The Intern.* Your character is a partner at a major law firm. He is in dire need for an assistant. My character is hired as an intern, so he seizes the opportunity and has her internship as working as his assistant. Then, he starts to notice how drop dead gorgeous my character is while his wife just gets uglier and less appealing with every year. Plus, she won’t give him any. So, he takes matters into his own hands. I’d prefer this one to lean toward him taking advantage of her or forcing her into a sexual relationship with him, using blackmail. She will be 16ish, lying about how old she is so she can have a job. Perhaps he could use that against her?

&gt;**3.)** *Daddy’s Little Girl.* Your character is going through a divorce. Or, maybe he’s not. Maybe his wife just isn’t the same anymore as she gets older. He’s the teacher at the local high school, where his daughter happens to attend. She rides to and from school with him daily to avoid the bus. Everything was going fine until a student made a joke to him one day about his daughter being his girlfriend/lover. Then his mind starts to wonder. On the drive home, he decides to act. Also would like this one to be more of a non-con aspect to it, maybe even throwing in that he wants to breed her because his wife refuses to have anymore children. But, how does he do it? Is the house empty so he goes straight home? Or does he go to an abandoned parking lot and pull her into the backseat to fill his desires and her pussy? 

&gt;**4.)** *Perks of the Job.* (Note: I really don’t want you to play a real celeb except for possibly a select few YouTubers that I’ll tell you if you want to do this prompt. Otherwise, I encourage you to make one up!) Your character is a celebrity. Movie star? Singer? YouTuber? The choice is yours! Either way, your manager puts out a contest that the winner gets to spend a whole six months with you at a private location. My character ends up winning. The contest was only for participants 18+, but my character was able to lie her way through it and get her alone time with you. The thing is.. that only serves to turn you on more. Her innocence, beauty, the fact that you’re alone for so long.. You aren’t going to let her leave without your baby in her. She just seems to want to be your friend, plus she’s oblivious to sex, so you take matters into your own hands. 

Kinks: impreg/breeding/pregnancy, unprotected sex, dom/sub (light), incest, non-con/rape, drugging, blackmail, light restraint, clothed sex, lingerie, short skirts, age differences, secrecy

Limits: anal (anything with the asshole really), bathroom stuff, feet, femdom, older woman, gore, vomit, extreme violence

*Note: I will not play any characters under 14. And as long as your character is older than mine, I don’t mind what age he is!*"

agi6i0,19,2019-01-16,I feel as though I wasted my good years...,purpleand20,RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/agi6i0/i_feel_as_though_i_wasted_my_good_years/,"Hi ladies; 

I'm soon to turn 24, and I honestly can't help but look back in time with regret. 

College was, for me, four plus years of stress and mental health issues. I also gained over 30 lbs within two years which lowered my confidence even further than it ever could. Fast forward to the present moment. I recently was dismissed from my grad school program; it hurt, especially knowing I hadn't held myself accountable as far as maintaining my overall health and well-being. 
I now hold a part-time position, which I've had my hours cut more than frequently. I think of all the smart and beautiful women back in college. I attended a university where plenty of students were well-off, so that meant their makeup and wardrobe were always stunning. Many also kept fit, with personal trainers and nutritionists 'on deck', while finding enough time to volunteer, take part in multiple internships, sorority events and job offers, all before finding themselves on the Dean's list by the end of the semester.

I feel I wasted so much time I'll never be able to get back. I know it's irrational, but at the same time, I wonder if I'll ever have enough time to do this and that, to revamp my style and tone my body the way I aspire for it to be. I grew up not taking much care of my body; just being very unkempt and those habits followed me throughout my college years. The men I vied for were not into me; who, at the time, was 30 lbs heavier with acne, a sloven appearance and bad hygiene. Thankfully, I've lost the weight and my pores are disappearing. My mental health is much better than it had been four, five years ago. In spite of all of that, I feel like there's no hope. I'd like to find love and get married, settle down with a family of our own, but I feel so far behind in so many avenues; is it even worth it?"

I’ve been busy with work so I haven’t had the chance to share my experience but I thought I would share it since this sub helped me out and hopefully it’ll help you.

I’ll start with a little background, I’m an average B&amp;C student with one year left until I graduate.  I registered for the FE civil for Dec 27th in early September because I wanted to make the switch from construction internships to design and consulting internships and thought it would boost my resume (and I did land a design internship before I passed).  I was planning on studying a little bit every week and then studying everyday after finals up to the exam.  That ended up not happening because of balancing a full class load and my internship and I didn’t start studying until the week before the exam, but the course material I had last semester was material that was going to be on the exam (like hydraulics and transportation). 

My study method was basically watching a bunch of YouTube videos from Marshall University and the videos on this sub from EnginierOnline.  I don’t know why she gets some hate from people on this sub, her videos are helpful and I’ll gladly give her money if I wasn’t a broke college student.  If you don’t like her videos, just don’t watch them/give her money and keep your antagonizing comments to yourself because she’s taking the time to help other people and no one is going to want to hire your spiteful ass.  I’ll be honest, a lot of the content from the Marshall U videos were helpful on the 1st session and the videos from EnginierOnline were helpful for the 2nd session and I even saw some problems from the videos on the exam.  So I would recommend going through those videos and trying out the problems on your own before seeing the answers because I feel like I learn more when I see why and where I made the mistake.  I then went through the practice exam front to back without a break and ended up not not knowing a good amount of the material as I have not taken Geotech, Reinforced Concrete or Steel design yet.  However, like I said, the Marshall U and EnginierOnline videos and learning the reference manual helped me understand how to solve those problems and where to look for formulas.  

On exam day, I went through all the problems and solved them immediately if I knew how to solve them and then flagged the ones that I had to think through.  I think I had around 10 on the first session and maybe 20-25 on the second session that I had flagged.  Then I went back through the flagged ones and solved the ones that I had to think through using the reference manual and flagged the ones I didn’t know at all.  And then I went through a last time and straight up guessed on the remaining (obviously take an educated guess).  I ended up finishing the 1st session in 1 hour and 30 minutes and the 2nd session in 2 hours and 30 minutes, with 1 hour left to spare.  I then went through and double checked all my work for the second session and ended up figuring out how to solve some problems that I was having trouble with by going through the manual with my extra time.  I ended up walking out feeling like I knew how to solve 80/110, second guessing 20/110 then straight up guessing on 10/110.  The ones I guessed on mainly were the statistics/dynamics questions and the conceptual questions (there was A LOT of conceptual questions on my exam). 

My biggest tip would be just really being able to look at a question and immediately know what section of the reference manual pertains to that material.  Also watching as many videos and exposing yourself to problems.  EnginierOnline’s videos on Geotech, Fluids and Concrete and Steel design helped me so much as those were my weakest subjects.  That was the saving grace for me and being able to solve problems that I did not know how to solve or forgot how to solve.  Also, a lot of the questions are a lot simpler than it seems and are just plug and chug so don’t overthink it.  Again, LEARN THE MANUAL, some of the answers to the questions like the math/ethics/construction/economics questions are straight up in the manual and to be real, there is no reason why everyone shouldn’t be getting a 100% on those sections.  

Anyways, if anybody has any questions regarding the exam, or questions pertaining to obtaining internships in construction or design, let me know! I would love to give advice and help fellow engineers out. "

agjin9,1,2019-01-16,Update about my new doc who used to be a bodybuilder,marios67,Testosterone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/agjin9/update_about_my_new_doc_who_used_to_be_a/,"Basics about me, I'm 22 with Test at 381ng/dl.

He asked how old am I and why I first did the blood tests, I told him I felt fatigued and had ED, while he was looking at the blood tests he was saying ""how is he gonna fuck his bitch with these levels"", he said that I had levels of a 40-50year old. He asked what the other doctors told me, I told him that they said that I shouldn't think about it, I'm fine and one of them said that he wished he had my levels, he went off with all of these. He asked if they were interns, I answered that two of them were head doctors and also teaching at my town's university, he said that this is malpractice and that they are dangerous.

I told him I don't want the gel, he said that he isn't going to write me a gel because that would be like putting me in a charger but he wants to re start my body's own production. I told him that I want the Testosterone injections, he didn't like that, he was really condescending when I told him that I don't want kids which I didn't like but I didn't want to mess it up since I tried really hard to find a doctor who knows about this. He said that he is on TRT for four years now and that he does HCG once a week and that is an expensive hussle.

The protocol that he gave me is this:5000iu D2/K2 with the breakfast  
I'll take one time 1mg Dostinex (cabergoline) because of my high prolactin.  
Every 3rd day 50mg of HCG for five days. Then for 2 weeks every night 25mg of clomid &amp; 10mg of nolvadex. ZMA in the night, Maca in the morning.All these for a month.

Tbh I was kinda bummed out that I didn't get the Testosterone injections, I believed it will have better results, in my mood in my confidence, in my body composition, in my erections and in pretty much everything, but I was kinda afraid to push him more in case he rejected me. Any thoughts about this Test inj vs my protocol?

EDIT: Should I worry for the luck of AI?"

Its so incredibly isolating-my mum telling me to find other jobs more suitable for me. But in this life, there are no happy endings. Can't keep a job, psychiatrist appointments are long, and constant invalidation by fellow peers. If I had a penny for everytime that guy told me he is worse than me, I would have $1 million when he's done. I always hear success stories-people getting married, people getting jobs. But I have been struggling with learning problems since I was 7. I remember staring out of the classroom in nursery school and they took me to a psychologist who told me I didn't have autism. Remember being in the classroom, being taught division, and when I came back home, nothing registered in my brain. I've done a mensa test and i'm in the 58th percentile. I am trying to get over this, but I seem to face never ending obstacles and I am seriously sick and tired of this. I finished my degree, albeit with a lot of obstacles along the way. Oversharing and being open could backfire, and cost me employment opportunities, but I am beyond that-I am beyond the point of hope. I have lost all hope. How nice if my hallucinations/delusions comprise only of me being in love with my imaginary lover.....When I was in that mental hospital, I was so lucid and everyone was screaming and shouting and I was losing my mind. I wish I can detach myself from reality and even if I were in a mental hospital I wouldn't be bothered."

agkbfe,1,2019-01-16,Neverwinter: The Heart of Fire Available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,BuckGB,GameBanshee,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameBanshee/comments/agkbfe/neverwinter_the_heart_of_fire_available_on/,"The Heart of Fire content update for Perfect World Entertainment and Cryptic Studios' fast-paced D&amp;D-inspired MMORPG Neverwinter [launched on PC](http://www.gamebanshee.com/news/121513-neverwinter-the-heart-of-fire-available-on-pc.html) a few months back. It introduced a new zany adventure that featured a number of characters from Penny Arcade's Acquisitions Incorporated show, and also overhauled several of the game's existing systems. And now, this module is also available on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, if that's your thing. Here's the official launch trailer:

And some additional details:

REDWOOD CITY, Calif. – January 15, 2019 – Today, Perfect World Entertainment Inc., a leading publisher of free-to-play MMORPGs, and Cryptic Studios announced Neverwinter: The Heart of Fire featuring Acquisitions Incorporated, is now available on Xbox One and PlayStation®4. Penny Arcade founders Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik penned the latest campaign for the free-to-play Dungeons &amp; Dragons MMORPG set in the Forgotten Realms (and beyond), starring Acquisitions Incorporated characters Omin Dran, Jim Darkmagic and Walnut Dankgrass (voiced by Holkins, Krahulik and Amy Falcone, respectively). An all-new campaign offers players the opportunity to join the famed adventuring company on their latest journey from green intern to becoming a full-fledged member.
   
   
 The Heart of Fire’s content is available beginning at level 15, with missions of acquisition included throughout the leveling experience. Acquisitions Incorporated’s signature brand of humor permeates this module, which challenges adventurers to seek out the titular Heart of Fire, a relic from Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ past, in a wild campaign. Omin and Jim assign dangerous tasks (for minimal pay, of course) including infiltrating a Beholder convention in a tank disguise, fulfilling the wishes of a mountain-sized giant from the deck of the company airship, and thwarting a heist at the Manycoins Bank in an all-new endgame skirmish.
   
   
 Acquisitions Incorporated’s new residence inside Protector’s Enclave allows adventurers to own a workshop as a base of operations for the overhauled Professions system. Other updates in this module include class balancing, dungeon chests and loot experience improvements. Find details about these updates to Neverwinter below:
  - **The Heart of Fire Storyline**- The minds behind the popular Penny Arcade games and gaming culture webcomic lend their wit to the latest Acquisitions Incorporated storyline. Become a member of the infamous company of adventurers and engage in questionable activities alongside Omin Dran (Jerry Holkins), Jim Darkmagic (Mike Krahulik) and Walnut Dankgrass (Amy Falcone).
  - **New Campaign: Acquisitions, Incorporated**- It’s not all dressing up as 11-eyed monsters and coasting through the brisk skies on the company airship. The newest campaign levels up with the player and puts an emphasis on acquiring items including new boons and access to the new endgame Skirmish.
  - **New Skirmish: Manycoins Bank Heist**- Beyond the internship stage of their tenure with Acquisitions Incorporated, players will be given the opportunity - nay, the duty - to defend the Manycoins Bank vault from Zhentarim intruders seeking riches of the realm. Surely, there is good pay in protecting the Protector’s payload.
  - **Professions Overhaul**- The Seven Suns Coster Market acknowledges certain adventurers’ acuity to the economic arts - and now beginning at level 20, players may now own a workshop, hire artisans to gather resources and craft items in the reworked, more personalized Professions system.
  - **Salvage and Dungeon End Chest Changes**- Astral Diamonds given as rewards has changed! Earn the coveted currency directly through dungeon delves as well as completing content. Dungeon Chest Keys will no longer be required to open chests and have been converted into tokens for free end-of-dungeon rerolling. This may also be done with Astral Diamonds. Finally, the Salvage feature has been phased out with this update.
  - **Class Balance Updates**- In a continued effort to ensure the game is fun for everyone and each class is viable, a wide variety of changes have been made to class powers and general balance. Check the official Neverwinter blog for patch notes and more details.
  - **Loot Experience Improvements**- Much of the loot gathered throughout the Forgotten Realms is now automatically added to a player’s inventory when they are in close proximity. Need/Greed rolls still pop up as needed. Fewer treasure (vendor loot) items drop and other less-desired loot no longer drops. Check [The Heart of Fire’s patch notes](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/xbox/neverwinter/news/detail/11069433)for even more detailed information.

Am I the problem?,MarriedStranger_,Marriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/agkqvp/i_expected_it_to_be_different_am_i_the_problem/,"I am married with my wife since August 2018. We have been in a relationship since February 2017. We got married so quickly because wanted to live together. A bit of background here: We met in Japan studying abroad. She is from the US and I am from Europe. It is really hard to get a residence/work permit in my country. Marrying a citizen is one solution. You still need to meet some requirements but the whole process in general is much more doable. She is 22 years and moved to my country right after she finished her university (major in Anthropologie, 30K$ debt). She comes from a rather poor family. Her mother was abusive and she only met her dad when she was 13. Nowadays she only really has contact to her grandma. She has a couple of good friends from the US but most of them also moved abroad so she talks to them and other friends mainly online. I am 25 years old. After my university I started a job I really like and I got super lucky cause not only is the pay amazing for an entrance level job but it is also with a company I did a lot of internships during my university time with. I have a good reputation there and work closely with the general manager. My family is not rich but was always able to support me financially so I finished university with no debts. This is not about me being rich and her being poor. I just wanted to provide a bit of a background.

I always imagined my life in a certain way and I worked really hard to achieve my goals. My plan was always to finish my degree, get a good job and be able to enjoy my life. I wanted to travel and just don´t worry about finances and my future. At the moment though my life is the complete opposite… I worry all the time about finances and I never really get to do what I want. I am basically using my salary to finance our shared life here so my wife can learn my language to prepare for the local job market. So she is not bringing in any income at the moment. Additionally she has a lot of free time. As she only is busy 4 hours a day with her language class. The rest of the time until I get home from work she is able to do whatever she wants. I understand that once I get home she of course wants to spend time with me. But for me the problem is I never get alone time cause she is always there asking what I would like to do. If I tell her that I want to do something by myself I can see how sad she gets because while I enjoy my alone time she just sits somewhere quietly until I am done. She tells me that she is bored during those times because she already did everything she wants to do alone today. The other problem is that she kind of restricts my access to my friends. I work long hours and if I want to meet them it always during the time she wants to hang with me. So I always need to choose between her and my friends and even though she says I can do whatever I can see how sad/disappointed she gets once I don´t choose her. My big problem is that I absolutely think she loves me and that she wants to make this situation work. She is learning the language pretty fast and is willing to take on any job to support me with paying the bills and her student loan. I am just torn because I also love her and there was a reason why we started but at the moment I am just miserable. Life is not what I expected and I think getting a divorce is the only way to fix it. I learned that I value my own independence a lot and that I would need a partner that is the same or supports that. I don´t see her ever becoming that person. What do I do? I can´t get over the fact that I might be the problem cause I am to selfish. But maybe I am just not the marriage/relationship kind of guy. I also don´t want to hurt her and make her life a mess. I know that she had almost nothing in her home country but I still know that leaving the country you grew up in is a big sacrifice."

aglkxk,0,2019-01-16,Coming down..... Bad Trip,abuttedpecan,LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/aglkxk/coming_down_bad_trip/,"Hello, so this is going to be a bit of a long read but, I feel this story needs to be told. Please try to excuse my grammar but I shall try my best. I'm writing this @ 7:20am

 

A little bit of back story before I go into the details of  what went down this night. I live in an apartment with my girlfriend who I will refer to as My Angel and its quaint but I like it, I work as front office manager at a hotel in town. AND I LOVE my job, it's one of those things I'm happy to get up in the morning for. The last time I took lsd was a week ago and also I have 300 mics of acid waiting for me after this fateful day of work.

&amp;#x200B;

To start the day off I work the 7am-3pm shift and get up, and see my girlfriend off for the day before I go to work. My Angel just recently started her internship in the city this semester and was up bright and early with me. But she wasn't as chipper as I am in the mornings as she usually isn't up so early. So I head on to work and work was perfect except for chad. More about chad later. So I go home after work to unwind and try to de stress my life away as usual, I clean the house. I wash my dishes and shower, I got the house clean for how I usually trip. Then I text My Angel while she is at her internship at 5:00. ""hey do you care if I take acid?"" to which she replies. ""um I guess"". Then I reply ""idk what that means."" ""but I'm a do it"". She then replies  ""ok"". Mind you guys my girlfriend has tried acid once and does not like it. She would rather me not do it and has a firm stance on how she feels about it. It's a strong NO from her, but she understands that I like to delve in the realm on psychedelics, so she puts up with me, even though she HATES IT. So we compromise, I told her I would take it sparingly, But I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. I dropped the tabs immediately after I sent that fateful text. Now we wait... To get myself started I put on some red dead redemption 2. The game is awesome. I play that for about 30 minutes and my gosh this is strong. I'm having a great time. I get a text from My Angel saying she is on the way home. So that gives me like an hour before she gets here. I continue playing red dead. I've played this game on other trips, and I was starting to question Duke's so called plan. I'M NOT SO SURE IT INCLUDES ARTHUR. I run into a town of cannibals had to get on out of there quick before I murdered the whole lot of them. No point in having a town of dead body's I figured. So I didn't stick around. I save a guy who lost his leg and I help a widow. Than My Angel arrives.

&amp;#x200B;

The time is 6:30 it has been an hour and half since I've dropped. She greets me soooooo warm, I cant stress this enough the girl is an angel. So she gets home and unpacks her bags. I ask her how her day was and her internship was a success, She had a great time and it was banging. I put on some blue planet 2 hit play and let the waves fucking rollllllllllll. Got damn Blue planet 2 is fucking fire. I've never seen the first one but damn I fucks with some blue planet. Anybodys who's been on the fence. SHITT go watch that shit now. LIKE DAMN. So I'm lost in the waves having a jolly ole time. My angel and me are chopping it up, conversing you know. She was doing her homework and had a quiz that night no biggie. I just here to WATCH BLUE PLANET 2!! Again shoutout to blue planet 2. Go watch that shit. Anyways after she finishes her homework. We are like 3 and a half episodes in. So the time is like around 10ish. I wont forget this. My Angel says ""So I have a question? You know you've dropped acid twice this week."".... 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the bad trip starts. When I tell you as soon as she uttered that phrase my entire world went black. I'm talking like a freefall down a dark whole. I completely shutdown. I knew exactly what she was talking about. I told her I was going to trip in moderation and taking acid twice in one week is not moderation let me tell you. I Got overwhelming MAD. I don't know if you've ever been mad while with lucy. but it is MADDENING. quite literally. I sat in silence I turned everything off and sat and stared at the wall. Just sitting in my chair. I say in my chair for about a good hour. I was mad at myself. BUT HOW COULD I BE MAD AT MYSELF!!!!!!!!!!! It drove me insane. I wouldn't even touch the thought of being mad at My Angel. How could I be she had done nothing wrong but beg the question. Addressing the white elephant in the room I know I had been avoiding. I gave her my word and I shat all over it when I just popped the tab. So there I sat angry in my chair. My angel gathers her things and asks me what I am looking at. I say ""nothing"". To which she responds ""So you're just staring at a wall"".

""yes I'm staring at a wall""

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't know what to do,  so she goes to the room and gets ready for bed. I am wide awake. Still roaring mad. I hate myself. So after she leaves I start to pace for a minute. I  grab my jacket and walk out the door. All I had on was some jammies and slides with NO SOCKS. Granted I did have a rather large jacket on. But shit it was cold. like cold as shit. So I'm stomping up the road. I Intentionally left my phone at home mind you. I didn't want anybody to follow me. I wanted to be alone. I had no idea what I was doing. Bu in my rage I walked and came upon a freeway..... A GOT DAMN HIGHWAY. I'm talking cars going fast as shit. and its dark. and there's no fucking cross walk!!! who doesn't put a crosswalk on a highway. Could kill somebody. But nevertheless there is a Walmart across the street. So I decide why not go in there and see if there is anything I could break maybe. Let up this pent up aggression. cuz whoooooooooo if I could fight me. I tell you. I WOULD KICK MY ASSSS. close to death but, still breathing, I would get the point. So I walk around Walmart. and damn it was honestly amazing. I've never been in Walmart during a trip and let me tell you. whoever does there marketing is a genius. GENIUS. I love it. But I grab a bag of chips so I don't look weird. I still don't know why holding a bag of chips made me feel less weird. but it helped. I actually still have the chips on the counter. post in the comments if you wanna know what flavor I got. I walk around. AAAHAAA, I found it, the thing I plan to break, I buy two plates, the nice dinner sized plates. They had a real nice weight to them. You could really feel the you know, plate. Shout out to whoever made these two particular plates. The funny thing is I spent longer trying t figure out what chips to buy than the plates go figures. Anyways I check out and...……. impending dread. I still hadn't let out my frustrations yet. So I was still pretty worked up. I cross the highway again back to my side of town. I had a moment crossing the highway for a second time. I stopped. Looked. I saw a car coming. It was the only car. I thought about just closing my eyes and walking into the road. And almost like a miracle. The car slowed down and came to a stop exactly than no moment sooner. Turns out it was just the light turning red. But shit man. that red light saved my life. So I walk across the street. now holding two plates a bag of chips and a life. I couldn't bring myself to smash them in a parking lot because I figured you know . you just cant be going around smashing plates in peoples parking lots. YOU SMASH A PLATE IN MY PARKING LOT...  and I will have a few choice words with you. SO I settle with going to the bridge and launching the plates off into the lake. I shoulda bought more plates. It felt amazing to just launch those fuckers into the lake. made a funny little splash and everything. So I meditate. I compose myself. I go back home. Its 12 when I get home. I had been gone around an hour. I go into the room. She's awake. I told her what I did. She doesn't believe me. So I show her the bag of chips. Then after realizing what I had done, I tried to ask her, why. None of the answers I wanted I got. I already know the answers. I get back everything I already know. It compounds again. I go back into this pit. I wanted to know why she didn't agree why she couldn't be okay with the my taking this drug. But that was besides the point because I knew. I knew what can of worms I was opening. So I go back  to the living room almost as mad as when I left. I turn all the lights off and hmmmpppppp. I SEEEE A PUMPKIN!!! A pumpkin that we never got around to carving for Halloween. I put my jacket on grab the pumpkin and leave. I go out back. Pull the melon over my head. These next events that transpired...……….. I destroyed the pumpkin. I absolutely smashed it. I cried. I yelled. I pulverized the pumkin. Whatever pieces were left I threw in the lake. I mediate. Compose myself and make my way home. I come inside tell My Angel what I had just done. She was crying...….. I made MY ANGEL cry..... I  took a shower. and after my shower I sat on the edge of the bed. nothing left to say. I look down at my phone. ""Chad isn't answering his phone"". My heart sinks. I was going to have to go into WORK and cover the desk. I exhaust all resources.. nobody else can come in. I swallow my pride. I ask My Angel to take me to work. I get dressed. I apologize and tell her I Love her. She didn't deserve that and I knew better. She was more hurt than anything. she told me she loves me back, took me to work. I get to work and it aprox. 1am when I get there. I am still tripping heavily. Work was pretty uneventful for the most part actually. under any normal circumstance I would have managed just fine. And might I add. I, Frankenstein was on and yeah it was actually a pretty good movie. You know that was defiantly the highlight of work. Great movie. I would rate it about 6/10 just cuz there were some iffy parts. but overall Frankenstein really had me going there. Than I watched the Hulk tv show. That show was fucking hilarious. I had never seen it until this morning and shit. that show was fucking funny. He fought a fucking gorilla. I'm still laughing in my head. I set up breakfast. No problems. everything goes smooth. 5am my relief shows up. And I call My Angel to pick me up. Where I come home sit down and write this report. Overall I feel a lot better but yeah that was my trip.

The moral of the story is, make sure to check both ways when crossing the street. And make sure to wear shoes when its cold out. And watch BLUE PLANET II. SHOUT OUT BLUE PLANET"

agm4v4,0,2019-01-16,When is a good time in life to get a dog?,saltyporkfriend,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/agm4v4/when_is_a_good_time_in_life_to_get_a_dog/,"I know exactly what kind of dog I want as well as a few reputable breeders that I'm considering buying from in the future.   
 This isn't an impulse desire.  I've wanted a coton du tulear (from a spring/summer litter) for the past 2 years now.  However, I don't want to bring a puppy into my home when I don't have a ton of free time to dedicate to loving, caring for, and training it.  Not to mention this is a breed that requires regular grooming, so extra time+money spent towards groomers monthly, bathing every other week, and frequent brushing.  I'm guessing it would take around 2-3 years for my pupper to fully mature and I'd have to put in the most time/work during that time.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, I can't see myself being able to just have 2-3 years with a ton of free time to take care of a dog.  Heck, I don't even see myself able to have 1 week to myself in the near future.  I work part time and go to school part time, with almost full time hours during breaks.  I've been dedicating most of my free time to college transfer applications with a little bit of social activity here and there.  Once I'm transferred to another school, it's going to be full time intensive schoolwork as well as internship searching/socializing (building future connections)/job searching, then full time job ASAP after school is done with.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like it wouldn't be okay to leave a dog at home all day if I get a full time job after I'm done with school.  However, the way I see it is that there's never a good time to get a dog until I'm old and retired :(  Do you guys have any advice on when the best time in life to get a new puppy is?"

Edit:  I realized I ended the post with ""should I aspire to be in Big N?"" which was misleading. that's more of a rant. I know that question can be only determined by me.  I have some good reasons to consider (for example, one recruiter from Big N has reached out to me twice recently.)

agmhzk,1,2019-01-16,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/agmhzk/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! It's a new one, so I'm sure there are kinks to work out along the way, but I really like the concept!

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"
agmlnc,2,2019-01-16,I can't live with the hope of impressing my father anymore.,jukeboxherowithstars,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/agmlnc/i_cant_live_with_the_hope_of_impressing_my_father/,"I am a ""dreamer"". My father is not, citing that he ""could never afford"" to relish and act upon his dreams. This has been the ultimate barrier in our relationship, and I've tried my entire life to either meet him halfway or abandon myself in attempts to understand and be more like him. 

My Dad has suffered much emotional and physical abuse at the hands of his own father. He used to tell my brother and I about it all the time while we were growing up because he didn't want to be the same kind of parent that his father was. My Dad has never, ever laid a hand on my brother or I, and he really is a fantastic father. When it comes to emotions, he's a bit overbearing and out-of-touch. He uses his own accomplishments and success as measurement for everyone else: ""If I can do it, why can't they?"" 

Because of this, I've grown up caring an awful lot about what my Dad thinks of me, my character, my choices. I always want to do right by him because he's constantly bolstering himself as the ""ultimate example"" for everyone else. The problem was, and still remains, that my Dad doesn't see me as a hardworking person and never will. In hindsight, nearly all my decisions in life were because of him - hoping to impress him, prove to him my commitment to hard work, show him that I've been hearing him these past 26 years. But it has all been in vain. 

There are so many details I can share about my Dad and I's relationship, there are so many layers that I have to navigate through to even write this. He's a great man, and I love him very much, but at 26 years old, I finally **FINALLY** realize that I **CANNOT** make choices for myself with him in mind anymore. 

I'm currently one semester away from obtaining my Masters to become an English Teacher. I do still live at home, but this is mostly from the encouragement of my Dad to save money. I am financially independent otherwise. I've worked very hard to get into the program by balancing two part time jobs and going back to school to gain required undergrad credits at a local community college. The program itself has been extremely dense with work, class, internships, practicums, student teaching, etc. I've had the last three weeks off for winter break before class starts up next Tuesday, and when Dad came home yesterday I could tell he was annoyed to see me cozy on the couch. 

My Dad started ranting about how he's worked for 40 years without a break, must be nice for me to have the time to hang out because ""I certainly never had the time"". I started to explain to him that classes start next week, that I can't find a part time job because my class schedule is so conflicting...but he didn't want to hear it. 

What haunted me was when he brought this up: My Dad started to recount an incident of emotional abuse from his childhood. He said again, ""you know, my father beat me..."" and started recounting the physical abuse. I've heard it before, but this time, my Dad was remembering it fondly, with nostalgia. Then my Dad said, ""You know, I wonder if I did the right thing as a parent. I wonder if I raised you kids right."" To say that right after talking about his own childhood abuse made my skin crawl.

""Dad, what are you saying, that you wish you beat me and my brother as kids?""

A long pause. ""I just wonder if I did it well.""

Okay. My Dad might be experiencing and reliving his own trauma from childhood here. He might be just reflecting on a completely normal question...but the way he asked it, tying it back to his abuse like that, was disturbing to me.   
I'm thinking, *Don't you have the evidence you need to at least think ""I guess I did a pretty good job?""* 

So I told him about how when my brother and I were growing up, he always was upfront about his abuse and said he ""didn't want to be like his Dad"". I told him he that that reigned true for him, and he never was like his own Dad.

My Dad rebuts with, ""Well, I struggled."" And gives me a look like ""Wtf have you struggled with kid?"" When he knows GODDAMN WELL that I've had struggles. I was mercilessly bullied as a child, I witnessed my parents' volatile relationship that was always peppered with threats of divorce, I had various medical problems and difficulties right before I graduated high school that made me even more insecure and anxious, and I've had mental health struggles throughout. HE KNOWS THIS. And I reminded him, ""I've struggled too Dad, in different ways than you, but I've struggled.""

And then I made the point, ""Don't parents treat their children better than they were treated because they want to give their children better lives than they had? Isn't that the whole point?"". 

At this point in the conversation, Dad gives a half nod and repeats ""I still wonder if that's how I should have done it.""

Maybe I'm taking this too personally...but I can't help but feel a bit worthless to him.

I told my Dad thanks for the wonderful life. I told him sorry he thinks that I'm an entitled asshole, sorry that I was a little bit too privileged as a kid. I told him that I've checked my privilege, and have done so in becoming an educator. I told him that maybe I've got it easy, but I try to put myself in a place where I can help those who might not have it so easy, and that's the reward I gain from teaching. 

He seemed content with that answer, and gave me an exasperated ""you don't have to tell me"" kinda look. 

Finally, I simply told him. ""Well, I'm not you, Dad."" I truly think that is the extent of his issue here, I'm just not more like him. And that vexes him to his core! 

Maybe my Dad is just being a normal dad...Maybe I just need to move out and get my own goddamn space...either way, I refuse to believe that I'm some lazy piece of shit who's got nothing to give. I refuse to believe that I'm not just some entitled, privileged asshole who should've been beat as a kid to learn my lessons. I'm not that person. And I've tried my whole life to show my Dad that I'm not. It really disappoints me to think that this is what my Dad thinks of me, that nothing I do will change his mind. 

This is my last year living with my parents. When I graduate the program in May (and hopefully land a job shortly after) I'm moving as close as possible to my new district. I think this space will work wonders for my Dad and I's relationship. But, I wish I understood my Dad more. Also, I feel really alone in this, which is why I wanted to post here. Anyone else have parents like this? Anyone else waiting for that wave of parental approval that will just never, ever come? I wish I just didn't care about what he has to say. I wish I could laugh it all off and say, ""That's just my crazy pops for ya."" How do I begin?  


TL;DR: My Dad was abused in his childhood and suggested that he should've been harder on me as a child because he thinks I'm lazy, entitled, and not enough like him. I've tried to prove myself to him my whole life and finally need to let go of the desire for his approval. "

You're also horny. This is a rather interesting yet common predicament many of your status find themselves in given that you can't just go out and have your way with anyone out of fear it might become an overnight Hollywood scandal. The obvious and generally accepted solution is to just date other celebrities and to a degree it worked out quite well, but you want something *different* than an equal partner.


You have people doing everything for you, from choosing your wardrobe, your hairstyle, driving you around, doing your laundry, yet you don't have someone taking *care* of you. Why not? Why would someone like you not have a person that drops to their knees at the snap of your fingers and tends to your every single sexual wish whenever you fancy? Talking to your agent, you got your agent to assign someone to you under the official role of 'intern', and they will start their new job first thing the following morning.

In this prompt, you play a celebrity that takes an unsuspecting 'intern' to be their personal plaything. I can be a random person, or I can be a fellow celebrity that you ended up acquiring through your own influence. This can either be taken slowly where you can play games with me and guide me to be exactly what you want, or it can be rather fast where you have me get to work the moment we meet, and put out any notion of me actually being an intern.


Celebrities up for grabs: Shailene Woodley, Rose Leslie, Ellen Page, Olivia Wilde, Hailee Steinfeld, Anna Kendrick, Daisy Ridley, Natalie Dormer, Chloe Bennet, Aubrey Plaza, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kate Beckinsale, Elizabeth Olsen, Margot Robbie, Rachel McAdams, Aimee Garcia, Lauren German, Briana Evigan, Scarlett Johansson, Amber Heard, Amanda Seyfried, Emma Stone, Jamie Chung.


Though not celebrities, I wouldn't mind you playing any of  [Jane Douglas](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/e6/17/bce61727feb3842464e3ecf720a94996.jpg), [Ellen Rose](https://i.imgur.com/HNZBwtk.jpg), Dodger Leigh, or Nika Harper"
agmwvw,1,2019-01-16,Which eco choice for a situational Thinkpad?,gokuwho,thinkpad,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/agmwvw/which_eco_choice_for_a_situational_thinkpad/,"So I'm moving to France this next Feb for my 5-month internship. I won't need to bring my own PC because the lab itself has strong servers to work with. I also plan on leaving my Dynabook R732 at home with my mother so I'm thinking of taking home another laptop to work with me with normal daily stuffs (which IMO should be office stuff, mail, bit of entertainment, sure not gaming) at least during this next 5 months.

I gotta be honest I won't spend more than 750USD for this next model so I've been thinking of a few different choices: T430, T450s, or X230, or X250.

Now here's why the X40 models won't be in this list: because it doesn't have the classic style of the X30 models, or it won't have the beautiful IPS panel of the X50 models.

TBH I was even thinking of old Macbook because it seems to be more casual using a Mac instead of a Thinkpad but just IMHO the old MacBook has more risks than old Thinkpads that's why I'm turning to a Thinkpad, and also I've been a long time idolizing the Thinkpad's keyboard (though haven't own one in my entire life, I regretted a bit buying the Dynabook instead of a T430 because the Toshiba keyboard is a real sh\*t, but anyway it's a really durable machine I have to say, I've been throwing it all around still functioning like nothing has ever happened).

Okay so I'm not gonna be fooling around anymore. What I'm asking you guys is should I go for the classic X30 model, or the more recent X50 models? What's the reason behind?

Also if there's a more decent choice than a Thinkpad, just give me a clue. Maybe I've not had enough experience to tell the best fit for my current situation, as some of you might've been through this before. If that's the case, I'm really willing to hear.

Lastly, I believe it's a long post for quite an old topic. I know what I'm about to do but I just need a little bit of advice. So thank you for coming by and read the whole post. Your words are always appreciated."
agn20l,1,2019-01-16,F4M/Futa - A Powerful Woman and the Cock She Serves,triyma,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/agn20l/f4mfuta_a_powerful_woman_and_the_cock_she_serves/,"Despite the drool running down my chin, the inside of my mouth is dry. It's the fabric; panties are surprisingly effective at soaking up saliva. When I spit out the pair jammed down my throat, it lands with a wet plop on my office's carpeted floor. I swallow twice to kill the cottony feeling they leave behind. A second later, my lips part with a ravenous gasp.

What will it be this time? A balls-deep explosion straight down my throat? Cockhead resting on my pink tongue as you paint it white? Neither - your right hand maintains a tight grip in my hair, keeping my pretty face at bay. It means you want to see each spurt splattering me. Will you stroke yourself to completion while I sit obediently, barely restraining my urge to lunge forward and swallow your dick? I know you like seeing me struggle to contain my whorish inclinations. Not this time, though - you let go of your glistening meat with a lascivious sneer, wordlessly compelling me to grab it.

I do so. It feels so thick in my hands (both hands, a testament to its girthy presence), so hot and throbbing, I can't help but let out a throaty moan upon first contact. While one hand asserts quick, firm, twisting strokes along the first few inches of the base, the other glides steadily up and down the rest of your rod and the glans. While one hand dips lower to fondle your heavy nutsack, the other shakes the shaft playfully, each bounce thumping off my face with a dull thwap. It hurts my hair pulling forward against your grasp far enough that I can do that, but the pain is secondary to pleasuring you.

Finally, I feel you tense and hear you grunt. After so many trysts just like this one, I can read your cock like a book. I shift my position, adopting a lower kneel with my thighs splayed to either side. If I were to dip an inch lower, my quivering cunt would be wetting the carpet even more than my drippings already have. I arch my back to emphasize my ample bosom, currently encased in a lacy, skimpy bra - visible because you tore open my button-up blouse two minutes after entering my office unannounced. I throw my head back and loll out my tongue, creating an enticing target for you. I wrap both hands around your throbbing member, one above the other, and jerk you like a pornstar. Between my pose, my figure, and my cock-handling skills, I certainly fit the part.

It's the dirty talk that really completes the transformation from levelheaded businesswoman to seasoned whore, though. ""Do it, you bastard!"" I hiss, my tongue waggling between words like an air traffic controller flagging down a plane. ""Shoot your load all over me. Coat me with it! C'mon, I want it, I wanna feel it sizzle on my face, I wanna taste it shoot across my fucking tongue. You motherfucker, you asshole, cum on me, show me I'm so fucking beneath you, that I'm your fucking personal cumrag, your jizzbitch, your- Oh god, it's happening. You're cumming!""

No need to warn me, not that you would care enough to - I feel it pulse and that's signal enough for me to shut up and stretch my lips even farther apart. A sound like I'm at the doctor's office having my tonsils examined hums from my oral cavity. My stroking continues through the lactic pain of tired arms. Nothing could stop me from extracting your load across my face.

The first spurt goes long, even though I'm pointing it directly at my open mouth. It streaks up my cheek, forces me to close my left eye or risk being blinded, and shoots over my forehead to dirty my lustrous brunette hair. I overcorrect my aim on the second one; it blasts against the bottom of my chin and down the front of my neck, before dribbling down into my cleavage. By the third rope of spunk, I've figured it out. This one spews directly into my mouth, and shortly following that a loud, hungry groan echoes from below the baby batter pooling on my tongue.

Load after load barrages my mouth, and soon, pearly white cum fills it halfway to the brim. As the force of your orgasmic contractions levels off, you release my hair and let me fall forward so I can suck out the rest. My lips clamp around your mushroom tip with gusto and my cheeks hollow as I bathe your piss slit with the jizz still collected in my mouth. While I nurse, I gently massage your balls and slowly milk your shaft from base to tip, eking out every last tiny drop of hot yogurt I possibly can.

Only when I feel your firm hand on the back of my hair again do I slide off of you with a pop. My cheeks bulge with the effort of keeping your seed within and unswallowed. A sharp tug from you, and my head jerks back. Like operating the foot lever of a trash can, my lips also part, revealing the pond of cum my tongue floats in. I lock eyes with you. You nod. My lips close. I gulp - twice. They part again, and my mouth is empty.

I'm panting for breath as the corners of my lips twitch with giddy glee. My nostrils flare because my throat is sticky, making it hard to breathe through my mouth. As you watch, I start gingerly scooping my facial into my mouth, careful to keep my makeup as undisturbed as possible. Most of it made it on target, so it doesn't take long before I've gotten it all. Well, almost all - the splattering in my hair seems to have escaped my attention, and I can feel a trickle of semen gliding through my cleavage onto my stomach. It pools in my belly button, and the sensation makes me shiver.

I give one more swallow, then clear my throat. The wild lustfulness of just a moment before is gone, replaced with my usual taciturn professionalism. I stand up and fix my skirt, then try to do the same for my top before realizing several buttons have been scattered throughout the room. A subtle flush creeps across my cheeks, but the gaze I affix you with is anything but embarrassed; it is stern, sharp, and exceedingly self-assured. I stand before you, my face a sloppy mess, my bra-wrapped udders popping out of a ruined blouse, a trail of liquid female arousal dribbling down my thighs and calves.

""Thank you,"" I say, in an impressively steady voice. ""That will be all for now."" My eyes flick up to the analog clock situated above the door. I lick my lips. ""You can see yourself out, but... I think I might have an opening after lunch.""

Without another word, I gracefully stride behind my desk and settle onto the fine leather seat. The last thing you see before the door latches shut behind you is a look of concern on my face, staring at a dollop of cum that dripped out of my hair and onto an important document.

---

Didn't quite find what I was looking for when I posted this yesterday, so I thought I'd actually write something OOC here. I want to play an important woman - maybe a CEO, maybe a senator, maybe a school principal. I want you to play the owner of the cock (or cocks!) that I am utterly unable to resist. I crave the way you treat me, that is to say, like a nasty, worthless whore only worth draining your balls into and onto. I don't care if you're the intern, a rival, or my own brother. Make me ashamed to love your abuse.

Specific kinks include, but are not limited to: adultery; ageplay; rough/violent sex; public sex and exhibitionism; life ruination; toilet play; bestiality; face fucking; cock worship; lesbian sex; gangbangs; blackmail; slapping; impact play; abuse; misogyny; tasks and rules I'm forced to follow; risky sex; impregnation/breeding; body writing; rimming; incest; cruelty; dirty talk; slutwear; humiliation/degradation; probably a lot more I'm forgetting.

I have zero limits for this roleplay, except I want everything to be consensual, even if it's dubious consent.

Please note that, due to my real life schedule, I can only play long term. I may be able to respond rapidly at first, but once the roleplay begins I will probably only get one response in every day or every other day. Or it could be quicker if I happen to have a lot of free time. It's hard to say. That said, feel free to just jump right in if you like.

If all of that sounds good to you, let's get filthy. ;)"

I recently tried the new iPad Pro which I loved so I'm thinking about returning the Macbook and just using the iPad for my illustrations. NOTE: I know the iPad is NOT a desktop replacement. My school provides very powerful iMacs in the design lab and other computers all across campus. While I'm still in school, I would be fine with only using an iPad. However, I am worried about not having my own MacOS device for the eventual internship I need to get for the summer. So I'm wondering in your experience, is it common for businesses to provide a desktop/laptop for interns or not? I'd love to be able to save $1000+ with not buying a laptop again but I'm just worried I won't have a MacOS device.

The following are the format: 

1. We spend a few hours in the future two weeks to practice in a room. 
2. Each of us takes turn to be an interviewer and the interviewee. 
3. There will be several behavioural and coding questions (on white board). 
4. A feedback section at the end of each interview. 

The interviewer has the following responsibility: 

1. Try to be vague in giving out questions. 
2. Guide the interviewee if he/she gets stuck. 
3. Take notes for feedback.

I’ll be graduating in June with an EnvE degree. My goal is not so much high income as it is to work in an industry with high employee satisfaction.  I’d appreciate hearing about your most enjoyable and meaningful experiences in the industry and advice on how to direct my path to find a great environment to work. So far I’ve had two internships, both at two very different consulting firms, and unfortunately I found them either overly stressful or mostly boring and disturbing (disturbing because people were lined up like zombies in their computers all day). This is probably just my own personal perception, though. 

Thanks ahead for any anecdotes and advice! "
agoyqb,0,2019-01-16,Fabricating on your resume to get your foot in the door for internships or entry level gigs. What do you think about it?,dondapperdeluxe,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/agoyqb/fabricating_on_your_resume_to_get_your_foot_in/,"I have a bachelors in communication and roughly 1 year of digital market analytics reporting and social media management that I have. I can make that look like 2 years since I started getting experience in 2017.  

I’m back in school for a masters in information system I can’t land an interview for for an entry level or intern gig to save my life. I know lying can backfire but I’m interested in doing just to see what will make the “fish bite the hook.” I don’t have shit to lose since they aren’t calling me anyways. A social experiment if nothing else. 

For example

 I can change my ethnic Hispanic name to a white American name ,either male or female.  

I can also say I have like 3 -4 years experience add a bunch of responsibilities I’m capable of completing  but haven’t necessarily gained 4 years experience doing .

I can make my address look like I live 5- 10 miles  near the site location

The idea is to work around their discriminatory bullshit ( in a mature way) at the when I get the interview and claim that it’s “my marketing tactic” to gain   the attention of my target audience. Why? because they desire a certain demographic and I’m not it. This is no different than trying to attract a materialist female like Kim k by acting like you have money by renting a Ferrari when you go to south beach. Once you have her attention, the playing field becomes more fair. 

Not long ago, I was watching some video on YouTube that  summarized the thought behind the Mad Men TV show. Back then, and to some extent now,  you need to be inline with the “WASP” (white Anglo Saxon protestant) establishment to have it easy with finding your way in the world. anyone who isn’t apart of it, like Don Draper, Peggy Olson has to find an angle/ finesse  to create opportunity for themselves. That made me think, since I can’t network my way in, being a good boy and following everything by the book by putting in 10000 application is waste of my time unless I find a way to finesse. I’ve been applying for 8 months and I have nothing to show for it. 

All this said gimme you thoughts on this “marketing strategy”

agp6qj,367,2019-01-16,Introducing zeal.gg — Custom Solo Queue Leaderboards,Pewqazz,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/agp6qj/introducing_zealgg_custom_solo_queue_leaderboards/,"Hey /r/leagueoflegends! I'm a CS undergrad who interned at Riot this past summer. As you might imagine, a few of the interns got _a little competitive_ about climbing solo queue. I'd find myself constantly refreshing multiple OP.GG tabs to keep an eye on how everyone's progress.

This quickly became tedious, so I spent a weekend building a leaderboard that polled and graphed everyone's ranks automatically, since I don't know of any existing sites that do this. It felt like something that the League community might find neat, so I put some time into scaling and polishing it up to prepare for the 2019 ranked season.

# With that, I'm happy to announce the launch of [**zeal.gg**](https://zeal.gg)!

To make your own leaderboard with your friends, just enter everyone's summoner names into the home page, and you'll be redirected a leaderboard with a unique, easily-sharable link!

The site is quite minimalistic by design, but here are some features:

- Create leaderboards with up to 12 different summoners.
- Visualize the ranked season — reminisce about those glorious win streaks (but ignore those loss streaks where matchmaking was _surely_ out to get you).
- View daily win-loss records and LP changes at a glance.
- Mobile-friendly (keeping tabs on your friends' ranks is a full-time job!)
- No need to manually refresh data.
- Star leaderboards to easily access them from the home page.

For example, take a look at where the members of Delta Fox are now (**[zeal.gg/dfx](https://zeal.gg/dfx)**), or check out how hard SKT is grinding solo queue to take back the World Championship this year (**[zeal.gg/skt-t1](https://zeal.gg/skt-t1)**).

Once you appear in _any_ leaderboard on the site, your ranked data will automatically be tracked daily, so be sure to make your leaderboards before the ranked season starts on January 23!

Happy to field any questions, suggestions, and bug reports about [**zeal.gg**](https://zeal.gg) in the comments, and good luck on the Rift this season everyone!"
agpcpp,3,2019-01-16,Stupid story,roydepoy,ITDisasterOps,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITDisasterOps/comments/agpcpp/stupid_story/,"A couple of years ago, the company was still running its own email server. The old sysadm was promoted and no longer had the time, so my md told that it was my resposibillity now. No pb, I liked any scrap that was thrown my way.

So the first few weeks I tried being damn strict at stuff: our culture was relaxed (even under the old sysadm) and every day there were people entering the server room to do their stuff. I protested a couple of times, but people kept doing it anyway. Spoke to the md, nothing changed, so I finally caved and thought “the fuck with this”

So a couple of months in, colleague x enters the server room, carrying a package. No big deal, I knew the guy for years. 15 mins later he comes out. 

Me thinks “job done”, but no, x returns 10 mins later with a with controller cable. We exchange glances, nobody spraks. 5 minutes later he leaves, return with an extension cable and a package. Me: whats up. X: no problem just need to wrap it up. 

So 20 minutes he exits, slightly sweaty, enters again. People start complaining email no longer works. I stick my head in the server room, x: yeah, had to take the server offline since we received the new harddisk today and I wanted to plug it in. Me: dude, couldnt you have told me? Him: the md said i could do it.

I had ordered a new disc since the backup disc had crashed.  

Then a period of 60 minutes go by, with him in and out, becoming sweatier and sweatier. Md enters: i cant read my mail for over an hour. Me: you told x to add the disc. Md: he didnt tell me it was on the mailserver. X is asked for an update: yeah, the controller cable was a little too short so i soldered it to the controller and now the server doesnt want to restart. Me (cold chills running the spine): can we return to the old situation? X: i tried but it doesnt restart. 

This continues for 10 minutes and all parties start getting more agitated. No backup since the original disc was all we had, and the server doesnt want to restart with it. 

With other disks the server restarts, ergo old disk and new disk are broken. 10 years of email archive, and no backups.

So md tells me: i made you responsable, so you solve it. The heavy sweating starts...

No sounds from either disk. I notice the old disk is made by ibm (yep, the disk and story are that old). I call ibm central number: sorry cant help. I call a buddy of mine who worked at ibm back then: well i ran into an intern who was playing with disks 2 months ago. Me: telno please. 

30 minutes later i get a telno and call: yep did some stuff a while ago, but i really wouldnt know what to do. Me: can i bring it in tomorrow morning anyway, you’re only 30 minutes away. Intern: i dont think i can help, but it seems your boss worked with mine, so we should at least go through the motions.

The next morning i bring in the old disk. Intern puts it on a testbed. No sounds, no reaction. While he is doing his thing i start looking around his office and notice a cool cut out of a disk (where a piece of the pie is cut out, so you can look at the internal bits). I pick it up: most of it is painted black. Intern: your disk is fried, sorry cant help. Me: the cut out looks the same as mine.  Intern: its just a thing which was here when i arrived. 

We both  both look at the cut out and conclude it looks the same. He takes the controller part of the cut out which unaffected by the cut, slides it of the cut out. Puts it on the fried disk. Connects it to testbed. It starts to whir. Files are still there...

I drive back, and install the disk. Server restarts and I am the hero of the day. Obviously had to share the honor with the intern.

Told the md to find another sysadm. He still thought i was a hero.

tldr: bad stuff happens to stupid people. Lucky stuff happens to stupid people. Ibm used to be a cool place.

agpdn6,1,2019-01-16,22 year old American freelancer looking to immigrate to Canada with a messy situation!,slopbox23,ImmigrationCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/agpdn6/22_year_old_american_freelancer_looking_to/,"Hi /r/ImmigrationCanada !! I am a 22 year old American freelancer looking to immigrate to Canada - I believe I may have a complicated situation and am hoping you all can offer me some guidance.   
My main question consists of   
1. Ought I pursue a self-employment visa, federal skilled worker, or a normal work permit via a job offer I have?  
2. If I choose self-employment, I am updating my tax registration in the USA and am wondering how to proceed to improve my chances of success?  
My quick story re: work/education qualifications is:

1. Age 16: Began work as a summer Camp Counselor, did this full time for 3 of the next 5 summers. When not doing that I began vigorously pursuing standup comedy at nights.  
2. Age 16-22:  I also worked for my Dad's small plastics manufacturing  business 15-20 hrs/month, however this has always been undeclared employment and income on both sides.  


3. I graduated high school with honors and a semester's worth of AP and early university credits. I went to a private art school in Chicago but dropped out 1 year in for financial reasons (too much student debt).  
4. I began working under the table at 3 performing arts venues from 2014 to 2016 in Chicago - I was paid very little for this, and all under the table. They could be considered internships, but the work load was easily 50hrs/week and I performed with and produced for world class touring comedians every week. I did this all for cheap and under the table because I was a young dropout that didn't want to be homeless in Chicago and my partners didn't want to do an ""official"" situation - I believe I could make the case this technically counts as self-employment?   
5. During this time my girlfriend of 4 years (a Canadian native citizen) was accepted at OCAD University in Toronto and moved there from Chicago to continue her studies. I moved back to my home in Connecticut with the goal of starting a freelancing marketing/creative/consulting/sales business so I could work online and continue visiting her.   
6. While setting that up in 2017 I worked under the table at a local bookstore as a manager for 6 months, as well as performing and producing comedy shows in CT and New York City.   
7. During 2018 I got my first group of freelance clients which include a Netflix documentary director and a famous author/fitness YouTuber with millions of fans. I'm working at a very high level in my field - I spent 9 months of the year on the road for that work across America as well as visiting my girlfriend in Toronto (4.5 months in Toronto total).  
8. I am only now registering my business and my personal taxes here in America for the first time. I'm thinking of registering as an S-corp.  
9. My ultimate goal is to be able to continue working for myself in Canada, but am unsure if the way I register my business/taxes in the USA will have an impact on my eligibility to apply for a visa.  I am also worried that since I have scattered and undeclared experience across multiple fields that my chances of acceptance will be harmed.   
i.e. I easily have 4+ combined years worth of experience for:  
     5135 - Actors and Comedians  
     5227 - Support Occupations in Motion Pictures and Performing Arts  
     5124 - PR and Communications  


Are there major red flags I should avoid in this regard? Does ""2+ Years Experience at a world class level"" mean A - in ONE occupation code (i.e. 5135, etc.) and B - in declared income under the same taxable entity?   


10. Finally, during my visits to Canada I have met a Toronto based entrepreneur (friends of my girlfriend's father) who is willing to hire me as an employee OR work with me as one of my clients based on what's better for me. In either case my position would be sales, marketing, events and content coordination for his Men's Jewelry business. Should I just get an Express Entry work visa and then change it to a self-employed persons visa later? Is that possible? If I take a job offer for express entry will I be penalized if I continue to work for my clients from within Canada but pay taxes to the US Government?

agrnk5,3,2019-01-16,5 Real Examples of Advanced Content Promotion Strategies,GuitarMusicInstitute,Guitartuitionvideos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitartuitionvideos/comments/agrnk5/5_real_examples_of_advanced_content_promotion/,"Posted by [bsmarketer](/%22https://moz.com/community/users/310156/%22)

Content promotion _isn’t_tweeting or upvoting. Those tiny, one-off tactics are fine for beginners. They might make a dent, but they definitely won’t move the needle. Companies that want to grow big and grow fast need to grow differently.

Here’s how Kissmetrics, Sourcify, Sales Hacker, Kinsta, and BuildFire have used advanced content promotion tips like newsjacking and paid social to elevate their brands above the competition.

1. Use content to fuel social media distribution (and not the other way around)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to selling the brand and blog to Neil Patel, Kissmetrics had no dedicated social media manager at the height of their success. The Kissmetrics blog received nearly 85% of its traffic from organic search. The second biggest traffic-driver was the newsletter.

Social media did drive traffic to their posts. However, former blog editor [Zach Buylgo’s](https://twitter.com/zachcb1) research showed that these traffic segments often had the lowest engagement (like time on site) and the least conversions (like trial or demo opt-ins) — so they didn’t prioritize it. The bulk of Zach’s day was instead focused on editing posts, making changes himself, adding comments and suggestions for the author to fix, and checking for regurgitated content. Stellar, long-form content was priority number one. And two. And three.

So Zach wasn’t just looking for technically-correct content. He was optimizing for uniqueness: the exact same area where most cheap content falls short. That’s an issue because many times, a simple SERP analysis would reveal that one submission:

([image source](https://grammargang.com/grammarly-review/))

...Looked exactly like the number-one result from Content Marketing Institute:

([image source](https://grammargang.com/grammarly-review/))

Today’s plagiarism tools can catch the obvious stuff, but these derivatives often slip through the cracks. Recurring paid writers contributed the bulk of the TOFU content, which would free Zach up to focus more on MOFU use cases and case studies to help visitors understand how to get the most out of their product set (from the in-house person who knows it best).

They produced marketing guides and weekly webinars to transform initial attention into new leads:

They also created free marketing tools to give prospects an interactive way to continue engaging with their brand:

In other words, they focused on doing the things that matter most — the 20% that would generate the biggest bang for their buck. They won’t ignore social networks completely, though. They still had hundreds of thousands of followers across each network. Instead, their intern would take the frontlines. That person would watch out for anything critical, like a customer question, which will then be passed off to the Customer Success Manager that will get back to them within a few hours.

New blog posts would get the obligatory push to Twitter and LinkedIn. (Facebook is used primarily for their weekly webinar updates.) Zach used [Pablo from Buffer](https://pablo.buffer.com) to design and create featured images for the blog posts.

Then he’d use an [Open Graph Protocol WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wonderm00ns-simple-facebook-open-graph-tags/) to automatically add all appropriate tags for each network. That way, all he had to do was add the file and basic post meta data. The plugin would then customize how it shows up on each network afterward. Instead of using Buffer to promote new posts, though, Zach likes [MeetEdgar](https://meetedgar.com/).

Why? Doesn’t that seem like an extra step at first glance? Like Buffer, MeetEdgar allows you to select when you’d like to schedule content. You can just load up the queue with content, and the tool will manage the rest. The difference is that Buffer constantly requires new content — you need to keep topping it off, whereas MeetEdgar will automatically recycle the old stuff you’ve previously added. This saved a blog like Kissmetrics, with thousands of content pieces, TONS of time.

([image source](https://meetedgar.com/features/))

He would then use [Sleeknote](https://sleeknote.com/) to build forms tailored to each blog category to transform blog readers into top-of-the-funnel leads:

But that’s about it. Zach didn’t do a ton of custom tweets. There weren’t a lot of personal replies. It’s not that they didn’t care. They just preferred to focus on what drives the most results for their particular business. They focused on building a brand that people recognize and trust. That means others would do the social sharing for them.

Respected industry vets like Avinash Kaushik, for example, would often share their blog posts. And Avinash was the perfect fit, because he already has a loyal, data-driven audience following him.

So that single tweet brings in a ton of highly-qualified traffic — traffic that turns into leads and customers, not just fans.

2. Combine original research and newsjacking to go viral
--------------------------------------------------------

[Sourcify](https://sourcify.com/) has grown almost exclusively through content marketing. Founder [Nathan Resnick](https://twitter.com/naterez94) speaks, attends, and hosts everything from webinars to live events and meetups. Most of their events are brand-building efforts to connect face-to-face with other entrepreneurs. But what’s put them on the map has been leveraging their own experience and platform to fuel viral stories.

Last summer, the record-breaking Mayweather vs. McGregor fight was gaining steam. McGregor was already infamous for his legendary trash-talking and shade-throwing abilities. He also liked to indulge in attention-grabbing sartorial splendor. But the suit he wore to the very first press conference somehow managed to combine the best of both personality quirks:

([image source](https://thehustle.co/conor-mcgregor-f-you-suits))

This was no off-the-shelf suit. He had it custom made. Nathan recalls seeing this press conference suit fondly: “Literally, the team came in after the press conference, thinking, ‘Man, this is an epic suit.’” So they did what any other rational human being did after seeing it on TV: they tried to buy it online.

“Except, the dude was charging like $10,000 to cover it and taking six weeks to produce.” That gave Nathan an idea. “I think we can produce this way faster.”

They “used their own platform, had samples done in less than a week, and had a site up the same day.”

([image source](https://thehustle.co/conor-mcgregor-f-you-suits))

“We took photos, sent them to different factories, and took guesstimates on letter sizing, colors, fonts, etc. You can often manufacture products based on images if it’s within certain product categories.” The goal all along was to use the suit as a case study. They partnered with a local marketing firm to help split the promotion, work, and costs.

“The next day we signed a contract with a few marketers based in San Francisco to split the profits 50–50 after we both covered our costs. They cover the ad spend and setup; we cover the inventory and logistics cost,” Nathan wrote in [an article for The Hustle](https://thehustle.co/conor-mcgregor-f-you-suits). When they were ready to go, the marketing company began running ad campaigns and pushing out stories. They went viral on [BroBible](https://brobible.com/) quickly after launch and pulled in over $23,000 in sales within the first week.

The only problem is that they used some images of Conor in the process. And apparently, his attorney’s didn’t love the IP infringement. A cease and desist letter wasn’t far behind:

([image source](https://thehustle.co/conor-mcgregor-f-you-suits))

This result wasn’t completely unexpected. Both Nathan and the marketing partner knew they were skirting a thin line. But either way, Nathan got what he wanted out of it.

3. Drive targeted, bottom-of-the-funnel leads with Quora
--------------------------------------------------------

Quora packs another punch that often elevates it over the other social channels: higher-quality traffic. Site visitors are asking detailed questions, expecting to comb through in-depth answers to each query. In other words, they’re invested. They’re smart. And if they’re expressing interest in managed WordPress hosting, it means they’ve got dough, too.

Both Sales Hacker and Kinsta take full advantage. Today, [Gaetano DiNardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/officialg/) is the Director of Demand Generation at [Nextiva](https://nextiva.com). But before that, he lead marketing at [Sales Hacker](https://www.saleshacker.com/) before they were acquired. There, content was central to their stratospheric growth. With Quora, Gaetano would take his latest content pieces and use them to solve customer problems and address pain points in the general sales and marketing space:

By using Quora as a research tool, he would find new topics that he can create content around to drive new traffic and connect with their current audience:

He found questions that they already had content for and used it as a chance to engage users and provide value. He can drive tons of relevant traffic for free by linking back to the [Sales Hacker blog](https://www.saleshacker.com/library/):

[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/), a managed WordPress hosting company out of Europe, also uses uses relevant threads and Quora ads. CMO [Brian Jackson](https://twitter.com/brianleejackson) jumps into conversations directly, lending his experience and expertise where appropriate. His technical background makes it easy to talk shop with others looking for a sophisticated conversation about performance (beyond the standard, PR-speak most marketers offer up):

Brian targets different WordPress-related categories, questions, or interests. Technically, the units are “display ads, but they look like text.” The ad copy is short and to the point. Usually something like, “Premium hosting plans starting at $XX/month” to fit within their length requirements.

4. Rank faster with paid (not organic) social promotion
-------------------------------------------------------

Kinsta co-founder [Tom Zsomborgi](https://twitter.com/tomzur) wrote about their journey in a [bootstrapping blog post](https://kinsta.com/blog/bootstrapping-startup/) that went live last November. It instantly hit the top of Hacker News, resulting in their website getting a consistent 400+ concurrent visitors all day:

Within hours their post was _also_ranking on the first page for the term “bootstrapping,” which receives around 256,000 monthly searches.

How did that happen?

“There’s a direct correlation between social proof and increased search traffic. It’s more than people think,” said Brian. Essentially, you’re paying Facebook to increase organic rankings. You take good content, add paid syndication, and watch keyword rankings go up.

Kinsta’s big goal with content promotion is to build traffic and get as many eyeballs as possible. Then they’ll use AdRoll for display retargeting messages, targeting the people who just visited with lead gen offers to start a free trial. (“But I don’t use AdRoll for Facebook because it tags on their middleman fee.”)

Brian uses the “Click Campaigns” objective on Facebook Ads for both lead gen and content promotion. “It’s the best for getting traffic.”

[Facebook's organic reach fell by 52%](http://marketingland.com/facebook-organic-reach-drop-steepens-52-publishers-pages-187253) in 2016 alone. That means your ability to promote content to _your own page fans_is quickly approaching zero.

([image source](http://marketingland.com/facebook-organic-reach-drop-steepens-52-publishers-pages-187253))

“It’s almost not even worth posting if you’re not paying,” confirms Brian. Kinsta will promote new posts to make sure it comes across their fans’ News Feed. Anecdotally, that reach number with a paid assist might jump up around 30%.

If they don’t see it, Brian will “turn it into an ad and run it separately.” It’s “re-written a second time to target a broader audience.”

In addition to new post promotion, Brian has an evergreen campaign that’s constantly delivering the “best posts ever written” on their site. It’s “never-ending” because it gives Brian a steady-stream of new site visitors — or new potential prospects to target with lead gen ads further down the funnel. That’s why Brian asserts that today’s social managers need to understand PPC and lead gen. “A lot of people hire social media managers and just do organic promotion. But Facebook organic just sucks anyway. It’s becoming “pay to play.’”

“Organic reach is just going to get worse and worse and worse. It’s never going to get better.” Also, advertising gets you “more data for targeting,” which then enables you to create more in-depth A/B tests.

We confirmed this through a series of [promoted content tests](https://getcodeless.com/promoted-content/), where different ad types (custom images vs. videos) would perform better based on the campaign objectives and placements.

([image source](https://getcodeless.com/promoted-content/))

That’s why “best practices” are past practices — or BS practices. You don’t know what’s going to perform best until you actually do it for yourself. And advertising accelerates that feedback loop.

5. Constantly refresh your retargeting ad creative to keep engagement high
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Almost every single stat](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/01/remarketing-facts) shows that remarketing is one of the most efficient ways to close more customers. The more ad remarketing impressions someone sees, the higher the conversion rate. Remarketing ads are also incredibly cheap compared to your standard AdWords search ad when trying to reach new cold traffic.

([image source](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/01/remarketing-facts))

There’s only one problem to watch out for: [ad fatigue](https://adespresso.com/blog/overcome-ad-fatigue-keep-cpa-down/). The image creative plays a massive role in Facebook ad success. But over time (a few days to a few weeks), the performance of that ad will decline. The image becomes stale. The audience has seen it too many times. The trick is to continually cycle through similar, but different, ad examples.

Here’s how [David Zheng](https://twitter.com/nansida?) does it for [BuildFire](https://buildfire.com/):

His team will either (a) create the ad creative image directly inside [Canva](https://canva.com/), or (b) have their designers create a background ‘template’ that they can use to manipulate quickly. That way, they can make fast adjustments on the fly, A/B testing small elements like background color to keep ads fresh and conversions as high as possible.

([image source](https://adespresso.com/blog/overcome-ad-fatigue-keep-cpa-down/))

All retargeting or remarketing campaigns will be sent to a tightly controlled audience. For example, let’s say you have leads who’ve downloaded an eBook and ones who’ve participated in a consultation call. You can just lump those two types into the same campaign, right? I mean, they’re both technically ‘leads.’

But that’s a mistake. Sure, they’re both leads. However, they’re at different levels of interest. Your goal with the first group is to get them on a free consultation call, while your goal with the second is to get them to sign up for a free trial. That means two campaigns, which means two audiences.

Facebook’s custom audiences makes this easy, as does LinkedIn’s new-ish [Matched Audiences](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/linkedin-news/2017/introducing-linkedin-matched-audiences0) feature. Like with Facebook, you can pick people who’ve visited certain pages on your site, belong to specific lists in your CRM, or whose email address is on a custom .CSV file:

If both of these leads fall off after a few weeks and fail to follow up, you can go back to the beginning to re-engage them. You can use content-based ads all over again to hit back at the primary pain points behind the product or service that you sell.

This seems like a lot of detailed work — largely because it is. But it’s worth it because of _scale_. You can set these campaigns up, once, and then simply monitor or tweak performance as you go. That means technology is largely running each individual campaign. You don’t need as many people internally to manage each hands-on.

And best of all, it forces you to create a logical system. You’re taking people through a step-by-step process, one tiny commitment at a time, until they seamlessly move from stranger into customer.

Conclusion
----------

Sending out a few tweets won’t make an impact at the end of the day. There’s more competition (read: noise) than ever before, while organic reach has never been lower. The trick _isn’t_ to follow some faux influencer who talks the loudest, but rather the practitioners who are doing it day-in, day-out, with the KPIs to prove it.

I am a first time investor, about 20 years old and I believe that I've established a fair portfolio but I wanted to run it by the folks in this community. I've compiled an easy to read spreadsheet of my proposed investments which is available as a photo at [https://imgur.com/QdgiwBo](https://imgur.com/QdgiwBo) (UPDATED). All of my investments will be in a Fidelity Roth IRA. I am employed while in college by the federal government, but I am not eligible for a 401k/TSP. I believe the same will be true when I transition internships in May, but I will be getting a fair pay boost.

&amp;#x200B;

I assumed that it would be fair to have somewhere between 60% and 70% in domestic stocks, and the balance in foreign stocks. I didn't choose to invest in any bonds because they seem too conservative since I am only 20 years old. As a 20 year old, I figured its best to take advantage of the power of investing young and aggressively since my horizon is so far off for retirement. Moreover, I chose the funds I have in the photo because of their fairly high performance, strong ratings from MorningStar, and (for the most part) their low expense ratios. I am unsure if it matters whether or not I vary the style of my investments, or if ensuring diversification between foreign and domestic stocks should be my main concern.

&amp;#x200B;

Do any of my investments jump out as a poor choice, or are there better choices in certain categories that you would suggest? Would you advise against the the actively managed ones I have in my proposal (I included them because they seem to have strong growth since their inception). Is one Global ex U.S. Index Fund sufficient for foreign investment, and is it the best choice (how about compared to a Fidelity ZERO index fund, established in September I believe)?  How about my two domestic index funds?

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what you think, and I most look forward to ANY suggestions and guidance that you might be able to offer. Thank you very much for your time, I truly appreciate it!

agsugk,2,2019-01-16,Advice on how to help my [23F] boyfriend [25M] cope with brief period of distance?,curious213241,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/agsugk/advice_on_how_to_help_my_23f_boyfriend_25m_cope/,"Hi everyone! 

Very, very long story short: 

My boyfriend and I have been together for just over a year. He is the love of my life. 

We have always struggled communicating when we are apart. In a few months, I will temporarily be moving cities (approx 8 hour drive from our home city) in order to complete a month-long internship. My boyfriend has already started to express real concern about how we are going to cope/get through this time apart. 


A key issue I have identified is that we both seem to have such different approaches to dealing with distance. I am a big fan of texting/calling in order to feel close and remain connected. Although this type of communication can never replace good old fashioned quality time together, it definitely helps me. 

However, my boyfriend has repeatedly said that he does not get as much out of texting as I do. His tendency when faced with distance in the past has been to pull away, want space and he has even said that talking makes it more difficult for him. This is something that I just don’t understand. I don’t think not talking for a month is a healthy option for the relationship or for me personally. I’ve asked him what else I can do to make it easier for him and he says that there is “nothing”. He seems like he’s already accepted that the time apart is going to be shit-house (if not worse) and that there’s nothing that can be done because nothing makes it easier for him. 

I understand that distance is hard. It’s hard for both of us. I also understand that it’s harder for him because I’m the one leaving, so he probably feels left behind, and because texting doesn’t “help” like it helps me. I want to make this easier for him. 

Does anyone have any thoughts, tips or advice? :) "

You’ve gotten so lucky in life. Being the youngest you’re getting everything I wish I had when I was 18. 

You have no job, you can’t maintain one, you have SO much freedom! You can come and go as you please, the parents go you a “new” car when you rolled yours. They fought the insurance company for you, they do everything for you! How do you return that favor? You disrespect them. You couldn’t even get dad his medication he needed. What did you tell them? “I ain’t walkin that far..” they can’t trust you to let the dog out to go potty or feed the horses! When your sister and I were in HS we HAD to feed the horses and take care of the animals when they left the state for vacations to medical stuff. You also have a GIRLFRIEND.. I couldn’t even have a boyfriend at 18. 

You know what happened when I wrecked my car?? I walked, several miles, to work.. I bummed rides.. I had a full time job.  I put myself through college, I was PUSHED to be a productive adult. Guess what?? I became one, I have a full time job, a retirement, two bachelor degrees, and three years into my career. I worked three jobs and an internship, on top of full time college. I had two jobs in the summer, I knew what taxes were and how to file them. I bought my OWN car, I’ve lived on my own once I turned 18. Our parents couldn’t.. or wouldn’t help me when I was 18.

When I call you out on your BS, you cuss me out, you put me down because I’m single? Because of my career? Jealous? Insecure? Know I’m 100% right?

I tried my hardest to love you, too your childhood and mine was not easy. I helped raise you.. I never really developed love for you.. when given the chance you picked out nmom over our dad. When nmom began stealing money and ruining your life.. you ran to daddy.. now, you don’t care. 

You skipped thanksgiving dinner this year.. you spent it WITH SOME OTHER FAMILY! God,  your a winner. Oh and Christmas? You only came up for food.. then changed the WiFi password.. knowing I need the WiFi because there is no cell service out there and my job needs a way to contact me. 

To top off your behavior, you LIED to our parents and your friends parents about me needing your help.. that I was in danger?? I had several missed calls and texts from our parents worrying about my health and safety.. you know what I was doing?? WORKING like a real adult does. Our parents laugh it off.

You are an intelligent human being.. but your choosing to be a manipulative little bastard. 

I hope your girlfriend raises her standards and dumps your ass for a REAL MAN. 

I tried really hard to include you in my life. I had you on all my social media and I would talk to you. Now, after tonight, you are blocked on all my social media and removed from my life.

The people who suffers? Dad and our step mom because I will no longer visit till your toxic presence is GONE..

Grow up little boy. Life is going to donkey kick you right in the mouth.

Fuck you. "

agthxy,4,2019-01-16,Panic Attack?,falangaTDG,PanicAttack,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/agthxy/panic_attack/,"Hey everyone, just wanted to touch some light on what has been happening to me, maybe in hopes of some feedback. 

Last Sunday, my parents got into a really REALLY bad fight, leaving details out, one that was very drastic. I was the catalyst for the fight, because of -long story, very short- school. I need to do internship hours. Everything else is good. I’ve been doing what I’ve can, but my mom guilt trips and yells at me all the time.  It was devastating, but I carried on. 

It’s been a couple days since that happened, been going to school and work, days consisting of going internship from 9AM to 2 PM and then bartending from 3:30 PM till 1 AM. That following Thursday, I felt weird after going home from internship (no work, but stayed from 9-3:30). I got on the train, and felt pretty dizzy, a sensation as if I wasn’t there, eyes felt like I was blurring (sort of), panicking, and the idea of death loomed large. I felt like I couldn’t breathe either and felt my heart racing. I didn’t have service under the subway, but when I called my girlfriend, I felt a little more relieved, but still extremely nervous. When I got off the train, I was contemplating on calling the ambulance, but I managed to make it home, feeling nausea as well. 

When I got home I felt a lot worse but after talking with my brother about what I felt, he said it could be a panic attack considering what happened that Sunday. I felt relieved and went to took a bath. I felt MUCH better and relaxed and managed to go get some sleep. When I woke up, it was dinner time. Parents, brother and I. No one was really talking with each other and I felt a little hesitate with what just happened prior. Then my dad asked what I felt, and I didn’t know what to say, or explain how I felt. I didn’t have an appetite either, and left the table. My mom was yelling at me till I came back and suddenly I felt really scared, I had shortness of breathe, feeling dizzy, heart racing, felt like I was gonna pass out. I went to the bed and told my brother to bring me to the hospital, extremely scared. 
 
We managed to get to the urgent care, since it was up the block. When I saw the doctor, I had “calmed” down a lot, she checked my breathing and said “your breathing is fine” (even tho I believed I was breathing as if I was struggling). I was still scared but felt a lot better. My breathing calmed down a lot and then the doctor said did anything bad happen recently, and I instantly - without even thinking twice - broke down, crying like a baby. I could t stop crying no matter how hard I tried to stop. She said I should possibly see a psych and what not. I felt so much better that rest of the night. 

The week forth, I’ve been having mini episodes, feeling it come on here and there but kind of stopping it, thanks to this sub. 

Is it normal to still experience these things? Sometimes I get lost in my thoughts, and then I feel the onslaught. I started writing this and felt like I was gonna have a panic attack, and as I’m closing this writing off, I’m feeling good. "
agtm2o,2,2019-01-16,I gave up making friends. They all leave me in the end.,IronxPhoenix,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/agtm2o/i_gave_up_making_friends_they_all_leave_me_in_the/,"You know the story.

Throughout my life, people have been absolutely useless or worse, just like me. I am much older and officially convinced of this. So let me spill my boring life because I have nothing else to lose.

Elementary School - Was diagnosed with autism because my parents are stupid enough to believe anything some asshat says. Self explanatory why nobody wanted to be friends with me but the best part is this: Didn't even turn out to be true. Some dumb bitch said I was 'cured' after gradual inclusion. I was still more inclined to hug a N64 controller or LEGO set.

Middle School - Was diagnosed with schizophrenia because my sense of worthlessness somehow manifested into an imaginary friend. I was also fat. Double whammy. The only positive out of this was that nothing interesting happened other than learning next to useless garbage and not needing to remember who the hell anyone is. I ditched the imaginary friend for a Playstaion and Runescape.

High School - High school is full of fake people acting tribal about stupid shit nobody sincerely cares about. Finally I found a group of random dudes that were basically some dickwad's posse to join. At least we played videogames. I was still fat so I deserved it somehow. That's what I would tell myself because it is verifiable true. Your opinion can be automatically invalidated mainly because you are fat. I lost a few pounds to play football and track to mainly get my Dad's respect back and 'make friends'. I even joined clubs just to get my parents to shut the hell up about what i did with my spare time and 'make new friends.' Nothing.  On top of that I even tried doing Honors Classes, where I was left to have my intelligence insulted in every angle possible. By some sick miracle I passed my classes, but no study-buddies for me! I was left out hung and dry. I joined clubs. I even got a god damned internship editing videos. Those friends I made? All of them stopped talking to me right after we all graduated. I hate them all anyway, every time I hear about them they are either in the local news for dying or for committing crimes.

College - Remember that whole thing about extracurricular? All that effort for classes, extra bullshit and sports was wasted anyway. Those activities are pointless and don't boost my CV. Doesn't get met into a good college. It was all about how much money you'd give up to follow in complete lockstep with some asshole who tells you what's on the exam anyway. You know... exactly like high school!  The worst part is I made that same exact identical mistake. I joined clubs, did dodge-ball, running long distances for no reason. I lost weight, didn't make me feel better, but it was something that finally got my parents' attention and made them think I was worth a shit. I desperately tried making friends. I was called a rapist by my first group of 'friends.' I got more satisfaction being alone and finding subtle ways to ruin their lives in proxy. I somehow made friends with the rest of the outcast people who were oddly enough OK with me and more grateful for a human relationship than I ever would have been. Made even amazingly a few normal pals but somehow I became the butt end of their jokes. I became an orientation leader since I was so good at having impostor syndrome, so why not do it for money? Unless you consider loan collectors friends, this didn't work. Just like last time: ALL OF THEM STOPPED TALKING TO ME RIGHT AFTER WE ALL GRADUATED. I even told  myself a lie saying that was the best time of my life, when in reality it was a waste of time and money. It felt so real so I could almost believe my own bullshit, but in the end they are all the same fake people from high school that didn't learn a thing other than how to get drunk, spread STDs and do drugs.

Work - I worked at a call center. I met some people. I even went out drinking with some of them.  They even threw me a birthday party. Probably one of the best ones I had. I moved to a different department that had a measly pay increase. The vast majority there there hates me now. I'm basically avoided like I have the plague unless they want to tell me how bad it is there and want to get moved up the corporate ladder. I have yet to understand why, but I'm sure its's a human nature thing. Pretty sure my boss hates my guys like all the rest of this new oh so good department does too. Nobody talks to me unless they need me to do something. That's just about as good as it's going to get. I put on a few pounds and that was enough to spark speeches from my parents that I need to do more of everything. Wow thanks, I never knew I needed to just DO MORE of EVERYTHING.

Dating - My sexlife was governed by six different dating apps. Yes, you read that right. Six. Nothing interesting happened at best. At worst, I would waste my time meeting someone that basically lead me on from the start. I deleted them just last year and it feels so much more satisfying.

I'm reduced to a machine that mashes buttons for a living until ready to be discarded or replaced. Reduced to a nobody to serve his purpose and then fuck off. I'm no more than an easily disposable man ready to be fed lies for comfort to the outsider. That truth has loomed over me for the past ten years.

I hate people and what they do. They ruined my life."

I knew him before also as he used to work in the same company as mine, but he left a few days after I joined to pursue his degree. Fast forward one year and coincidentally, I got an admit in the same university and program as he did and ended up joining the same course, with him my senior.

As i had known him before, I thought of him as more of a friend rather than a senior, and I used to go to his home sometimes, and he also invited me over a couple of times. Come internship season, which he had already gone through last year, I thought that it would be helpful if he could send me a list of companies he had applied for. I knew he maintained a list because he had told me that I should keep a track of companies that I had applied to, as it will be easier to manage. I remember him saying he had applied to around 120-130 companies himself. I had myself applied to around **100 companies before asking him for the company list. 

I had asked him for the list to ensure I do not miss out on any company he might have applied to, because I had indeed missed out on a few deadlines.

He got angry and told me that it was disrespectful of his hardwork to ask him of something like this. I asked him for the list directly, as I thought it won't be that big of an issue, and if it needed some clarification, I would provide him with that.

I understand that I should have taken up a more diplomatic approach and let him first know the whole problem, and then asked him for his help, but I thought that won't be required as he was my friend.

Am I in the wrong for asking him for this?"

(Rant),thyfe,eczema,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/aguyjh/dont_you_love_that_eczema_smell_rant/,"You know, the weird smell of your open wounds from the eczema on your face that makes you feel like your skin is rotting? (I mean this sarcastically, of course.) 

Hey all, long-time eczema haver, but new to r/eczema. I've had eczema basically since I was an infant, and my partner recently suggested that I come here to read posts from other eczema sufferers; I was really glad they sent me here because seeing the community here gathered around our Common Skin Evil is... sad but pretty heartening. That is, it's nice to see I'm not alone, and that there are so many of y'all who understand what it's like.

My whole life I've had pretty mild eczema, but it wasn't until May 2017 that things got really out of hand. That month, I tried a Tony Moly face mask and had the first of MANY horrible flare-ups that still plague me today. My face was swollen and red for a whole month before it went away, and then... it actually did go away for an entire year, until May 2018. 

The same thing happened this past May, except with no trigger whatsoever. It may be notable that both flare-ups happened the weekend right before I started my summer internships, but I really think it's just a horrible coincidence. Anyways, my face was the same as the year before: swollen and red, but this time, it didn't go away after a month. Oh no, it continued to spread all over my body, to the point that I had large, raised, deep red, and extremely itchy patches all over my body. They also wept fluid, so much that my face and neck were literally wet all the time and my sheets would get pus stains from my body. I was clocking almost no hours of sleep because of this, and because I was constantly drenching my sheets in sweat and overheating (I'm trans and am taking testosterone, which makes me sweat much more than I did before), which worsened my itchiness. I finally decided to go to an allergist, which I hadn't been to since I was a child after my mom decided that I didn't need allergy shots anymore (it was understandably very difficult for her to find time in her work schedule to take me every week!). 

My allergist took one look at me and told me that I had hives, NOT eczema, which was a shocker to me. He had me apply for Xolair and prescribed me a cocktail of antihistamines (I'm currently taking Zyrtec 3x a day, Zantac 3x a day, Singulair, Hydroxyzine, and Benadryl), as well as some topical steroids. The ensuing summer was a slow hell for me, as even though I was approved for Xolair, I did NOT have an Epipen (or equivalent) and Epipens just happened to be recalled in June or July and on backorder. I didn't even get to start Xolair until November when my allergist gave me a sample of Auvi-Q she received, and was basically on Prednisone tapers on and off for months. I went back to my allergist's office in November and saw a different allergist, who then told me that I had severe atopic eczema, NOT urticaria!! I'm not sure if I had hives initially, which then led to a prolonged eczema flare-up, or what, but I know that I definitely have eczema now after being told that and comparing my experience with several folks on this sub-reddit. 

I've been on Xolair for two months now, which as you can guess, has not helped at all. I've been told to wait at least 3-4 months until seeing results, but I don't expect to see any, as Xolair is for chronic urticaria, not eczema. I scheduled an appointment with my allergist for early February, however, to talk about starting Dupixent, so that's what I'm currently holding out for right now. Like most of you can relate, I'm just so tired of constantly being in pain and Looking Like This. Right now, I'm on yet another Prednisone taper that I just started today, and I can't even smile and have to eat more soupy foods due to the fact that I can't open or move my mouth much because I have open cracks at the corners of my mouth, as well as cracks all over my upper lip. My eyelid swelling is starting to go down though, and I don't have to struggle to keep my eyes open anymore. 

My latest flare-up comes right after a 12-day Prednisone taper starting from 60mg that ended last week, and I'm extremely upset that my body is so reliant on this steroid and that now only very high doses really help at all. The taper I just started today starts at 20mg and will last until I can see my allergist again. Has anyone else here been taking very high doses of Prednisone like me? I've been on and off the steroid since June... so about 7 months, but I think I've been basically continuously doing tapers the whole time. I've gained about 10-15 pounds because of it, with a lot of it going to my face, as I understand Prednisone can cause a ""moon face"". It's really made my self-confidence plummet; my parents and grandparents have no filter and are always telling me I'm fat whenever I visit :-( That, and I'm worried I'm going to develop steroid-induced diabetes and osteoporosis, which I'm already at risk for both because of direct family members having them already. 

I don't know! Suffering from severe eczema is a lot! I'm tired of being in constant pain, having to avoid foods that make me flare up, having a swollen and red face, and have dry and cracked skin all the time. I'm sick of going out to class and work looking SUPER shiny because I'm covered in Vaseline jelly, which I think highlights how horribly lumpy and swollen my face looks. I hate that my boss's parents (I work as a server for a family restaurant) always point out that my face is red, when it's literally red like, EVERYDAY!!! I especially hate the cruel irony of working in a sushi restaurant but not being able to eat any raw sushi, which I absolutely LOVE, because raw fish makes my flare-ups worse. 

If you read this far, then thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read about my eczema experience and braving my hastily written and badly-organized thoughts. At least I know that a silver lining for me is that I can probably start Dupixent within the next month or two, which I'm really hoping will give me some relief. I'm wishing you the best in your journey to recovery from eczema!"

I was recently admitted into the uiuc college of engineering for computer science. However, in addition to computer science I was also interested in electrical engineering so I was considering a double major. Is this allowed? And if so, how many additional classes will I have to take to get the EE degree in addition to the Cs degree, how many classes overlap? Also, if I decide to double major, how difficult will my course load be, will I still have time to participate in undergrad research or an internship while getting a full 8 hours of sleep?

Also, when will I have to make my decision of double majoring by? At the beginning of freshman year? During Sophmore year? Thanks for the help, I'm really confused."

I am studying Psychology at the moment. I know that to work as a psychologist, you need to have the qualifications and titles, which means Master's is finished (at least in Finland).

People who study Computer Science (CS) can get a job easily from a software company while they study. But what can we noobs look for when the summer vacation comes? Where can I get more experience from this field? I don't think it matters to me what kind of work it is, as long as it is related to *Psychology* and paid, or internship (but those come while doing Master's I think [?] ).

Any suggestions?"
agvuiu,0,2019-01-17,The summer of '18 part 1,SecretlyWantingMore,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/agvuiu/the_summer_of_18_part_1/,"I just wanted to share my story with people that wouldn't just call me an asshole, this may get lengthy but here goes:

For background I'm 21M, AP is 25F. AP has been close to my family for the past 7 years or so, grew up down the street from me, she regularly babysat my sister, and is basically family to my siblings. I go to school 2 states away from where I grew up and AP lives about an hour and a half away from my hometown. I feel kinda weird referring to her as AP so for the rest of this I'm going to call her ""Brooke"", obviously not her real name. 

It all started when I had come back home for the summer from college, had a nice 8-5 internship during the week, and spent most weekends drinking with my friends. 

My friends birthday was coming up on a week where my parents would conveniently be out of town, and some of my friends from school were coming down to stay with me, absolutely perfect situation. The only variable I hadn't accounted for was Brooke, who stayed at our house for the entire week taking care of my little sister. I wasn't too worried about this but I know how some of my friends drink, especially on special occasions, and would probably end up playing host more than actually having fun, but I figured if I keep my friends in the back yard, everything will be alright.

The party is Saturday, friends come in Friday night, thursday after I get home from a long day of work (I think it was my first hard day in my internship) and I'm excited and stressed about the weekend. I get home and greet Brooke and my sister. Brooke asks how my day was and I just say ""I need a beer"". She says something along the lines of ""That bad, huh? Grab me one too."" 
(Additional background: Brooke has a boyfriend of 2+ years, and while she is a family friend, her and I never really talked before I went to college. We didn't really know each other as people, and I've come more into myself since highschool)
We sat in my kitchen and over a couple Mich Ultras just talked about everything, life, college experiences, family. I didn't think much of it at the time but it was really easy talking to her, although romantic feelings weren't even a blip on my radar at this point, they may have been for her. 

Friday night my friends are coming in late and I'm staying up to make sure they get here alright. Brooke and I are just sitting in the living room, just kind of getting along, it's at this point I knew our relationship went from awkward kid and the older girl from down the street to something more. We just clicked. I'd known her for almost half of my life, but it was like I was getting to know her for the first time, and I liked her.

On Saturday night the party happens, about a dozen of my friends from home and three from school are all drinking, swimming, sitting round the fire, college party things. I'm running in and out of house taking care of things, pulling my friend out of the pool after he had too much, hosing off my back patio after that same friend threw up on it. All the while Brooke is sitting inside watching my sister and kind of playing the responsible adult to all this shenanigans. After my sister goes to bed though I went back into the kitchen to make myself a drink, asked Brooke how she was doing, and noticed she was drinking a vodka tonic. She replied ""good, just having a few drinks what it being a party and all"". 

At this point the party was kind of dying down, most people had left, and I offered to make her a drink. It wasn't too complicated of a drink but as I was getting the ingredients together she comes from the living room to stand right next to me. We talked for a little while longer about I don't even know what, but I do remember that as I finish making the drink, our faces are about six inches apart. She says to me ""you know you're really attractive, right?"".

Now, I am bad at flirting, meaning I do not know when I'm flirting with someone, and I sure as hell am bad at noticing when someone is flirting with me. But that got my attention. I kinda turned and looked at her for an eternity-long second, then put my lips on hers in what I can describe as the most intoxicating kiss of my life. Very soon after that we are in bed almost tearing clothes off each other. 

After 2 hours of fucking, collapsing in eachothers arms, and laughing in sheer disbelief at where we were and what we just did, I went back to my bed, knowing we couldn't walk out of the same bedroom in the morning. 

I couldn't believe what I had just done, and also couldn't believe how I felt very little guilt about it. I have met her boyfriend, he's not a bad guy, I don't know him well enough to say that he's a good guy but he seems perfectly fine. But holy shit, I just fucked Brooke. 

The next day was odd, my friends from school put it together pretty quick, not that it was an issue. But I didn't know how to act. Brooke was acting like everything was perfectly normal. I was still in shock I guess. 

That night, after my friends left Brooke told me I was acting weird, to which I told her this isn't a situation I've been well acquainted with. But once I got the chance to talk to her again my nerves calmed down and we got to talk about what happened, now that we're both sober. I asked her if this was a one night stand. She put on that same wicked, sexy smile that I see everytime I close my eyes and said ""I don't think so. I want to know what you feel like sober"". Somewhat needless to say, we went at it like rabbits on coke. We spent a long time tangled up together just laughing and talking about anything that came to mind, like we had been together for years. I felt like she was a part of me that had been there forever, still do today. After getting up and one of us dragging the other back into bed a few times, I went back to my bed, scared and excited for what I had just found.

The next day my parents were coming home, but we spent every private moment we had kissing, stupidly smiling at eachother, dying to jump back in bed. By the time she left I had already began longing for the next time I'd see her. 

That weekend kickstarted the most terrifyingly beautiful relationship I've ever had with another person.



Sorry for the length and my general writing ability. I do plan on posting the rest of the story once I get around to putting the events into words. Any feedback is appreciated :)"

agxwwc,9,2019-01-17,"CS Bachelor degree: Groningen, Delft or Twente?",Keta47,StudyInTheNetherlands,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudyInTheNetherlands/comments/agxwwc/cs_bachelor_degree_groningen_delft_or_twente/,"Hello Reddit

\*Warning, kinda long, but I woud really appreciate your opinion\*

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm in my last year of high-school (12th) in Romania (Eastern Europe), and I plan to continue my studies in Netherlands. I have been conditionally admitted to the following universities (considering that I will pass the final exam (the baccalaureate) with at least 6, which I don't consider a problem):

* University of Twente -  Technical Computer Science
* University of Groningen - Computing Science
* Radboud University - Computing Science (this was kind of a back-up option, in case I wasn't admitted to the others. Now, I don't consider taking courses on this one)
* \* TU Delft - Computer Science and Engineering (a numerus clausus of 500 students has been introduced this year, and I have to pass the exam. But I don't really worry about it, because I consider my math skills mediocre at least, plus that I'm taking their edX course right now)

As for myself, I'm going to lay some facts about me, that are going to influence my university top choice:

1. The budget - My parents are going to help me with the living expenses for the first 4-6 months (until I can start working 45h per month and be able to loan money). After that, I'm on my own. Everything I will spend will be from loaned money and the job. This is why I excluded big cities like Amsterdam, because they have high accommodation prices. **In conclusion, the less expenses, the better.** N.B.: the ability to find a job where I can speak english is also of upmost importance. Rn, I have 6 months experience as a bartender. NB2: if a university has higher internship opportunities, it would be EXTREMELY beneficial for me to choose that one. 
2. I value both the information and the experience the university gives me. If it would be for a percentage, 65% studies, 35% fun. For example, if one university is only 10% better in terms of quality, but the city gives 30-40% more opportunities to have fun, I would take the latter.
3. I consider myself a C++ intermediate. I have been studying this language for 4 years throughout high school, with an average of 7 hours per week. Python and SQL very basic notions. So, I don't start from scratch.
4. I don't mind the fact that Groningen is 2h away from the big cities. 

Considering all of these, I have two questions:

\- If I'm admitted to TU Delft, would their program quality compensate for the city's higher costs? If I'm not admitted, or if it's not worth it, the second bullet comes into action

\- I'm torn between Twente and Groningen. Right now I'm considering Groningen since is has a higher place in the global ranking, has an active night-life, the campus has a higher male:female proportion and from what I've understood, jobs value scientific universities more than technical ones.  

&amp;#x200B;

What would you think?

TL DR: Main considerations: low budget, the ability to have fun. I don't know if Delft's prices are worth it, and I'm still considering between Twente and Groningen, although I favor Groningen.

agy07e,1,2019-01-17,Girlfriend thinks I don't want to be serious about us.,Tjeerdmeister,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/agy07e/girlfriend_thinks_i_dont_want_to_be_serious_about/,"Not sure where I can ask this so this seemed the best place. I (21) have been dating my girlfriend (20) for over 2 years now. 

Lately my libido has been down a lot and we barely have sex anymore. We talked about this last night and I told her that I've been very tired lately, plus I've had some troubles with getting it up/staying hard sometimes. When that happens, I feel really really bad and selc conscious about myself. So because I'm scared that it'll happen again, I can't seem to focus on enjoying myself (and her) as much and it happens again because I don't have any focus.

Besides this, we've gotten to the point where we're looking for places to move in together. We're actively looking, because the house market is total shit at the moment. She wants to spend a few months abroad to study, and I told her that I might be interested in doing my internship abroad too. She replied with the point that if I wanted to do my internship abroad, moving in together would have to wait until I'm back. I told her that I was aware, and then said that the internship abroad would probably be too much of a hassle to do, because I have to arrange literally everything myself for it. So after a long silence (we're both studying at the moment) she asked me if I wanted to go study in a different room, and then said that I wasn't serious about our relationship anymore.

I'm around at her parents' house a lot, I sleep there most of the time. I buy her things, I help her parents around and her two sisters. We go out when possible to do things together, for instance we play Pokemon Go together, or spend a day in a zoo etc. 

What can I do to improve my libido, and what can I do to make her know that I still want to be with her and still move in together? What am I doing wrong?"

Don't skip anything. Master it all.

Just wanted to share that since I had a few classmates who didn't take the course seriously last semester. 

Also, for anyone who is struggling with finding an internship, Handshake is an amazing tool and a great starting point for finding up to date job postings before moving on to other sites like indeed.com.

agyl3r,2,2019-01-17,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/agyl3r/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! It's a new one, so I'm sure there are kinks to work out along the way, but I really like the concept!

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"

I'm studying abroad and taking a bunch of Exercise Science classes in England and am planning on getting an internship over the summer for Physical Therapy. After I graduate, I will hopefully be helping my professor in a research project. My grades aren't the best. Most of the classes that tanked my GPA were from Computer Science, but my grades are generally not that great. I have most B's, some B-'s, and a couple of A's in the sciences/prerequisites for grad school.

My plan is to take a gap year, work to save up money while getting observation hours and studying for the GRE. With all of that said, would it be best for me to become a PTA then work my way into getting my DPT? Or shoot straight for the doctorate and prepare for it by retaking classes? On top of that, how would retaking classes work? Do graduate programs even consider you despite retaking classes?

Staying hopeful and looking forward to some feedback.  "
ah0b07,26,2019-01-17,"Do I even want kids, or does everyone else just want me to?",NaiveFish,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/ah0b07/do_i_even_want_kids_or_does_everyone_else_just/,"Hi guys. This is actually my first time posting to Reddit at all. I'm new to the platform after just following the good stuff vicariously through my boyfriend for the last several years. I've come to this thread because I am someone who has only sort of recently embraced the ""childfree"" mindset. I still sometimes struggle with this urge toward being a mom, but it's insanely difficult for me to tell how much of that is influenced by actually truly wanting to be a mom and how much of it is external pressure.

A little about me:

I am a 26 year old woman who grew up in the south. I am the oldest of three siblings. I am non-religious but formerly   
a Christian. Essentially all of my friends want children. I deal with intense family pressure to have children. And my workplace is one in which nearly everyone has kids and I would stick out like a sore thumb if I were to ever express my honest desires there.

I am a good deal older than my siblings and my dad traveled for work, so I was functionally a parent--or at the very least a caretaker--to my siblings. I always volunteered in the nursery at church. I studied martial arts throughout middle and high school and was an instructor in the kids' classes for several years. I was always surrounded by children and entered adulthood never really even questioning if I wanted kids or whether or not I would have them. It seemed to me as guaranteed as going to college or paying taxes.

In college, I studied abroad multiple times and developed a deep passion for travel. I did lots of exciting internships like lobbying/advocacy work on Capitol Hill. I partied. I explored non-monogamy. I discovered that I'm bisexual. I broadened my horizons immensely in terms of what my future could look like. I discovered there was more to life than getting a reasonable job and a house in the suburbs, marrying a nice man, and popping out a few babies. 

On the flipside, I have some complicated feelings. There are few things as enjoyable to me as spending a couple of hours rocking a sleeping baby. I love running around with a toddler (I play a killer game of hide and seek). I like helping older kids understand concepts. I think I could be a great mentor to a teenager.

I just... don't want to do it all the time. 

I struggle immensely with the idea of being consumed by ""mom life."" I don't want to work from 9-5 and then get home to take care of tiny humans until bed. I don't want to lose myself in the experience. I love sleeping in on Saturdays with my boyfriend. I love taking our dog on walks whenever we want. I love being able to book trips without factoring in a kid. I literally never sit around and think ""man, I wish I was taking care of a kid right now."" I sometimes wish that I could hold a baby, but I don't ever wish to have one full time.

I wouldn't say I'm decidedly, 100% childfree. I would say that I lean heavily toward it. I still deal with some urges sometimes to be a mom. But I am having a really hard time lately determining how much that urge is based on my true desires and how much is just general external pressure.

Like I mentioned earlier, my parents are both dead-set on me being a mom. They are divorced but each separately foster this view. When I say it comes up nearly every time I see or speak to either of them, I am truly not exaggerating. My dad asked for my social security number yesterday for a life insurance policy and said, ""memorize your kids' socials and be better than me!"" My mom recently told me to buy a bigger food processor than the one I was looking at as ""an investment in my future bigger family."" It comes up in big and small ways CONSTANTLY.

I deal with it from my friends as well. I recently mentioned to one of my closest friends that I was on the fence about having kids, and she lectured me on how it's my civic duty because I'm smart and would raise decent human beings. Even my one childfree friend, who is 40, recently implied that I'm too young to know that I don't want kids. I have story after story just like this.

I also deal with some anxiety surrounding the fact that so many of our friends intend to have kids. Most of our friends are married or engaged. Many of them are looking to start having kids as early as this year. I worry a lot about being the odd ones out, or one day realizing we've lost all of our friends because they're all so caught up in parenthood. I worry I'll regret not just joining in on the ""fun"" for the sake of keeping my sense of community. I realize that I shouldn't feel that way, and that would be a terrible reason to become a mom, but it's a struggle I have all the same.

So all that's to say--has anyone else dealt with the process of trying to listen solely to their own feelings over all the outside noise? Or just reading what I wrote here, does anyone have any other thoughts or advice? I have no one to talk to about this really, besides my boyfriend, but I could enjoy some third-party opinions.

ah18pu,146,2019-01-17,Dressel Dive Club Dive Master Internship strongly NOT Recommend,B-Georgio,scuba,https://www.reddit.com/r/scuba/comments/ah18pu/dressel_dive_club_dive_master_internship_strongly/,"The intent of this post is to inform potential future interns of what to expect for the Dressel Dive Club DM internship. 

The four main issues I’ll be addressing are-
1: Unorganized 
2: Physically unhealthy exposures
3: Mentally unhealthy working environment 
4: sub-par guidance and education 

I am from the United States (MN) where I’m an engineer in biomed and had the serious misfortune of moving to Mexico for a DM internship with Dressel Dive Club. I  recently turned 30 and getting my DM has been a personal goal of mine since I started diving in my teens so I figured taking a 6 month vacation would be a good way to bring in my new decade. 

It started out with looking up DM internships on line, Dressel pops up on top of google search saying that it’s free and provides housing, they just require you to be there for 180 days. I applied, had a Skype interview and was given on offer right on the spot where they said I’d be interning at their Playa Del Carmen (PDC) location, which I was very excited for- this was 5months prior to my start date

Sorry for the novel, there are many more examples I left out to keep this somewhat short - AMA

Point 1- unorganized 
About a week before my move to a new country I asked what the address for the intern house is. I was told they didn’t know what house I’d be assigned to yet, but they’d assign me to one when I arrived, which got me a bit nervous and hesitant. My first day I arrived to the PDC location, where my arrival was unexpected and seemed burdensome to the admins I dealt with. They had me sit down for the day and go over very poorly translated contracts, and read their company policy book that they call The Bible.  At the end of the day they told me they didn’t have room at the PDC location and I’d be transferred to the Paraiso location (45min north of PDC). This was very irritating because I had family and friends that had already made reservations to visit me at the PDC location, and the hotel charged for the location change even though they are all Iberostar resorts. Also I didn’t know if I’d change locations again as they were very vague about placement as I asked them about it. 

After the first day at the resort I was brought to one of the intern house where I was told I’d be staying. Walking in to place I was very put off by the moldy stench through the entirety of it, the puke / shit / mold plastered bathrooms, and the fact that there was no available bed for me. The place housed 8 interns, all of which where very nice and easy to get along with, but shared the same views towards the Dressel DM experience which was “welcome to hell”.  

During the interview I was told the living situation is structured like a hostel, so I came with very low expectations, but I’ve never seen a hostel in such horrible conditions before. I stayed at a hostel in Belize in 2013 called Dirty McNasties, that charge $6/night and came with free bedbugs, Dirty McNasties ranked higher then this place IMO. I slept on the floor the first night as the only open furniture was a stinky,, moist 4’ long love seat. I was moved the next day to another shitty intern house where there was an open mattress, though it was covered in mold. The next week I was told I needed to move to the 3rd intern house which was actually decent and closer to what I was expecting, but after 2 weeks there I was told I needed to move back to the initial house due to a new couple starting the DM program that required more privacy so I moved 4 times in 4 weeks.

Point 2: Health
For 5 hours a day you are made to do pool demos that insist of walking around and bugging resort guest if they would like to try a free demo in the pool, which I was actually excited to do as I enjoy meeting new people and sharing my hobbies / passions with. The first demo I did went fine, and the person caught on very quickly and was stoked on the new experience. When we got to the surface after making a lap around the pool they said that it was awesome and they were going to sign up for a discovery course and then mentioned they didn’t realize how disgusting the pool was. I looked down and saw that every grout line in the tile pool was black, I touch it and it blew up into an underwater cloud of black mold spores. This is found throughout the 2 main clorinated pools at the resort. It was also noticed that there was a halocline of what I assume is piss by all the swim up bars. After my first day in the pool I felt myself getting an ear infection (I was expecting to get 1 or 2 over the 6month internship) by the second day it was full blown ear infection. 
During my 30 days with Dressel I had 4 ear infections, and thought I would have permanent hearing damage. I also had the stomach twice from accidentally swallowing pool water during demos, which I could literally feel/tract the dirty water got down my throat hit my stomach and make its way through my digestive system. There was also foot fungus (never had before in my life) which I contracted on day two and had the entire time I was there, it was so bad that my foot skin was cracking wide open to a point it was so painful I could barely walk. 

Point 3: Unhealthy Work Environment
All the other interns were awesome people, however management was a bunch of narcissistic fear mongering ass-hats that would go out of there way to make your work experience not pleasant. Interns are able to sit out the fun dives if we have ear infections, but to still have to do demo work in the disgusting pools unless we brought in  a doctors note. 

However the biggest issue I have with Dressel is they do not submit any of the PADI certs (through snail mail)until you finish 180 days of work, and they are very trigger happy to fire interns weeks before their completion, making there time with Dressel a waste. One intern got fired with 2 weeks left of their 6 
Month internship, and did not receive their advanced, rescue and DM certs because they were caught on their phone. I got fired on thanksgiving for texting my family on my first week, the head of operations was sneakily auditing me at demo and caught me send a text. He called me in his office and said I was fired for being on my phone at demo and that I signed a “no phone” contract on my first day. I told him I was never informed of the policy, and did not sign any contract of that nature. After looking through my paperwork it was determined I was never given that contract to sign. After 20min of toying with me about being fired or not (having a huge smile on his face the entire time) he told me that was my first and final warning. The same person has had his truck burnt down twice and physically beaten up by the local staff for fucking them over as well. 

Point 4: sub-par guidance and instructors
I really debated writing this point, as the instructors are my friends and overall awesome people and great divers. However Dressel has an extremely high turnover rate, the most senior person (not including the site manager) had been there for 6mo and has since quit. All the certified instructors had been certified within the previous few months, and did provide adequate instruction. For example my Peek Performance Buoyancy for advanced consisted of writing my name on the sand while upside down in the water. When I did my advanced with the dive center I switched to, my very experienced instructor spent 4hrs on PPB, that consisted of figuring on my proper weight amount and distribution. "
ah1xfu,1,2019-01-17,Applying for H-1b now or wait until last chance next year,nummerfem,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/ah1xfu/applying_for_h1b_now_or_wait_until_last_chance/,"Hey guys. I'm a Swedish citizen that got my bachelors here in the US. I've been with my company since I graduated now, soon to be 2 years. We applied for an H-1b last year but didn't get selected, so since then I've gone back for a masters degree and working under a CPT internship. I've been talking to my boss about applying again this April, but after checking with the attorney we used last year they said that, while it should be cheaper than last year since they have most of my info ready, we'd still be looking at a $4-5k cost for the initial application - not including potential RFE costs..

&amp;#x200B;

That's a lot of money obviously but it's supposedly a really good attorney – my boss found them on a list of top immigration attorneys in NYC... However, because of the cost now he's been saying that maybe we should just hold off until next year. That worries me since I'd be stuck paying tuition for a whole year extra, and if I don't get selected next year I'd be completely out of luck.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it necessary to have ""the best of the best"" attorneys for something like an H-1b filing, or should I convince them that we could be looking at cheaper alternatives to at least apply at all this year? Or are my worries crazy to wait another year – is there another option?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any input."

I've done so much to lose weight but it's not happening fast enough and I'm not happy with my body. When I look in the mirror and I'm almost disgusted with what I look like some days. Not even my body just with the way my face looks. I don't want to feel like this about myself anymore I want to go back to loving the person I was before my ex girlfriend destroyed me.

Maybe you’re a married woman, and have been for a while now. You no longer have that spark from the honeymoon phase, whether you’ve been married for ten years or twenty. You used to be very careful about keeping up appearances, going to the gym, shaving your body, and more. But now, things have quieted down on that front.

Or maybe you have never been married. You like to enjoy yourself with as many men that you choose. Tying yourself down to one guy was never in your plan and that is perfectly fine with everyone ;)

Regardless of the type of life you lead, you have somehow found me. I’m young and handsome, and in many ways I am exactly the kind of young guy you've been looking for. Not surprising, I'm instantly turned on by a sexy older woman like you. Maybe you see me at the gym and catch me sneaking glances at your ass. You think it sags a bit, and you know you have cellulite on your thighs, but I still keep on checking you out. Little do you know that I’m sneaking into your locker after you leave and smelling your used gym shorts, the smell of your sweat and natural odor combined with your hairy pussy giving me an instant hardon.

Or perhaps I’m an intern at your firm, and you realize that I keep on coming into your office to get different forms because you have to lean down to grab them from a drawer, giving me an eyeful of your cleavage. Your tits sag after three kids, but you realize that that turns me on.

Maybe your an average looking milf. That means cellulite, sagging tits, an ass that had dropped a little, a wildly hairy pussy, and more. Or maybe your a pornstar-type bimbo, hotter than anyone else in town! I’m open to most kinks so I’ll just put my limits, which are death, scat, gore, and vomit. As to kinks, why don’t you include those in your message, and we can work out a story."

Hello, I'm currently writing this from work..

I live in a college house off campus and I've been up for winter break for my internship. We have two floors, I live on the second, and I haven't looked/been down to the first floor at all. It is seperated by a door.

I woke up this morning, went to my kitchen, and out of nowhere, hearing loud ""meows"" right outside the door to the first floor. At first, I thought it was outside, so I open the door just a little bit, and I see a cats head right fucking there. I love cats, but this scared the living shit out of me. It just keeps meowing. I opened the door and left it some food and water, closed the door, and had to go to work.

I'm not sure what to do now. It would be cool to have a house cat but I'm not even sure if it's a feral or a stray. Do I slowly try gaining his/her trust? Bring it to the animal shelter? Pet it? Gloves? Really lost, could use some help. Thank you."

MY THOUGHTS: beautifully made film from top to bottom. MVP of the movie by far is Jeff Bridges, he elevates this shit to a whole another level. The dynamic between Chris Pine and Ben Foster felt truly brotherly, from them not giving up on each other to Foster’s ultimate sacrifice to make sure his nephews get the life he never had. The cinematography was breathtaking, although you can tell that they’re not exactly in West Texas. Taylor Sheridan wrote the absolute fuck out of this movie and I can’t wait to see what original project he takes on next.

The letter itself:
J.P. Morgan

Dear Sir or Madame:

I am an ambitious undergraduate at NYU triple majoring in Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. I am a punctual, personable, and shrewd individual, yet I have a quality which I pride myself on more than any of these.

I am unequivocally the most unflaggingly hard worker I know, and I love self-improvement. I have always felt that my time should be spent wisely, so I continuously challenge myself; I left Villanova because the work was too easy. Once I realized I could achieve a perfect GPA while holding a part-time job at NYU, I decided to redouble my effort by placing out of two classes, taking two honors classes, and holding two part-time jobs. That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups.

I say these things only because solid evidence is more convincing than unverifiable statements, and I want to demonstrate that I am a hard worker. J.P. Morgan is a firm with a reputation that precedes itself and employees who represent only the best and rightest in finance. I know that the employees in this firm will push me to excellence, especially within the Investment Banking division. In fact, one of the supporting reasons I chose Investment Banking over any other division was that I know it is difficult. I hope to augment my character by diligently working for the professionals at Morgan Stanley, and I feel I have much to offer in return.

I am proficient in several programming languages, and I can pick up a new one very quickly. For instance, I learned a years worth of Java from NYU in 27 days on my own; this is how I placed out of two including: Money and Banking, Analysis, Game Theory, Probability and Statistics. Even further, I am taking Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Modeling currently, two programming courses offered by Stanford, so that I may truly offer the most if I am accepted. I am proficient with Bloomberg terminals, excellent with excel, and can perform basic office functions with terrifying efficiency. I have plenty of experience in the professional world through my internship at Merrill Lynch, and my research assistant position at NYU. In fact, my most recent employer has found me so useful that he promoted me to a Research Assistant and an official CTED intern. This role is usually reserved for Masters students, but my employer gave the title to me so that he could give me more work.

Please realize that I am not a braggart or conceited, I just want to outline my usefulness. Egos can be a huge liability, and I try not to have one.

Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Mark"
ah40er,1,2019-01-17,[M4f] now hiring,FrankCreep,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ah40er/m4f_now_hiring/,"Appearances aren't everything. Yes, you are a natural blonde, and yes, you have the kind of body that pornstars envy. Big tits, big lips, big ass, big eyes... tiny little waist. But you're no bimbo. You're a competent, intelligent young woman with a lot more ambition than to be some vacuous arm-candy for some dirty old man just because he's loaded.

Of course, you have to start somewhere, and all those student loans are a pretty heavy load. Worse, you find that nobody's hiring inexperienced kids fresh out of college. You can pick up a few gigs here and there, and an unpaid internships, but there are no real opportunities.

So, like always, you do what you have to do. Guys pay good money to watch a girl like you dancing in a g-string, and though it's humiliating and you don't dare tell any of your friends, it pays the rent. The other night, something happened. A man came in, tall, fit, handsome, salt and pepper hair. He was wearing a suit, and you couldn't be sure in the dark club, but it looked hand-tailored. He's got a beautiful gold watch, manicured nails. Everything about him screams success.

Flirting and foreplay are part of the job, but there are limits. You can touch the guys, but they can't touch you. You've gotten good at faking it, pretending to be into a guy who you find completely repulsive. This one is different. This one, you want to touch you.

You want him to want you. You want him to take you. When he takes you to the VIP room for a private dance, you forget all the limits. You let him touch you, you fingered your dripping pussy for him, you came for him, and you begged him to let you make him cum. He smiles, but he shakes his head. He tips very generously, but when he leaves, you felt empty.

You still felt that emptiness the next day, but you don't have time for it. You had an interview for an internship with Lawrence and Associates, a major firm downtown. You knew it was a long shot, but it's one of those internships. The ones that open doors, that actually lead into careers. You got there, and there were dozens of other applicants. You filled out forms, and then one by one you were called in. A couple of young men in suits interviewed you.

They tried flirting with you, and you gave them a little. Not to encourage them, but enough that you weren't shutting them down. A useful skill. When they finished, you went back out to wait again. More forms to fill out. A second interview with a second team.

You were back in the reception area with all the other applicants when he walked in. He was talking with another man and they hardly seemed to notice all of you. The receptionist stood up.

""Good morning, Mister Lawrence,"" she said. He gave her a slight nod and then looked around. He saw the applicants, and he saw you. The corner of his mouth twitched in the ghost of a smirk.

""This is the applicant pool for the internships?"" he said.

""Today's group, yes Sir,"" she said.

He nodded to her, let his eyes sweep around the room once more and smiled. His eyes stopped on you for a moment, and he might have winked. ""Well, good luck, everyone.""

Then he turned and walked onto a waiting elevator, picking up his conversation with the other man.

This morning you got a call from his office, asking you to come back for a follow-up interview tonight at 9pm.

From here, I will turn you into the perfect bimbo. I will train you to love things that would shock the person you were. I will shape your personality to suit my fantasy. You will be constantly horny, eager to please, unable to refuse my least request. You will love sucking cock, love being displayed, dressed like a Barbie sex doll, passed around, used, humiliated."

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short my University here in the Netherlands is making me do a 4 month internship as part of my degree. Unfortunately I live near Eindhoven and I have found about 4 game studios in the city, with no luck in the surrounding area either. I was wondering if anyone here knew of any indie studios near Eindhoven that might not have come up in searches? I'm really struggling to find somewhere and my university is not helping me in the slightest.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks"

I’m a criminal justice major who LOVES both these schools. I’ve been accepted to each and just cannot decide. I’m from upstate New York if that matters at all, and I previously had decided on Albany but after much thought decided to rule it out and pick one of these two instead. I’d like to do a double major; something to do with computer science, homelance security or psychology. This is an incredibly hard choice for me and I reaaaaally need some guidance. My parents are supportive of both, but they tend to favor Fredonia because they did some work on campus for a week and were just shocked by how nice everyone was. (Which they really are!!)

Other things you should know about me:

-Democrat

-Gryffindor

-INFP MBTI

-Vegetarian 

-Cannot stand vaping and will feel very uncomfortable if there’s a lot of it (which, obviously there is bound to be, it’s a college after all, but some schools are more notorious than others)





Pros of Oneonta:


-Cool mascot

-Good program

-Great food

-LLC’s (living learning community)

-Higher graduation rate

-More selective

-Great internship opportunity 


Con’s of Oneonta:


-Can’t bring your car until junior year

-A tad bit harder to get to location wise

-Middle of nowhere



Pro’s of Fredonia:


-Decent program

-Chill atmosphere 

-Amazing dorms

-Can bring a car as a freshman

-I have connections there

-Met with a professor there and he was super friendly and it was a super great meeting. And admissions + tour guide + other staff were the nicest and most accommodating people I’ve ever seen on any college campus

-Great internship opportunity 




Con’s of Fredonia:


-At least 4 people in my hs class are going

-Less selective

-Eh food

-Kind of a pain in the ass to visit friends in other res halls because your id only works in your building

-People tend to have a not so great reaction when your tell them you’re looking at Fredonia"
ah5y8u,1,2019-01-17,Need advice about an internship,NormallyNervous,careerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerquestions/comments/ah5y8u/need_advice_about_an_internship/,"I'm a junior in college and my majors are accounting and human resources management. My school recommends that we should have at least two internships before we graduate. I have my second internship this semester at a small accounting firm near my school, and it should last until April 16th. My main duties seem to be helping them through the tax season by preparing various tax forms for their clients. However, yesterday they took me with them to audit one of their clients and I thought that was really cool. I kind of hate the tax stuff, it's very boring, but I also don't really know anything about taxes. They knew when they hired me that I had not taken the tax accounting class my school offers yet (I'm in it this semester), but they seem to have thrown me to the sharks. 

My desk is in an office with one of the accountants, let's call her Mary. It seems like she's the one in charge of training me and answering any questions I have, but it seems like she's annoyed anytime I ask her something. She's also never at work on time and usually shows up about half an hour later than me. I've been trying to do stuff before she gets there, but I'm never 100%  sure about what I should be doing. I haven't received any feedback on the forms I've been handing in, so for all I know, I could be doing everything completely wrong.  

I expected them to give me more guidance than what I'm getting considering I have no tax or accounting experience. I understand that accountants tend to work independently for the most part, but I have received little to no training. Mary is never around to help, whether she be late or in one of the other accountant's offices talking about her upcoming wedding. When she is at her desk, she has earbuds in, which makes me feel bad about asking questions. I really want to learn and be able to do things independently, but I really think they need to spend more time training me. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is whether or not this lack of guidance is unusual for internships? I don't need or want someone to hold my hand throughout the entire semester, but I would like to have some help until I'm confident in completing the tasks. 

What's the best way to work on being independent while at work with the very little training I've had? Do companies tend to fire interns for not being independent and confident after a certain period of time? I'm worried they'll eventually get fed up with my questions and fire me. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but I really wanted to get my second internship over with. 

Thanks! "

From the moment I saw you in the court room I hoped you’d end up on the jury and it felt like the universe was on my side when you were called up. You were one of the few excited to there and that alone felt like it set us apart from the group. I knew right away I wanted to get to know you. By day two I knew I’d have to ask you out when our Duty ended. I did my best, I focused on the case in front of us but I could not wait to see you in the morning, I could not wait until we would break from the case.  I could not wait for lunch so we could take and learn more about each other. I thought I had more time.

I was completely drawn in by your soft eyes and warm smile. As the jury grew comfortable with each other and anecdotes began to fly I felt a connection because when I laughed I looked over to meet your gaze as if the whole thing was one big inside joke to us.

I expected the trial to last until next week. I put our civic duty first and didn’t want to think about what I would say until we were through. When the mistrial was announced I scrambled. I felt so confident I didn’t plan to fail. When you told me you had a boyfriend I panicked like a pre-teen boy at a middle-school dance. 

The disappointment stunned me. I wished you good luck with school, turned, and walked away in a manner that was completely uncharacteristic of me. I was completely flummoxed.

I feel as if I missed an opportunity for a more heart-felt goodbye. Good luck Juror Number 2 on your studies. Good luck with your internship. Good luck with your relationship. 

I regret not taking he opportunity to make a new friend out of this whole experience.

Familiar clacking of heels and whispered shady comments break the previous run of uncomfortable silence. As the girls jostle each other for premium workspace and cluster into their assigned pairs, Portia looks around the room, trying to figure out what this (seeming) return to workroom normalcy is missing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The wan offerings of bread, ranch, poppers and stale pretzels at the craft services table? Check.

Cheap canvas painted brick “walls”? Check.

Del’s piles of elaborated discarded props NOT put back in her own damn workstation for once?

Sadly, check.

&amp;#x200B;

With a shrug of her shoulders, Portia turns toward the main mirror to start removing her elaborate SFX burns, only to find a pile of hot pink lipstick handwriting obstructing her view.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sir Ving (in handwritten mirror message):** *If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, they will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless. Just as useless as this show now that that pageant stripper routine found me the carbohydrate caregiver of my dreams. A bitch is packing her bikinis and enjoying some cocktails in Palm Springs on someone else’s dime.*

*Amelia, Diana (RIP), Portia and Del, love you all for showing me friendship here xxx*

*P.S. Amelia, I left you my biggest and most iconic breastplate, as well as my fake Chanel bag, as this bitch can now afford a real one.*

&amp;#x200B;

Portia’s face cracks. Audibly. This prompts the other girls to turn toward the sound, the mirror message, and the massive disembodied set of double E cups thoughtfully wrapped in a pretty pink ribbon. Elle and Willow look shocked. Del looks pensive as she reads what to her is both enviable AND relatable content. Amelia had been all smiles as she had been happily enjoying her first win, and it takes her a moment to notice she is now talking entirely to herself. She steps toward the mirror, looking stricken, and a single tear falls on silicone as she picks up Sir’s gift, and sadly walks back to her own workstation, clutching the breastplate and an old photo of full effect Dimeliacox in happier (and non empty sweater) filled times. Del builds a pillow fort to try to console Miss Velvet, and they begin to work on their PSA, hoping the exclusion will lighten the mood.

&amp;#x200B;

**Portia:** *Given the choice between a team composed of this season’s villain edit who operates as if she’s on the complete opposite timezone to her partner, and the grieving remnants of a once plot relevant clique, I guess I will be flying solo. Karma is real, kids. I’m a theater queen! The show must go on, and I can TOTALLY kill this. I think. How much time do we have? Airtime and a redemption edit. For me. That’s how much.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First up…… **Amelia Velvet**!

“Overall, it seems like you guys missed the point of the challenge. Firstly, it was way too long for the short PSA brief that we gave you. And the way it was presented and written, it seemed like more of a parody DragCon panel session instead of a PSA. Instead of highlighting the “issue” of bad drag, you guys gave sort of a step-by-step guide on how not to look cheap (loosely speaking). 

You were definitely the standout of your PSA pairing and this character was a smart choice to play as it is one of the easier archetypes to make funny and relatable. There were parts of Del’s dialogue that fell a little flat for me but you came in and picked it back up, so that’s very commendable. On the runway, I thought the challenge you put upon yourself to take Christmas colours and make it work was bold, but the outcome was a little predictable. It read like a crossover between a Lana Del Rey aesthetic and Acid Betty’s Movie Premiere Realness gown in green, which, although stunningly beautiful much like yourself, didn’t have any new elements that excited me. This is an open-ended category which you could have gone all the way, and tonight, it was just safe for me.” says Anita.

“I have to agree with Anita that your PSA with Del missed the brief by trying to do too much, and ended up wandering into a more web tutorial/Drag Con panel territory. Additionally, some of the topics you covered were taken directly from the challenge parameters doc, which was my tossing off softball reference examples to get your ideas started. Don’t reuse my toss off one liners, as I am not known for being funny.   You have a charming knack for a certain screwball physical comedy in even the smallest pieces of motion/stage direction (e.g the shoe tossing), and your goofy rhyming tips through the first half of the PSA made me wish you had carried the gimmick a bit further, as you lost a bit of steam and rich bitchy charm through the back half, only regaining a bit of the previous magic in that goofy, collaborative ending. 

On the runway, you did manage a red/green look that didn’t reek of Christmas, which I commend you for. However, I would have liked to see a bit more ambition in the silhouette or use of the roses that weren’t quite as literal and safely pretty. Perhaps a capelet or train of fresh blooms, or a hoopskirt or other underpinning utilizing thorns, which would have been on color scheme and theme, and a bit less forced than the contrast of the party cannon gag in an otherwise ethereal sort of presentation.” remarks Angie.

“**MY CROWN IS PRETTY!**”, shouts Tish.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Next up….**Del O Ryan**!

“From what we gathered, you worked on more of the PSA than Amelia but somehow her character was stronger than yours. You were overshadowed by her, even if just by a small margin. However, I appreciated the silliness of your character and it really brought the piece together, even if it wasn’t 100% what we asked for. On the runway, you definitely made up for any lacklustre performance in your team. The Diana Forrest tribute gown was BEAUTIFUL, with the way it moved (a la Roxxxy’s Candy Ball Couture) and the story was made clear through your actions and movements. My favourite part was the little details that added so much depth to the whole look, such as the dyed tongue and the berries above her ass. Even though your partner and you chose the same colours, you definitely knocked her out of the park in the runway portion.” says Anita.

“In the PSA, while you had some of my favorite moments of pedal to metal comedic zaniness (the mop wig, “Shoes are for capitalists”), but they were fewer and farther between than I would have liked. I find myself in a similar bind with you as I have in previous comedy/acting assignments…...you let the surrealist, wacky you out to play in short bursts, but then pull back right as things are getting really interesting. Embrace the weird and the daft. Please. It’s wonderful. You had a lot more room to play with strangeness as the trainwreck character, without the burden of making bitchy, polished perfection funny. I wish it had been more fully utilized in tonight’s main challenge. As it stands, your partner stole the show out from under you.

On the runway, it was a bold move to do the same color pairing as your partner, and take that even closer to Christmas adjacent with allusions to both pine forests and fires. Your team’s PSA may have suffered a bit from overambition, but that same swing for the fences mentality was a sartorial triumph for you tonight, fashion wise. You managed to serve an editorial shape, avoid the pit of holiday cliches AND make a sub meta reference to a fallen friend without being tossed brick literal about it. I could have done without the distraction of the berry embellishment breaking the more somber and strange vibe of the runway presentation toward the end, but the shape and structure of the garment are very stunning, and you get a bonus point for correctly dating the popular era of block pumps.” says Angie.

**“MY CROWN IS ALSO SPARKLY!**”, says Tish, at a slightly lower volume than before, but not by much.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Next up…..**Elle Crimson**!

“You and Willow had a very promising plotline, you got the gist of what a PSA is, the little elements of physical comedy really amped up the already charming humour of the submission and the beginning was really solid. However, it was wayyyyyyy too short and you guys stabbed yourself in the foot by cutting off your plot like that. I know we asked for short PSAs but you guys coulda wrapped the video up without it being so abrupt. Such a waste because I really liked the start of the piece and if you guys had the time to refine it together, it would have been a winner.

Kudos to you for spearheading the actual writing on this challenge. I know that working with someone in a different timezone is insanely difficult and you having the initiative to start is great. Your comedy is great as always and I could see the Elle stamp on the work very clearly but it would have helped if you spent more time on it to help Willow point out what was working and what wasn’t. On the runway, it was a fresh take on the many gowns that we’ve seen today, and had that young joyful energy to it that we know and love about you. I loved that you took something that you’re known for (pop culture references, in this case the song Cherry Bomb) and turned it to something totally unexpected, which is what you should do with all the “reference pieces” that you’ve built your brand on. The standout was definitely your makeup, which was beautiful and fun at the same time. Fantastic work.” says Anita.

“I loved the concept of your PSA, and while I don’t think most view you as a comedy first sort of queen, there is a certain style of dry humor that you are quite good at, and which I personally enjoy very much. That stamp is all over the structure of the PSA, and while I think your team went too far in the direction of brevity, the bones of the thing were sound ones. I know coordinating across time zones is tricky, but I agree with Anita that a bit more cohesion with Willow would have helped to really knock this into the top tier for the week.

On the runway, I usually love how you will turn a completely unrelated reference into a fashion piece. However, this missed the mark for me as being much too literal, with the skirt being a dead on cherry colored, spherical bomb. Without the visual pun, the silhouette does not really work as a standalone garment, and reads slightly awkward and bulky, wobbling and scrunching down the runway. The hair and makeup were absolutely stunning, but nothing below the neck packed the same punch. Red/green was the most common pairing tonight, and some of your competitors outpaced you in terms of fresh takes on that particular choice of shades” says Angie.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Tish: ………………..** 

*Tish sits behind the judges table slowly turning her head back and forth to watch the reflected light from the rhinestones make rainbow patterns on the opposite wall, completely oblivious to the proceedings*.

And now…...**Willow Blue**!

“Definitely a much better attempt at comedy than your previous tries, so I have to commend you on that. Even though you were a little outshined by Elle, there were jokes that I really enjoyed in the submission. However, according to the Who Did Whats, you changed the ending of things to make it not too long, which I assume is the reason why the ending was so abrupt? Working with someone whose day is your night and vice versa is hard but you gotta make it work, if not your submission will suffer, just like it did tonight. On the runway, this orange and blue ensemble is heavenly and a great change in aesthetic for you, to this bougie ass rich woman who is prim, proper and a real pain in the ass. Although I wished that the hair was blonde, the lips were orange, the accessories were in theme and the makeup elaborated more, I thought that the basic idea of it was really great and the presentation was very campy, purposely throwing her hat just to find an excuse to show off her ass. You’ve improved so much from your first submission, just pay attention to the little details of your look.” says Anita.

“Your performance in the PSA was a much better paced attempt at comedy than your previous competition efforts, and I commend you for making the pacing adjustments you had previously been given notes on. I also think making little in jokes to some of your previous comedy/acting struggles as a character choice was a smart one. However, your PSA doc indicates you did the edit for length, and as previously mentioned above, you cut a bit TOO much from a fundamentally sound idea, making the submission err on the side of too short, and the ending a touch jarring.

On the runway, it was refreshing to see blue/orange after all of the red, and I love the rich lady at the horse race campiness of the enormous hat, as we have not seen you do that more buttoned up aesthetic previously. I like the basic idea of this shape, and I wish you had given us a bit more detail of the little nuances of what I picture to be a very cute look. What kind of blue heels? What fabric is the garment? Little things help us envision your runway the same way you do when writing it.” says Angie.

“I feel like I forgot something……..did I mention my crown?” says Tish in a loud ass, faux confessional, sotto voce stage whisper. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Last, but not least……... **Portia Bella Mushroom**!

“You definitely got the brief of the challenge the most accurate out of the 3 groups, and the campy narrator character you chose really fits the direction that you were going. Your use of the props, green screen and everything else in your surrounding was also really great and had great moments of comedic delivery and physical comedy. It did get a little too long though, as I thought the Baby Queen crying part was not necessary and it didn’t really add on much to the comedy or the plot. The runway was a HOOT cause I loved the presentation of the look and it felt so on brand with what you are as a queen. I did feel that the neck up was given more thought than the neck down, so remember to add more pizzazz to it as well. We love a campy queen, but a busted campy queen, we don’t love. All in all, you had a lot of fun on that stage and we were with you in that fantasy. Great job!” says Anita.

“You nailed the tone and the brief, keeping it just fear mongering enough while still being darkly comic for cynics, much like actual PSAs. Poppy Cox, Celebration Florida as the saddest place on earth, the Beyonce bodysuit reveal shade, a really high percentage of your jokes were firing on all cylinders. So much so that you almost didn’t need the “To Wong Foo” reference of the crying little boy in drag in the latter section. It’s a rare time indeed when a reference to that particular film becomes superfluous, so kudos to you for forcing my hand in typing that sentence into the universe by virtue of the strength of the rest of your material.

On the runway, you chose a color pairing no one else even touched, and in a category that allowed a wide berth of interpretations, this was probably the best moment of the competition to go full on camp with a playful Punchinello. Given that the presentation and concept was extremely camp and playful, I would have liked to see a tiny touch of luxury in the trim and the fabrics chosen as a counterbalance. Just a small touch to keep the lightness of the idea from floating away like your balloon props, but it's a very minor quibble in an excellent night for you” says Angie.

“I am ABSOLUTELY sure I forgot something……” says Tish.

**Portia Bella Mushroom…...you are the WINNER of this week’s challenge!**

**Portia:**   *I was at a huge disadvantage with no partner to play off of. I’m so happy I was able to take that challenge on and turn a trash week into treasure!*

**Del O Ryan and Amelia Velvet, I’m sorry my dears, but you are up for elimin-**

Before Angie can finish her sentence, there is a terrific crash as the ceiling mounted movable stripper pole and excess candy from Sir Ving’s Miss Wig Pageant routine crashes down onto the runway. All too explicably, it’s been hanging on by a thread up there since last month, or however the fuck long ago that ancient history was. In addition to taking out most of the lights, it also nearly takes out Del and Amelia. The main stage is a mess of loose wires, shattered light bulbs and slightly singed caramels and hard candies. Once Angie is sure she is out of striking distance, she picks out several salt water taffy pieces from the pile, chewing thoughtfully as she accesses the damage (read: scopes for more of the strawberry flavor in the wreckage).

Currently on a 1-month internship in a school, my project manager asked me to write a shell script on a UAP AC Pro for an On-Demand Wi-Fi.

I already spent hours on the net, looking through different documents, Ubiquiti forums, and all. Although it seems too complicated (or I may be too hardheaded), I should want to know if this is even possible (it looks like yes but I need more information since I never dealt with this brand ans this device before).

The last thing I have seen that I could work on is to modify config.properties and tmp/systemcfg

The daytime company I work for has really good future potential as far as my careers aspirations goes. They hire within often and push for career advancement (my boss has been encouraging me to learn a new program so I can get promoted to the next level). They also offer tuition reimbursement.

The night audit job is really easy. I spend at most 3-4hours doing actual work, and have the rest of the night to study or do whatever I want, but most of the time I'm too tired and end up either watching something online dozing off at the desk; I just can't find focus/drive to do work.

Currently, I'm getting on average 5 hours of sleep during the week, sometimes less. I try to do school work on the weekends since I'm not really getting to do much at night at my other job. I have some credit card debt and other debt that I want to pay off; I also have undergrad school loans. But the second job just doesn't allow me to focus on school/advancement at my other job as I'm always tired, and never have the time. It has even impinged on my social life. I'm planning to graduate at the end of this year; I also need to study for a certification, and I need time to learn that programing language for my daytime job. Should I quit the night job to focus on those things, or should I continue and just struggle through it?

The reason I got the night job is so that when the time comes, I'd be able to do both that and some sort of internship at the end of graduate school program for better job prospects."

Just for general information, I have posted here once before. Anyways, I'm going to explain my situation. I'm a student, currently an intern in the EP. I get paid 1000 euro monthly, but the problem is that I initially came to this position in the beginning of November, for a month contract with the option of extending it if I and my MEP both agreed to it. And I stayed working for them until 14 December, the last day of work before holiday break. That is when one if his assistants told me that my contract will be extended. However, as the MEP was back in his home country already, we couldn't sign the contract then. So we did this when we came back to work - 10 days ago. I was hoping that it would be enough time for the contracts to be registered and my payment to be sent between 12 and 15 January (which is when payments are sent every month). Sadly, seems that no such thing will happen. I am scared and stressed to a point where I've no clue on what to do. I need to give back 350 pounds to my sister that she needs to get as soon as possible, as well as pay 150 pounds to my landlord back in England as a final payment so that we can end the contract before the previous fixed date. I would take any type of advice on how to get those money or what to do. "
ah9l2d,103,2019-01-18,Stomach Ache,supbunny24,EntitledBitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledBitch/comments/ah9l2d/stomach_ache/,"First time poster, I'm on mobile, sorry about the format.

I don't know if this fits here, but I need to put this somewhere. Tl;dr at the bottom

My mum is a teacher who went back to work about two years ago because my sisters and I are old enough to look after ourselves, so she doesn't need to be home all the time anymore.

She's a science teacher, along with being part of the school's head management team. She's someone who spends a lot of time with her students, and honestly I'm pretty sure she can start listing ""therapist"" in her resume after the amount of times she's had to counsel her students.

Anyway, onto the reason I'm here. Friday morning is when the ninth grade class has gym, seeing as they just came back from New Years break and the inter-house tournaments have yet to begin, the students were allowed to distribute their own teams and play whatever sport they chose. They chose Captain's Ball.

So, teams are chosen and everyone is ready to when, oh no! one of the girls (let's call her EB) has a stomach ache! It's really, really bad and she has to sit down right away! She can't possibly play.

So my mum, who's overseeing this gym period because the nurse is out sick (yes, the nurse is sick), takes the girl out of the court and sits her down. My mother, bless her heart, then goes to get EB some 100+ to drink, to help with her stomach ache as EB has said in the past that it helps her. Mind you, the cafeteria is on the other side of the school and the nearest vending machine was out of service, so my mother had to walk quite a bit to get EB a drink. Instead of thanking my mother for the drink, EB complains that it isn't cold.

Whatever, my mom has an entire class of other students to keep alive, so she ignores EB and goes about her business.

Five minutes later, the match is over and they're sorting out new teams, waiting until the teams are decided, EB shoots up and says that she's better! She can totally play now.

The gym TA tells the gym teacher that EB says she's good to go on in, but this ain't Mr. Arm's (this is this man's actual name) first rodeo. Apparently, EB does this everytime she isn't on a team with her friends; she'll get a ""stomach ache"" and as soon as the teams are reshuffled, she's all better. Mr. Arm says no, she's not allowed back in. If her stomach ache was so bad just a few minutes ago, we can't let her run around so quickly, she might get sick (mind you, this man is fully aware that there was never any stomach ache, but EB doesn't need to know that). The TA, a college intern, is kinda hessitant about going over to EB (who is notorious for her attitude) and telling her she can't play, so my mum offers to do it instead.

So my mum tells EB that Mr. Arm said she isn't allowed back in the court. My mum says she's slightly concerned that EB keeps getting these ""stomach aches"" and that she should let my mum take her to the doctor.

Ooh, but EB doesn't like being told that her scheme didn't work, she starts bitching at my mum, saying that she isn't really concerned and if she wanted to worry about anyone's health she should worry about her own.

Now, my mother is a very caring woman, but after three girls, she doesn't put up with any attitude. My mum tells EB off, sending her out of the gym, not giving her detention or anything for mouthing off at a teacher.

But if EB is anything, she is salty. And there's nothing that salty fourteen year olds like better than ranting on social media.

But EB forgets that I follow her on both her main account, as well as her private one. (I visit the school a lot and I'm close to many of the students, sometimes I stop by the school after my classes are over so my mum and I can go home together)

Now, EB thinks she's smart, typing on her private account, in Spanish the following comments:

""Some adults think that they're so good when they're actually nothing""

""this bitch teacher of mine thinks she has the right to tell me what to do""

""if you want to be concerned about anyone's health, maybe look in the mirror""

""who the fuck do some bitches think they are""

And a few other, nastier comments that I don't have the heart to re-read and type out.

Tl;dr EB student claims to be sick so she doesn't have to play on a team without her friends, gets mad when my mom expresses concern and the gym teacher won't let her play once teams are reshuffled

Once we got to our hotel room we settled in and my boss just came out and asked me to suck his cock. I sort of asked him what and he gave me that what his wife didn't know would hurt anyone and then he basically said he knew we where going to have a good week. Needless to say I did end up blowing him and we did have a good week.

This is my first post ever on Reddit! I’m not sure what I’m looking to get from writing this, maybe I just feel a need to vent.

I started my spring internship this week, and I haven’t worked in awhile, so I’m nervous about the job to begin with. 6 months ago I was finally diagnosed with PMDD (I’ve had the symptoms since I was 16, but never knew what PMDD was. I’m 22 now). Throughout college, my symptoms have steadily gotten worse, and now they are almost crippling.

Anyway, started my internship on Wednesday, which also happened to be 13 days before my period (PMDD symptoms begin at 12 days for me). So yesterday was 12 days before my period, and my PMDD was AWFUL. My internship is a fashion marketing job, so I spent the day at a photo shoot steaming clothes. I was in a room filled with extroverts, and I felt that any time someone looked at me/spoke to me, my face would get insanely red due to anxiety. My hands were shaking, I was extremely fatigued, my body got so hot I was in a full sweat. I mainly avoided eye contact and conversation as much as I could. I went for a walk on my lunch break and felt a bit better after that.

To sum it up, this is what PMDD does to me on my second day at my new internship. I’m supposed to be meeting people, networking, really doing my best, but PMDD is making me into someone I’m not. Normally I’m not this anxious and I’m fine speaking with people. I have a prescription from my doctor for Xanax but I try to avoid using it (my father is a recovered alcoholic, so I try to avoid alcohol/drugs of any kind). In addition, I’ve been on Wellbutrin for 6 months but feel it isn’t working much. 

I feel I’m off to a rough start already, and I know in the coming days my depression is going to hit me like a ton of bricks. Then when I get my period soon, it will all magically go away.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with PMDD in the workplace? "

So this is why women don't work in STEM fields?,FairEmu7,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ahb8sq/need_advice_negative_lab_environment_so_this_is/,"**TLDR:** I am an undergrad. I am a woman. I have a part-time internship working in a highly respected research lab (my first internship and lab experience). I feel that my male supervisor has been disrespectful, demeaning, and avoided giving me significant tasking, among other things. I have reached out to others there without assistance. If I leave before it is over it probably won’t be on good terms. If I stay, I will continue to be treated the way I have been, which is now affecting my mental health, but I might get to be involved in a very promising project, have my name on a scientific paper, have a good recommendation letter, and learn.

Has this happened to anyone else?

How did you get through it?

What should I do?

**With most of the details:**

**Background:**

When I was a girl, I always knew that as soon as I was old enough and could do something to help others I just had to. I am the type of person who will always stop to listen, assist, or aid someone in need. I grew up in an abusive and unstable family situation and left home at an early age. I worked hard to be able to get a roof over my head, finish high school, and be able to attend college. I recently got married to a wonderful guy, who has a career which allowed me to be able to quit my retail job and put 100% of my focus in school. I am currently an undergrad at a community college with the hopes of transferring to a university, getting my bachelor’s degree, and continuing to medical school. I am a planning person, very detail oriented, “bubbly” usually I get along with everyone, ask lots of questions, enjoy learning, very respectful (come from a culture where respecting elders is a BIG deal), I am direct if I am comfortable, and very protective of my friends (“mama bear”).

**The superduper very exciting summer opportunity:**

This past summer I somehow landed a paid internship at a large prestigious research facility. I was hired through the Training Office, where I had a contact (Miriam), but assigned to a Biology Lab in a separate office and worked under the supervision of the postdoc of the lab (Dan). The PI (head scientist whose lab it is, would be more hands off, Dr. Hammond). I had some difficulties communicating with the postdoc of the lab during the summer. Dan is not a planning person, shy, does not say much, passive aggressive, highly critical, knowledgeable about his work, spends 24/7 of his life in the lab or working on his work (from what I understand it encompasses all aspects of his life and he does not have a social life and lives alone). Most of the summer I had been working 12-hour days (not counting my daily 4-5 hour roundtrip commute).

**The red flag:**

One significant occurrence however took place shortly before my end of the summer poster was due. Dan had given me something to do I didn’t know how to do, would not answer my questions or give me guidance on it, and told me he wanted it in a time frame I felt was an unreasonable. I pulled 2 all-nighters and got it done with as much “perfection” as I could (the quality of my work is important to me). While I was waiting for Dans feedback on my work, I went to a 1-hour drop-in support group meeting for interns (the entire facility heavily advocated self-care, wellness, etc. They had a lot of things like this). When I returned feeling much better and motivated to tackle my work, Dan called me into his office. It was a small space. He was sitting between me and the door and the door was closed. He proceeded to yell (raised voice very hostile tone) and berate me for going to a drop-in session when I had work to do and without asking him. He said psychology is a made-up science and even though I am a woman I can control myself. That workshops like that are a waste of time he had expected more of me than to be using this as an excuse to get out of doing my work. I lost my composure shortly after he started yelling. I remember feeling terrified and trying to defend myself but I just full on broke down and was in tears. I guess Dr. Hammond (who I usually hardly ever even saw) happened to be walking by outside and heard because he knocked on the door and popped in. He said he was there to ask Dan about something else and interrupted himself to ask me if I was ok (it seemed overtly obvious that it was just an excuse to pop in to check if everything was ok). I felt embarrassed that I was crying and tried to quickly compose myself to respond, but before I could Dan said, “Oh she’s just having difficulty getting her poster done.” Dr. Hammond said something to try to reassure me and then jumped into some unrelated light-hearted story about his favorite food growing up. I felt better, composed myself and left when Dr. Hammond was leaving. I only really told my husband and another student who knew Dan about what had happened. There was never really a discussion about what happened between me and Dan and when it seemed like there would be, he stopped it and just said that was in the past let’s just concentrate on the future. Several weeks went by and things seemed to smooth out a lot and I just thought ok everyone has an off day and maybe he that’s what it was and chose to forgive and forget.

The rare chance:

When my internship was getting ready to end a couple weeks before Fall Semester, the opportunity for me to stay on through the year had come up from Miriam’s boss, the head of the HR and the training dept, Roberta. From my understanding, there are no undergrad internships or programs at this facility for the school year and having an undergrad stay there was very unusual so there would have to be a lot of special exceptions and clearance given. If everything went through, the internship would continue to be through the training office under Roberta, where again Miriam would be my contact. I would be required to be in school part time. I was so honored and excited at this possibility. All the things I could learn, see, and be a part of! The summer was my first experience being in a lab of any kind besides the biology lab at school. I felt that I had just scratched the surface. Before I agreed to stay at the lab, I let Dan know that the long hours were too much for me and I could not sustain them through the school year. We agreed on an 6:30am-2:30pm 4-day work week and that any vacations I had already scheduled would be ok to be off in addition to any school breaks/holidays. I would start right away.

I was told I would be working in Dr. Hammonds lab completely under Dan (He was trying to get his own lab, so it was a good experience for him to have an “employee”). There was a little concern in the back of my mind, but the end of the summer had gone well so I just pushed that away. We would meet once a week to go through the plan for the week. If I wanted to attend any lectures the facility had I had to get Dans permission at the weekly meeting. Lectures and learning of any kind were encouraged including shadowing at other labs in the facility etc. The training office was requiring me to attend two separate meetings. One was a 1-hour support group once every two weeks and the other was a separate meeting for something unrelated. If I had any issues I was to go to Dan or Miriam. I was going to have a mostly independent project and be learning some advanced techniques from Dan (whom was the only one in the lab who knew them). However, Dan had to get a grant proposal ready so he would be busy the rest of the month and not available for weekly meetings or anything else. I was told we would start my project, which I could not start without him, in October. I was disappointed to have to wait but I understood and wanted Dans proposal to go well. He told me to work from home and review what I had learned over the summer.

**The build up:**

October came around. I came in on a weekend and observed him doing the complicated technique I would be learning how to do. At this point I was told he would be busy the rest of the month preparing a presentation so we would begin in November. Again, no weekly meetings. I asked if there was anything else, I could help with. He either wouldn’t ignore me or would make rude comments. However, I was given one scientific journal to read, which I read and took notes on.

During the month of November, I had a brief opportunity to help a visiting scientist in a different lab. I was happy to have something significant to do and jumped on the opportunity even though it required me to spend nearly three straight days at the other lab. Dan was free again in late November just as I left for a school break. The last two work days in November I missed work due to an unexpected death in my husband’s immediate family. We hadn’t had any weekly meetings and the few opportunities there were to have a weekly meeting Dan had not shown up.

In December I met with Dan. I was told that we would start next week. I wasn’t given anything else to do that week, so I worked on university applications. Next week came around I waited for Dan in the lab around the time we were supposed to start and nothing. When I saw him, I said I thought he was teaching me today. He said “Oh, I can’t today, we’ll do it Wednesday.” Wednesday same thing happened. I tried to convey as respectfully as I could that I was concerned that we weren’t sticking to schedule, that if he could let me know in advance if he could not make a meeting then I would appreciate it, and that I was trying to find things to fill my time till there was something to do. He responded by saying “we will have plenty of time and it was disrespectful for me to ask him about his schedule, didn’t I have enough of those ridiculous groups to go to, and if I wanted my name on the paper and a letter of recommendation I would behave.” I felt angry at what he had said but also it made me feel horrible about myself but didn’t know what to do about the situation. I was just an intern and to boot a rare woman in a place with mostly men. I cut back on my classes for this? I spend all this time driving to and from this place to get here and do nothing that actually requires me to be here?! ...but this was a good opportunity and I really really really wanted to learn. What if it would be my only opportunity to know what it is really like to work in a lab before I applied for medical school? Without the letter of recommendation, the time would be a waste and all that work I did over the summer would be a waste?! What if I did something wrong and this was somehow my fault?.... and on and on... my thinking spiraled.

I started to feel scared of Dan. I made excuses the next week to not come into lab once I realized we wouldn’t be doing anything, or I would go to a lecture. I distracted myself with the approaching Christmas holidays and Monday morning I was told we again weren’t starting that day. I tried to sit in lab and work on my university applications or read but I was so anxious and sick to my stomach. Nothing was getting done and I could feel myself constantly getting up and looking around and then starting to feel like I had to take deeper breaths because my chest was so heavy and like I would just start uncontrollably crying. I am usually a very bubbly, easy going, excited, positive, happy person so this feeling felt relatively foreign and terrible. I packed up my stuff and just left. I felt bad that I was now just uncomfortable coming to lab. I tried to force myself the next day and just pretend like I was ok. It didn’t work. I saw Dan in passing and he said he was going to just start my project without me while I was away for Christmas break. I was crushed.

**Impending Disaster:**

After Christmas break, I felt stronger and tried to tell myself “Ok it’s January, a new year let’s start fresh, be positive and try to make this work” my first day back I wrote an email saying “I was excited to begin my project. How did Dan’s work over break go? When can we start this week?” Along with a lot of other questions. I got a response a day later saying, because you were out for so long and took up so much time working on your University applications, we couldn’t start your project. Instead of doing your project you will be helping me work on one of my experiments meet me tomorrow at 5pm to talk about it. I couldn’t believe he was trying to put this on me. 5pm was outside my regular work hours and I had a commitment so I said I couldn’t then and asked for the last day of the week in the morning. He suggested a time that I had planned to go to a lecture Roberta was hosting and I had told her I would be there. I told him I wasn’t available at that time because I was going to a lecture. He responded by saying then we can’t meet till Monday and oh by the way its ok to go to that lecture even though I didn’t approve it. I was so mad. He hadn’t given me anything significant to do for weeks. Mostly my only learning opportunity had come from attending occasional lectures and he hadn’t seemed to care where I was or what I was doing since the summer. Now it just seemed like he was saying that to be spiteful and it came across as passive aggressive to me.

I met with Miriam and thought she would be supportive and maybe I could transition to a new lab or something. I started by telling her what happened over the summer. To my shock she instead told me that unless I am being physically or sexually assaulted there was nothing I could do. That It didn’t matter how disrespectful Dan was or what he did/didn’t asked me to do or what time he asked me to do it or how it might make me feel. If the situation didn’t work out, I had no one to blame but myself. I lost it, started crying, and completely broke down. I left and went to the lecture Roberta was giving. I remembered that Roberta and Dan were friends outside of work, but she seemed like a pretty professional fair person. She said something that resonated with me afterwards. Without divulging anything I asked her afterwards what I should do if I was in a lab environment that was affecting me negatively? She said I should talk to my supervisor. I asked a follow up question and she said she knows about my situation and that in hindsight she would not have given me the opportunity to stay, that my commute is too far and then she insinuated that my not being present was the reason I hadn’t been able to start my project. I told her I was scared to talk to Dan, and she told me to talk to Copley, another training office person.

Over the weekend I was depressed. I couldn’t concentrate on anything. I couldn’t sleep at night. At some point I felt slightly better and I decided to separately email Dr. Hammond and Copley to set up meetings.

I met with them both being as concise and professional as I could. They both were supportive, and I felt encouraged with Dr. Hammonds support. Dr. Hammond (usually serious, respect commanding, down to business type of person) said he knew how hardworking I was from the summer, that I took constructive criticism well, that he was happy I was able to stay, that I should never feel uncomfortable coming to lab, that ultimately he was responsible for me, that it is completely fine if I want to stay home to work if I am only reading journals or have work that doesn’t require being in lab, that he doesn’t need to know my day to day activities that I should make the best use of my time there by attending lectures, seeing if I could shadow scientists in other lab, that Dan should have followed through with his commitments, and that Dan means well but is probably just too busy. He said he would involve someone else in the lab a visiting scientist who happened to be a woman, Sam. She would be now working on the same project and learning from Dan the same technique and everything, that after Dan teaches me, I could be more independent. We would have a planning meeting the next day. Copley was also very supportive and said that I should never feel like that coming to work and everyone deserves better than to be treated that way. She also said she is sorry I am going through this, but it is good lesson to learn because there will always be difficult people.

During the planning meeting Dr. Hammond stressed how important this work was and how we needed to start right away. The short version of this meeting was that Sam and I said we were eager to start and were very flexible. Dan was completely inflexible. Dr. Hammond said that we had to figure out the schedule amongst ourselves. Sam eventually made a comment along the lines of “Well you are dictating our schedule, it is obviously not your priority, you are being inflexible, and it doesn’t seem like you even want to teach us.” Doctor Hammond mentioned that there would be some helpful journals for me to read. After the meeting I check with Dr. Hammond and he said my only focus till we could start the project was to read a few journals that he was going to give me. I felt positive when I left.

Today, I emailed Dan and Dr. Hammond saying I was going to read a journal Sam had given me and requested the journals that had been mentioned for me to read. I was planning on staying home to do this which hadn't been an issue in the past and Dr.Hammond seemed to indicate at my meeting with him ""was understandable."" During the day a medical situation came up and I went to the doctors office. I got a long email from Dan saying he hadn’t seen me in lab and that I was required to be there. That for the next 4 weeks I wasn’t allowed to go to any lectures, I had to be there the hours he dictated, including my day off (when I have class), I was required to just sit in my chair in lab, if I wanted to do anything else, I had to ask for permission, I had to be in the lab on a weekend he knew I would be out of town (usually weekends are off). Furthermore, the journal Sam had given me was not a good journal as it only taught me techniques and I wouldn’t need to know any techniques. He did not approve me to read it. Miriam emailed me to ask why I hadn’t been in lab and to say that I needed to comply with Dan’s wishes. I could not schedule any meeting including with Copley unless I went through her (she doesn’t know what I spoke to Copley about just that I met her).

I’m just at a point where I don’t think I can physically and mentally deal with this. I turned off my work email notifications and just of the frame of mind that I will never make it as a doctor because I can’t deal with this situation. I won’t have a letter of recommendation. If I leave, I don’t think anyone will have a good impression of me. I don’t think I’ll have another opportunity to see what research is like but maybe this is just how it is working in labs. I feel bad that I was so naive and excited to learn about science.

I am leaning towards just sending in a resignation letter cc’d to everyone saying something along the lines of thank you for the opportunity and for having me in the lab. I appreciate short time I spent over the summer researching. I wanted to have a positive learning experience, which unfortunately I don’t feel that I am getting. I had hoped that a facility such as this one, which promotes wellness and inclusion would want to encourage students, especially young women to exchange ideas to be a part of a STEM field. I sincerely hope this issue is reviewed and things change so that no one else has a similar experience ....etc. I do not think it will be received well and do not expect to be given any type of reference/recommendation letter.

If I do this I will miss out on learning in and outside of the lab at the facility including being apart of research among other things I have mentioned.

ahbpd0,16,2019-01-18,AITA for making my African American intern work on MLK Jr Day? She was one of three picked at random.,irallysuckatmyjob,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ahbpd0/aita_for_making_my_african_american_intern_work/,"Try to do as much background as relevant. I work for a small engineering firm which subcons for a fortune 500 company which makes parts that go into nearly every mobile device made by one of the biggest companies on the planet. I was promoted to manager back in November and think I'm way over my head because I really like the tech stuff but not so good with people. 

So one of our devices is having an issue and my department's job is to fix the problem. We are under a super tight deadline because when the biggest company on the planet wants to release their next ""big thing"" on time, we don't want to be the holdup. Problem came to us last Thursday, boss had a deadline o this coming Wednesday when we are supposed to fly to our customers headquarters and explain our fix. I called my team in over last weekend and we actually made so much progress that I thought we were well on our way. My boss told me to bring in my team on Monday so we could prepare to brief him Tuesday before we flew out Wednesday. I don't think he remembered Monday is supposed to be a holiday.

So I made the decision that I really didn't need all six of my people (4 full timers, 2 paid interns but all essentially doing the same job) so I explained to everyone that I needed 3 people. I also said that this was a tremendous opportunity because they get to brief our CEO and potentially the CEO of a fortune 500 company so if any really WANTED to work on the holiday, please speak up. Also if any of them really didn't want to work, please speak up. No one spoke up as preference for either. This was Monday and every day since I would either mention in person or over email that I was still waiting for volunteers. I told them that if I didn't have any volunteers, I was just putting names in a hat and picking at random. No one objected or volunteered. 


So last night I literally wrote names on pieces of paper, put them in my coffee mug and drew three names and emailed the ""lucky"" people and all the sudden all hell broke loose. One of the names I picked is our very talented African American interns. I was actually very relieved she was one of the one's I picked because while she's not the most technically capable, she is one that I can give a task to and she will get it to the 99% solution without any questions or intervention.  


Well she was deeply offended that I was making her work on MLK day. She claimed that I was singling her out and went above my head direct to my boss. I was called into his office and was asked to explain why I picked just her. I explained that I didn't just pick her, I picked two others as well and that I offered everyone a chance to either work or not work multiple times over the week and no one, including this intern spoke up. My boss accused me of being ""tone deaf"" and then we went to speak with his boss who again asked me to explain. When I explained that I picked at random, she told me (paraphrasing) ""this is one of those times when your random pick shouldn't have been exactly random...do you understand what I'm saying?"" I told her that I was really sorry but I didn't and she said that I had a bad attitude and was trying to pin her into saying something she shouldn't say. So she is really pissed with me and she gave the intern the day off, basically going over my head. 

So no either I pick someone else or I work 20 hours on Monday to get this project done before we brief the CEO on Tuesday. I feel like such an asshole for all this, maybe not for my process but for the outcome. 

AITA?

ahc11l,4,2019-01-18,We are Getting Married!!!!,alphaonfire,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/ahc11l/we_are_getting_married/,"Wow. I can’t believe we are here. If you told me 8 years ago that we would end up here I would have laughed in your face. I would have said there is no way. No way we would have moved past all the barriers and made it this far.

Not for lack of wanting. It’s safe to say we both knew the other was special. I knew from the moment I met you that you were going to change my life and you did. I was so sorry when we went out separate ways. Mainly because I loved having you in my life. We would have never been able to be friends no matter how much losing your presence devastated me. So we tried to move on and for a while we did. 

I told you once that I wanted to thank you for the impact you had on me. Having you in my life ignited something. It pushed me to better myself. To be honest I was always an academic but I was fine with that being my internal life. Hopping from art museum to art museum. Play to play. Hip restaurants, concerts, traveling. The intellectual stimulation wasn’t something I really required in my professional life. Personal satisfaction was enough. Right before we met I started to realize I wouldn’t be fully happy unless I incorporated that side of me into my professional life. I changed my major and applied to graduate school. I applied for a host of prestigious internships. I made some huge academic strides. I’m not sure I would have ended up in the same place if I had not met you when I did. Something about you pushed me to be better. To try harder. To live a happier and fuller life. 

It’s not that I wouldn’t have been the same person. Deep down I was always a creative type who loved adventure and learning. Professionally I am not sure I would have ended up in the same place. I credit you a bit for driving me to end up in our nation’s capital. But that same decision is what kept us apart for many years. Sure life got in the way as well. But honestly, I think I would have come back to you sooner if it wasn’t for the distance.

Now you are my fiancé. I tried those words on for size last night on my flight to come see you while speaking to a stranger. It felt right. Not just right but amazing. Like I must have lost my mind or be dreaming. It almost doesn’t feel real. 

As we stood on your porch last night you used the same word. You had that shit eating grin that I love so much. A sparkle in your eyes. You looked so happy. 

It sounds cheesy but I’m looking forward to making you happy. To taking care of you. To starting a family. I didn’t tell you this but I actually considered not having kids for a long time. I was pretty set on it. As time started creeping up on me I realized that I did want kids just not with my ex. That my relationship with him was the problem and it wasn’t a lack of desire to start a family. That realization led to the end of that relationship. 

Tomorrow we start looking at wedding venues and there is so much to plan and figure out. You are so excited and it really reassures me that we are making one of the smartest decisions we could make. Sure we might be a little crazy. I often tell you that sometimes leaning in to the madness and taking risks reaps the best results. This, I am certain, is one of those situations. 

I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you. While planning a wedding is going to be fun... I am way more excited about what comes after. I’m excited to start our lives together and be your wife. 

I love you so much. I get right now I am scared and I have every reason to be. You have been so strong and such a great leader during a time where I have so much stress and uncertainty. I am very lucky. "

Hey there DPP,

So a fantasy for me has been thinking about which celebrity women are the kinkiest, what they do in private and how some lucky guy (or girl) is getting to do it to them. So what could be more fun then hearing about some of these filthy actions straight from the women involved?

I would love to play a BFF, an intern, a co-star or something along those lines that a celebrity woman plays around with on the side. They never actually fuck and it's usually very chill for them but she likes to tease him with her tales as she makes him jerk off, or jerks him off herself while making sure to commend him for his heavy balls and talking up how much she's looking forward to his load in the meantime. Even fingering herself and making sure that she gets off when he does or while she's telling her story before making sure her partner finishes too.

If it becomes a more long-term affair, we can introduce kinks going forward but I would like to at least begin with the set-up that she enjoys telling her stories in intricate details while teasing her partner. She can use her ass, thighs, hands, lips, face, panties, etc etc. How she does the teasing is up to you for sure as well as the tales! My guy will happily share his own, have requests/in-depth questions and have the biggest crush on your girl that you can imagine.

His race, age, height, dick-size and the like can be up to you if you have any specific wants and desires out of him so don't be afraid! As long as he is 18+ then I'm happy to oblige anything that would make him just a bit hotter for you!

I tend to like women 25+ but I am up for suggestions! Feel free to leave a small list or let me know if there is anyone specific that you would really like to play! Thanks for reading and looking forward to playing with anyone interested!"

ahd3it,10701,2019-01-18,I [23f] stopped being overly accommodating when my boyfriend [21m] wants to reschedule things at the last minute. We haven't seen each other in 2 weeks.,FedUpGirl002,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ahd3it/i_23f_stopped_being_overly_accommodating_when_my/,"My boyfriend kept cancelling or putting off things last minute because his friends ask him to hang out and he has major FOMO so he'll always say yes.

That was really frustrating for me because I have a much less flexible schedule than him. I work a full time job, he is a student. I do two sports, and he does one. I have hobbies that involve pre-planning such as backpacking and rock climbing, his main hobby is gaming which he can do anytime. I am looking for a new job and I am spending time at networking events and on teaching myself a new programming language, he doesn't spend much time on career development. He got his internships very easily at his dad's company, or through his dad's connections, and didn't need to spend time networking.

So to him, delaying or rescheduling something wouldn't be a big deal, because he doesn't have many solid commitments. For me, it is a big deal because I have a lot on my plate, and moving one thing will force me to shuffle my calendar, effecting several days.

For some time, I did that. Shuffling around my study time, skipping the gym, etc, to accommodate him wanting to put stuff off or reschedule last minute. Let's say we had a lunch date planned, and I wanted to go to a networking event after, and he was late for lunch, I'd let him push it off even if it meant missing my event. But I got sick of that, it was putting a lot of extra stress on me because I was inconveniencing myself. 

So, these last few weeks, I've been treating my calendar as set-in-stone. If I have a gym trip or sport practice planned, I go. If I have studying or career development events planned, I do that. If I want to get to bed by midnight to be well rested for work,, I do. I don't shuffle things around or cancel my plans if my boyfriend shows up late or wants to reschedule.

A few examples were on a Saturday, I'd planned to go to the gym in the morning, have a lunch date with my boyfriend at 11:30 am, start studying for interviews at 2 pm, and go see my friends at 6 pm. My boyfriend texted me around lunch time saying he'd be running late, and could we do a late lunch? I said that I had plans at 2 so I'd need to be done with lunch by 2. We ended up not doing lunch because by the time he'd be ready to go, it was too late.

He wanted to come hang out at my apartment on Sunday and I said that I'd be free from 7 pm on, but I wanted to be in bed by midnight. He wanted to come over at 11:45 and I said that was too late, I was getting ready for bed.

One weeknight, we had a dinner date planned, and he got invited out to dinner with his friends. He went, and then said we could go out for dinner after that. He'd be full but he'd have a drink while I ate. But by the time we'd planned to go out, he was still out with his friends. And I didn't care to wait around for him, just to be the only one eating, so I made myself dinner and cancelled the date.

On Friday night, I threw a party starting at 8 pm that my boyfriend was going to come to, and even help me set everything up for. It wrapped up around 1 am, and my friends went home. Through the whole thing my boyfriend had been texting me saying he'd come over soon once his gaming group finished their campaign. Just a little bit longer, just a bit longer, etc. He showed up just as everyone was putting on their shoes and coats, and I told him to go home because I was going to bed. I was drunk and didn't want to sleep with him after he'd flaked on my party. He said that he thought it would be fine to show up at one am because usually my friends and I will party until sunrise. But we haven't done that since college.

He asked yesterday when we could hang out, and I told him my next free night is next Wednesday, and he got mad he'd have to book with me almost week in advance. 

So, since I stopped accommodating his lateness and last minute delays and all, we haven't seen each other for 2 weeks except for when he showed up for the last 5 minutes of the party and I sent him home. We had plenty of stuff planned, but each time he tried to change the plan at the Last second, and I just stopped accommodating that.

I don't think I'm too much of a stickler for punctualness or schedules, it's been effortless to make plans with my friends and have them work out. I'm only having this issue with my boyfriend.

I don't know what to do from here. 

TLDR - I stopped being so accommodating when my boyfriend was late to stuff, or wanted to reschedule things at the last minute. Ever since I stopped going out of my way and accommodating his flakiness, we haven't hung out in weeks."
ahdkow,9,2019-01-18,"My mom dated a young, well endowed guy before she remarried",mymomhotpast,hotpast,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotpast/comments/ahdkow/my_mom_dated_a_young_well_endowed_guy_before_she/,"I discovered this sub not too long ago and I think this falls into hotpast territory. 

My mom was a single mom who had me early (teenage pregnancy). Her side of the family was wealthy so life wasn't as hard as it is for most kids with single parents. She wasn't a bad mom but she wasn't super responsible. She'd date a different guy every 1-2 years. 

The one guy I'm making this post for was almost 10 years younger than her, he was in his early 20s. He just started working as an intern in the same company as my mom, that's how they met.

The age difference was noticeable, people would stare at them. It was kind of embarrassing. But the most embarrassing for me was their sex. My mom would sometimes bring home the guys she dated, but with him it happened a lot more often.

I knew they were fucking when the tv was really loud in her room, which mostly (but not entirely) covered the sounds. I had (and still have) some sleep issues, so waking up in the middle of the night or taking hours to fall sleep happened every now and then. Sometimes when he'd stay over for the night and I'd leave my room to take a piss or get some water I could hear my mom moan or giggle in the middle of the night.

The worst part is they started dating right around when my puberty was kicking in. So that made me think about their sex even more.

And the thing that really messed me up was seeing his dick one day. One saturday morning my mom left her room, the door was still mostly open, i was walking past it and I saw the guy naked, checking something on his phone. He looked like he had a half chub. His length was pretty decent, but what really struck me was his girth. His dick looked so wide, probably thicker than my mom's wrists even in that state. I stared for a little before leaving and I don't think he noticed me. If i did I think he just thought I was walking by.

But anyway that made me pretty insecure about myself. And jealous. And it made me wonder if it was the reason why my mom was having more sex with him than with her previous partners, and why she seemed to enjoy it more.

Their relationship lasted about a year. Eventually my mom remarried a guy. He's a cool guy and I think she liked him (and still does). But their sex paled in comparison. It didn't happen nearly as often and I never heard a pip from my mom, unlike with her younger intern. I've never seen his dick but I've seen him in briefs and he looks average at best down there. My mom seems happy with him but I know she had the time of her life sexually with that previous guy ...

I know it's kind of weird to talk about my mom here but I thought it was more or less a hotpast story."

If you don' want to read this - please, scroll to the bottom and my points, answer my questions. It definitely will be stupid and immature for 90% of people. Sorry for formatting and mistakes, second language.

&amp;#x200B;

I met that one girl last year (lets name her C.) on a event of our small internet community (gaming community, related to one website). On that event she was with her boyfriend at a time, I saw both of them first time then. They were both living in a city few hours from mine (in a different appartments). I didn't talk to her a lot that day.

The thing is I wasn't looking for a girlfriend at all, actually. I was 18 at a time. I'm still in high school (not USA, european version of high school), I was then learning IT, working part-time, and now I'm still learning in last grade, not working anymore. So I has not so many time, so any relationship would fail. And I have issues about my look, myself, my family, and other things - I'm still thinking that I'm not good boyfriend for anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But she talk to me few months after, C. was going to my city to see friend (from our community, so I knew her but never saw her before), asking if I maybe have time and want to see (me, her, and that friend). Aaaaand this was totally different than the last time. We were talking a lot, she was really nice, it was great. She said she is not with her BF because ""they have problems"", okay, I wasn't asking. The whole day we were walking together under my umbrella because it was raining. A the end, after fighting with myself,  I embraced her under the umbrella, and she did the same to me. I was feeling awesome, and awful at the same time thinking about her boyfriend. But, it was it, the meeting was over, I didn't do anything wrong, later she just kissed me on a cheek and she go to her city (yeah, and that friend di to me the same, the whole day I was forgetting about her because I was thinking about C.).

&amp;#x200B;

Then she invite me to her city, to spend time at her town. Me and that one friend. I goes there, met her family, spend few hours together, it was great. I asked about her boyfriend and she said that it's the past, he was awful, that one friend said this is true, ""I was always telling you he is terrible"", etc. So it was some signals to me. Later she took my phone as a joke and told me to give me something for it, so i give her a kiss (on a cheek again) and she was happy.  The whole thing - it was great for me. Some girl was first time notcing me! Liking me! 

&amp;#x200B;

And then I go to my city back again. It was a summer time, so I was free from school and working full-time as an intern, so lot of free times. And we were talking and talking and talking everyday. And finally one day she confessed her love to me. She said I'm handsome, she like me, we have many things in common. She wanted to be together. 

It was really hard to me. I really liked her too, she is pretty, we have common hobbies AND she is older than me - so she is mature, it won;t be some stupid teenage love. But it would be a long distance realtionship. Then I had a lot of time, but as soon as school started - again not so many time. And I was thinking she deserves someone better than me, I was really afraid about that. But she told me everything is okay, lond distance relationship can work and it would work and she is planning to move to my city anyway soon (my city is big, really big, many opportunities). So after some thinking I told her okay, lets try it.  


And I was riding to her every 2 weeks on bus (no driving license and no car), and it was the best time of my life. First weekend we were talking, playing together, I finally cuddle and it felt awesome. We were sleeping in one bed but without any sexual thing, her parents in other room and I wasn't feeling ready yet. The second time there was some sexual stuff and more kissing, and more of this every ""trip"". It was great to love and be loved. After few months I was feeling ready and we tried sex.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm to immature to relationship. The whole time I was scared I would do something wrong and destroy the realtionship, I was telling her sorry for everything whole time, she was relaxing me, but I was still afraid. I still have issues that I'm ugly and all that things. She was with me and her relaxing me feel good. But after some time I think she had enough of this, the things wasn't perfect between us, I think she preffered someone older and more mature. I was scared that she would come back to her ex and be with him, too. He was living 2 streets from her, and me in another town, and they were friends and were talking and seeing each other regulary - it felt terrible to me.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, after time, my trips to her after some time wasn't as good at first. She was more cold to me. In the bed she doesn't wanted to cuddle anymore. It's not about sex, I just wanted to hug her and sleep together - and suddenly she wanted to just sleep alone (on the same bed, but without much hugging). I didn;t know waht is going on, I wanted it to be better. Our talking trhough internet get worse too, less talking and less with time. At some time I wanted to call her everyday just for few minutes, just ot hear her voice, thinking it may improve something. Yeah, and then for 2 weeks she suddenly didn't have any time to talk at all, because at work she can't, at home she because something, because something, becasue something, and at night her phone is broke and is charging and yeah, she could text me but no calling. I was really confused, why she can't just talk to me for one minute? One minute? I was confronting her, I told her to get the phone of her brother, etc etc but everything have excuse. I finally asked here why she is lying to me and she get offended and goes to sleep.

And the thing over we get quarrel about was my lectures. I'm going to lectures at university, to learn about IT. It is great to me, I learn much about many stuff. It is a little late, I came back late to my home but it is good to me. But no, to her I wasn't respecting school, I should get more focus on school, etc. But I get best grade in my class. I was thinking it's awesome I'm going to study at university while being in high school - but no, to her it was awful. She didn;t said that to me but she preffered I'd stop doing that. And you know, after fighting and after everytinh, I stopped going there, I just don't have energy to this.

&amp;#x200B;

So, one day I goes to her. It was okay, but still cold between us. And on the last day, she just told me it is not working. We need time. I need time to end school, she needs time to her things. It's not over, we may came back together. But now it's not working.

&amp;#x200B;

It was before Christmas, around 10th december. And I'm still just broke inside. I think about her every day. I think about things I just fucked up. I was supposed to go to her place at new years eve, spend it together. And after break up I was still going there, but she cancelled it for some reason. And the I just died inside. I stopped talking to her, I just couldn't, it hurt so much. Some time ago we started to speak again, it still hurts.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is - no, it would not work, we not be together again. We live different lives. I won't move to her city (smaller, no opportunities for me), she won't move to mine (yeah, after time she changed her mind I think). It just doesn't work.  But I want be with her.

&amp;#x200B;

So, main things:

1. I feel I'm to immature to be with someone. I learned some things (don't open too much to someone at early stage of relationship, I shouldn't have told her my insecurities, and other stuff), but still I feel like it was all a huge mistake - she told me that things will work out, but it didn't (I don't blame her, I should tell her ""No"" few months ago or just never met her). I feel like I just fucked up my first relationships and it should be something special, not something like that.
2. I feel like it is not the end, but it should, it just will not work. But, if I tried to be with her a few years later, when I would be like 22 let's say, I would get then better job, car, more time, etc. And things would work better. But now, I fucked everyting now and I will not have a second chance. 
3. She basically picked me. She choose me. She was thinking that I have something in me, that thing. That I'm someone speciall. I don't know, I'm just too afraid that I will not be with anyone other - I know, everybody thinks that at some point. But what if that happens to me. I'm to afraid of rejection to ask anyone out, only women on this planet interested on me asked me out, what are the odds there will be another.
4. I wanted to be someone special in her live. To be something special in her heart. I was afraid I will be just another boyfriend, some bad episode of her live. And, looks like I will be. I'm just thinking all the time, that soon she will be with someone else and I just feel terrible. It hurts. Is it stupid?
5. I just regret it. I just feel awful. If it didn't happened to me, I would just be feeling normal, thinking about work or school. But I can't. I know, this will disappear with time, but I just regret whole thing. She know my personal stuff and secrets, she was my first girlfriend, I wish it didn't happened.

tl;dr first girlfriend, she picked me, long distance, didn't work. I regret everything, feel deppressed."

ahfl9v,2,2019-01-18,Is it appropriate to cold call/email smaller CPA firms to ask if they are hiring an intern?,thestolenlighter,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ahfl9v/is_it_appropriate_to_cold_callemail_smaller_cpa/,"I'm a junior accounting major working towards 150 credits. Currently my GPA is pretty low because of some mistakes with non-accounting classes, which has barred me from applying from getting involved with the big 4 recruitment process. I don't really have any accounting experience besides a collections and bookkeeping assistant for a local BHPH car dealership. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've applied to a lot of the internships I qualify for within the Philadelphia area. Would it be appropriate to reach out to smaller CPA firms and ask if they are interested in hiring an intern, especially for tax season? How would I go about finding local CPAs and seeing if they'd be open to an intern? Would it be appropriate to do so without having any contact with the firm or people working there previously?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to proceed would be lovely. I'm very lost and want to get some experience this spring semester, so I can try to get a full-time internship for the summer and not have to do retail again. Thanks!"
ahfz2t,4,2019-01-18,Looking For Writing Partners (Long term!) F Seeking Male characters,hac20010,RoleplayPartnerSearch,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/ahfz2t/looking_for_writing_partners_long_term_f_seeking/,"Hi! I go by Addie here on the interwebs i am 28 years old and have 10+ years of experience writing and role-playing! I posted here just over a week ago but my internet decided to act out so my notifications got a little screwy so for anyone who reached out and I didn't reply, my apologies, the issue has been fixed!  I live in the Central Standard Time Zone and even if I am not ALWAYS able to write every second of the day, I am always lurking thanks to technology and push notifications! I'm posting here in hopes that I can find someone to write with on a long term basis. I would also like to maybe even forge a friendship of sorts out of the deal because I am super into OOC conversation as well. I've started a job that requires at least one 12 hour day, but again, I am always around.I LOVE plotting just as much as I LOVE to write the story out.  


I will tell you, right off the bat,  that I have one writing partner who lives countries away, but we have a whole Discord server with 30+ channels and more 5+ google docs related to one role-play we have going on. I love intricate and intense plot lines but that doesn't have to be how we start out. Also don't let those numbers intimidate you, it took a while for all those things to come about. All I am trying to say is I can get pretty invested and would love if my writing partner was just that into what we are trying to do. I would prefer to play with 21+ only because some of the themes I like can be pretty NSFW, and I am not comfortable playing with people to much younger than myself.  


I honestly have a bunch of different platforms I like using the role-play with so just send me a DM if you are interested, and we could figure things out from there. Obviously with Discord it would be nice since we could have multiple channels going for OOC, plot stuff, actual story etc. but we don't have to use that if it isn't your cup of tea! I am fairly laid back so not to worry there! If you want to stop writing with me either forever or to take a break, that's totally fine, just let me know! There are times where I might not be available for a few days, but I always try to communicate that to who I am writing with and I would love if my partner did the same! As much as I love to write, we all have personal lives outside of it, and I understand that entirely. 

I am a female and prefer playing the female character of a MXF pairing. Though I am also open to FXF and would be willing to write male for the right person who would be patient with me while I continue to get more comfortable writing for them. I don't double but I also do not mind having multiple supporting characters to make our world and story make more sense and would expect the same from the person who writes with me. I do this as a hobby and something fun but I also put tons of effort into my stories including tiny details like medication names and what types of phones were out in that year if its a modern role-play. Its the tiny details that make the story more believable and therefore more fun and immersive.I write in 3rd person and try to always give multiple paragraphs, the more detail the better. Sometimes the reply will be small but I always do my best to avoid one liners. How crummy does that feel when you have written 7+ paragraphs and then you get back one sentence every single time? Nope! Not my style! Though I do understand, sometimes to get the story going past a certain point, only a couple lines are what is necessary. I always say quality over quantity.

I'm okay with writing original work or fandom. Original is a bit more fun if only because you can create absolutely everything from religion down to the name of some plants. I LOVE romance and slice of life but ALSO drama angst and everything in between. I only have some limits like VOR and MPREG and things along those lines but anything, and I mean pretty much anything else, I am most likely fine with. If you knew some of the themes in the book I am working on co-authoring it might shock some of you. Smut is great just like romance, but again, I don't want to just jump into either theme. It is all about chemistry for me and I want to watch our characters grow together and see where life takes them though I will admit I usually (meaning always) ship everything right off the bat. Lets work toward that romance, and really feel it as we writ it but I would also like to make sure that it is not the main focus of story either.

Speaking of romance, give me all the smut, though I will admit here and now, I as a person am fairly, ""vanilla,"" but that is not to say I want my characters to be. If anyone is willing to explore a woman, 'finding herself,' I would so be up for that!

Also two other final things: I get way over excited about plots that we discuss and work really hard on, and my characters I write will swear like sailors, so if that offends anyone, so sorry!

Here I will list the fandoms I like and pairings to go along with them. I will make sure the character I would want to play are in bold font.

\~Harry Potter: RemusX**Anna** (my OC which I would be more than happy to give details on if you are at all interested in this)\~Sherlock:SherlockX**Molly or OC**\~Doctor Who: 10X**Rose**

Those are the three I have tried and would be most comfortable playing in though I am willing to try other fandoms and pairings as well!NoneFandom ideas/plot bunnies

\~A fantasy world with magic, dragons, all that fun stuff. We can create this world and even go as in depth as laws, days of the week, planet name. Etc. (In this one we could even play siblings that are obviously not romantically involved but maybe part of a royal family, and we could explore the dynamics of this)  
\~BossX**subordinate**  
\~FBI internship: Very intelligent **high schooler** gets an internship opportunity with the FBI and one of the men on the force gets to know her and takes her along on some random missions he isn't supposed to since she is supposed to stay in the building working admin type duties at all times. (I have more on this so just let me know if you are interested at all)  
\~Mafia boss son/HeirX**News reporter** from another country:includes some super natural abilities. (another one I have more info, just message me.)  
\~Something where a female needs saving and even if they don't get along at first a male comes to the rescue. I am a sucker for the whole night in shinning armor bit.  
\~anything romcom (I saw someone mentioned the movie, 'While You Were Sleeping,' and I forgot how much I have been dying to play something like that but with the roles being reversed! Please!!!)  
\~Having to pretend both muses are engaged to help one of them out of a sticky situation and then it eventually turns out they really do fall in love  
\~something with demons or vampires, exploring the dark sides of the universe could be super thrilling!  
\~anything having to do with anything supernatural. I have a particular craving for telekinesis and or telepathy right now.    \~someone famous/A fan.someone else end up together somehow  
\~2 strangers trapped on an elevator (mostly because this is an actual fear of mine and maybe playing through the experience could help??)

Let me know if any of these ideas interest you, or if my post inspires you to want to connect and maybe discuss becoming potential writing partners with me! I'm not expecting you to be super in depth with your hello, but give me something? Looking forward to hearing from any and everyone! if i haven't scared you away, bravo!"

While my father and siblings were amazingly supportive, my mom was furious.

My mom is going to stop paying my tuition for my last semester of college in the fall. I need to plan for this financially. Any tips?

My mom has always been very controlling, and has monitored as much as she could about my life. This includes every purchase that I make. I need to cancel my current credit cards and make a new checking and savings account that she can’t access. Ironically, she has already cancelled two in secret, so that’s good. 

I am also still on my parent’s health insurance. I need it for HRT. When I came out I offered to let my parents come with me to my first appointment, but now I regret offering.

Should I actually delay my appointment until I move out? What are my options if she takes me off of health insurance anyway?

I’ll be moving out to my brother’s place, so rent isn’t a big issue.

ahh37p,5,2019-01-18,[SP] Time Trapper,xYasune,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ahh37p/sp_time_trapper/,"Walking through the bustling streets of the Czech Republic packed with small bodegas and bazaars, I notice an old man sitting underneath a purple velvet tent. A wide mahogany table stood before him, showing off the profusion of analog clocks set on top of it. Roman, grandfather, pendulum, any type of clock imaginable from just about any era. Hell, there was even a gilded Arabian sundial on the table.

My curiosity got the best of me as I approach the man at the tent.

“Hello there! Looking for anything in particular?” the man asks with a thick Czech accent.

“Nope, just browsing. How’d you get all these clocks?” I ask in efforts to start a friendly conversation.

“Oh, from many different places. This sundial here is from a village in the Arabian city of Thāj,” he answered, picking up the gold sundial I spotted earlier.

“Don’t you mean Riyadh? If I recall correctly, Thāj existed way back in the time of the Greeks,” I replied, attempting to use my knowledge as an archaeology intern.

“No, I mean Thāj. See, this clock was made in 331 B.C. Using the clock properly will allow you to go back to the year it was created in the ancient city of Thāj,” the man said with a straight face.

What the fuck is this guy on? I knew sellers in this area sell some of the strangest items, but this is beyond the weirdest of anything I’ve found in this city.

“I’m sorry, what?” was all I could muster to say.

“I’m a time trapper. I trap portions of time in clocks and sell them. Clocks from the Byzantine era are on sale currently if you’re interested,” he said, picking up an ornate red and gold clock, etched with Roman numerals.

No way is this real. This guy’s obviously crazy. But still, my curiosity got the best of me.

“So how do you use these to go back in time?” I questioned, playing along.

“Set the clock back to the exact time the clock was created. It will send you to that time of the day the clock was made,”

“And how would I know what time the clock was made?”

“It’s just a matter of right and wrong,” the man says to me.

So, let me get this straight. This crazy old dude is telling me that I can buy an old clock, set it to some random time and hope it takes me back in time? I regret the next few words I spoke.

“How much is this one?” I asked, pointing to a simple wooden quartz clock.

“This clock from the German city of Rhineland is 4800 US dollars,” he answers.

My mouth drops. There's no way I would ever pay double my rent for a fucking clock.

“Looking at your face, I can tell that’s a bit out of your budget. How’s this?” he asks, pointing out a copper Mayan clock.

“How much?” I instantly ask.

“80 US dollars. It’s at a good value, considering this dates back to the Mayan era,” he responds.

“I’ll take it,” I say, without another thought.

I dig into my pocket and hand him my blue Amex card.

“Don’t accept cards. Only cash.”

You’ve got to be kidding me. I count my loose bills scattered around my wallet and come out to eighty. I hand him the crumpled bills. He inspects the bills thoroughly, then neatly packs them into his metal cash register. Surprisingly, there were already stacks of cash in there. People are actually out here buying clocks from this crazy dude claiming to travel through time. But then again, I am one of those people.

Momentarily, the man hands me a dark brown bag with the clock inside, wrapped with gray paper.

Later, I get together with a friend and grab dinner, completely forgetting about the clock. It wasn’t until I got back to my hotel around midnight that I remembered about the clock. I place the bag on top of my bed and slowly unwrap its contents. I pull out the clock and begin to marvel at its detail. This is way more interesting than any of the garbage I find at the historic repository I intern at back in Los Angeles.

The clock is round and about the size of a plate. The edge, I assume, is made from pure copper. The face of the clock is a light coffee colored stone, sanded to be smooth to the touch. The face is decorated with an ornate painting of a sun, done with dark brown paint to match the copper edge. Surrounding the sun painting were twelve black Mayan numerals in the circle, reading from one to twelve.

Turning it to its back, I noticed a small black dial. This must be used to adjust the time. I turn the dial a few degrees and watch the hands move on the opposite side. Suddenly, the clock begins to heat up immensely. I gasp and suddenly toss the clock back onto the bed. I inspect my hands and find scorch marks from the clock.

What just happened?

I look at the clock again, when all of a sudden, a bright white light blinds my eyesight. I lose my balance and can feel myself toppling down onto the ground. A cold gust of wind entangles my body as my limbs begin to go numb.

For a second, I thought I was dying. I couldn’t see, hear, or feel anything, except the cold wind and the jarring light in my face.

Seconds, maybe minutes pass and I finally begin to grab ahold of my senses once more. I slowly stand up and open my eyes.

I find myself in the middle of some sort of desert city. Stone pyramids, clay houses, and people wearing strange-looking attire surround me. I look down and see myself still wearing the same Adidas joggers and gray t-shirt I was wearing back in the hotel. The clock sits in my hands, cold to the touch. It seems to have shrunk, as it’s now the size of my palm.

All I could think was that I had actually traveled through time. Surveying my surroundings, I concluded that I must be in some ancient Mayan city, in at least in the year 700 AD.

Looking back at the clock, I come to a realization. The man never told me how to go back to the present."

ahhb2c,4,2019-01-18,I'm graduating college in May. I've been lusting after a BRZ for the last 5 years. I already have a salaried job lined up after graduation making 50K per year.

I'm a software engineer who got hired through the internship I've been working since last June.  I'll be making 50K once I graduate, and right now I'm making $25 per hour working an average of 25 hours per week (two 10-hour days plus a remote 8 hour Sunday every other week).  I do not have any student loans or any debt.  I recently sold a small company for around $300K and used that money to pay back my father, who paid for my college in full.   No, I didn't have to do so, but he has given me everything.  The least I could do was to give him back my tuition, at least.

I have been drooling over a BRZ for the last 5 years.  Ever since the 2013 model I've been 100% sold on getting one.  I know it isn't fast.  I know it isn't a WRX.  I want one anyway.  I like the way it looks.  I loved the way it felt to test-drive it when I did so a few months ago.  I want one.

But it's expensive.  I want the automatic gearbox with paddle shifters because I commute to work and often sit in traffic.  Also, not gonna lie, I'm not the best with a clutch pedal.  I know how to do it, but I don't know how to do it well.  I also want the kicker sub because I'm an asshole and I want my music loud.

So the point of this post is to appeal to BRZ owners.  Why *shouldn't* I buy one.

And don't say head gaskets, because I can afford to fix them."

ahhwtg,7,2019-01-18,My Girlfriend (f22) and I (m22) are having some disagreements regarding cleaning the apartment and I think that it's started ruining the relationship.,Throw9621,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ahhwtg/my_girlfriend_f22_and_i_m22_are_having_some/,"To premise, we have been in a relationship for nearly 6 years now, my first, and it's sometihing I don't want to give up easily on without a lot of consideration, but the arguments we've been having are making me question what I truly want from this relationship and I'm not sure where to go from here.

I moved into her apartment last July and things were great unitll mid November. I'm on my placement year at uni in the UK. My internship turned into a part time job and I started working at my uni too, helping out 3 days a week in one of the previous years modules. Around this time, she also got a part time job at a pet shop for 3 days a week. I worked 5 days, 3 at uni + 2 at work, for nearly 50 hours yet I would have no help doing anything around the apartment. No dishes would be washed, nothing was cleaned. Her excuse was that her job was more physically demanding and she needed the rest, but that doesn't me that my jobs weren't stressful either, albeit mainly mentally draining. 

I was working and yet still making sure we had a semi clean place to live while she sat around watching some Korean shows on Netflix and when I asked her to do some on the days she was off, she would always retort with the same excuse as above.

I had two weeks off over Christmas and I made sure I cooked for her when she got home, do the house chores etc all out of love for her. 

I'm a junior software developer at a startup with short deadlines so I have to learn fast and do the best I can but doing all this and getting home to do more chores is getting tiring and very stressful.

We had a conversation about this before Christmas and I thought we agreed to split the chores; whoever cooks, the other cleans etc. But we had an argument last night as this was never happening after all my asking and aparantly I was putting words in her mouth and we never agreed on anything. From this point she blanked me for 2 days giving me the silent treatment expecting me to apologise. I haven't and we're were on speaking terms again. 

I was never good in conversations or spontaneous talking so generating a response takes a while, so in heated arguments where I know she's in the wrong, I can't argue my point because I can't think properly. I think she knows this and is taking advantage of this and using it against me.

From the argument last night, she said why don't we clean our own things separately, and she meant do everything separately (clothes, plates, dishes, forks, you name it) , but to me, that just sounds like a roommate and not a relationship where you work together and sacrifice for each other.

After the argument, she took 40 mins to go to the corner shop barely a minute down the road. I don't know what to think of this. 

I clean and cook when I get back all the time but cause she has big clean days every other month nearly, she uses that against me in the arguments saying I never help out in them. I recognise that yes I stick to one room usually during them due to my anxiety as she usually has her mother over to help and I don't know her that well surprisingly after 6 years. 

I'm busting my arse trying to further my career while she lounges around on her days off and does nothing to help or encourage me. I've tried suggesting to her why not apply for university or improve yourself somehow but she always ignores it.

She also owes me a lot of money, nearly £200 now as she just spends before she gets paid and the I have to cover her bills unitll she can pay me back. I would say she's good with that, but it still seems like she pays me back and then spends again. 

I should also mention I have anxiety and suffer with depression too. I've recently come off my meds as I was a whole lot better (didn't quit cold turkey) but it and my insomnia is coming back with all this stress at home. 

This has all got me starting to think about what I want from life and a relationship. She also goes on about kids soon and I don't want that yet, maybe if ever, I'm not sure yet, but if she's like this with me, I don't want to consider what state our place would be with a kid. She also talked about marriage previously but all the details she gave made it sound like she wanted the wedding more than an actual marriage. 

Please remember that this is a 6 year relationship which has just started turning sour and I don't know how to handle things from here and I really do appreciate any advice. 

Thanks.

TLDR: 6 year relationship, my first, I bust my ass off at work and uni, nearly 50 hour weeks, still doing way more than my fair share of cleaning but Gf is just lounging around doing nothing on her days off. Can't get through to her, advice please"

ahieun,3,2019-01-18,I'm terrified of looking for a job and I really don't know how to do it.,nabuy,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ahieun/im_terrified_of_looking_for_a_job_and_i_really/,"Basically the title. I was always okay-ish at school, I always liked studying and reading things. And for the longest time I was in an environment where that was more than enough to be a ""good kid"". I volunteered until fairly recently, I have a part-time job. I thought I was doing okay. Last summer  I was applying for internships (maybe to like 10-ish places?) and I wasn't accepted to any of them. I tried not to let it get to me. I told my friends about it with a jokey tone, ""Yo it's their loss,  I'm the baddest bish out here lololol"" but I know it got to me. I know after the summer I have done basically nothing in the job-hunting category. A bunch of personal stuff happened and I was like fuck this, I'm going back to my home country to be close with my family, and just...chill for a bit so that I can be in a mentally better state and come back to all this. That's in a couple of weeks and it will apparently seriously impede my job-hunting because there is a established job-hunting season here.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my school's therapist in an attempt to force myself to do shit, I told her a long version of the above and she was like ""Maybe we should find something for you that is outside of the system so that you don't have to be anxious about it?"" Lady, if it were that easy I wouldn't be here. I went to the career support center at school as a desperate call for help and  the nice old man who was there gave me a long list of ""character traits"" and told me I should tick the ones that I think I have. (They call it ""self evaluation"")""Problem-solving""...is something even really a problem if you can solve it though?  It's as if the Internet doesn't exist. Problems are things we can't solve or they wouldn't be fucking problems. ""Cooperative""...the fuck does that even mean? What kind of person says ""no I'm not cooperative""? A guerilla? A terrorist? Even those people need to coordinate with their group to serve their purpose/interests. ""Logical""...who the fuck thinks that they aren't logical? Nobody really thinks that. Even the most delusional of people justify their own actions/thoughts. I read through the thing and I couldn't tick any of them because of all these dumb counter-arguments that my Edgy Teen (TM) brain comes up with. I tried studying for those ""are you a dum-dum or not? Let's find out!"" tests that some companies give that are supposed to test your reading comprehension and whether or not you can figure out where point A of a pentagram will land if it rolled around 1056 times. I wish I could just get off my ass and just tell myself ""hey, dumbass, if you're that smart you'd just grow a pair and go do it instead of complaining of how dumb it is"". But I can't. It's not just boring, it's unproductive because it's more of a race against time (there's a time limit) than about ideas. This was not like how I would still try back in high school even though I was shit at math. I didn't like it, I wasn't good at it, but I still believed that it served some purpose in the long run. This is different. I went through the whole internship applying thing and I remember putting so much effort and thought to everything only to get an automated email saying ""We are sorry to inform that you weren't selected"". It's the first time I realized that effort has nothing to do with anything. Intention has nothing to do with results. And it was devastating.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what I'm looking for here. I feel stuck. I'm afraid, both of trying and failing. Of rejection. Of societal pressure. Of making decisions that will determine my life. People keep saying ""Stop thinking! Stop letting it get to you! Just do! Just clench your teeth and do it! You're smart! You're definitely better than me! You can do it! I believe in you!"" Believe in what? What is there to believe?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I can't bring myself to start looking for a job or start applying because it is daunting, and the last internship applying process+ personal stuff really fucked me up. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking."
ahir4z,19,2019-01-18,Deciding between offers - Advice,CarLovinActuary,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/ahir4z/deciding_between_offers_advice/,"So I recently received two offers back to back, both out of my ideal location and I need a little advice.

1)  This offer is with a mid-size life company in a suburban area, so it carries a smaller city feel.  The role itself seems to imply a lot more responsibility than (2) because it is with a smaller company and I would be the only person on this specific team (excluding my potential manager).  Although it is still an entry-level position, and I had a relevant internship regarding the work I'll be doing.  

2)  This offer is in a very large city in a health role with a much larger company (which is intimidating in the idea of learning to live in a city of said size).  This role seems to be very focused on development of the actuarial staff and easing into more responsibility.  This position does have a formal rotation program where the other does not and I really liked the people I met and the environment, albeit a little intimidating size-wise.  


Both offers are similar pay wise, although (2) has a 3% higher salary with a sign on bonus, but this doesn't seem to justify moving to a city that has a higher COL.  Both companies offer similar study programs although (2) is much more strict in terms of progression.  The 401k plan with (1) is a bit more generously matched, but other benefits seem to be fairly balanced/similar.  

Overall, I thought I would be 100% towards offer (1), but based on my interview experience and the overall culture of (2) I am having second thoughts.  I am a bit more interested in life than health, but don't have enough real experience to say I am opposed to health and (1) is closer to where I'd like to be (family and gf).  

Should I be putting more focus on the money and industry (health vs life) at entry level, or should I be more focused on culture?  If anyone has had similar experiences to either of my two choices, what would you recommend as far as development, the smaller company with more responsibility, or the larger company with more focus on easing into responsibility by starting with small projects, etc? 

Any general input would be appreciated as well!"

My goal is to finish my bachelors degree and get PR as fast as possible without wasting too many years.

My situation is that I currently have 2 offers where one is from Flinders and another is from UoW(University of Wollongong). I am currently turning 22 this month and will be studying computer science for 2 years as I’m transferring from a university in Hong Kong. Which is starting this Feb, I have only a few days to make my decision and am in dire need of help. Im extremely sorry if this ends up being long as I did promise I would try to keep it short.

I was wondering what would be the best approach if I wanted to gain PR?

As of currently, I was thinking that my best way to get PR would be through the 189 skill test. As of currently, I will these points

&amp;#x200B;

18-24 years old = 25 points 

English language = 20 ( I am in the proficient section but am confident I should be able to get 79 through PTE) Australian education qualification = 5

Professional year = 5 ( will do professional year if needed)

1 year work experience in Aus through graduate visa = 5 ( I plan to hopefully work a year there and gain the experience )

Bachelors degree qualification = 15

&amp;#x200B;

Wollongong route total points = 70 ( if I complete professional year or get 1 year experience I will be 25/26 years old so 75 and if I am able to get state nomination ill be at 80 though I think thats being too optimistic?) would this be sufficient down the line in about 3 years? Im skeptical as seeing all the competition Im worried it wont be enough.

Flinders route: 80 points due to low population area. ( 85 if Im able to get state nomination which I think will be easier in Adelaide than Wollongong? I think)

So that is my game plan above, which route would you suggest taking? I want to go to UoW as it is a better university in terms of ranking which will help if I decide to return to HK but I do want to prioritise PR as well so I can get both my degree and PR status. Which would you suggest I do and which route would give me the best chances?

I have spoke to some migration agent but my contact has been limited due to them only willing to look at my case after I pay the fees which I cannot financially afford at the moment. What I did gain from speaking to 1 was I shouldn’t change my path of going to UoW and try seeing if there are other ways. He as even if I go to Flinders due to the policy changing annually it still may not be a guarantee that I will get PR through going to Flinders and all. What would you suggest I do?

Lastly, I just wanted to clear some doubts.

1. Am I able to gain the 1 year experience while studying? Or is it only able after I have completed my studies?
2. Does part time work count as experience? For example on the medium and long term list there is Web developer if I were to do part time web developer jobs while I do my professional year would it count towards it?
3. Am I able to apply for the 189 visa if my job isn’t listed on the medium and long term list?
4. Will I have to declare my job? Like for example, if they require web developer does that mean while applying I can apply as a Web developer on the 189 visa, as long as I have 1 year worth of web developer experience? Or how does it work, as In IT a lot the programming skills are interchangeable so experience in lets say network security can also help in web developer roles so how do they actually check these roles? Would it mean that my best way would be to check the roles in need when graduating and then apply for these roles and gain 1 year experience in them for the best chance in PR status?
5. How does the 190 visa work? Is it that, if your job roll is in the short term skill shortage you may apply and may get state nominated and then get PR? If I get this would I believe I have to stay in australia in the state nominated area for 2 years, so during that 2 years am I able to leave the country for a short period of time like 1-2 months etc? Also what are the chances slim according to you if I were to try for state nomination in Wollongong or would it be better to do it in adelaide? Lastly, is it possible to lets say graduate from UoW but move to a state where its easier to get state nomination and apply from there? Like move to Adelaide for example after graduating and then applying from there to increase my chances on 190 visa.
6. Is it worth it to go to Flinders just for the 5 points? Does going to increase my chances substantially due to the points from region and maybe higher chances in state nomination?
7. Lets say I have enough points for the cutoff that year after graduating, will I be able to apply for the 189 visa without any experience? Or is experience required?
8. If Im put in a scenario where I had to choose between getting a year experience first or doing professional year which one should I do first? As from my research, professional year is basically like going to school with classes for 7 months and 3 months internship, I wont be able to get any experience beside the 3 months during internship as the agent said part time work wont count.
9. Are there any other routes I could take to get PR?
10. Any tips/advice or things you would like to warn me about?

Thank you very much in advance! I need to make my decision in a few days so I am in dire need of advice."

ahjpdq,1,2019-01-19,Update or Restart Background Investigation?,gwnci82,SecurityClearance,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityClearance/comments/ahjpdq/update_or_restart_background_investigation/,"In 2017, I received a conditional offer for a summer 2018 internship with an agency which requires a TS clearance and polygraph.

My background was favorably adjudicated in late June 2018, but I was ultimately unable to accept the final offer and therefore I was never actually given the clearance. 

This past December, a few days before the shutdown, I received an offer for a summer 2019 internship with the same agency (which is affected by the shutdown). 

Presumably because the HR staff is furloughed, I haven’t received the paperwork yet, so the clearance process hasn’t begun. As the shutdown continues, I’m getting worried I won’t get cleared in time to start this summer unless the investigators can start off where they finished last year. 

Since the same agency adjudicated my background last year, will they only have to investigate anything new since June 2018, or will they have to restart the entire investigation?
Will the fact that my background was favorably adjudicated last year make this year’s process go any quicker?"

Another Friday the 13th, this time in October. The air was cool and crisp, and everything looked golden: the ground, the trees the sky. The city was paved in sunlight and yellow leaves that crunched rhythmically underfoot. It was a normal autumn day, and anyone in their right mind would have wanted to spend it outside, reading, walking, just basking in it. No one would have wanted to go to a cheesy office party slash “team-building” exercise, that was really just a poor excuse for Glynnis to use her old Halloween decorations, and for Larry to make jokes about pumpkins and black cats. And don’t forget Ed, and his endless “bad luck” trivia. A broken glass gives you 7 years of bad luck—or is it 8? Who cares? Not Joseph. It was his second such party, and he was already tired of the recycled material. But he was relatively new to the office and he wanted to, if not make friends, at least not rock the boat. So he smiled when it was appropriate, giving half-hearted chuckles here and there, frequenting the punch bowl a bit too often while he wondered how an internship at a well-known and well-respected tech company could turn out to be so utterly lame. He needed to go home and rethink his life. All 23 years of it. 
	

Swaying back and forth a bit as he said his goodbyes, Joseph ambled toward the staircase, tripping down to the second floor as he struggled to wrap his scarf around him. It was obnoxiously large and green, but his mother had sent it with him when he left home. “You California boys don’t know how cold it can get out there…make sure you bundle up!” Her constant fussing over him was annoying, but appreciated. After all, he was his parent’s oldest child and it made sense that they’d be extra nervous about him going out on his own. He pushed open the door to the lobby and sprinted across the tile and through the glass door that lead to the outside. 

	
The air was cool and crisp and leaves were spiraling upwards towards the sunset. It was lovely, and after the stuffiness of the party-meeting, Joseph welcomed it. He circled around the building to take the long road home, through the promenade where all the museums were. The street was wide, cars coming and going on either side of a tree-lined walking path. It wasn’t really tourist time, they would be there later in the year to see the snow. This time of year the promenade was filled with natives enjoying the peace of their city, taking advantage of their resident passes to enjoy the famous artwork that people from abroad traveled thousands of miles to see. 
	

Joseph liked art, and he appreciated the museums but not today. He just wanted to enjoy being outside. He sat on a bench to people-watch for a bit. To his left an elderly couple was walking hand in hand, pointing at the buildings, maybe recounting precious memories.  He stared at them for a moment, but something brushed against his leg and he jumped in surprise. He looked down to see a small black cat, purring and rubbing against him. “Oh, hey there…kitty,” he said nervously. Joseph had never liked cats. He had gotten bitten by his neighbor’s orange tabby when he was a kid, and he’d avoided cats ever since. He tried to shoo the cat away, but it hopped up onto the bench beside him. He flinched, stood up quickly and started down the path towards home. 
	

The sun was setting anyway, and he had just enough time to get home before his show came on. Maybe he would order a pizza. He looked back at where he’d been sitting, a habit he’d picked up from his mom, she was always walking off without her keys, gloves, purse, child…and Joseph had learned to look back to make sure he had everything with him. He did this time. There was nothing left on the bench but the black kitten, sitting, staring, mewling after him, its tail curled around its feet. Joseph shuddered and kept walking. After a few steps he looked back again, just out of curiosity, and the cat was still watching him. Its eyes were strikingly green eyes, almost the color of his scarf, it also looked more cat-sized than kitten-sized. *Strange*, he thought. He wrapped the cloth tighter around his neck and kept walking. 
	

The sun was almost all the way down, and the wind was starting to pick up. The street lamps flickered making the cobblestone sidewalks look even more ancient. The city was old and dark, especially this time of year as winter approached, before the city was decorated in Christmas lights. Joseph wasn’t a big Christmas guy but he loved the lights, he loved any bit of brightness to contrast the darkness, especially in city the size of Madrego.
	

Speaking of size, Joseph wasn’t the tallest or brawniest guy in the world, but he knew how to handle himself. Despite growing up in the suburbs he wasn’t afraid in the big city, but he knew that it was good to be cautious wherever you are. There were always pickpockets and muggers to worry about. But Joseph wasn’t thinking about hoodlums, he was thinking about those glowing green eyes. He felt ridiculous: *It’s just a stupid cat, dude. You’re just worked up because the party was so annoying. Chill.* He looked back again, the cat was following him—was it really following him? And why was it bigger? *It’s not bigger, it’s closer, and you’re tipsy*, Joseph told himself. *Wait…it’s closer?* He walked faster, past the museums, the fountains, the out-of-place pieces of modern art positioned awkwardly in the middle of the street, he usually stopped to look, to comment, to watch other people look and comment, but today he barreled ahead without giving anything, or anyone, so much as a glance of acknowledgement.  


He was about 3 blocks away from home. Just one intersection to go before he could duck into the side streets. He sprinted across just as the red hand started flashing and a bland female voice started the familiar refrain of “Please wait!” A few people looked at him disapprovingly and he would have normally stopped and waited, but he wanted to put some distance between himself and that cat. A block later and two shades of night darker, Joseph turned onto his street. Looking behind him, he breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that there was nothing behind him. He laughed to himself as he reached into his pocket for his keys and turned towards his apartment, an old red-brick building with creaky floors, no air conditioning, and a cranky landlord, but it had character. It definitely had character. That’s why he chose it. He just didn’t feel right taking in this beautiful old city while living in a stiff modern —


**meow**


“What the —” Joseph jumped in surprise. The cat was across the street from his building, watching him. It was the size of a golden retriever. *What the heck is going on?* Joseph started to panic, he fumbled with his keys but fortunately someone was leaving the building. He almost knocked him over, pushing past him to get inside. The man called out to him in protest but Joseph didn’t look back, he just headed towards the elevator and punched the button for the 13th floor.
	

*Thirteen. Ha. Stupid Larry. It’s all those bad jokes that are getting to me. And that punch, what the heck did Stacy put in there? Ugh…* He started to unwrap his scarf, using it to wipe the sweat off of his forehead. His heart was racing, he was breathing heavily. What was his roommate going to think? *Get it together Joe. Come on!* 
	

The elevator doors opened and he turned right, towards his open apartment door. His roommate’s girlfriend was leaning halfway into the entryway, giggling and kicking up one of her heels flirtatiously. What was her name again? She was new, and Joseph hadn’t committed her name to memory yet. “Hey you, move it, I’m starving!” He tried to sound more playful than annoyed. It wasn’t her fault he was all worked up. She was pretty and sweet, like all of Michael’s girlfriends. Joseph didn’t understand how he could find them so easily, or why he didn’t hang on to them, but that was Mike. *He probably got girls so easily because he’s not some geeky tech loser afraid of a damn cat,* he thought, frustrated.

	
“Well, if slow-poke here can ever find his phone to call you, we’re bringing back something. HE’S RIGHT HERE,” she yelled into the apartment, still blocking the door. Joseph felt anxious, he just wanted to get inside and feel safe. He heard Michael approaching, “Hey dude! So you want burgers or–hey what happened to you?” 
	

*Crap, he noticed*, thought Joseph. As far as girlfriends went, Michael was quick to move on from one to the next, but friends he kept forever. He and Joseph had been friends since 3rd grade. Of course he would notice that something was wrong. “Nothing…I mean, I’ll tell you later. It’s nothing. You said you were getting pizza?”

	
“See I told you pizza would be better!” the girlfriend said, slapping Michael’s chest, leaning against him possessively. Michael put his arm around her, still focused on his friend, “Sure man, we can get that if you want. Just take it easy, ok? I know those work parties can really get under your skin. Such an annoying waste of time, right?” He looked Joseph in the eye knowingly. “Pepperoni on one and sausage on the other?” he asked. “Yeah, Mike that’s great,” responded Joseph, “Thanks. See ya’ll in a bit.”  
	

“Byeeeee” the girlfriend sing-songed as she sauntered down the hallway with Mike’s arm around her waist. Joseph stumbled into the apartment, slammed the door behind him and locked it, relieved to be alone. He went to his room, dropped the scarf and his coat onto the floor, kicked off his shoes and the rest of his clothes until he was naked. He marched into the bathroom and turned on the shower. He brushed his teeth in the sink, trying to get the taste of punch out of his mouth. He waited for the hot water to make its way through the old pipes, waited for steam to obscure his reflection as he looked at himself in the mirror. He laughed, *Man I must be tired, freaking out like that over a dumb animal.* 
	

The shower calmed him. He’d almost forgotten about his strange walk home when he heard something outside. “You guys are back already?” he called out. There was no answer, but he figured he was just hearing things. Old buildings make noises and neighbors are loud. Joseph wrapped a towel around his waist and headed to the living room. No one was there. He checked the peephole in the door to make sure Michael hadn’t left his keys. No, no one in the hallway. *It’s just the neighbors. I’m starving, they’d better be back soon,* thought Joseph. He unwrapped his makeshift sarong and started drying off his back, his shoulders, his hair. His vision was partly obscured by the towel rubbing his head when he walked into his bedroom. Bending over to dry his legs and feet he caught a glimpse of something moving in the window. Joesph froze. 
	

Two fluorescent green eyes were fixed on him. Two giant glowing green eyes were staring at him from a giant black face, blacker than the sky. It wasn’t fully dark yet, but Joe could clearly see how huge the cat’s head was. He watched in horror as the it batted the window with its paw—the sound he’d heard before— it pulled itself up onto the windowsill and purred, a low rumbling sound like thunder. It nudged the window with its massive head. Joseph couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, he didn’t know if he should yell and try to scare if off, throw something at the window or make a run for it. He heard the front door of his apartment opening up behind him, the cat licked the window, blinking at him. He could hear Michael calling out “Room service!”, the cat crouched down low, how was it even balancing on that tiny ledge? He could hear the girlfriend giggling, but he could not take his eyes off of the beast in the window. “Joe? You there?” he heard Michael call behind him, but he couldn’t answer. All he could do was scream in horror as he watched the creature burst through the window.

I have no friends... I mean genuine people who actually treat me with respect and as a priority... my older brother ditches me to hang out with his friends no matter how giving, kind, and respectful I try to be for the guy... My pop is the same... My ""aquantances"" who I buy a drink for to shoot the s$\*t with barely keep contact and even when we chill I can tell they really only interact with me for career questions.. im starting to feel a bit socially awkward around people.. I get social cues just don't have much in common  with people to build a real connection...So im not sure if this is normal..

&amp;#x200B;

Ive heard the saying your 20s is a quarter life crisis.. you re trying to figure yourself out... but idk Im trying to start new hobbies... im taking a salsa class.. I love music and Im trying to learn the proper steps, instead of relying on my ADHD wanna be rapper dances haha. I hit the gym 1-2x a week and starting to keep track of my reps/sets. And like I said I go to school and doing an internship so my time is stuck to that too.. So my life is busy.. but I feel my head just pounding with ""dude, what are you doing.. why are you awkward?? you should have experience with traveling the world..and know which bars and clubs are hot in your area.. Have a few girls in your rotation.. and buds to shoot the s\^%t with after.. you should know how to play fortnite… You should know every freaking quarter back's history and understand why tom brady is an asshole...

ahkm42,4,2019-01-19,Am I on the right track for a DS job?,TheRealJamesHoffa,DataScienceJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/ahkm42/am_i_on_the_right_track_for_a_ds_job/,"So I've been interested in becoming a Data Scientist for a while now and have been doing a good bit to work towards that. I was hoping that I could get some advice or direction on whether or not this is enough and what else I could do to land an actual DS job.




About me:

- I am a senior undergrad graduating with a BS in Information Systems this upcoming May. My school is ranked pretty high for CS, and my degree involved a good amount of CS course work (done a good bit of programming, data structures, etc) Plus I took a applied math and stats course last year.

- I will be taking a Data Science course offered by my school in my final semester this spring.

- I have taken both Intro and Intermediate Python for Data Science on DataCamp

- I am currently reading The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book

- After finishing the book, I plan to take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course that everyone seems to recommend.

- I consider myself to be competent with SQL, and I have created my own relational database for a project so I am experienced and have a pretty good understanding of databases.

- I just recently got a Data Analyst internship that I will be working at during the spring as well, but I haven't started yet.




That's about all I can think of that I'm involved in right now. I'm sure there is more that can be done, I'm just not sure what right now. I was hoping to get some advice from you guys. Ideally I would like to have a job lined up for when I graduate, but I don't know how realistic that goal is at this point. Is that even possible? Or should I change my target to a full time Data Analyst position that I can start at and eventually break into a DS role? Thanks everyone."

*Uw Semi-wekelijkse overzicht van wat er gebeurde op RMTK*

##Actualiteit:  
-	**/u/Nickmanbear gekozen tot Voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal:**  
Na een spannende verkiezing werd oud-(onder)voorzitter en D'18 partijleider /u/Nickmanbear gekozen tot Voorzitter, De kandidaten /u/kajtuu98 (D'18), /u/Der_Kohl (D'18) en /u/RkRs21 (SDC) verloren respectievelijk de 1e, 2e en 3e ronde, waardoor /u/Nickmanbear uiteindelijk als winnaar overbleef.  



-	**Premier /u/Graansmoothie tijdelijk vervangen door SP-leider, oppositie onthutst:**  
Waar is toch de Minister-President? als wij de rijksvoorlichting moeten geloven heeft hij griep, en daarom heeft het Kabinet besloten een waarnemend Premier aan te stellen.  
Echter, de keuze voor wie de rol van waarnemend Premier ging vervullen is niet in goede aard gevallen bij vele leden van de oppositie. Ondanks dat het kabinet beschikt over drie Vice-Premiers, is geen van de Vice-Premiers aangesteld als waarnemend Premier, nog een van de andere Ministers uit het Kabinet. In plaats daarvan werd gekozen om /u/7Hielke, Tweede Kamerlid en SP-leider aan te stellen als waarnemend Premier, ondanks dat hij geen ministeriële ervaringen heeft, de leider is van de 3e partij binnen de coalitie en oorspronkelijk van plan was om zijn Tweede Kamerzetel te behouden terwijl hij waarnemend Premier was, iets dat ingaat tegen de Grondwet (en waar hij na flinke druk op terug kwam). [De Volkskrant](https://www.reddit.com/r/RMTKMedia/comments/afjos3/hoofdredactioneel_commentaar_de_scheiding_der/) kwam als reactie met een uitzonderlijk hoofdredactioneel commentaar over de noodzaak tot scheiding der machten, en ook vanuit de Kamer kwamen vragen over de legaliteit van deze actie.  


-	**SP wijst tijdelijke vervanger aan voor /u/7Hielke in de Kamer:**  
Waarnemend Premier /u/7Hielke gaf onder druk tijdelijk zijn Tweede Kamerzetel op, hij zal in de Tweede Kamer worden vervangen door /u/House_of_Farts, SP-Kamerlid /u/LordAverap neemt de functie van fractievoorzitter over.  


-	**CDA-leider stapt per direct op:**  
CDA-leider /u/Paddo_In_Wonderland stapt per direct op als Partijleider en als Kamerlid. Hij zal worden opgevolgd door de prominente CDA-Senator /u/Keijeman, die ook zijn Kamerzetel en positie als Fractievoorzitter zal overnemen.  



##Activiteit Kabinet:  
-	**Kabinet in de greep van vervanging Minister-President:**  
Het feit dat /u/7Hielke als waarnemend Premier werd aangesteld verraste velen binnen de coalitie, anoniem gemompel van zowel MBE als SDC suggereert dat de coalitie intern nog steeds verdeeld is over het besluit.  
  

##Buitenlands nieuws:  
-	**Republikeinen verpulveren Democraten tijdens Amerikaanse Midterms:**  
r/ModelUSGov beleeft haar Midterms, waar de Democraten flink verliezen. In het Huis van Afgevaardigden gaan de Democraten van 24 zetels naar 12, en gaan in de Senaat van 4 naar 3 zetels. De Republikeinen gaan in het Huis van Afgevaardigden van 15 naar 21 zetels en in de Senaat van 2 naar 5, en krijgen daardoor beide Kamers in handen. De Bull-Moose Party (BMS), die een samenwerking aanging met de Republikeinen en belooft hebben om hun te steunen in het Congres, gingen in het Huis van Afgevaardigden van 4 naar 10 zetels en in de Senaat van 4 naar 2.  
Dit resultaat word gezien als een gevoelige klap voor de Democratische President /u/GuiltyAir, die in drie maanden herkozen hoopt te worden als President.

so i discovered about this internship program at Kyoto university and applied for it. i just had to mail the scientist. so i mailed them my cover letter and CV. i did that like a week ago, but till now i have no response! no acceptance nor rejection e mail!

i am very worried. i HAVE to get into that internship anyhow, it means the world to me at this point.

but i am getting no response from them. i sent them a reminder mail as well..

what is the reason? do Japanese people not send a rejection e mail? or will they take time for everyone to mail and then shortlist it later?

&amp;#x200B;

if you guys have any knowledge about it, please let me know..

ahmb0b,2,2019-01-19,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,Cpnthirst,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ahmb0b/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you.

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

  * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

This is not about humble-bragging, either.  


The MH 2-Step Summon Banners (Sieg's yesterday, Shion's today, probably Roxy's tomorrow) list the rate of getting the featured 5-star unit at 0.5%. I happened to land both units (neither of which I had previously), with astronomically low odds of doing so. Similarly, the comments on Sieg's banner in this sub seem to indicate that a lot of people got him on his banner. Did anyone else also pull a repeat and get Shion too?  


Are we the lucky beneficiaries of a Gumi intern error, or is this just a statistical anomaly? How many of you have gotten both units from both banners?"

Throwaway because reasons

TLDR - My sister does stuff that I wouldn't dare get away with when I was her age, gets paid wayyyy more attention by aunts/uncles when visiting extended family overseas, does not keep up with promises (and is not held to them by parents), and gets financial help from parents while the lack of me needing any help (through my diligence and hard work) is seen as me getting ""lucky"".  Is this petty or is it ok for me to feel like this?

Please bear with me.  Writing this out serves as a bit of a cathartic experience for me.  If I'm just being petty, please let me know.

1.	The drinking

	Some context:  My mom very much does NOT like drinking and alcohol.  From talking to her, this isn't from any alcoholism in our family, but she is just paranoid about developing any mild addiction whatsoever.  I understand her feelings on this, as I've avoided taking stuff like dilaudid when prescribed it for kidney stones because if I can avoid exposure to opioids, I'll go without them (despite the pain - not fun!).

	From when I was around 18, or even beforehand, my mother would be VERY SERIOUS about telling me to not drink or do drugs when going to visit friends while in college (I went to one of the best schools in the country for my major - happens to be many states away so she couldn't be there in person) or while visiting home and meeting up with friends.  My friends and I were, and still are, huge nerds.  We'd be getting together to geek out together and play DnD.  Drinking was the last thing on our mind.  By the time I was 20 and in college, I would occasionally go to a get-together with &lt;10 friends where there would be drinks, and I would have a few drinks.  I didn't dare tell her about this due to her aversion and attitude to me drinking anything at all.  When I finally did ask an older friend to get me something to drink, I asked for a bottle of vodka, because I could mix it with stuff and just a couple drinks with my friends without having to go to a party where I don't like half the people there.  At this point I was having maybe 4 standard drinks-worth of alcohol every MONTH (her attitude towards it made me scared to the point where I would manually measure any alcohol out and run the numbers in my head to have an EXACT tally of what I was drinking).  When she asked me I assured her that nothing was going on, but she would keep on pestering and I told her that I was drinking, but in a very controlled manner (very few drinks every month, and I'm a big guy).  She didn't believe me in that regard, thinking I was drinking far more than what I told her.  When she came to visit unexpectedly, I had to dump an entire bottle of vodka down the drain because I was deathly afraid of her finding it and legitimately thinking that it was all for me/I was drinking a lot.

	My sister, on the other hand, freely goes to work parties at the restaurant she works at, where my parents KNOW there's a lot of drinking going on.  She spends a bunch of weekends at her boyfriend's place, where they have pretty big parties.  She openly drinks up to half a bottle of her fancy sparkling wine in front of my mom and dad, and even gets them to buy some for her for special occasions.  She recently took a trip overseas to visit extended family, and was pretty much having drinks the whole time while down there with family, and taking lots of pictures of her holding drinks up with cousins on what felt like a daily basis to a big group chat we have for extended family.

	The standards feel verrry different in my opinion.  Devil's advocate:  She's going to school locally and I went many states away. I was far away she wouldn't have much control/view of me, so she wanted to be more mindful with me.

2.	The SO

	When I was her age, there was a very clear and present expectation with what was appropriate or not with my then-girlfriend spending the night at our place.  If she were to spend the night, it would be with her in my room and myself on the couch, or vice versa.  No exception.  I understand this, it's common decency.  With her current boyfriend, she spends most days of the week over at his place.  I wasn't born yesterday and neither were my parents - that is to say, everyone knows she's not sleeping on a couch.

	Again, the standards feel kinda different here.  Devil's advocate:  Neither my girlfriend nor I lived alone at the time, whereas her boyfriend rents out an apartment.  Could be just a ""Not in my house"" thing, where they didn't want me to be indecent while she lived at home.

3.	Familial ties and attention.

	We're an immigrant family, so in the US it's just my parents, my sister, and I.  All of our extended family is overseas.  We come from a culture where extended family is very tight normally - cousins are effectively siblings and aunts/uncles would see you almost daily.  Despite this, most of my father's side of the family (minus the grandparents and one or two siblings of his) are jealous of our family's success and have effectively disowned my father as their brother.  When I was young living in the old country, I would hang out and play with those cousins, as they were around my age (my sister and I were the first grandkids to my maternal grandparents (except for one born around her age), by a margin of something like 15 years or so).  Whenever I go and visit, I greatly love spending time with my grandparents, but my aunts and uncles are reluctant to try and find many excuses to see me.  I understand, there's not as close a connection there and I'm sort of ""in-between"" generations.  But I WANT to make those connections nonetheless.  I understand common advice would be to initiate the connections or activities, but I left this country when I was 5 years old and have little-to-no idea what there is to do/see there that would be fun for everyone involved.  By contrast, my sister visits and is just plain adored by all aunts/uncles/cousins, and has an abundance of things to do each and every day that she's down there visiting.

	Devil's advocate:  During high school and undergrad in college, I took practically every vacation to work on an internship or be in school.  I wanted to further my career prospects and look good for colleges and potential employers down the line.  As a result, in the past 10 years, I've only been able to visit once, whereas she's visited at least 5 times or more, I've lost track.

4.	The Pink Room

	Two and a half years ago, I started to take internships near my college instead of back at home.  As a result, I wasn't spending half the year at home any more, only a couple weeks of the year.  I had always had the larger room when we lived at that house while growing up, and she started saying how she'd really like to have my room since I was away most of the year.  This made complete sense!  I was going through a really rough breakup at the time so I figured, a change of routines and everything, especially at home where I spent a lot of time with my long-term gf at the time, would be a good thing, and for the most part it was.  I was happy to be out of the old room.  However, when I talked to my sister with my parents present, I asked for one thing - that she paint the room something other than pink.  She was SUPER happy with the deal at the time, thought it was fair, and said that she'd do it by next time I was down there, no problem.  It's been two and a half years since then, and I've reminded her every time I'm down there, but my room is still pink.  Not only that, but the room I gave her in exchange has gotten a fresh coat of paint for herself, while my room has gotten two splotches of paint to ""test the color"" and see how it would look.  Whenever I visit home and ask her, she just looks at me like I'm crazy and brushes me aside, getting angry at me for bringing it up.  I ask my parents and they say they ""give her crap"" for it, but I've never seen it happen, and at this point I can tell she's just waiting it out until I move out of the house so she doesn't have to worry about me asking for a non-pink room anymore.  In addition to this, my wardrobe in the new room is still half-full of her crap.  She moved to a larger room, and still keeps her stuff in my room because there's ""not enough room to put it in her room"" despite *moving to a larger room*.

	I've told my parents to just rent my room out so they can at least make money off of it, but they keep saying how they need to keep it for when I'm older and want to visit, so I can have my room there because I'll always be their baby, yadda yadda.  The thing is I don't feel like that's ""my room"".  It's just *A room* that I stay at a couple of weeks out of the year.

	Devil's advocate:  No idea here.  I feel this one is just unfair.

5.	The finances.  AKA: ""You got lucky.""

	We've never been a particularly high-income family.  As a result, when I was going through undergrad, FAFSA was always ""good"" to us, and expected family contributions were always fairly low.  Both my sister and I went to/go to different colleges that both have very generous need-based scholarships (You're only expected to pay the expected family contribution, and financial aid is actually scholarships, not just loans).  While going through my undergrad, I amassed a total of about 16K in loans, mostly to cover the expected family contribution (FAFSA said we had a family of xyz amount, but my mom was going through some health issues so our effective family income dropped a bit halfway through).  I'm doing my master's now and thankfully, I've worked my ass off to get a fellowship my first semester, and a TAship for my current/last semester.  I worked so dang hard for both of these positions beating out dozens of people in each scenario (It's VERY competitive to get either of these, think only 10% of people land the fellowship, and each TA position has about 40 students apply but only 1 gets it.), such that I won't be on the hook for about $60,000 in tuition+housing for my master's year, as there's no scholarships for grad students at my university.  I was super stressed out over this fact for months and when I finally landed the positions/fellowships through hard work, I was ecstatic.

	In a recent phonecall with my mom, I talked with her and mentioned some of the stuff about how I feel like I'm not being treated fairly compared to her.  She mentioned how ""it's not a competition"" and I agreed, but still told her I felt bad about it.  We moved on to other subjects. Later on in the call, she mentioned how, since my father's business had been gaining traction, the family contribution expected for my sister on her FAFSA had risen to a higher value, from effectively around $0 (I forget the exact amount, it was below 1k for sure that's how low it was) to somewhere around 7k for the upcoming year, and probably the same after.  I responded ""that's still not all that much, she can just get a loan for that, right?"" To which my mom replied ""Yeah, I've told her to save up a bit and do that.  You got lucky!""

	""It's not a competition.""

	""You. Got. Lucky.""

	This devastated me.  Even with the new higher contribution for her, I still will have more than her in loans.  My master's degree didn't come cheap either.  I didn't get a free pass for the 60k worth of tuition/housing for my masters, I'm over here busting my ass off to make them proud and set myself up for financial success down the line and she has the gall to tell me *I got lucky*.  In what world does this make sense???  This has downright ruined my mood for the past couple of days.  So much of what I do is to honor the huge sacrifices my parents made so my sister and I could have better lives.  I may not be working the hard manual labor my dad is, or be studying to be an honorable profession like my sister (she's studying to be a teacher and my family as a whole, including me, greatly value education above all else and respect teachers as a result), but I busted my ass all the way through engineering school and landed my dream job that I'm starting later this year.

	How did I get lucky?  I can't think of a devil's advocate for this one and I'm just ruined.  My thesis is nearing completion and in the acknowledgements section I have a huge thanks to my parents, in which I dedicate the work to them.  This is my biggest piece of work I've ever done, at over 100 pages, and I'm immensely proud of the months and years leading up to the research and writing going into it, that I wanted to dedicate it to them.  But with the ""you got lucky"" I feel terrible.  I can't even read the words I wrote without feeling like shit, like it'll fall on deaf ears.

	I know this all sounds terrible, but my parents love and support me no matter what, and these are the only issues I really have with our relationship.  They have nothing but love for me and I don't want it to come across as me being petty or not having a good relationship with them, but this is eating away at me and every time I try to bring up something small from this to my parents, they dismiss it and tell me not to worry.

TLDR (copied from beginning of post)- My sister does stuff that I wouldn't dare get away with when I was her age, gets paid wayyyy more attention by aunts/uncles when visiting extended family overseas, does not keep up with promises (and is not held to them by parents), and gets financial help from parents while the lack of me needing any help (through my diligence and hard work) is seen as me getting ""lucky"".  Is this petty or is it ok for me to feel like this?"

TLDR - My sister does stuff that I wouldn't dare get away with when I was her age, gets paid wayyyy more attention by aunts/uncles when visiting extended family overseas, does not keep up with promises (and is not held to them by parents), and gets financial help from parents while the lack of me needing any help (through my diligence and hard work) is seen as me getting ""lucky"".  Is this petty or is it ok for me to feel like this?

Please bear with me.  Writing this out serves as a bit of a cathartic experience for me.  If I'm just being petty, please let me know.

1.	The drinking

	Some context:  My mom very much does NOT like drinking and alcohol.  From talking to her, this isn't from any alcoholism in our family, but she is just paranoid about developing any mild addiction whatsoever.

ahnxg1,6,2019-01-19,Looking for kind of relationship advice,successufd,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/ahnxg1/looking_for_kind_of_relationship_advice/,"Hi! I found about MBTI a year back and got INTJ as a result. I used to think something was terribly wrong with me for being the way I am and often tried to be more extroverted or feeling than my natural self allowed. It was frustrating but after finding out that I'm an INTJ, I felt at home. 

I gave the tests a few more times and sometimes came up with INTP or INFJ. Mostly the former. Still, I identify most with INTJ.

I'm a 25 year old female and I completed medical school two years back. Six months after getting my degree, I started my internship. Around the same time, my parents discussed a potential marriage prospect who's my mom's cousin's son, 5 years older and a doctor, too. This man worked in the same department that I worked at but he was my senior and our duties were separate so we didn't get to talk much. Among our few conversations, he never brought up the marriage proposal or tried talking to me. I did ask him to not let anyone know that we are related because I didn't want drama at my workplace. I have reasons to believe that he told some of his colleagues and when asked, denied this completely. 

Near the end of my rotation in that department, my parents asked me to give them my decision and since I didn't know him much, I couldn't. I asked him to meet me outside work so that we can talk about the marriage proposal. On the day we met, he claimed that I was perfect for him and he madly liked me. His exact words. I asked him to give me time to decide, that we needed to talk more before I take a decision. He wanted to know how much time. Like in exact number of days. We agreed that we will talk. 

Two days later, I was on call and after midnight, he texted me various reasons to say no to the proposal. I asked him to refuse himself but he said his parents won't agree to him and that I have to be the one to refuse. I tried to understand what he was trying to do, even asked him but he kept giving me various different reasons, mostly not linked together, to refuse. I deduced that he was either lying or manipulating me or trying to test me. 

His parents invited my parents to finalize this whole thing and when my parents asked me, I told them to refuse. Not because he asked me to but because I can't imagine living with someone who would do one of those 3  things for the rest of my life. And the fact that he did it on day 3 of us talking seriously didn't sit well with me. My parents couldn't understand my decision, saying that these kind of things are not what you consider when deciding your SO. Still, they didn't push me and refused the proposal at which point his dad called him on phone and scolded him a lot.

He later texted me, thanked me in an angry manner, saying that it was all a test and that if I can't last a few days, how would I have managed a life with him. I blocked him after that. For me, it all ended.

From that point onwards, everyone kept telling me that what I did was wrong. That these kind of things are normal and I shouldn't react so magnanimously to little matters like those. My parents were also among those people. Strangely, my little sister and brother, who are both under 18, took my side.

These lectures continued for a year and a half until the end of 2018. Whenever someone told me to give him another chance, I asked them if they would allow me to refuse again. That I would only talk if I had the choice to say no again. And strangely, everyone who would advocate him would shut up at that point. Since he and I belong to the same family and have the same roots, if I refuse again, it will break the base of our families. I don't want to risk that for someone like him. Also, agreeing to talk again would be interpreted as agreeing to marry him. So it was important that I keep those points in front. That nobody finds out that I've resumed talking to him and that talking to him does not equal agreeing to marry him. 

Last week of 2018, one of my mum's cousins called me and asked me to give him another chance. She was also talking to him and said he wanted to apologize for what he did and that I shouldn't take such huge decisions so rashly. When I gave her my same old two conditions, she agreed. He agreed, too. 

I've talked to him twice in the first week and then, the next week, I had to visit another city and live with another person from my extended family, compromising my introversion and my privacy. During those two talks, he claimed he would do anything for me, that I'd never cry because of him, that he'd buy me whatever I want and other things like this, that he knows me completely. He also sent me his degrees and certificates, his pictures from conferences, him getting awards, his ugly pictures, and then, the latest, test reports of one of my aunts. When I confronted him about compromising confidentiality of a patient, he said that her family has right to access her health records. When I told him that it's against medical ethics, he asked me to show him where it's written. He also tests me on random medical stuff and found it surprising that I have hobbies other than studying. His text messages for the first few days involved a lot of hearts which he stopped when I asked him to.

The lady who got us talking again has been asking me for my decision since day 1. She says that his parents are in a hurry and they want my decision fast, and because of this, I'm suspecting that his parents know but they keep claiming that his parents don't know whenever I confront them about it. I also feel like he lies to me to keep me happy and pacified. I feel like he's saying whatever to ensure that I say yes. He claims he is being honest, but I don't find it believable.

Because of these ""take your decision quick"" messages, I asked him to take the MBTI and his results were: ENFJ-T (E=72%, N=51%, F=60%, J=58%, T=54%). He comes off as introverted, doesn't get along with a lot of people, people find him too intimidating, my colleagues at work were scared of him and his work reviews advice him to be less aggressive with people even though he claims that he keeps his emotions in control. I feel like he lied on the MBTI, too, because the ENFJ description does not match what I know about him.

Considering that I have a total data of 5 conversations, 3 of which are 1.5 years old, I can't take a decision I'd be satisfied with. I'm looking for your insight. On paper, he sounds like the perfect partner for me: apparently introverted, quiet, minds his own business, doesn't get along with most people in our extended family (a perception that people have of me, too), a doctor like me, same field of specialization that I'm interested in, very smart (apparent by his grades), would be quite rich in a year or two, etc. These are not good enough reasons for me to say yes. When I talk to him, I find him strange. His MBTI has confused me even more. All his data is contradictory. Men who recommend him to me say things like... I can't stand that man but he's perfect for you. Women emphasize on how much he likes me and is sincere with me. My parents just like that he is from family, so they know him and his values. And among all unmarried men from family, he is the most accomplished one.

I can probably have a few more conversations with him before I'm forced to decide. What kind of data do I need to make a proper decision on this? Everyone who has adviced me about marriage here says that it's very unpredictable. That I can know nothing for sure. That the more time I take, the more evils I'll find. That even if I marry someone else, I won't know anything about him. They ask me if I can guarantee that someone else I choose would be better than him. That if I would even get another marriage proposal. I just want to take an informed decision. I don't want to say yes or no without knowing why I said that. I need to have a strong reason behind my decision. I'm asking for your wisdom. What should I concentrate on during our next few conversations? How do I find out if he is someone I can respect for my whole life? Divorce is unacceptable here. I'll have to live with my decision forever. I can stick to my decision for life if I know I took it for good reasons. My previous reasons for saying no were valid but I promised I'll start with a clean slate this time around so I can't use those previous reasons. Similarly, the reasons others find good are not good enough for me to say yes. How should I proceed?

Edit:
Cultural and religious context: I'm a Muslim Pakistani. Arranged marriages within family are common and promoted. Marriages are based on the man's resume and the woman's housekeeping abilities. Women aren't expected to work. Men aren't expected to take care of children. Marriage is necessary. If someone is unmarried after a certain age (different for each gender), it's believed that something is inherently wrong with them. 

My opinion about my culture: I don't agree with my culture and some of the things people press upon as part of religion are actually culture-based but if I don't follow them, I'm at risk of being called a non-follower of my religion and shunned from my society. I like my religion, but some things are deliberately left vague and people around me can be extremists in thoughts if not in actions or words regarding these unclear things.

In my life, I haven't shown much care about the culture and done stuff that all these people find brilliant and odd simultaneously. They admire that I've done all this stuff but would never consider to do something similar themselves or allow their daughters to do it. Since I don't fit the mold, no one knows what to expect of me which makes me dangerous and unpredictable for them.

I just want to make sure that I'm not unfair to him or myself. If I take more time to decide, he will get very attached and I don't want to hurt anyone that way. It will also become very difficult to refuse then. I also don't want to refuse right away before being sure that he can't be my SO. "
aho3h8,5,2019-01-19,A year has passed since my last post; the situation has changed somewhat,MeltedChocolates2,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/aho3h8/a_year_has_passed_since_my_last_post_the/,"I only tend to post here when things get really bad or too hard to handle by myself so sorry for the long time in between. I forgot the email I used to sign up for my first throwaway account (MeltedChocolates without the 2) so I made a new account (this one) on reddit. If you want details on my background see my last post in that account.

While the summer I was referring to in my previous post had its own share of weekly homework, nDad has become less physical in threats but more verbal/emotional since I graduated high school unfortunately. This past summer I was constantly on edge waiting for the other shoe to drop, as it did with all extended vacation/break times after the initial first week dies down, but thankfully it wasn't until late last August that he started in with the usual ""start studying your subjects all day now one week before they start or you will regret it etc."" speech.

Last fall semester has been just average for me, but physics really brought it down (almost failed), this semester I will be re-doing it with a different instructor for a better shot at it. I was fine with the daily homework sessions during this winter break because I was used to it by now as long as I could get some hobby time (social media, videogames, reading, computer stuff) at night. However, coincidental comments turned this time into the ticking clock of doom and everything took a nosedive. :(

Long story short, some church people (who apparently don't have anything else to do than gossip?) were asking ""Whyyyy hasn't Melted graduated yet????"" when I was at church last Sunday (I'm an atheist, obviously, but nDad ""volunteers"" there so I in turn am ""voluntold"" to help set up). Now I have been enrolled in college for 5 years as of this year, and getting classes is heavily impacted. I've been filling the reqs as reliably as I can, even if they aren't the best grades, forgoing classes not pertaining to my major even though they look interesting. It doesn't help that the folowing week the clerk at my doctor's office chimes in too with ""When are you gonna graduate Melted?!?!?"" (passive-agressive tone too) before asking me if I had chosen my internship company (I had not yet, I haven't taken the classes pertaining to their main company openings). This struck a nerve with me because later it was used as direct leverage against me for spending too much time on hobbies. (""Tons of people have asked why you aren't graduating! and your high school friends are already in jobs and have fancy offices!!"" - I had not contacted these friends since high school ended so I wouldn't know if they are still in college or not)
Today after a meeting nDad goes and digs up all the previous confrontation above and throws it at me in another ragey, pointy-finger (hey its literally better than getting beaten?) why-is-my-kid-unmotivated study-no-backtalk-no-hobbies rant. I endured most of these after most report cards, but this time he loudly said that ""I only love you if you have good grades and don't love you if you do this childish trash"" (aka my hobbies) I thought love was supposed to be unconditional but whatever, apparently not with this guy.
Walking back home he mocked my hobbies to my face and kept moving the goalposts (""Grades don't matter you need to graduate"" to ""You must get high C's"" - which turned to high B's at the front door) Tried to greyrock but that only escalated it (god forbid anyone not make eye contact or try to avoid him when he is trying to physically/verbally get into your face) to ""if you are even slightly cranky about it (studying, no hobby time) you're out of school and working at mcdonalds!!!"" which has become his go-to insult lately when I express anything not positive. Also said when I finally agreed to his study plan just to get him to stop, ""you are so much nicer to be around"" than before - only 24/7 studious automatons are acceptable now I guess.

TL;DR - situation changed, random people's comments caused a 180, need advice. :( I know I'm not supposed to say ""Sorry my experience isn't as bad as others"" but I just
read other posts on here and they are really really horrific, way more so than mine.
One day has passed since the altercation and nDad is still adamantly ""hobbies = bad"". Also I'm posting this during the aforementioned studytime, I need some validation if I'm overreacting or not."
ahoggc,3,2019-01-19,Advice Needed From Child of a Kind of Divorce,lovelyzinnia44,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/ahoggc/advice_needed_from_child_of_a_kind_of_divorce/,"Hi, I'm a 21 year old girl who's living with her parents while doing my internship for my medical major. I graduate this May. The other day, my mom told me that my dad and herself were fighting. Like always, I listened to her rant and reminded her that she love him. Normally, she agrees, my parents talk, and the fight ends. However, my mom told me that she had felt the last straw had happenened, she was done with him, and didn't love him anymore. She doesn't want to be with him anymore. 

I mentioned the idea of divorcing, but she said it was complicated. For background information, my mom got her associate's degree as an ECE, a job that doesn't pay too well. Then, she met my dad and they got married. My mom worked and made minimum wage working her ECE degree job, Later, due to the economy, my dad, who's the primary breadwinner, moved us to (new state) due to a job opportunity. It involved my mom leaving behind her job and moving closer to toxic in-laws, and to a clique-ish small town who didn't welcome outsiders like herself. She couldn't find a job. 

Regarding the in-law situation, for years my dad has been understanding of how they treat her, and simply thought any time she felt discouraged or upset about this town and its limited opportunities, that she 'simply hates 'new state' and will get over it'. She normally does, but that's because she loves him.

Now, back to the present. Now, they are sleeping in separate rooms, she has told she has no desire to have sex with him, and has told him not to speak with her. She doesn't care him or his diabetes health anymore. He apparently told her that the sexual harrassment she felt at one job she found, and was mistreated greatly, was 'taken out of proportion'. He's always saying she should get a 'nice, office job' and told her to not do minimum job with nice people, which has tried to hire her twice. Recently, her car broke down, and he won't even let her change out the steering wheel cover on 'his' car. Money is tight, so we can't just get a new or used car right now. His mom bought our home we currently live in, so he claims he felt guilty when his mom offered him money to fix her car. He rejected the money, that made my mom upset today, because leaving this town has helped her mental health to be away from cliques and toxic in-laws. To top it all off, my dad works from home right now for a month, so they're always avoiding each other. 

I told her I could build connections in the future when I start working and get her a job with my connections. I mentioned that my fiance and I could help her if need be. It'd be an asset since she wants to be able to help out and see any future grandkids when she's not working in the future. I told her she mattered and she would make the right decision. She's worried about divorce, due to cost upfront and her having no job, and wants to separate in the same home without talking much to dad. 

This has put me in the weird spot of then talking to my dad, who isn't sure why she's 'like this in a mood' and I played dumb about knowing anything. I said he should talk to her about it. He said she won't talk Nd knows she'll be fine soon. 

What should I do for the next five months before graduating? Should I continue to refuse to be mediator, and only be a listener? Is there anything I should be telling my mom right now that I'm not? Do you have any advice I should tell my mom?

It's complicated because I love both of them, but this feeling of knowing about their sudden separation status, and being unable to talk about it to anyone, is hard. My heart feels funny knowing my parents don't love each other. My fiance has a gossipy mom who might innocently hear the news from him. 

I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this. I feel upset, weird, and worried for my parents, and my mom's loss of love for my dad of 25 years of marriage.

ahoox4,1,2019-01-19,[M4M] Zootopia/ Life is a Simulation RP. [Kik: nailorsam],ramosvik,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/ahoox4/m4m_zootopia_life_is_a_simulation_rp_kik_nailorsam/,"Hello there! How's it going, I'm Sam. Have a few new prompts I've been wanting to try out and am looking for creative minds to play them out! I'm 23 and live in the west coast so I'm using Pacific standard time! 

Before anything, I like RPs with lots of romance and drama, plot really makes the smut all the more worth it. Overall I would like maybe a 60/40 split on story and smut. 

I tried to keep the prompts simple but here they are:

1. Life is a Simulation: You are an intern for a huge tech company and you are working late hours at night by yourself when you get curious about a machine. This simulation machine can put you in worlds unimaginable, and you can meet all sorts of cartoon characters. (For this one I'm only looking to play cartoon characters, anything Marvel or DC, Super Smash Bros, Disney, Pokemon etc.) 

2.  Zootopia Role-play: This one is pretty straight forward. You're a prey that falls in love with a predator, but the predator just wants to get a taste of you so he feigns romantic interest. Eventually he does fall in love though, how that happens will be up to us. I also have some furry refs for us, but will gladly look at some of yours. 

When it comes to kinks, I like rough anal, nipple play, body/muscle worship, deepthroating, cum swallowing, and some non con. I usually play TOP but I wouldn't mind playing bottom as well. I'm pretty dominant as well. 
Won't do anything too extreme like scat, blood etc 

My kik is nailorsam if you want to roleplay with me! Hope to hear from you! If you've read this far include the word 'fishing rod' in your message!

( I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ )"
ahp91r,1,2019-01-19,Seeking Advice (Want to switch out of actuary),soulf123,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/ahp91r/seeking_advice_want_to_switch_out_of_actuary/,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a student in an actuarial program with 3 semesters done and currently on my second internship. I have come to realize that I do not want to pursue the actuarial path since the work I see being done in both of my internships so far has not made me excited. I don't feel good about going to work everyday and even thinking I have 4 months of this makes me feel really down. I am kind of lost and would appreciate any advice from any of you even though I am guessing this isn't the best place to ask considering this sub is probably more about thriving in the field.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 4/4.3 GPA so I could try a few things but I am not sure what to switch into. Here is what I am considering:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Data Science (Switch to Statistics program and get transferred a lot of credits): 

Honestly, I have only heard buzz words about this and it made me think I would love it but maybe some of you could shed some light on how difficult it would be to enter the job market for it considering there are no defined requirements. I am also wondering how much the work differs from actuarial work. We have a team working with ML at my internship and their work seems a lot more interesting since it is a bit more distant from the finance aspects I don't like. They work with graphs and R and applying mathematical ideas more closely to what I enjoyed and saw in my math classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I am willing to do a Masters but again, I don't know if that boosts my chances of getting a job in Canada with just 2 internships done. (I wouldn't do another internship probably because I can't afford to waste more time)

&amp;#x200B;

\-Computer Science:

I feel this would allow more opportunities in case entering Data Science entry is not possible. This would ultimately take me more time since a lot (almost all) of my courses were math/stat. I am just not sure if this is the best degree considering people have me confused when they say it's better to self teach or go into software engineering (extra year) instead or its a saturated market and you won't find a job. This worries me because my 2 internships are in actuarial positions and I wouldn't be doing another internship probably since I really need to rush through uni at this point and get any kind of income. Would I be held back or out of my league considering the competition in such a degree?

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very long post and I apologize for it. I just started writing and I am trying to make a better decision before going down another path only to find out it is not what I want from life.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to all who read and for any words of advice,

&amp;#x200B;

ahp9v6,0,2019-01-19,My local PD infringed on my 2nd Amendment Rights. I thought you officers took an oath to that document. What a farce...,Birds-Cant-Fly,ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/ahp9v6/my_local_pd_infringed_on_my_2nd_amendment_rights/,"I was legally open carrying my Beretta M9, and I was called in and detained by the local PD. They asked for identification, and I refused, they tried pulling threats on me, I kept refusing. 

It got to the point where the female officer accompanying the male officer demanded I let them put me in handcuffs for “their safety”. I allowed this, but exercised my 4th amendment rights. 

The officer took my gun off of my holster, unloaded the magazine, and stuck the rounds back in my pocket. They kept asking afterwards “what’s your problem, buddy?” Things like that. To which I’d reply asking what they have against the 2nd amendment. 

They kept asking why I was “misbehaving”, and I told the officers that I was trying to get back to my car. They offered me a ride, I told them to kick rocks. That pretty much ended that right then and there. 

The officers then state that they’re going to let me go, and the female officer rudely tells me to “work on your attitude” because she has a “daughter who behaves better”, To which I said “Okay, mom!” In a mocking tone. 

The female officer instructs me not to load my gun until they’re back in their car and out of sight, again for “their safety”. I decided I was going to defy their request, and went ahead and loaded the magazine anyways. 

Just as quick as I tried loading the second bullet, the officers bailed back out of their car, and threw me in cuffs again. The officers take my firearm, and start patting me down again. 

Out of the confusion, I kept demanding what they were doing, until finally the quiet male officer stated that they’re going to take my firearm down to the station, where I can pick it up in an hour. 

I tried protesting, but before I can speak the female officer comes unglued on me. She tells not to say another word, or I’ll face charges, I about said something and she interrupts me. I shrugged out of instinct, and she claims that I failed comply, identify, and resisting. 

I then got my opportunity, and said “what crime am I being accused of?” Of course, I was ignored, and the male officer took the cuffs off of me once my “firearm was secure”. They reminded me to pick up my firearm later, and so I went to the station, and there was a different officer behind the desk. 

I buzz in at the desk to get his attention. He looks at me, and says “so you’re the one who pissed off officer Oswald!?” I ignored his mockery, and asked for my gun back, the officer tells me to wait. He punches in the code to open the electronic lock. I could hear him talking in the evidence room, but couldn’t make out what he was saying. I knew it was him ridiculing me, because a female intern poked her head around the corner for a second, before putting her hand to her mouth in an attempt to make her laughter not so obvious. 

The officer finally comes back with my gun, he slides it under the glass protector that surrounds the front desk, and hands me back the magazine and bullets. SOMEONE VACUUM SEALED THEM! 

I asked why they made it an even bigger pain to get my firearm loaded, and the guy just gives me a sly ass smile and says “a steak knife ought to cut that open! Good Luck!!” 

Nothing else happened outside of that. I feel like my rights were violated in this case. I know I came off as no better than the officers, but I ask for an open mind is all. Since when do I have to be treated like a criminal, and prove innocence? 

Since when do public servants think it’s ok to make their constituents laughing stocks? "

&amp;#x200B;

 Back in September I started Simple and Sinister with a one handed swing weigh of 25lbs and TGU of 15lbs. After dialing in my form, creating a progression, and figuring out how many days my body could handle I've progressed to one handed swing 50lbs and TGU 35lbs which is the weight requirements for female Simple but alas, I could not meet the time mark. My internship starts next week so I'm switching to a different workout routine but here's what Simple and Sinister got me.

&amp;#x200B;

Results

* 1 mile in 10:01 after 3 months of only S&amp;S, my average mile time back when I was running. Running still stucks
* Added 10 to 20lbs added to my squat and went from 5x45lbs to 5x75lbs on deadlift. I measured these on the same day as the run so not the best representative of my max.
* Solid Core Stability - 2 min plank, 1 min side plank L&amp;R, 3 minutes on Sorenoen's test (lower trunk muscles)
* Single leg balance has drastically increased 
* I can swing a 50lb kettlebell. That's pretty cool

Lessons Learned 

* When tweaking swing form focus on one problem at a time. For an entire week of focused on one cue ""butt back,"" the next week I zeroed in on swing timing.
* It takes the body about two weeks to get use to an increased bell weight
* Corn husker's lotion solves a lot of callus problems
* You've got to keep rest times short if you want the full cardiorespiratory benefits
* TGUs will make you realize how heavy a 5lbs increase is
* Respect the slow and steady approach
* Nothing swings like a kettlebell. If you are serious about this program once you reach the higher weights you have to start buying bells. Ones over 50lbs are extra rare at  normal gyms and nothing else feels right.

ahqfbz,1,2019-01-19,I recently started a new relationship with an awesome person and my anxiety is back. I’m afraid of ruining it.,throwawayrhe11,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ahqfbz/i_recently_started_a_new_relationship_with_an/,"Hallo everyone.

First of all thank you for this forum, even if this gets zero replies, it helps a LOT to formulate my problems into text. I’d appreciate any advice though, if you have any.



Ok so here’s my current situation: I, 22 y/o male went through a shitty time last year. Alcohol, depression, suicidal thoughts. I managed to break out of it by working on my career and 2018 was great. I found a paid internship at my dream company, realized I’m good at what I’m doing and landed an unlimited full time employment as a junior there, right after I finish my bachelors degree next month.

I feel awesome, having beaten my fears and anxiety and turned the negative energy into positive energy. Internship ends and i go back to university. I help out at a student film shoot and basically meet the woman (23y/o) of my dreams there. 

My last relationship was three years ago and ended ugly for me. It scarred me and I arranged myself with the idea that I will write off dating until I settled in with the job in one or two years time. Well that changed. I’m on cloud nine since November and she is everything I never knew I wanted. Truly an amazing and beautiful person, on the inside and outside. Kind, respectful, humble, communicative, she basically lifts everyone’s mood when she is around. For some unknown reason, she fell in love with me. 


**tl;dr: was depressed, got out, met an amazing girl a year later.**


Now here is where my problems start. She lost her apartment and moved back in with her parents, two hours away. During the week, where we both go to university, she stays at my place. It’s amazing and we both love every second of it. On the weekends, she drives back home and stays with her parents.

When that happens, I turn into a nervous ball of anxiety. It feels like i downed 10 cups of coffee constantly. When I was on Ski holidays with my family during Christmas I was away for 14 days. It was terrible, I started to sleep at 9pm just cause I couldn’t handle being awake anymore. I don’t recognise myself anymore, I was so sure I closed this chapter of my life.

Now here is what happens in my stupid brain. She never had a serious boyfriend before, only 4 sexual relationships that never lasted more than 1-4 weeks. She is kind of conservative and would never even hug someone she doesn’t really like, so she would never do anything stupid, and I don’t even think she will. But as soon as she leaves, the anxiety starts.

What if she gets mugged? What if she realises I’m not good enough? What if someone tries to convince her that I’m not the right one? What if she has doubts, secretly? What is she doing right now?

On top of that, I keep thinking about her ex ... friends? She tells me she never had better sex than with me and she can’t keep her hands of me. She even told me she faked her orgasms with the first two etc etc, but everytime I think of her, I see her with one of those 4 dudes.


**tl;dr: as soon as she leaves, I get nervous. I start thinking about her ex lovers, and constantly stress about what she is doing and if she is safe. I also start doubting myself and if I am good enough**


So there’s my wall of text. I absolutely understand if you guys don’t give a damn about my somewhat childish problems, but I just want this to stop. I’m so tired of feeling like this. I wasted my whole 2017 being a depressed and lonely idiot, and now I found the best person I have ever met and I am starting to ruin it. I never mentioned how bad it is in front of her, because she is so nice that she would start worrying. I mentioned her ex lovers once, just in a normal conversation and we had a mature talk about it, as well as my ex girlfriend from 3 years ago.

If this continues, I don’t know what will happen to my emotional state. I’ve looked into the dark hole of depression once, and I never want to go back. I have tried meditation, working out, vitamin D3+K2 pills, more sleep and everything helps, but only for an hour or two. After that, the nagging feeling in my chest comes back and my heart starts beating. 

If you have any suggestions, I would be very glad. Thank you for your time."
ahqkqu,1,2019-01-19,My crippling health anxiety struggle resulting from fear of rabies exposure,TumultForDays,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/ahqkqu/my_crippling_health_anxiety_struggle_resulting/,"Hey there, r/HealthAnxiety!

I have a peculiar and exhausting case of health anxiety, and I'm hoping I can find both support and advice here on the sub. This post will be much longer than most others here, as there's a lot to cover since this has spanned almost two months now, but please stick with me. I feel incredibly alone on this issue which my mind and body react to as life-threatening. At the very least, skim through it and read the conclusion. Without further ado, allow me to begin.

**Background**

I'm no stranger to anxiety. Dealing with tough classes or personal issues have often thrown my life into disarray, but I had always been able to get through these instances. No situation up to this point, however, has inspired such a constant and mortifying fear within me. 

Just over eight weeks ago on Nov. 22, four stray cats appeared on my porch looking for some food. I've always had a thing for cats, so in my foolishness I decided to go outside and play with them for nearly an hour with little clothes on and while barefoot. I did this off and on over the next three days, though I believe on at least one of the days I began to wear sandals. The cats behaved normally, brushing up against my legs, meowing at me, and nipping my fingers and toes. This continued until the last evening where one of them scratched me on the finger as I was playing with her. At the time, I didn't think much of this, and just retired for the night after some more petting.

The next day, I committed the cardinal sin of health anxiety and decided to take to the Internet and see what sort of risks for disease you could get through contact with these animals. The usual suspects didn't really bother me, though some further research caused me to become consumed with fear that has continued to this day: rabies. 

I've learned so much about this disease through official sources and the occasional medical journal that I could probably specialize in it. For those of you who aren't aware, it's a stealthy, sinister, and debilitating virus that almost always results in death. It hibernates undetected for so long within you, and there don't seem to be any pre-symptom tests for it. As someone who always struggled with a fear of mortality, I was in complete fear.

**The Good News**

Let me start off by mentioning most or all of the things going in my favor, some of which is informational and others relative to my case.

* Animal bites are the predominant method of transmission, and save for the occasional nibbling of my fingers and toes, I have not been bitten by ANY animal.
* I do not recall but cannot say with absolute certainty any blood being drawn during my encounter with the cats. The scratch mentioned did cleave the skin a noticeable bit, though.
* I could not get a statistic on a case of human rabies in my county, which leads me to believe if it ever did happen, it was decades ago. The last reported animal case was a single bat a few years ago.
* Most reported cases of rabies in humans involve dog or bat bites, and many of them occur out of country. There are also approximately 0-3 cases per year, though let's not diminish the fact these people still lost their lives.
* My state offers preliminary reports of cases of rabid animals, and as of the week of Dec. 14, no animals of any species were reported rabid within 150-ish miles of my county. 
* Behaviorally, cats in the wild often avoid contact with other animals, meaning chances at them ever having been bitten or scratched by a rabid animal were rare.
* Perhaps most importantly, the cats have are actually okay! They disappeared for a bit after I stopped feeding them, but I was able to see each four at points three weeks and six weeks after my initial encounter. They still come by periodically and mess around on the porch for a bit, which makes me uncomfortable.
* I have not had any direct contact, meaning me touching or being touched, since Nov. 28. Three days before this only involved contact with them against my pant legs or shoes. 

With all of that being said, you'd think I would be calmed down entirely and convinced that I'm safe, right? Well, if only it were that easy.

**The Bad News**

I'm still mentally affected, perhaps even worse than I was in the first few weeks. I still feel threatened by other opportunities where infection might have been possible and in addition, I am in constant fear of another exposure from just being in my house. I mostly worry that:

* During the original encounter: there could have been infectious material on the porch where I was walking barefoot. I may have had wounds on my feet I didn't notice, and I definitely had (and still have) calluses which can apparently introduce pathogens into the body.
* During the original encounter: there could have been infectious material on the cats themselves (fur, claws, or even teeth) that wasn't theirs but came from some other animal that was transmitted.
* In general, I fear contact from outside, especially on the porch, might have found viral particles on clothes that were then brought in the house and potentially making contact with skin.
* Because of my compulsive hand washing over the weeks, my hands have become dry and cracked, sometimes bleeding from small cuts. This provides further areas of exposure. I've also had other wounds on my hand, ankle, and shoulder, half of which had bled at some point.
* My health wasn't great before and hasn't been after the fact given how little I've eaten, slept, drank, and exercised, causing concern that my immune system might have been suppressed.

I'm sure you can tell the vigorous mental gymnastics I am performing in some or all of these after-cases, but I cannot help it. None of these I can conclusively disprove as a possibility, and thus I am worried that I might be that one exception to the rarity of it all.

**What I'm Like**

My day to day is not great, as I spent my entire waking hours at various levels of anxiety from moderate to debilitating. I used to have the freedom of evenings in that my worries weren't as bad, but those seem to have diminished as time goes on and panic sets in. I hate touching anything in my house, touching my face, or even breathing in the air, all tying back to the same fear.

Any time I cut myself or get a wound in some way, I panic as I struggle to ""clean"" it all enough. I constantly apply things like alcohol and peroxide and try to wash it when I can. I've recently nicked my right hand on a sink pipe and scratched a pimple to make it bleed, so now I'm afraid of two contaminated points on my body. Every time they have a sensation or look red, I think to myself, ""whelp that's probably it"". 

Compulsive hand washing has grown to be a serious issue for me as far back as a week after the initial encounter. Two weeks after, my hands were in such bad shape that they began cracking and bleeding, and of course having another site of exposure is another flare for my anxiety. I am constantly torn between protecting by hands by not overly drying them and potentially leaving infectious material on my hands. Feels like I'm screwed either way. Possibly in conjunction with my 

In terms of my health, I have had issues with the following:
* Eating and drinking: I constantly worry that something might make its way onto my dishes, food, or water, which gives me a very considerable fear of contamination. The water thing has really gotten bad over the last weeks as I fine myself dehydrated at times, even though I used to be big on fluids.
* Sleep: I've always had issues with insomnia and sleeping, but since this health anxiety began things have taken a turn for the worse. I generally get anywhere from 4-6 hours a night. 
* Motivation: I've lost a lot of motivation to do things, such as study or exercise, the former of which is good for me and the latter good for my health. 

**What I've Done**

I feel like I've greatly mishandled this all from the start, often being too late to act on anything considering how sharply my motivation has declined. I have:

* I have seen a couple doctors on this in hopes of getting the post-exposure vaccine, though none of them seem to take my case seriously and are often abrasive. I have issue talking with medical professionals and I feel as if I never argued my case well enough for them to just dismiss me.
* Written daily reports of varying quality starting a few days after the initial exposure, mostly depicting any encounters, exposures, or thoughts I might have had. I wish I had started it earlier, closer to the initial exposure as much of what I've filled in there is vague or conjecture. 
* Taken supplements recommended for anxiety and stress management, such as L-theanine and Ashwagandha. Can't say for sure if either really showed results, as I've stopped taken them since. 
* Started receiving professional help with a general psychologist. Took several calls to over 12 people just to get this one person to say they were available. I'm not sure if they're a good fit or if I'm getting anything out of the sessions, and given the co-pay it's starting to become expensive. I'm not used to therapy though so I can't say for sure what the problem is. 
* Been prescribed fluoxetine by my doctor just recently, following a recommendation by the psychologist. I had originally wanted to avoid medication, but at this point I feel it'd be better than nothing. I've heard that it takes weeks to get going and there may be side effects early, so that will be a challenge. 
* Tried reaching out to various sources online, now including this sub!

**Conclusion**

Living like this for the past few weeks has been physically and mentally draining. I don't think I've ever had such a low point in my life. I live every day in contact fear for my life in the possibility that I might have this fatal disease that springs itself on you months down the road with no indication whatsoever. I don't know what to do or if what I have done so far has harmed me in any way. I'm not ready to die. I want to go back to worrying about things like exams or internships. 

Rationally, I know the risks of contracting rabies are low, especially in my case. I know there is a better chance of me getting in a car accident. I know the likelihood of any of my fears coming to be are infinitesimally small. But nothing so far has given an indication that it's zero chance. And that frightens me. My mind has blurred the line between what's rationally possible and grossly illogical. I just don't want to die this early and in that way. I don't want to have screwed up my chances at survival by treating my body poorly or failing to clean a certain room.

I am more than welcome to any advice, support, strategies, or suggestions that you can offer me, as I feel I've virtually exhausted my options. The only way I see that I will know with certainty whether or not I'm okay is to live, and it's not comfortable for me to put it out of my mind and go on like I have nothing to worry about. It's really hard for me to go on every day and assume responsibilities that I feel might not even matter in a few months. "
ahqn4b,1,2019-01-19,Roth IRA Questions about Income and Taxes,whitebutalsoasian,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ahqn4b/roth_ira_questions_about_income_and_taxes/,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I'm an undergraduate student who wants to open an IRA. 

For some background on my financial situation:

* I attend a public university which my parents are paying for fully
* I do not have any debt currently and will not have any student loans (unless something bad happens)
* I already have a credit card and very good credit score
* I don't have much of a steady income throughout the year (only $15/week and gift money from holidays, birthday, etc) until summer, when I get internships
* In the summer of 2018, I worked a paid internship through my university in which I was paid about $6000, which was taxed before I received it (so I received less than $6000). 
* My understanding was that I do not make enough money to pay taxes and so I should file taxes in April to get back the amount that was taken out of my income. 

I'm assuming that I am better off with a Roth IRA since I am probably being taxed at a lower rate now than I will be when I graduate and start working full time. My understanding was that money that goes into a Roth IRA has already been taxed. But now I am confused about my marginal income tax rate and whether or not I should/need to file taxes in April and get my money back and how that would affect a Roth IRA.

So I have a few questions:

1. Is my marginal income tax rate currently 0 because I don't make enough money/am an undergraduate?
2. Should I file taxes in the spring to get back the money that was taken out of my pay?
3. Would I open a Roth IRA before/after filing taxes (does it matter)?
4. If my marginal income tax rate is 0, can I still put that money into a Roth IRA since I technically haven't paid taxes on it?

If my questions are not clear or I am misunderstanding anything about a Roth IRA, please let me know! Thanks!!"

&amp;#x200B;

\---------

&amp;#x200B;

So, I had fantasies for a long time - my technical first time was 12 years old with a friend in his basement and we took turns ""butt fucking"" each other (i dont think either of us got that hard but we loved it). That was it for 10 years or so until college....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I had an internship at a nonprofit, where Marcus also had one, but we didn't interact much. I was a skinny, nerdy white kid, and Marcus was a quiet, large-ish black guy with glasses who made small talk with me. I think I knew Marcus was gay (he was open enough about it, iirc). Sometimes at home when jerking off I'd have fantasies about him.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, both our times at the nonprofit come to a close. Months go by, and we're friends on Facebook. He messages me one night while I was home alone and drinking. We're chatting about people from our internship, shooting the shit, and he starts making comments like how ""he always loved looking at my 'fat ass' in my khakis"" and typing 'lol' afterwards, mentioning he knew I was straight. I don't know what came over me, but I WAS horny...

&amp;#x200B;

marcus: yeah I always thought you were hot LOL oh well

me: u should have said something

marcus: oh??

me: haha yeah you never know what someone might say

marcus: damn well im saying something now

me: why dont u come over? its just me here

marcus: seriously?

me: yes

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He started telling me how he couldn't believe it, that it was crazy this was happening (I wasn't the first straight guy he turned)

&amp;#x200B;

45 minutes go by, and I'm getting REALLY nervous now (was this happening? was I gay? etcetcetc). He comes over, and without saying much of anything, he sits down on my couch, and I start giving him a lap dance (I didn't know what else to do). My ass and tight underwear is grinding up against his bulge in his jeans while he gently carresses my back and sides. He eventually slides off his jeans, and I can really feel his bulge now brushing up against my bubble butt (I was skinny, but Marcus was adamant I had a fat ass lol). He grabs me, pulls me closer onto his lap and toward his chest and turns my head around, starting to kiss me slowly but firmly. At this point, I had never kissed a guy, and am in pure adrenaline mode. I let him kiss me, taking it and getting hornier by the second. 

&amp;#x200B;

We move to my bed, and Marcus knows what he wants. He slides off my underwear, lays me on my back, and starts rimming and licking my hole. It's like nothing I've ever felt, and his tongue almost feels a little scratchy up against my hole. He's going to town on it, pushing his tongue into my ass as far as it will go. After a few minutes he simply goes: ""I want you. Do you want my cock inside you?"" I nod without saying anything, and he explains to me the best ways to relax and let his cock get in there. Unfortunately, my inexperience gets the best of me and I can't relax -- it hurts, and Marcus is having a tough time getting consistent thrusts in. Eventually, we settle on me jerking him to completion while licking his cock a little. He knows he'll be back here again anyway, so he's probably in no rush.

&amp;#x200B;

It ends, and Marcus leaves -- but we'd see each other again a couple times. I moved away from my city a few months after that, so we never got as close as I wanted. I ended up getting a girlfriend (Marcus says he always wish he asked me out after all that -- god knows what I would have said, but it's not hard for me to imagine having him as a boyfriend).

&amp;#x200B;

If there's any interest, I'll post part 2...."

So I moved to a new city back in September of 2018 to start grad school. I was really excited back then - new school, new friends, new things to do. Well, here we are in January and I've never felt this alone in my life. I've yet to really find a group of people I get along with in school, I've started to realize this city really isn't for me (maybe I'm just biased because my overall experience has been pretty negative), and I'm just isolating myself more and more, it almost feels intentional at this point which I hate. I literally just go to class, go to my internship, study, eat, and sleep. Nothing else. No new friends that I hang out with, a handful of restaurants that I eat at every so often (alone), and I'll walk around the city every so often just to kill free time by myself. I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm certainly an extroverted person, love making new friends, but I just haven't been able to click with anybody - they all have their friend groups and I don't feel a part of any of them - and I haven't found anyone, personality wise, that I click with. I feel like I can't make new friends anymore. Just feeling very isolated."

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone! I was wondering if anyone has had luck with the career fair as a sophomore candidate? Technically, I am a junior by credits, however, I am in 200 level CS and Math courses.  After the spring semester, I will have completed CS 221(Data Structures), CS 214(Discrete Structures), and Linear Algebra, along with Calculus C.  Do you think that recruiters will want someone in higher level CS courses for internships or that I might stand a chance with getting interviews? My GPA is good at a 3.7. I also have an Associates Degree. I do have a one internship experience from when I was fresh out of High School with the Government. However, it was not technical or related to Computer Science.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Much Appreciated!"

I just usually browse through Vault and Indeed for internships (I'm in the NYC area) but I'm not sure if I could be doing something more (that's what my career counselor told me to do). Should setting up informational interviews with alumni in my area be one of my priorities?

I really really love the outdoors and listening to music. My absolute favorite thing to do is mountain bike, which is unfortunately is a bit difficult in a foot and a half of snow. I like listening to pretty much any kind of music but it's mostly metal. Lately I've been listening to a lot of Christian metalcore ,in particular For Today, August Burns Red and Fit For a King. I'm actually going to a concert for the last 2 over in Albany end of February. 

I'm honestly just looking to meet some people up here and hopefully make some new friendships.

ahunq4,276,2019-01-20,"I [22F] am graduating and can't find a job in my chosen field here, but my BF [30M] refuses to move",PurpleHairEngineer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ahunq4/i_22f_am_graduating_and_cant_find_a_job_in_my/,"Hi all,

I'm graduating in May with my MS in Computer Engineering, and I have been dating this amazing guy for 7 months. I have spent my whole life in this area, and he moved here from his hometown in another state about 3 years ago after carefully researching where he wants to live for the rest of his life. I don't have a problem with this area and would gladly stay here if it were feasible.

Here's the problem: although this area has a lot of jobs, none of them are entry-level in the field I want to be in and have gone to school for (hardware verification). There are a LOT of entry-level software jobs - and I had a 1.5-year software internship so I could probably get hired somewhere - but I don't want to do that. I feel like I'd be pigeonholing myself into a career that I don't want and that my advanced degree would be completely useless for. 

I received an offer for a job in the field I want to be in, but it's located 2500 miles away (I really liked the city though). I have 3 upcoming interviews this week with other companies in that field, but they are also 1500+ miles away. My parents and professor are very supportive of me moving and following the career path I want - and so is my BF - but it would be the end of our relationship since we don't want an LDR and he point-blank said he would never be willing to relocate since he loves it here so much.

It's important to mention that he is in a career field where he could get a good job literally anywhere in the US, but he really loves the job he has now and doesn't think he could find one that great in any of the cities I have interviews in (although he hasn't looked). But the main reason is that he has a very solid and large group of friends here that he doesn't want to give up (I am more introverted with way fewer friends). He made it clear that he is absolutely unwilling to relocate. He also isn't ready to propose marriage (it's only been 7 months), so there's no guarantee we would even stay together if I chose to stay here. He is hesitant about even staying with me if I do choose to stay here, because he thinks I would end up resenting him later on for ""keeping me here."" He encouraged me to go to the interviews, and was honest from the start about not wanting to relocate, but I thought maybe he would make an exception for me (difference between not wanting to and being unwilling to), or else that he would be willing to commit and we could live happily ever after here. He didn't think I would be able to make a rational decision if I didn't at least go see what was out there.

I'm really looking for advice and personal anecdotes here. I really love this man and want to marry him and have his babies more than anything (he would support me financially and let me be a SAHM if I stayed here and couldn't/didn't want to find a job, but I don't think I would find that very fulfilling). I know that if I had never met him or were single, I would take a job somewhere else. My parents and professor have both told me to take a job somewhere else, but I'm a hopeless romantic with very specific needs in a relationship that few men can meet (especially to the extent that he does). Please help.

TL;DR: I can't find a job in the field I want here (but could probably find another well-paying job), and my boyfriend refuses to move... ever."
ahuycl,1,2019-01-20,Boy advice,lilie_roisin,guyadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/guyadvice/comments/ahuycl/boy_advice/,"So I’m in a bizarre situation at the moment. I’m 20 years old but I only just had my first kiss with this guy I really like. We met at a party and started messaging every day. I was going overseas so I invited him to a friends party - he didn’t finish work until 11 but he came over after, then drove me home. I was then overseas for almost three weeks, but we still messaged every day and when I got back I asked him bowling. He suggested we also get dinner. Our first date was so good, we spent six hours bowling, getting dinner then going back to him place and snuggling on the couch. A few days later he invited me over to help him set up his desk and we got dinner again then watched a movie and he kissed me. The next day I went over again and we went to the cinema and he kissed me again. Then he went away for New Years and started working 12 hour shifts so I couldn’t see him, then he had to fly overseas for a week internship. We were still messaging everyday and I kept alluding to wanting to see him when he got back, and he said “looking forward to it”. But something happened when he came home, he went to a party and didn’t invite me, and seemed to be holding back a bit over messenger. Then I finally asked him out again and he said he just wanted to be friends. He said he wasn’t in the headspace for dating and that his lifestyle made him too busy. But he also said he really enjoyed talking to me and spending time with me. I knew from mutual friends that he hadn’t had a relationship in a long time and is perhaps afraid of commitment. I’m just feeling very sad and confused, because I feel like he likes me but isn’t sure about taking the next step? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

ahvv5f,2,2019-01-20,F4F - White Wannabe Cuckquean,dppsexygirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ahvv5f/f4f_white_wannabe_cuckquean/," Title basically covers it, haha.

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

Now I'm home sick rewatching and I'm on S8E13, I like them better as a couple this time round.

However...some observations

- Angela was a starving artist, why is she in charge of all these computers and scenarios?

- Daisy is so freaking annoying, I hope she gets her doctorate and goes elsewhere for work!

- Bones' character development seems staggered, and when she makes some emotional progress, in the next ep it just seems to be forgotten

- Where the fuck does Parker live that booth doesn't see him for months at a time (when sweets moved in)

- I've shouted at the tv multiple times in the last few seasons, calling out connections or links the squints take are missing

- I miss the epilogue bits that had B&amp;B sitting in the bar wrapping up their day.

- My 1st run through I hated Cam. This time I understand her better

- Wendell is my favourite and the most relatable intern, I hope he sticks around. 

- Nigel Murray's deaths scene was super powerful. He wasn't my favourite, but I liked hi. And still that scene got me.

Edit...

- how can hodgins and Angela be broke when she is earning 25% of Brennan's writing royalties?

I made a payment plan for them, and thought I would be ok, but I just found out that my boss at work is cutting my hours down so I will not be making as much anymore. After paying bills and rent, taking care of my cats, and paying the medical bill payments, that leaves me with $20 for grocery for the month. I will be taking a second job as soon as I can, but right now I’m a full time student, have an internship, and work, which take up most of my waking hours of the day. Plus if I overwhelm myself my health issues tend to get worse and I will end up back in the hospital with more bills. 

Sorry for the long post and rant, but I’m trying to figure out a way to make my grocery money last the month without eating unhealthy foods daily. I have some rice, beans, and frozen veggies in my fridge already. Any recipes or tips help!! Thanks in advance and sorry for the long read


Edit: Thank you so much for all the helpful tips and recipes, it is truly appreciated! I think with the resources that I’m finding available to me, I will be able to make it ok so that my kitties and I don’t starve:)"

Good journalists ought to have an edge- and yes, ‘ought’ is a real word. Professor Wiley taught the class that in her introductory journalism course. Grammar, diction, syntax, and all the rest of the dressing could be taught. 

If you didn’t have an edge, that was different. No amount of coaching could sharpen a dull writer into a proper journalist. 

Professor Wiley told me I had that edge. I smiled wildly because I knew I did - I’d always had a step up everyone else. 

I didn’t stew about it being an unfair advantage - knowing who was dangerous was only half the battle. I sought the rest of the story out myself. 

Of course, everyone wondered where I got my leads. No one else could’ve cracked that mafia story open and gutted the organization with a front page exposé. Everyone knew Carmine Falcone was a shady character, but no one would’ve guessed he was the ringleader. Even I was more focused on Mickey Sullivan until I caught a glimpse of their meeting. 

Sullivan was a five compared to Falcone’s eight. The highest I’d ever seen. 

I pulled it apart from there. Nearly won a Pulitzer. 

A knock on my office door pulled me from my latest piece on corruption in Luthor Corp. When I’d seen Lex’s six I looked into their records. My instincts hadn’t proven me wrong. 

“Boss wants to see you,” Olsen said, “he’s finally decided on the new hire.”

I set down my coffee mug and walked through the bullpen. The smell of coffee drifted in the air. Interns buzzed between desks with stacks of paper. The crowd of ones and twos poured over their latest fluff pieces: Grant’s review of the spring fashion lines; Smyth’s coverage of the Wanye charity ball; Lombard’s take on the Eagle’s win. 

I wrapped on the door and let myself in. “I hear you’ve got a surprise for me, chief?”

The new hire was already in the office, though. A big guy hunched over in the comically small chair. He had thick, dark-framed glass and a rumpled dress shirt. 

Over his head, a perfect ten glowed in the air. 

He stood and turned to me with a warm and lopsided smile plastered across his face. His teeth were alarmingly straight and white. How’d a journalist manage to avoid the coffee stains?

“Clark Kent.” He stuck out his hand. I took it. I had no choice. “Pleasure to meet you.”

Ten. The most dangerous person I’d ever met stood in front of me but I couldn’t picture him as much as throwing a punch. The guy looked like he’d cry if he ever stepped on a puppy’s paw. 

Most people would’ve run. Cut their losses and kicked the guy out. He could’ve been a serial killer or a home-grown terrorist for all I knew. 

Most people didn’t have the edge they needed to make it in journalism. If this guy was here, he probably did. 

I *knew* I had that edge. There was a story here - a big one. I wasn’t about to turn down the scoop of a lifetime. 

I shook his hand. “Lois Lane,” I introduced myself, “nice to meet you.”

to be honest this is like my last choice for an internship because i've gotten accepted to better ones near me, but my parents are telling me that it might be good to do one outside of the country.

i just need to know minimal japanese and i'll be working in a team with other canadians/americans, pay is amazing, and living is accommodated. the only reason i would want to go to japan is to check out akihabara arcades since fighting games are huge there and get some anime and video game merch since i know type-moon is huge there. but i could prob just go on vacation there instead lol. i don't really care about sightseeing or finding a girlfriend. also i'm ethnic so i don't know how that will play into factor. never travelled outside of the country alone by the way. 

basically should i go to japan and work there for 16 months or will i regret it."
ai0r3k,2,2019-01-20,Why do I feel completely unhappy with my life even though there's not really anything wrong with it?,throawayjoaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ai0r3k/why_do_i_feel_completely_unhappy_with_my_life/,"first off, throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'll try to do a quick rundown of various areas of my life below.  Feel free to skip the non-relationship ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Education and work:

i'm in my last year of university right now, doing some internships. They pay pretty well, and have great benefits. i end up spending a third of my salary on housing, and getting two meals a day provided by my job, so i'm left with a good piece of money each month. i'm so bored at work though. i feel like such a piece of shit, because they're giving me so much and i can barely be assed to show up. I don't feel motivated to do school either. I was so excited for school when I arrived, but i've found it to be (IMHO) PC and dumbed down to the point of uselessness during my first 3 years of classes.

&amp;#x200B;

General Health:

I try to stay in decent shape by going to the gym. I put on maybe 10 or 15 pounds in the past 6 months, to the point that a pair of my pants didn't fit, but the weight's been coming off since I increased my exercises at the gym. i was very skinny before putting on this weight, so it hasn't really been noticable except to me. I drink sometimes, although I've cut back a lot in the past 6 months, and I very very rarely smoke weed (maybe a few times a year). I don't do any other kinds of drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

Relationship:

I'm in a relationship, for close to 2 years now. 6 months ago, I cheated on my girl-friend. (I kissed another girl i'd never met at a bar if it matters.) I was terrified of ruining things with my gf so i didn't tell her, which made things worse when she found out a week later anyways. We ended up staying together but things haven't been the same since. she was understandably very hurt. i thought things would get better but they haven't. it killed me seeing how heart-broken she was after i cheated, and it kills me knowing she still feels that way inside. she's also become less pleasant towards me, picking fights and acting jealous (even though i've seriously cut back on drinking and have hardly spoken to another girl since i cheated). I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Friends:

I have a few groups of friends I'll hang out with, mostly from school. things are nice with them but i don't see them as often as i'd like and i don't feel as close to them as i'd like either. I feel like there's no one really close to me in my life, even though i've got a gf + loving family + lots of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary:

Objectively, my life seems to be going pretty well. But I can't help but feel like my friends don't actually care about me, I'm just an fraud who doesn't deserve my job and I somehow lucked into it, and i've ruined things forever with my gf by cheating. Even disregarding all my present troubles, i can't even see myself being happy in the future. my work will just be more of the same for higher pay, i'll get even less time to spend with my friends and on hobbies, I'll get fatter and fatter as i get older, and I don't think I'll ever get married and have kids (or that I even want that).

I just see myself working at jobs I hate until I die alone with no friends or family.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the walls of text everyone."
ai1f4k,5,2019-01-20,Family friend [50s/f] is trying to help me [22/f] find a job but I just want some space and the chance to do it myself!,altcoriolanus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ai1f4k/family_friend_50sf_is_trying_to_help_me_22f_find/,"This may get a bit long, I've added the TL;DR below. 

&amp;#x200B;

A family friend (I'll call her Jenny) of mine told a friend of hers\[60s/m\], who happens to run his own business, about me when he mentioned he needed a new employee (I'm trying to keep it kind of vague, sorry!). I've just graduated from my MA (last week) and was previously working at a popular high street coffee chain, my plan being that I would live at home for a few months working there and looking for a job in my industry. However, Jenny put me in touch with her business owning friend and I was offered an interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

The job was in a completely different industry to what I've done my degree in or previously done internships in so I was pretty sure I wouldn't be offered the position, just thought it would be polite to go and good practice for future interviews. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up being offered the job before I'd even gotten home (the job is about 2hours by car from home, relevant later), and just said thank you on the phone etc. and decided I'd think it over once I'd gotten home. That evening Jenny got a call from businessman's wife asking why I hadn't accepted the offer properly. This is probably getting complicated, it's as messy as it seems. Jenny then rang me asking me the same thing, why hadn't I accepted? I was too nervous and embarressed to tell Jenny that I wasn't sure I wanted the job. It would mean relocating within the next 2/3 weeks to a place I've never been before the interview, away from my family and friends, before I'd even had my graduation ceremony. But Jenny told me to email her businessman friend and accept the job. I wanted to tell her no but felt too mean and rude, so I emailed him and accepted. Immediately I knew I'd made a huge mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I start the job and it turns out to be rubbish, not just rubbish tasks for me (that's fine, I don't mind mundane stuff - it is my first 'professional' job afterall!) but my manager \[40s/f\] we'll call her Coldy McCold isn't interested in training me. She occasionally emails me something small to do, swivels around in her chair to speak to me once every 2 hours, and leaves 2 hours ealy without leaving me anything to do. So I did the usual, bucked my ideas up, asked her to give me some stuff to do when she leaves everyday, asked for more guidance. But nothing changes. Coldy McCold just ain't bothered. 

&amp;#x200B;

After 2 weeks I left the job, this is catching up to where I am now. I'm back home, where I was before the job and much happier. Even though Jenny dismisses my job at the popular coffee chain, I was really happy doing it. I knew it would take time to find a 'professional' job and most graduates are looking for a few months anyway. No sweat. 

&amp;#x200B;

But tonight, Jenny texted me asking for my CV and details to send to another friend of hers, whose children work in advertising. Now, I have absolutely zero interest in that field of work, no experience. After this quite stressful month of me moving away temporarily and taking up a job I knew wasn't right for me which also happened to be awful and poorly paid, I just want to go back to my coffee shop and keep job searching as I was doing before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jenny is quite confident that I need help and that any job in any part of the country will do. But I moved back home because my dad \[69/m\] is ill and could get worse. I only graduated last week and I'm still exhuasted from the toughest year of my life, studying for my MA. I just want to be left alone to make my cappucinos and take some time to look for work without rushing into huge decisions before thinking them over, as I've just been forced to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please reddit, help me find a gentle way to tell Jenny that I'm happy to just look for jobs in my industry alone for a while. I would understand her panic if I'd been home doing nothing for a year or something. But I had a job and was actively looking! I appreciate the hard work on her part, but I don't want to be pushed into these uncomfortable situations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, side note, my parents were also really concerned about this job as they knew it wasn't what I was looking for and it was too far away from them. They supported my decision to leave the job and are happy with me living at home as long as I am working (re-applying for my coffee shop job!) and looking for other jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Family friend set me up with a job interview for a position much further away from home than I've been looking for in a totally different industry, I did the interview and got the job but was unsure - she pressured me into taking it and I ended up being miserable. Now she's asking for my CV and more info so she can set up more job related things for me, but in completely different areas to what I'm applying for! "
ai1gjs,2,2019-01-20,Is this a symptom of depression?,xcer49,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ai1gjs/is_this_a_symptom_of_depression/,"Hi, so I’ve already been diagnosed a while ago, and I’m on medication for both that and GAD. Lately I’ve been experiencing what I want to say is a lack of a will to do anything, but, I have reasoning behind it. 

(TL;DR at bottom)

So here’s some background for context, because I don’t know if what I’m feeling is depression or just a reasonable given the situation: 

 I’m in college and switched into a difficult major halfway through. This is my fifth year; scheduled to graduate after four more semesters. I’m very ready to be done with the whole school environment. It’s been a constant cycle of hard work that doesn’t seem to be enough, being too busy (partially my fault- I tend to overcommit but I also feel it’s necessary to be successful in the field), getting stressed out, and not getting enough sleep/exercise/etc. So honestly pretty typical. But four more semesters on top of the nine already is just exhausting to think about, esp given that the classes get harder. 

I also work part time- it’s an internship, but I also have it because it helps pay the bills, which are piling up. My husband and I have both been dealing with medical bills, even with his parents’ help (which is awesome that they help, btw. We’re lucky for that). He struggles with an undiagnosed illness that looks like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome mixed with MS. His mom has MS so it’s suspicious. Because of this, he’s only able to do class part time. He used to have full schedules plus a lucrative internship- it just isn’t possible anymore.
Li
Additionally, I’m not on speaking terms with half my immediate family due to abusive issues. That finally culminated last fall, and really added on to stress and such. From time to time I still have to defend myself against family members I do talk to. The defending involves a lot of guilt tripping and things you’d find on r/raisedbynarcissists .

My internship is at a steam turbine power plant. My passion is towards energy engineering and somehow stopping/preventing/reversing(?) climate change. It’s incredibly sad to me to see permanent changes happening to the planet and tbh gives me anxiety to think about. So I want to do what I can to try to help. Having just started this position last fall, it’s been very exciting, because it’s a great gateway into the field I want to work in. The job is flexible and I can focus studies &amp; research on efficiency of pretty much anything in the plant. Which is awesome! What’s disheartening is that through my training and increase of energy knowledge, the answer to some sort of solution is so much more complicated than it seemed before. And everything takes money, of course. What if we don’t actually have the resources to stop this, and it’s a lost cause? 

This has been on my mind recently. Added to that is a fundamental constitutional disagreement in the club that I help lead that I have strong feelings about. So that’s a bit more stress

All of this pretty much wore me out a bit last fall. But then, my husband and I had a really nice break for the past couple weeks, away from all of it, where we got to spend time with his loving family. It was so helpful.

Came back from that, and went to work for almost a full work week. Back to the grind of things. And now that it’s the weekend I just... I don’t want to do anything. I don’t think I have the energy to do anything. I have things I want to get done, but I don’t even have a positive mindset that they will get done. So I’m currently talking about the past couple days, but this is something I experienced on quite a few Saturdays last semester as well.

I don’t see the _point_ in doing anything. Right now, I just don’t see any victories. Last fall was decently successful but I don’t see these plans going well. School is fine but I’m not a naturally good student; just got off academic probation. I’m worried about my coming classes. 

I hope it doesn’t sound entitled but I don’t see a lot of positive things in the near future. Working/studying 24/7, dealing with med issues and helping husband, dealing with family members, working towards a purpose that looks bleak as I barely even start; plus the current world drama, I guess.

Point is, I don’t want to do anything mostly because I don’t see any of it ending well anyways. Do you think that’s a normal reaction? Or part of the symptoms of the depression I’m fighting against?

There’s more but I’m going to end it there. 

TL;DR I have little to no motivation, but I don’t know if it’s due to depression or because I’m dealing with a lot of stress and disheartening circumstances. Thoughts or advice?"

Task

A friend has written to you asking for advice about a problem at work. You have had a similar problem in the past.

Write a letter to your friend. In your letter:

* tell your friend you understand the problem
* explain what happened to you in the past
* suggest a possible solution to this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Mike

Good to hear from you and I’m glad you’ve graduated. Welcome to the workforce! Let me give you some tips to ease your entry.

I know how disappointed you must be right now. You try to get a job but most of job postings are advertise for someone with few years of experience, and as a recent graduate you got none. It’s a typical catch 22 situation and it’s frustrating.

Rest assured you’re not alone and that’s exactly what I’ve went though two years ago. I couldn’t land any job at the beginning, so I had to get in touch with my one of my college professors and through her connections I got an internship offer. Three months later, I got hired as a junior financial analyst.

Back to your situation If I were you, I’d try to network and get in touch with in the people in the business. Also, I think signing up for a resume writing workshop at the community center would be beneficial. And I advise you to widen your search pool and aim for any entry or junior position in the financial sector to bump your chances.

Well, best of luck in your job hunt, and don’t hesitate to get in touch.

Regards,

John."
ai22sm,17,2019-01-20,Web Developers?,cursewordbyrd,Sacramento,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/ai22sm/web_developers/,"Hello there folks,

I just turned 31 in December and i’m tired of working minimum wage jobs in restaurants. I’ve been slugging away feeling miserable and being underpaid my entire life so I decided it’s time to make a change.

Around the spring of last year I enrolled in Sac City Colleges 2 year certificate Web Developer program. The program is stackable and offers you basically three certificates in one upon completion. It starts off with Web Production Specialist then once that’s completed you can go for a Front End Web Developer certificate and once that’s completed then you can move on to a Web Developer certificate. 
You can see all the goods it entails here: 

https://www.scc.losrios.edu/cis/web/

https://www.scc.losrios.edu/cis/web-production/

https://www.scc.losrios.edu/cis/front-end-web-developer/

I have a few questions regarding this path.

- Is achieving these three certificates a good option in helping me start an ACTUAL career or would it be more beneficial for me to have a much higher education in this industry (associates/bachelor...etc)? 

- I don’t expect anyone to read everything on the info page but if you happen to, are the classes offered for this even substantial enough to lead me to anything?

- When is a good time to start applying for entry level / internship opportunities? I’ve never worked in anything other than restaurants and a few smaller mom and pop offices so I don’t really know how to go about doing this. What should I be looking for in job postings, what kind of jobs would I even be qualified for and where can I find such things?

- I don’t currently see myself going through with a plan on taking my formal education any further than what i’m already doing now with these certificates. I could easily transfer to a UC but I don’t really have the means to do so anytime soon. With that being said, what sort of things should I be learning to help my career on my own after I do earn these certificates? I know there’s a million different facets of web development and obviously the community college isn’t going to cover all of them in two years.

Any tips and tricks and ideas or other pieces of advice about this sort of thing would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

But then he mentioned he was still on tinder, and swiping but has not been seeing anyone else other than me. He told me he would be ok if I did the same, since he does not want to ""restrict"" me if he was to be with me... which I then answered and said I preferred exclusivity.

Now I'm just confused and wondering if he's just been playing me the whole time, or if he's genuinely conflicted and deserves time. 

I just feel numb since it didn't seem like a straight up rejection, but he also made it sound like he's mainly seeing me exclusively because of laziness/boredom. I don't know if I should just keep enjoying what we are while we still have it, since the future is so uncertain. I

This is shilling, not just posting under a throwaway. This is attempting to create a false consensus on a few different topics.

Here's the story: I saw three accounts all posting under the same parent comment in a thread and noticed something strange. All three accounts were created 10/31/18. All three post to this sub and /r/libertarian. All three accounts were pushing the same message in that thread and within the same hour. 

Then I checked their accounts and noticed more coincidences. They frequently post to the same threads. Sometimes all three accounts post to the same thread, but more often it's only two of them. This includes threads that were buried on this sub. They also post the same messages. They claim Tulsi Gabbard is an establishment ""plant."" That's just one example. They like the word ""puppet"" as well to describe Trump. They also say very similar things about Trump's wall. Two of them specifically said ""goofy wall,"" so we can see that this is probably an intern somewhere who wasn't instructed how to shill properly, especially with the identical ages of the accounts. 

I found another account that was created 10/31 that also said Gabbard is a plant, but I'm withholding that one for now until I find undeniable evidence for that one. This tells me there are probably a ton of these accounts that this shill made in batches. 

The three accounts: KakeDistance, KeeKeeKat, ConspiracyBuffer 

Link to where all three accounts posted comments pushing the same narrative: https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ahz1rt/this_entire_native_american_trump_supporter_thing/eek55mj/?st=jr5cuwp9&amp;sh=25cedfb5

If they delete anything, archive of the thread: http://archive.is/Y290t

As you can see, all three accounts are telling us to forget about the media manipulating us because it feeds into the division.

ai4o6f,125,2019-01-20,You’re not going to tell me the price of a salad mix before I check out? Ok then!,mart1373,MaliciousCompliance,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/ai4o6f/youre_not_going_to_tell_me_the_price_of_a_salad/,"Mobile post blah blah, yada yada.

This just happened a few minutes ago at a Meijer store. If you’ve never been to the Midwest, Meijer is to the Midwest what Walmart is to the entire United States. For the most part, Meijer is a pretty reasonable store to go into: you see fewer weird customers than you would at Walmart (at least imo) and the shopping experience is relatively pleasant. The store invests in having a good customer experience, and I even worked at their corporate office for a summer internship a few years ago. All in all, Meijer is not a terrible store to shop at.

This particular trip to Meijer, however, was kind of, well, bad. I had gone there to pick up some salad mixes, so I made a beeline straight to the salad produce section and start looking for the salads I wanted. The salad mixes were jumbled up, many were not stocked, and 9 out of 10 mixes were missing a price label. So I’m like, Whatever, I’ll just grab a few and go from there. One of the mixes was actually 2 for $5, so I was guessing the salad mixes were going to be reasonably priced. 

I go to check out, and I scan my salad mixes, and they ring up as $3.69. I was a little peeved that the price was higher than I expected and that they didn’t have the price of the salads listed so I could’ve made a more informed decision, but I reluctantly decided I’d just pay the extra $1 more than anticipated and get the 4 or 5 bags I had in my cart. 

Then I scan the 2 for $5 bags: they each scan as $4.49 each. At this point I’m definitely more annoyed that the price was more than I expected paying. So I thought about doing what any reasonable person would do in this scenario: asking an attendant for a price adjustment. But then I remembered something about Michigan law.

In the state of Michigan, if you purchase an item and are incorrectly charged a different price than what is labeled/advertised, even if it’s an inadvertent error on the store’s part, you receive the difference between the price incorrectly charged and the advertised price as a refund, *plus 5 times the price difference, up to $5.00.*

So instead of asking for a price adjustment as I’m checking out, I put on my shit-eating grin and finish purchasing the salad mixes. After finishing up, I immediately head to customer service and point out that I was incorrectly charged $4.49 each for two salad mixes and the price should’ve been $2.50 each (2 for $5). As a result, the customer service employee issues me a refund of $3.98 ($4.49 times 2 = $8.98, minus $5.00 for the two mixes), *plus* an extra $5.00 for the error ($3.98 times 5, but maxed at $5.00), for a total refund of $8.98. 

So because Meijer decided to not tell me the correct price of my items before I checked out, I decided to do the same and not tell them the correct price of the other salad mix, earning myself an easy $5 in the process :-)"
ai4wwc,4,2019-01-20,To that little girl,deathlyhallowsordead,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/ai4wwc/to_that_little_girl/,"When asked what you wanted to be when you grew up, you said “lifeguard”, because of how much you loved to swim. But that dream came to an end, and so did your passion, when your hair started breaking off &amp; your self image plummeted. 

When you were about to graduate elementary school, you dreamed of all the fun that you would have at your new school - all the freedoms and new friends. But instead, you cried almost everyday because that bubble of innocence you lived in had burst &amp; you were exposed to some of the harsh realities of life.

When you got accepted to your dream high school, you jumped for joy because it was as if your prayers had been answered. But that happiness soon faded once you realized that it wasn’t all that it was cracked up to be.

When you persevered and strived to be the best, resulting in you being at the top of your class and winning a national competition, you cried tears of joy at the opportunity to go to the college you so greatly loved. But that ethereal feeling lasted a split second before your parents reminded you that they could not afford the high price tag. 

When you decided to study abroad your second semester, you were elated that you finally had the opportunity to travel as you so desperately craved for years. But instead of exploring the world, you wasted your time talking to a boy who would later devastate you.

When you started dating the guy you had been eyeing for months, you felt that everything in life was finally falling into place. But instead, he broke your heart and made you feel lower than you’ve ever felt before. 

When you got the best internship in your major, you thought that that meant you were worth something and had a shot at success. But instead, you were told that you were not good enough for this opportunity and were made to feel worthless. 

To that little girl who loved to play imaginative games, to play sports, to spend time with friends, to celebrate the holidays, to live life...

When you were younger, you thought that you’d be happy in life. But instead, you can’t wait for your life to end.

When you were just a child, you didn’t even know the word “suicide”. But now, it’s the only word you seem to know. 

To that little girl who thought her life would pan out differently, who thought she would grow old, get married, potentially have a family, and experience what others call “the joys in life”, 

I am sorry.

ai4yt6,7,2019-01-20,Is getting into an American university a good start?,siposbalint0,space,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ai4yt6/is_getting_into_an_american_university_a_good/,"Hey r/space!

I made a post a few weeks ago where I asked a few things about my future studies, for which I got some great responses to learn c++ and python and spend time in kerbal, and take every opportunity to work with anything space-related. Little about me: I'm a 18 years old Hungarian male who is going to start university next year on the field of computer science engineering, and my goal since childhood is to work in the space industry, and I AM GOING TO make this into reality.

Now that I got to know what I need to learn, I encountered the next barrier. How to get into the USA space industry, because of ITAR regulations. Without a green card, I'm not even able to apply for these jobs, neither internships. ESA is also an option which I'm applicable of, since I'm an EU citizen, but their open positions only require someone with a lot of experience, and also most of it requires me to live in Italy or the Netherlands, which I don't intend to.

Hungary's space program or oportunities is exact zero, same goes for education on this field. Our biggest accomolishment was the first Hungarian satellite, the MASAT-1, which was built at the university I'm starting my studies at and by ESA funding.

So my question is is trying to start my master's in the USA going to help me in these regards, or it won't change anything. My plan B is game development, which requires the same programming languages, but it also needs me to move to the USA sooner or later.

I'm just a young man with big dreams and I feel I can make it happen, but I don't really know what exactly to do and how to start my career in the US space scene.

Thanks for your help, reddit! "

ai53ia,1,2019-01-20,Forensic internship got scary - need to vent!,dreamfields007,counsellorsintraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/counsellorsintraining/comments/ai53ia/forensic_internship_got_scary_need_to_vent/,"Howdy!

Returning adult to education here, needing to vent about my internship ... and seeking words of wisdom, if y'all have any.

I'm a Master's-level intern in a counseling field.  Since I began the current one-year commitment to an agency, I have been sexually harassed, not given a case load (in my 5th month), and my two supervisors' expectations of me are likely much lower than my own.  This last point has caused some ruffling of feathers, as I am longer in the tooth than the supervisors and am more educated, in the counseling field (different country), as well as another, related, field (first career experiences). 

I am told to observe.  Yet, my schedule does not fit with the others in the department.  This is my final semester in internship, and I feel that I lack the job training which my university laid out as an expectation in the agreement with the agency.  I have taken this up with the university supervision as well as the agency supervisor, and nothing changes.

Last week, one of my over-worked supervisors did not answer a question (""at what point of behavior x do we use intervention y?""), rather they jumped into action with an intervention, taking over the situation, still not answering my inquiry.  At one point, I felt as though I could not slow matters down, and I left the room twice (no clients present).  Later, this supervisor was toe to toe with me, telling me that I forced them to do an intervention that they did not think was clinically their idea, and that despite my age and experience, they didn't like being challenged, especially by an intern.  During this confrontation, I was alone with them, behind a closed door.  It seems my impression of the situation was vastly different than theirs.  All I felt they would hear was an apology and statement that the action (challenge?) was not intended.  This was all I said in response to the supervisor who was 30cm (11 inches?) away from me.

Within two hours, the same supervisor gave me a file, for me to find additional supports and programming through the agency (without the client's knowledge, I believe).  With no further direction on a new situation to me (as far as this agency goes).  The supervisor then left the room, reminding me to chart my actions.

I think both of these supervisors are good at what they do.  My concern is that as supervisors, they lack the time to devote to basic needs of the relationship.  I respect the supervisors as professional counselors, yet I'm not getting my needs met as an intern or as an intern under the university agreement.

Over-worked is no joke - often, when I seek supervision, the individual is slammed with tasks, clients, or their door is closed for other reasons.  Other supervision scheduled times have been attended, and, at times, chatting with co-workers (personal stuff:  gardening, weekend plans, and so on) has taken precedence.  The main supervisor refuses to be mindful of my schedule (frustrating, as I am unpaid and have life and university matters which I must complete outside of my time at the agency).

This is not an emotionally safe environment, and now I wonder about its physical security.  My university did not have much to say about this.  No other interns have been at this agency in five or more years.

The sexual harassment matter got fumbled in the agency, as the agency was more concerned about the safety of future interns, above my own.  My university is aware, and there is no support, as well as no further steps for me.

I can grin and bear (bare?) it, as they say.  I have lived through much worse, though I had higher expectations from an agency in a forensic setting, especially in such a large US city.

Well then, thank you for hearing me vent.  If you have any words on the matter, I welcome them.  Thank you for listening (reading)."

ai5ncq,9,2019-01-20,How much harm can one bad performance review do for your career?,Concerned_Intern,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ai5ncq/how_much_harm_can_one_bad_performance_review_do/,"I've been interning at a Big 4 firm for a few months now and have had been on 3 projects total. 

The first project was high profile and challenging. I was on it for 3 months and I received great feedback from the director, senior associates and the manager. The I was on the second project for 2 weeks and my team liked me, but I did not request feedback since I was on it for a short period of time. For my third project I am on it for one month working only with one senior. It is a low profile client and my senior works from home a lot which caused me to be more careless in my work ethic.

As a result of this my feedback for this project is bad.

Before I joined this project my mentor at the firm was already discussing my contract to come back full time after my internship expires (since they heard positive feedback for the first project).

How will this negative feedback impact my career and potential return offer?

I am very nervous I may have blew my chance by being careless."

ai5zdv,3,2019-01-20,Me (24M) far away from home and feeling empty and missing my girlfriend (24F),TooFarAway1011,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ai5zdv/me_24m_far_away_from_home_and_feeling_empty_and/,"Prepare, this will be a long post.

Hello fellow Redditors. Made a throw away for this post because I felt insecure about using my main account. Insecurity will probably be a recurring theme though.

So first off a little background. 1.5 years ago, started doing my Masters degree, and decided to do an internship abroad. I just came out of a long relationship of 4 years (bad break up) and wanted to get away from it all, but also knew this was good for my resume (abroad experience works allot in my field). So I set in a procedure to do a 6 months internship at a prestigious university in the US (I am from the Netherlands, to clarify). I got an offer from my former professor to do an internship with a colleague there, working on a cool project. This took a while but after some months I finally got everything in order to leave January 2019 till July.

Here comes the problem, because when I was setting things in motion, around November 2017, I came across a girl. I knew her from my study, and we found out we had a lot in common. We were first just talking, then things clicked and so started dating. A few weeks later we had our first kiss. Everything went on and on, and we started our relationship. I was insanely happy that it happened but we both knew that I had my internship for 6 months in the future. We decided to carry on (best decision). She is my soulmate, and we have been super happy together ever since. We were together allot, basically everyday, but we both didn’t mind at all. We still did our things separately with friends and what not but just at the end of most days we would be happy sleeping together.

Fast forward about 10 months, and January was getting closer. We talked about it a lot now but since I already set everything in motion I couldn’t really turn back, as it was still one of the best opportunities in my life. Last few days in December and start of January we were inseparable and very happy together. But then came my flight day off (8 of January) to the US. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing ever but we both knew we would see each other in 2 months (she’ll visit me for a week).

At first I was fine! Yes it was hard, I missed her and my own place and family, but it was okay. But than after a day or two I became really insecure and sad. I always was (unreasonably) insecure, even when I was still home with her. I trust her 110% and I knew she would be forever faithful to me, but a voice in my head kept saying that she could just leave me whenever she wants. This made me even more insecure and drove me crazy. I talked about it to her and of course she told me she would never do something and be with me forever. Problem is, I really need to talk about my feelings. I need someone to help and listen to me when I’m feeling down. She on the other hand would rather not talk about it because it would remind her how much she missed me. This was and still is very hard because I have to give her space but I can’t really because I want to talk to her. So to sort of replace talking to her I now talk to my friends and family a lot, but this is sometimes really hard because I miss her and talking to her the most.

So we do talk once or twice a day, but it is hard talk. I am sort of pretending that I am fine to help her, but inside I just want to go home and cuddle her. I have enough to do here (made friends, have enough to do for my internship, can walk around and discover etc), so it’s not that I can’t distract myself, but my head just won’t stop thinking. The evenings are fine because then she is asleep and I can’t talk to her and my head can rest because it thinks nothing can happen now, but the mornings are though because I then want to talk to her but she is doing whatever stuff so we can’t really.

Going home is not an option really because I invested so much money in this internship, and would bring my former professor to shame, let alone the place I am now. I know she will come in 7 weeks and I also know I have to give it more time since I am here for only 12 days now, but there are times that I just break down and feel so intense dark/sad that I can’t really think about something else than going back home and be with her. Due to me being insecure, I am sort of a ‘doom thinker’ meaning that I am imagining all sorts of crap which I know is not true (She doesn’t love you, she found someone else, she is happy without you) but I can’ help thinking those thoughts. We talked about it, and she said to just don’t think that and that she’ll love me forever and that I am hers forever, and that helps every time she said that, but a few hours later after we talked the sadness an insecurity slowly creeps back.

So, I can go into way more details but I think you get the point now. I am out of ideas to set these thoughts out of my mind. Read all sorts of guides online to stop homesickness and the feeling of missing someone. But I still feel so empty and lonely especially when I think about the fact that I have 7 more weeks to go till I see her, and after that week, 4 months till I am finally home and I am just here for 12 days now. I don’t want to count down the days but my head keeps doing just that. I am supposed to enjoy this super cool and adventurous period I am here but my head just keeps thinking bullshit.

Any advice?

TL:DR: Am 6 months away from home, feeling lonely and miss my girlfriend allot, but don’t know what to do to stop that feeling."

Hello everyone! As my post's title suggests, I am crazy about MILFs and looking for any and all of them!

Maybe you’re a married woman, and have been for a while now. You no longer have that spark from the honeymoon phase, whether you’ve been married for ten years or twenty. You used to be very careful about keeping up appearances, going to the gym, shaving your body, and more. But now, things have quieted down on that front.

Or maybe you have never been married. You like to enjoy yourself with as many men that you choose. Tying yourself down to one guy was never in your plan and that is perfectly fine with everyone ;)

Regardless of the type of life you lead, you have somehow found me. I’m young and handsome, and in many ways I am exactly the kind of young guy you've been looking for. Not surprising, I'm instantly turned on by a sexy older woman like you. Maybe you see me at the gym and catch me sneaking glances at your ass. You think it sags a bit, and you know you have cellulite on your thighs, but I still keep on checking you out. Little do you know that I’m sneaking into your locker after you leave and smelling your used gym shorts, the smell of your sweat and natural odor combined with your hairy pussy giving me an instant hardon.

Or perhaps I’m an intern at your firm, and you realize that I keep on coming into your office to get different forms because you have to lean down to grab them from a drawer, giving me an eyeful of your cleavage. Your tits sag after three kids, but you realize that that turns me on.

Maybe your an average looking milf. That means cellulite, sagging tits, an ass that had dropped a little, a wildly hairy pussy, and more. Or maybe your a pornstar-type bimbo, hotter than anyone else in town! I’m open to most kinks so I’ll just put my limits, which are death, scat, gore, and vomit. As to kinks, why don’t you include those in your message, and we can work out a story."

ai7ikt,91,2019-01-21,"I've always believed in it, ever since I was a teen.",TheGreenWitchNYC,lawofattraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/ai7ikt/ive_always_believed_in_it_ever_since_i_was_a_teen/,"I always thought of my self as lucky. Things always seemed to work out. Things have also gone spectacularly wrong, but most of the time I've always had some sort of ""luck"" propelling me in a good direction.

Only recently have I realized that this was me subconsciously manifesting things. I've always been a pretty big believer in my life going in a direction that I'd be happy with, and not worrying about pitfalls or obstacles because it'd sort itself out... Because they always have.

For example, I'll begin with college. I applied to one school (though I don't advise that) because it was the one I wanted to go to. A very specific art school. I believed I'd get in, and I did.

- Art school is notorious for leaving students with out a practical career path. I see how this could have absolutely been an issue for me, but I believed that I'd get a job after school. I wasn't worried by it. Lo and behold, I got an internship and was hired on full time the day I graduated.

- Art school left me with an insane amount of student debt. 150k to be exact. An absurd amount. I remember a specific evening sitting at my desk right after graduation, pouring over my student loans that I had to start paying. I remember instant messaging my friend and saying to him that if I just pay 1k over the minimum amount a month, I'd have these loans payed off in under 8 years. It just seemed practical to me. The right time and the right amount. Looking back, I had NO idea how I was going to get that kind of income to do that. No clue. I just believed it'd happen, and I'm proud to say that on October 13th, 2017, seven years after graduating, I officially became fully debt free.

- During that journey to become debt free, my partner and I were discussing our jobs and salaries/household income. I remember saying to him ""in five years Ill probably making x"", despite that not really being the trajectory of my career. I also said ""in that same amount of time, you'll probably be making xx"". It was just a guess, but the number seemed right. I then finished by saying ""I think our total income will be xxx in 5 years"". About four years later we hit exactly those numbers, and now we've exceeded them. Yes through working hard and being good at our careers, but we're making above average in our field of work. Again, I believed it to be true, and so it was.

- I wanted to live in a particular part of the city and the apartment needed very specific things. Things that an apartment in my city generally doesn't have in our price point. I desired an elevator building so that my elderly parents or family members wouldn't have to climb stairs. I wanted a bigger sized kitchen so that my partner and I could cook with each other. I desired a full sized fridge, and counter space. I desired a washer and dryer in the unit itself so I didn't have to bring it to a Landrymat or fight for a washer. I wanted it to be spitting distance from the park, and 20 minutes from work. The bedroom had to fit our king sized bed. It had to be quiet. This list of desires is pretty absurd if you think about it, especially in the city I live in. But after like, two weeks of casual searching we found the apartment that hit every single desire. Every single one.

These are just the huge things I've manifested. There are tons more, many very small things that have come into my life that I haven't mentioned. 

People seem to have a lot of rules for manifestation, but thinking about it now, the thing that's seemed to work for me is to just believe something will work out. Don't obsess. If I'm obsessing over something, constantly thinking about it and intentionally trying to *make it happen*, it doesn't. If I think about it, plan for that thing to happen fairly casually, discuss it like it's to be, and make slow comfortable moves towards the ""goal"", then it happens.

I watched ""The Secret"" in a high school math class for some reason a million years ago. My teacher decided that we needed to see it and I remember a story of a guy wanting a house, seeing a photo of a house he liked in a magazine and pinning it above his computer on the wall. Every once in a while he'd glance up, look at the photo, smile and go about his day. When he finally found a house and moved in he realized he moved into the same exact house he had been casually glancing at in the photo. He didn't obsess. He appreciated what he wanted, went about his days and then got it. That's my approach as well. 

Sorry that this was so long, but it felt really good to write out. It doesn't feel like a coincidence anymore and never really felt like one to begin with."
ai7scq,4,2019-01-21,[T4A] Lovers of Femboys and Traps Rejoice! This is the Prompt for You!,samw141,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ai7scq/t4a_lovers_of_femboys_and_traps_rejoice_this_is/,"Hey all! If you're a fan of androgynous boys, feminine boys, traps, girly-bois and everything like that under the sun, then this is definitely the prompt for you! 

Like to top? Sure! Like to bottom? Why not! Like to switch it up, get kinky with it? Absolutely! Do you roleplay in the real world? That's fine! Like to roleplay in more fictitious settings? That's awesome too! 

I'll play with anybody, regardless of gender or sexuality, so just send a message! Below I'll drop my limits, and add some scenario ideas based on genres I find appealing.

Limits: blood, gore, feet, scat, death, watersports, bimboification, torture, and other extremes.

Scenario ideas:

**Fantasy:**

- I'm a diplomat for an Elf race that resides not too far out from your Kingdom. As an offering of peace, they send me to the castle to act as a servant, not realizing you have other plans in mind...

- You're the king or prince of a large kingdom that needs to grow, but can only do so with the marriage of your royalty to another country's royalty. Unfortunately, the biggest nation nearby has only a prince as well, but they're willing to dress him a little different if it means your hand in marriage.

I really need to get this off my chest. Sorry for such a long post.


I really want to send this to him. We've been dating since grade 12 and right now we're in third year of uni, going to unis around 1 hour apart. We were eachother's first everything basically. I'm currently on an 8 month internship and I moved home to commute. Due to my strict parents, I haven't been able to stay for an entire weekend like we did previously. I thought we were great. The first 2 and some years, we spent all our free time together, in person and on Skype. But come third year, things started to fall apart. I've been jealous of this one girl he met at uni for a while and every single time he's reassured me that nothing happened and that they're just friends. I've met this girl multiple times as well.


He told me that he had feelings for her 3 days ago. And apparently in November, he told her that he had a crush on her. They've been spending more and more time together and things started to escalate romantically in December, when it was study season and he told me he was studying all day and too busy to talk. Although they didn't kiss, they acted like a couple in December. They played truth or dare and talked about their sex lives. He said he dared her to stand still and close her eyes so that he could see how close he could get to her face without kissing her. They almost kissed a couple times. He slept in her bed a few times. He wrapped his arms around her. He did this two days after my birthday. And the day after that, we met for dinner. I can't believe I was so naive.


----------------------------------------------------------

Here's my letter if anyone wants to read:


Dear [Name],

I hope you know that what you did was horrible. I can't even imagine the thought process you had in your twisted mind that you ever thought you hadn't given up on us. For weeks, you made the choice to go over to her house. You made the choice to play truth or dare. You made the choice to talk about those topics. You dared her and you teased her. You made the choice to almost kiss her. You walked up the stairs, you turned off the lights, you got in the bed, and you wrapped your arms around her. 


You didn't want to admit to yourself that you were the one cheating on me. That's why you didn't tell me, not because you didn't want to give up. I could tell you liked her, but I had no idea you were taking it that far. You said I was the most understanding girlfriend you could imagine. It's because it was easy to lie to me, right? I didn't question where you went and I thought there was something wrong with me for being jealous. It was perfect. 


It wasn't only you that did something wrong, but her too. Just think about all those things that happened with you two. She knew you liked her and that you had a girlfriend of 3 years, yet she continued to tease you too. You said the first time you weren't able to sleep when you slept over, right? Was she able to sleep? Like a frigging baby, knowing what you two were doing? 


You had the guts to put blame on me. See, I thought there was something to salvage by December. It's what started the rift in the relationship, but cheating and lying is something that will put an end to it the moment it starts. You couldn't live with yourself you said. At first I felt bad for you, I thought you had feelings that you couldn't control and that you were trying to stop it. Instead, you used my trust in you, trust that we built over 3 years, and you threw it away because you felt lonely over the fact that I wasn't able to visit you overnight for a couple months. You indulged in your feelings, pretty obviously, I think. You didn't tell me because you made the excuse that you were still trying for us, like you were still the good guy. She said she didn't believe a guy like you could like a girl like her. I think it's possible. A guy who would cheat on his girlfriend of 3 years could indeed like a girl who would help the guy cheat. Sure, you guys like each other and you have been friends for 2 years. I don't know if you'll start dating each other but if you do, maybe it will last. I hope when she meets your family and they ask how you started dating like they did with us, I hope you say that you told her that you liked her two months before you ended us. I hope you say that you started to escalate it a month before our relationship ended. And I especially hope you say that it all happened behind my back. How romantic. 


I know you said you don't think you could ever hate me, but I'm sorry if you do now. I hope for next time you learned a lesson. That you don't hurt another girl like this again. 


I totally would love to send this to you and rip you a new one. But I have to keep my dignity and not grow hate between us. Although, I would love to announce to the world how much of a dick you are, because everyone loves you and you seemed like one of the good guys. I hope I can truly let go and forget about you but honestly you probably ruined me with these new found trust issues and all. And you had the guts to tell me that you didn't want to lose me and that you still wanted to be friends. So thanks. Thanks for a great 3 years and thanks for teaching me to believe myself when I can feel something is wrong."
ai9rc9,6,2019-01-21,How do you get past social anxiety at work and fear of failing?,tatilopespt,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ai9rc9/how_do_you_get_past_social_anxiety_at_work_and/," Wondering if anyone who deals with depression and anxiety in the workplace has tips for me. 

My situation is this, last year after high school I went to university and when anxiety and depression hit me I never left my room and ended up quitting university after way too long. After doing some therapy and eventually opening up to my family “we” decided (mainly my dad) it was better for me to ingress in some technical degree so I would have more than the high school diploma. The first two years went fine, with me passing every subject. In the 2nd year I started working at a company; I was working at an admin job, after 9 months I started having a lot of trouble getting out of bed go to that job at the beginning of summer last year, eventually I left (I was leaving on my own). 

In October I started an academic internship in a company, it’s a month away from ending but I’m having a lot of trouble doing what my uni teachers ask me. Not only I am doing something I never did before, with no experience, I have trouble getting past my social anxiety to talk to people about what am I doing, and in general slowing down my work as well as constantly doubting if I am doing a good enough work – with my uni teachers constantly saying I’m behind on work. I guess my main problem is that I’m not employed in this company therefore I’m not taking orders from anyone – which I would much prefer – in fact it is quite the opposite I am interning in a management position (lean implementation for those who know what it is) and I am struggling to do the job everyday. I think the only reason I haven’t called in sick any day is because I’m living at my parents and I can’t just hide in my room. In general coming to work isn’t so bad because I end up interacting with people and slowly feeling better. Last week everyday I was better than the one before with me doing more stuff and getting more confident. Today it’s Monday and I’m back at doing stuff extremely slowly again. 

I guess the main point is that since I failed uni before I'm extremely scared of failing again, but also somehow failing feels more real and familiar than succeeding. I feel like I'm used to sabotaging my own life and I don't know how to get past it.

I’d like the scenario to be something like this:

I’m a university student, it’s my first year and you’re my incredibly attractive and hot professor. One day I split up with my bf and decide to drown my sorrows. Sure, we’d done some sexual things but we had never got round to having sex yet. Part of me was apprehensive about having sex because I was a virgin, but none of that mattered now that we had broken up.

That same evening, I decide to go out alone to a bar and drown my sorrows and lo and behold, you were there too. You spot me and decide to come over, we talk, we laugh, we flirt, I get more tipsy than I anticipated and before I know it, you're telling me I need a woman who'll treat me right and give me the best sex I could ever experience. Eventually, we end up back at yours or a hotel.. You end up taking my virginity and I let you. We don’t stop seeing each other after that though, we continue and our sexual relationship grows into a more kinky one.

I know this is a brief scenario but I’m sure you get the picture, if you don’t like the sound of professor and student, I’m also open to the idea of being an intern and you’re my boss.

I’m only open to women for this roleplay. If you see this post and it's already been up a few hours, please don't hesitate to message me!

My kinks include: risky and public sex, choking, spanking, slapping, hair pulling, light bondage, name calling, oral (giving and receiving), strap-ons, nipple play, etc.

My limits are: blood, gore, scat, watersports.

I hope to see some orange envelopes soon!"

I'm in my last year of school, and I've been studying RT since 2016. I switched to RT after studying two years of Music Therapy (which is my true passion, but I had to quit due to medical reasons), but after all my research and after talking to a few RT professionals, I'm having my doubts about getting certified. 

I love the field, and I love the impact it has on individuals, but seeing how little progression one can make as a CTRS is kind of disheartening. I really want to get my Master's in SLP so I can combine Speech Therapy and Music Therapy, but I would have to switch my major to Pre-RT if I wanted to graduate in time to take the prereqs and apply for the program. The only downside to that is I won't be able to take the full time internship, thus rendering me ineligible to sit for the exam, which worries me because what if I miss out on job opportunities that only a CTRS would get? I feel as if I'll miss out on the doors the cert would open for me, but I'm also unsure there are that many doors in this field to begin with...

My question is, is it worth it to get my cert to become a CTRS if I plan on going into SLP? Or am I better off skipping it altogether if it means I get to take prereqs and apply to grad school in a timely manner?

Thank you for your help!

So I have two BAs in humanities.  No internship experience or experience of any kind related to those degrees.
  
I was fortunate enough to get an entry-level administrative job with a local software company right out of college.  Over the last 7 years, I have established myself at this company, expanded my role, and make a comfortable salary which is, in my opinion, overpaid ($75k/year).  For some perspective, the median listing price for homes in my county is $615,000.00, so although I make a nice salary, I'm not exactly Scrooge McDuck-ing it in this area.
  
I don't enjoy what I do.  It's a reliable and comfortable paycheck, but I honestly feel like it's draining life out of me.  I look to the future and see nowhere to go - I have no marketable skills, no specialty knowledge, and worst of all, no interests.  I don't have a dream field, a dream job, a life goal, anything.
  
This feels scary and urgent.  I need to find and develop something that will ensure a future.  I am about a year out from paying off my remaining student loan debt, and considering going back to school to try and ""do it right"" this time.  However, every time I start to look into it, it just feels the same as the first time - I don't like anything or care about anything, so just pick something.  I don't want to waste money again on something that will be useless other than to say yes, I have a degree.  As we (or at least I) have learned, a basic BA doesn't mean a thing anymore.

aid56w,6,2019-01-21,Looking for advice: Thinking of enrolling into Technical Writing certificate program but unsure of program's merits/ability to help career growth.,NeglectedBurrito,technicalwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/aid56w/looking_for_advice_thinking_of_enrolling_into/,"To cut to the chase, there is a local community college offering a 15-week online Technical Writing Certificate Program ([Link to class info](https://www.campusce.net/bc/course/course.aspx?C=13637&amp;pc=1820&amp;mc=&amp;sc=)) for $1,500. Due to my background in writing and interest in technology (see education/career background below for more), I figure this may be something for me.

Is there any particular things I should look for in order to decide if this specific program merits the financial and time commitment required while I continue working 40 hours per week? Perhaps if the professor or program itself has any sort of accreditation(s)/certification?

Also, I realize this is likely a significant ""Your mileage may vary"" scenario, but has anyone here enrolled in and completed any sort of similar online certification program for Technical Writing? If so, did you find it helpful in any way towards career growth and worth your time and money? That's probably more broad of a question that I intended while creating this post but I am  ultimately interested in anyone's experiences, guidance, and advice on this topic if that makes sense.

I suppose a little bit of background is necessary for the nature of this question but I'll try to keep it relatively brief.

Roughly five years ago I graduated from a four-year university with a Bachelor's degree in Communication emphasizing on Journalism and Media Production. I served as a reporter for the school paper at this university and also at a community college prior to that. Immediately after college I worked at a newspaper for a year while simultaneously completing a paid internship revolving around public relations. Some soul-searching, life experiences, and whatnot got me to the point where I ultimately realized that this wasn't necessarily the path I wanted to continue following for a multitude of reasons that are probably not important to delve into at this time.

The past two and a half years have been spent doing a couple Tier 1 technical and administrative support jobs at a major corporation but it's contract work through another company with limited room for advancement and career growth. Employees looking for those opportunities here are likely better-off continuing (or beginning) their education elsewhere while working the full-time job. I am interested and passionate about technology but I wouldn't necessarily say I'm well-versed in that field.

Currently I'm at the point where I realize my degree isn't serving me well (I'm not free of blame for that) and I need to further my education one way or another in order to achieve a more fulfilling career. I have researched and attended info-sessions for a variety of options stemming from radiation technology to IT and network security.

While this lengthy post won't reflect it, the last few years of writing at tech jobs now have me more geared towards the Technical Writing style and shook the AP style out of me a bit. I feel that may have provided me at least a slight head-start in Technical Writing in the sense that I may be able to adapt to the style of writing faster than I would fresh out of college where I had to write like a reporter.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have 2 situations that came about, one was about 6 months ago and the other was about a week ago and they both have the same base from 2 different people.

Let it be known that having kids is not a 10, 20 or 30 year commitment but a lifetime.  Sure it's nice to think that after a couple of decades those wee hellions will have made their way into adulthood then you simply wave as they depart on their journey through life.

Leaving you to enjoy the fruits of your labors.

Wrong.

Case 1.

My wife and I were going away for a few days and we like someone to stay at our house with our dogs.  Not just pop in but stay at the house (hey its a nice adult house, hot tub, wifi, xbox untouched by germy hands)...

So we had the daughter of a friend want to stay and take care of our dogs for us and we would pay.  My wife, hyper organized as she is, arranged this a couple of months before our planned departure.

About 2 weeks before departure she calls the daughter (who is 24 I will say and working on her masters in accounting, but lives at home with mum), to check to see if everything is OK.

Oh yeah...No..sorry.  I am babysitting my father's dogs that weekend.

And you didn't call to tell us?  We would have been stuck with airline tickets we couldnt use...

Yeah.  Oh well.

To which my wife, not happy, told her that it was disrespectful and we really were disappointed in her.  (Please note the Scot in me would have had ample 4 letter words for this 'woman', but my wife kept it VERY civil).

She need not have bothered keeping it civil because Mom, a 55+ year old woman, started texting my wife and telling her how abusive she was towards her daughter.

Seriously.  It's now abusive, even to 20-somethings, that you have the expectation that they fulfill obligations that they have agreed to.  What has this world come to I say.

I hate to think what will happen when daughter goes out to work and gets a bad review at work or her boss says something negative...

Here Comes screaming mom...Its sad because this mom used to be our friend and we have some social circles but she treated us like we owed her money after that little incident.  Now we don't talk AT ALL.

Case 2:

A week or so ago talking to a friend who is in town for a month on a job internship.  Her daughter is 23 and staying back at the house on the other side of the country looking after the dogs etc.

Mother tells daughter that she has to drive to the bank and take out money to buy groceries.  Mom even plots out an 'easy' route for the daughter to do these chores.

Daughter flips out because she doesn't want to.  She gets uneasy driving, afraid to make left turns, and doesn't want to go into public.

\*blink\*

Mom and daughter go into fight mode over all this because daughter is actually going to go live in Korea for a year in about 9 months from now.

How the hell is Flakey McShakesalot ever going to survive IN KOREA if she can't even handle going to the bank and grocery store in her hometown (and its not a big home town).

I guess the whole idea of this exceedingly long post is that because we have a whole generation of helicopter parents that have wrapped their progeny in bubble wrap for so long and buffered them completely from life that anything that is even remotely uncomfortable for them is enough to make them fall apart in hysterics.

Because of this helicoptering all these kids remain as kids and become broken adults that are ill equipped to handle even the slight rigors of being an adult.

aiez5a,2,2019-01-21,Am I[25M] wrong for feeling left out?,redbatata,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aiez5a/am_i25m_wrong_for_feeling_left_out/,"I'll try my best to make it as short as possible

So, me and my gf(24F) have been dating for 2ish years, have had pretty mild discussions about mundane stuff but overall we are in great terms always. We both live in our parents home(I'm a intern on a company and she didn't got work since finishing college few months ago) and we see each other once or twice a week.

So, my family enjoys taking vacations and we go on one at least once per year(they pay for everyone here, which are 5 people) and mid december they did book a trip to the beach, and I asked if my GF would fit in our hotel rooms. They said that yes, but she would need to pay for her own flight tickets. I asked her and talked about that and she couldn't afford(and me neither, but I would happly be able to cash 50% of the ticket, about 80 dollars, if she could pay the rest).

So she couldn't make it and last week I went with my parents and brothers in this vacation, and mid vacation she said to me that her parents offered to pay for her to go with them in a car trip to a nearby city(2 hours drive), and told me that her sister and BF that were arranging and that was it. I said that was nice for her to go since she couldn't make it with me, and I thought that was going to be the end of this talk.

Yesterday I had got home from the airport and was feeling good and asked her out. Mid date we were laying down in a park with out phones out in the picnic cloth that we were sitting and her phone started buzzing by my side, I just glanced over and saw notifications from a whatsapp group recently made.

The group name was ""vacation + city name"" and who was talking was her brothers fiancee, and said about adding ""her side"" people to the group, I asked her whoelse was going and she said that her brothers(2) and her sisters(3) were invited but not all were going. And also there was some couple that she didn't know who was.

So after seeing that everyone that was invited was going with their SO I felt kinda left out, and said it to her. She said that she didn't know that they were going and just found out, which I find hard to belive since they were making plans about this trip for a whole week and her sister that was planning lives with her too.

Another detail is that her parents are paying for her, but I would pay(no problem at all) for a room that we both could stay, but since its kinda close to the date the hotel have no more rooms avaliable, and even if I wanted to get a room I couldn't.

So, am I wrong for feeling that she kinda didn't invite me on purpose?

After I mention how I felt she got really defensive and kept saying that she didn't know if I would want to go since I just got from another trip, and that I would need to pay. But how could she know without even asking me?

And to finish she went to talk with her mother and now everyone on the trip is trying to change stuff so I can go, trying to accommodate me on her parents room, which I have no desire to do since it would be really awkward. Now her sister is texting me saying its all ok and got me somewhere to stay, but I don't really wanna go now.

TL;DR: My GF didn't bother asking if I would like to join a trip with her even with her brothers and sisters also taking their SO there, and now her family is texting me asking to go"

I will receive a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Business Administration. The cost of all that will be $53,176. 

I have an internship that will begin starting late this May and last all the way to end of May 2020. It will pay $16/hour; full time hours during summer and part time (around 20 or 25) during school year. 

In order for me to graduate at that time frame, I need to take three extra courses during summer and/or winter, which I plan on doing at a community college to transfer in. 

Besides taking the extra courses so I don’t have to go for extra year and owe over ten thousand more, what else can I do to lower the debt? I live at home, use my dad’s car and I spend $200-250 a month for food, gas, phone and entertainment.

Maybe you’re a married woman, and have been for a while now. You no longer have that spark from the honeymoon phase, whether you’ve been married for ten years or twenty. You used to be very careful about keeping up appearances, going to the gym, shaving your body, and more. But now, things have quieted down on that front.

Or maybe you have never been married. You like to enjoy yourself with as many men that you choose. Tying yourself down to one guy was never in your plan and that is perfectly fine with everyone ;)

Regardless of the type of life you lead, you have somehow found me. I’m young and handsome, and in many ways I am exactly the kind of young guy you've been looking for. Not surprising, I'm instantly turned on by a sexy older woman like you. Maybe you see me at the gym and catch me sneaking glances at your ass. You think it sags a bit, and you know you have cellulite on your thighs, but I still keep on checking you out. Little do you know that I’m sneaking into your locker after you leave and smelling your used gym shorts, the smell of your sweat and natural odor combined with your hairy pussy giving me an instant hardon.

Or perhaps I’m an intern at your firm, and you realize that I keep on coming into your office to get different forms because you have to lean down to grab them from a drawer, giving me an eyeful of your cleavage. Your tits sag after three kids, but you realize that that turns me on.

Maybe your an average looking milf. That means cellulite, sagging tits, an ass that had dropped a little, a wildly hairy pussy, and more. Or maybe your a pornstar-type bimbo, hotter than anyone else in town! I’m open to most kinks so I’ll just put my limits, which are death, scat, gore, and vomit. As to kinks, why don’t you include those in your message, and we can work out a story."
aihrze,1,2019-01-21,New intern is perpetually trying to one-up me and it’s starting to really piss me off. What should I do?,ProximityProdigy,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/aihrze/new_intern_is_perpetually_trying_to_oneup_me_and/,"Let me start by saying I myself am an intern myself, but someone else hired who graduates much sooner than me but isn’t Let me start by saying I myself am an intern, but someone else who was recently hired and graduates much sooner than me has made practically every attempt to not only ride my coat tails, but likewise is constantly trying to one-up me in practically everything I do at work.

For example, If I go speak to our boss about something specific to me he just has to too. Which probably baffles me the most. 

When I mentioned a new software I would like to learn more about, suddenly he’s been reading up on said program and is also interested in upping his licensure. 

After I curated some of the best notes from an important meeting, updating the proforma for the entire firm, he just had to further tweak and ultimately implement his version (a hybrid of mine) to our boss. 

It’s literally to the point where I cannot get up out of my seat without him wondering over to where I am, to dissect what I am doing. Who I am talking to, and What’s next for me. I am literally rethinking working for this company post graduation if I have to deal with this for the time being. Mind you, he’s much further ahead in his studies and completely clueless about most happenings at work. 

What causes a person to act like this? Or am I overreacting? It seems as though I am laying the foundation based on my own merit for someone to just come behind me after all my hard work and original thought for them to take all of the credit. 

Any advice?

I don't know whether it was because of my high school ex taking my all and it not being enough, or my overconfidence at my first internship, but I was a toxic, un-caring, emotionless, (I'm going to say borderline because it'll make me feel a little better, but it probably wasn't borderline) borderline emotionally abusive to my best-friend-turned-girlfriend.  It was fine in the beginning, it was wonderful in the beginning, but then summer started, we went semi-long distance, and things started to go down hill.  I stopped listening as intently as I like to, I stopped giving anything, I stopped compromising.  I communicated too much my problems with her, probably because I have been told time and time again that communication of issues keeps a relationship and I have a tendency to take advice way, way too far, while she communicated very little of her problems with me, probably because they grew so slowly neither of us noticed them.  I criticized everything about her, but the worst was when I got mad at her snoring.  Oh, yeah, that's another thing, I have anger issues I didn't know about until about a week ago.  Just throwing it out there, because for the first fifteen years of my life, I _actually_ didn't get angry.  I was super depressed and anxious, but never got mad.  I realize now that as soon as my depression began to lessen, that void got filled with all the repressed rage I had been keeping in, and it took me six fucking years to figure that out.  Anyway, I got mad at her snoring, because I thought it was what was keeping me awake, and she ended up looking at surgeries or someat while having a mental breakdown because I did...I didn't know this for a while, but knowing how anxious she gets, I really should have assumed as such.  I was the one that broke our relationship off.  Reasons being I put a lot of the shit I was putting her through on myself (blaming her for things that were my fault).  I was a generally shit person, and I likely forgot a whole lot that can be clarified upon more specific request.  And now, because I realize how shit of a person I have been, I feel myself falling back into a depression I haven't felt since middle school.  The kind of despair you can only understand if you are feeling it or have felt it recently.  Due to this, I have been somewhat avoiding talking to my friends, both because she is also friends with all of my friends, and I don't want to make them choose between us because that is unreasonable, but mostly because half the time all I can think about is her, how bad I fucked up, how much I want to fix this and have another chance, how much I cannot subject her to me again because I don't trust myself to change my ways, how badly I don't want to subject _others_ to me because I don't trust myself to change my ways, and it is sometimes all I can talk about.  I have talked about it a lot with my friends, but I really don't want to annoy them any more than I have, especially because a lot of my complaining can be accusatory, because of course I have to accuse one of them of getting in with her after promising me he wouldn't, because they are good friends and are spending a lot of time together (I mean, it also just feels like they are both replacing me with each other, because they are doing what I did with my ex that I lost, and this friend and I were real close last semester).  I'm starting to go to a therapist, but because I've only had a precursory meeting with them, it hasn't started to help yet, lol, but I'm hoping.  So I'm just basically sitting here trying to forget all my anxiety about everything about this, because I know I shouldn't be suspectory or anxious or whathaveyou, because I'm good friends with all these people, and they have not broken my trust.  I don't know if I want advice, but if you have some that you think will really help me, please give it, because I'm getting desperate for anything that will make me feel even a little better and let me do my schoolwork, because that hasn't been happening for a while either.  I dunno, I just really needed to talk, and my parents (the only ones I feel comfortable talking to about this) are long asleep, and it is a work night for them, so I don't want to bother them, so thank you for reading.

Edit: I know I deserve to feel this way.  The way that I treated her is inexcusable."

ailjsm,320,2019-01-22,“But snakes are his favourite animals!”,JumpingShinyFrogs,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/ailjsm/but_snakes_are_his_favourite_animals/,"This is my first post, and I’m on mobile, so if I’ve done something wrong I apologise. This is kind of long since I tend to ramble, but there’s a TL;DR at the end for anyone who doesn’t want to sift through it.

I spent a few weeks interning at an aquarium, helping out in the reptile section. Every day there would be a talk session, where two reptiles would be brought out and used to give a talk on general reptile facts. At the end of the talk, the audience would be allowed to pet the animals if they wanted. However, there were rules in place to avoid stressing the animals out, and no one except the staff were allowed to hold the animals.

One day, I was watching the talk session to learn about how it’s done, but I had the honour of holding the reptile. The first animal was a royal python who had a little bit of a temper—she’d get hissy and strike-y if she was upset (she was a relatively new addition, so she was still a bit huffy and not fully used to being handled yet), so it was very important that audience members followed the rules with her. When it came time to offer the audience the chance to pet her, I explained to them that they had to pet her on her back, in the direction of nose to tail, and that they weren’t allowed to touch her head.

Most of the audience stroked her, made the usual comments about how nice her scales felt, all pretty good. But there was one kid, he was like 9, who asked me if he could “boop her snoot”. I thought it was pretty cute that the kid knew about snake memes, but I told him he couldn’t touch her head because it would frighten her and she might get upset. The kid nodded, and pet the snake, and seemed happy. But his mom sure didn’t.

She started asking why her son couldn’t pet the snake’s head, and why I was stopping him from playing with the snake, and snakes are his favourite animals and all this. I was just an intern, so I kinda got freaked out and didn’t know what to do. So the other staff member came over to explain to her that this snake was quite skittish and that she might strike if she got scared. Then the mom started up with some spiel about how her son wanted a snake but they were too expensive to buy, and frozen mice are gross, and he just wanted to pet her nose, was that really too much to ask?

The kid seemed totally fine getting to stroke the snake’s back, so I have no idea why she was making such a big fuss about it. I carried on letting the rest of the audience pet the snake while the mother argued with the other staff member. I didn’t hear most of the rest of what they said because I was too busy showing the python to other people, but the other staff member shut her up by telling her that touching the snake’s head might provoke a bite. All seemed to be ok.

Next animal was a bearded dragon, and I had him sitting on my arm held close to my chest so he wouldn’t try to jump and run away (he wasn’t that skittish but you can’t be too careful). After the talk, I showed everyone the bearded dragon, and the same rules applied: stroke on the back, in the direction of nose to tail, don’t touch the head, don’t grab the tail. Simple. When it was the kid from before’s turn, he pet the bearded dragon and made a comment about how cool the spikes were, and didn’t ask for anything. I thought that meant we were all good, but apparently Entitled Mother wasn’t done with us yet.

She demanded we let her son hold the bearded dragon, and once again the senior staff member had to come over and explain why the audience couldn’t hold the reptiles. The mother was throwing up a huge fit about how all the posters saying you could touch the animals were false advertising if you couldn’t hold them. Even though the posters literally just said you could touch them and see them up close, not hold them. The rest of the audience kind of shuffled away since the talk was over (or maybe because it was too awkward for them), leaving just this lady and her son, who looked a bit embarrassed.

He tried to tell his mom that he didn’t need to hold the bearded dragon, and that he wanted to go see the shark feeding, but I don’t really think she was listening. I went to put the beardie back in his tank, and by the time I came back the lady was gone. I didn’t see her at all for the rest of the day since I was working in the back, but I couldn’t help but wonder if she went off at the shark feeding talk because her son wasn’t allowed to feed the sharks himself!

TL;DR Lady demands her son be allowed to break the rules at a reptile talk, even though her son looks perfectly happy following the rules."

aim7x5,4,2019-01-22,Controlling Difficult Family of my SO: long read but advice needed,channabatura,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/aim7x5/controlling_difficult_family_of_my_so_long_read/,"FMIL: Future mother in law 

SO: Significant other 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 years old, have been dating my SO (25) for three years now.

Up until October 2018 our relationship had been going really great. I had moved to London for a new job which also brought me closer to him and I live in a flat 5 minutes away from him, which is also a good distance to my work.

FMIL has known about me for about 1 and half years now and I have only met her once. SO has met my mum and dad about 4-5 times. We are Indian and so meeting each others parents is quite a big deal and I hold more significance over it than he does.

SO has a brother (same age as me) who recently, in December 2018, (after years of being fine and nice to me) lost the plot and started threatening me (I'll kick her face in etc) and messaging me horrible things all because of a couple things I said about his parents 2 years ago which came to the surface after I refused to go get him a burger (long story).

2 years ago I was frustrated that my SO wasn't being open with me about his feelings, and so I messaged his brother (we talked weekly back then) and asked why this might be. I suggested that maybe he was not being open because their parents are not very affectionate (dad forgets my bfs birthdays and FMIL doesn't say love you etc). The brother didn't like this, said I have stuff against his parents and said I was making my SO feel like he comes from a dysfunctional family. This was never my intention and so I apologised and we left it at that. My SO also spoke to me about it and we cleared it all up.

Fast forward to October 2018, and I am complaining to my SO that I've never met his parents and hes met mine. They know I exist, my name, they ask their sons about me (job, family, education) but never wanted to meet me (my SO said they lead very busy lives). FMIL would even send leftover cakes and sweet treats she had made with my SO when he came to see me but has never thought to invite me over for dinner. My SO even asked a couple times if I could come over for dinner and FMIL would say 'let me check my diary'.

I ask my SO to arrange a dinner for us to all meet like I did when he met my parents. So he asks FMIL and she says why doesn't she just pop over on this day. So we agree and that very same day FMIL says shes busy and can't meet me. I let it go because these things happen.

I try meet FMIL again, we have even agreed on a time. I head over there with my SO and he gets a message from her saying ' lets leave today', no explanation as to why. I end up just dropping him off whilst FMIL peers out from behind he bedroom curtain at me (infuriating). A couple days later my SO gets sent round with some orchids and a card from FMIL apologising to me, but still no explanation.

Then comes the huge explosion of his brother about the whole burger gate incident who brings up what I said two years ago. He threatens to tell FMIL so I said go ahead, I haven't done anything that bad and they will be more angry at you for threatening me multiple times and also threatening my SO. Turns out his parents are more angry at what I said then they are at their own son threatening someone. He has not been punished in any way or even been told to apologise to me. Since that day in December we haven't spoken or seen each other. The weekend after this all went down was the weekend that I was supposed to try meet them for the third time. They said that after they heard what I had said about them, they didn't want to meet me. My SO also gets grounded (hes 25 guys) because he was being selfish not getting his brother that stupid burger and also because he doesn't have a proper job only an internship, and gets told he can only see me once a week (we lived like this for around 3 months last year after my SO didn't get the grade his parents wanted him to get in his masters, I thought all of that crap was behind us) . The brother goes scot-free on holiday with his SO (who is also a nutter and started sending rude messages to my bf the night it all went to crap).

That weekend after the incident I end up meeting them (the brother is on his holiday) after my SO pestering them. I decide not to bring any of the events up and just simply apologise once for what I said in the past and just act normal as I didn't want them to to get an even worse impression of me and think I just came over to argue about their threatening son. So I apologise and FMIL tells me not to as her son was in the wrong (finally shes seen the light). The meeting goes well and FMIL even gives me a Christmas present. I think that's finally it, they like me, everything has worked out apart from his brother who I don't intend on speaking to until he apologises or at least admits to my face that he was wrong.

I go away on holiday for a couple weeks and come back first week of Jan, excited to have my SO stay over for the night at mine. He tells FMIL this and she says no you are still grounded (WTF?!?!). Up until now it sounds like my SO just does whatever his mum wants and she controls him and to an extent she does, but he also does fight for us but he just gets shot down. I think FMIL is toxic, uses his past failings (in education) and that fact that he only has an internship as a way of making him feel bad to manipulate him to staying at home doing tasks (the brother does none) for her instead of spending time with me or even going out with his friends.

My SO is suffering so much right now, with the stress of trying to find a graduate job after he finished his masters last year and also being stuck in the middle between me and FMIL. I've made it clear to him so many times that all I want is for us all to get along, but without his brother apologising and FMIL giving his some freedom to be with me that we wont work because I will end up hating/resenting his family.

FMIL has also told him that she doesn't want me and her to have a bad relationship like she has with her MIL but yet she cant make any time for me or allow her son to stay the night with me (which she knows he did pretty much every night of final year at uni). The brother can go on holiday and stay in hotels in the city with his SO even though they are my age and that's fine.

I've asked my SO to invite her to come out for lunch with his on birthday which is tomorrow as I thought it would be a good way to get to know each other and she would be free as its a weekday and she's currently not working. FMIL said that she would have to check her diary (how busy can you really be) . From my holidays I even brought a present back for FMIL and have been trying to give it to give it to her for the past three weeks (she knows this) and yet she cant even just tell my SO to tell me to come over when she knows she will be at home. I ended up just giving it to my SO to give to her and I just got a thanks in return.

I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want a future where I still have to be dealing with this toxic negative dysfunctional family but I also don't want to not have any ties with them for the sake of my SO.

Although I am only 23, we are quite serious and I know that he is the one for me and we both want a future together.

My friends (they love him) are telling me to just focus on the two of us and ignore them, but I can't do that as I know he will still feel the strain and family means too much to me. His family are saying that I control him and he needs to learn to say no to me. I am quite a strong confident person and from meeting me that one time FMIL knows this and I think she is threatened/feels jealous that there is another women in her sons life and that her control on him is faltering. FMIL has a tight grip on him because she has no control over her other son whatsoever. They can't even get his brother to apologise to me and I know that they haven't even told him to which is insane. I even wrote the brother a fairly nice email the day after it all went down apologising again for what I said two years ago and also telling him that I understand to an extent why he was pissed off. I said that I didn't want to argue with him and that I hope one day he will realise he was wrong and that we can be amicable. No reply, my SO got told that my email made his brother even more pissed off (no way to win with this one).

SO obviously knows that this is wrong and its out of order and that his brother should apologise to me but yet he wont do anything about it because hes scared of losing his family. He has asked his parents multiple times what they are going to do about it and they just said that they will speak to his brother.

In an ideal world, his brother would apologise, FMIL would invite me over for dinner at least once a month since she knows I live alone and just 5 minutes down the road and she would be fine with her grown adult son staying over at mine once a week and seeing me whenever he wanted.

But this isn't the case and I need advice on what to do next.

I do not want his family to be the reason why we break up, but the longer we ignore the fact that his family are just f'd up the more strain it has on us.

Recently I can't help but make small comments about his brother and FMIL which obviously he gets annoyed about and then we start arguing about it all over again. I am hurt that I am being treated this way when I really didn't do anything so bad, not anything to justify the way they treat me at all.

My family love my SO and they all know that he is different to them and he wouldn't hurt a fly. But his family have this control over him that he is scared to fight against because of the consequences (getting kicked out or financially cut off etc)

Do I just call it a day and accept the fact that I will never had a good relationship with his parents or any relationship at all, possibly making my SO feel worse but making myself feel better?

Or do I keep trying to get through to them in the hopes of us getting along to lessen the strain and stress of it all on my SO but possibly making me not like them more if they keep rejecting me?

Sorry for the long post, just thought it was better to explain most of it to get the full picture.

This is also my first time using reddit!

Any advice is kindly appreciated xx"
aimkqh,3,2019-01-22,After a lengthy sick leave i am about to head out into the professional world again. I have a meeting with my doctor and my country's general insurance system to figure out what kind of help i need. What do you think is important i should know before this meeting?,jingjang1,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/aimkqh/after_a_lengthy_sick_leave_i_am_about_to_head_out/,"This is not my first rodeo, last time they where able to give me financial support in the way that they pay my employer part of my salary. This is something i will ask for since it will be so much easier to find a job that i want, they also recommend that i start off with a internship/work training period. I feel like a real employment is better, even though an internship would put much less pressure on me, not sure on this one.

&amp;#x200B;

a couple of years ago i started a course to become a machinist, to become a excavator driver. It was during the course i had an episode, first a hypomanic episode, turning into mania. I panicked and numbed myself with cannabis for the last month or so, and managed to finish the course. It was when i finally finished i let go and went full crazy mode and sought help, to be able to finish. I feel like it would be a huge waste not going into this profession, even though its a new line of work which brings more stress. It\`s a good job, with good pay.

&amp;#x200B;

I could tell you a whole story about that place, it was not a pleasant experience for anyone attending that school for many reasons. And for me it was hell at the end, where one of the teachers actually, legit, tortured me. I had myself to partly blame since i was manic and put fuel into the battle between us during that state of mind, even though i was not able to control my behavior. But that man was evil, and used his power over me to give me hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, i have left all that behind me. Time to look forward.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to prepare myself best i can before the meeting, i am not sure what they have to offer. I live in Sweden, and i have my rights, which has been hard to obtain in the first place. I want to fully use the support system we have.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think i should know before the meeting?"

aimwre,11,2019-01-22,"AITA for dropping a friend who read my messages to her boyfriend (her bf and I were planning a surprise for her. Also, not the first time she read our messages)",[deleted],AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aimwre/aita_for_dropping_a_friend_who_read_my_messages/,"Sorry for the confusing title!

Some background. X is a friend i've gotten close to over the years. We never really had a lot in common, but around 5 years ago we found ourselves in the same friend group which consisted of us, her then BF, and another girl. She then had a falling out with the other girl over her then boyfriend. The guy is close friends with the girl and X got insanely jealous. Friend group split up and altho I was always the odd one out, for some reason I found myself with X and her then BF. 

Flash forward a couple years, X broke up with her boyfriend. She would often talk to me about it and I would comfort her. She and I had similar issues but due to the help of my therapist and church, I was able to outgrow some of mine and therefore I wanted to help her grow too. (im sorry if this part sounds conceited  😔) Said issues are jealous tendencies, lack of taking responsibility over actions and just plain anger issues. It didnt help that both our past relationships were very toxic (mine ended a year before hers did). I'm always transparent towards her, and would often point out her mistakes and suggest ways she can improve. Im very careful not to project my past on her as well. Anyway I held her hand over her breakup and because of this, she's declared me her #1 best friend. 

Couple months after the breakup she meets a guy and he treats her very well. I've only met the guy two times (once during a dinner out and the other during my birthday) and both times she was there and I had a date along. Guy is very nice and I get the sense she abuses his kindness a little, she's always had a princess complex, and at the times she complains to me about the guy not doing stuff for her, I'd point out that she should put herself in the guy's shoes. An example is she once got angry when he doesn't drop by her place to visit her cause he needs to spend time with his family. There are more stuff she does that I dont agree with but I wont mention them cause I think it's more about a difference in values. 

Her boyfriend then goes abroad for a couple months for an internship. During this time, he messages me privately a couple of times. Reason is because he's asking for help regarding X because she wants to break up or something. I'd try to mediate as well as I could but most often i tell them to fix their own stuff. I then learned that X would open her bf's account and read our messages. I have nothing to hide so i'm not really afraid, but I talked to her how I think it's an invasion of privacy on my part and I would appreciate if she doesn't do it again. She apologized and promised not to.

Her BF then messages me saying he'll be home a couple days earlier than what he told X and was asking for help to surprise her. I happily agreed and we came up with a plan. I then learned that X has been spying on our conversations still and ruined her own surprise for her. It was kind of the last straw so I decided to finally end my friendship with her.

I know it seems a bit petty but I realized we had so many differences and I was at the point of my life where I wanted positive people in my life. We've been friends for a good number of years and it was always the same emotionally draining shit. She called me once during a date freaking out about a pregnancy scare. She would call at weird hours of the night crying and freaking out and although i would do my best to support her, it was just so draining. I always felt that I had to drop everything to cater to her anxiety, her loneliness, or whatever issue she has. 

Sorry its so long, just need to get it off my chest. 
Have to clear up that there is absolutely nothing between me and her guy. Im in a very happy and secure relationship atm.

TLDR; I dropped my close friend after she kept reading chats between me and her boyfriend, which eventually ruined a surprise the BF and I were planning for her. "

I plan to trade in my current car but don’t plan to get much (2002 Mazda protege with 135,000 miles). I also plan to put $1,500 down and finance for 4 years.

I just want some opinions on whether or not this is a good decision. I’m 23 yo, was in an intern position but was recently promoted to my full time staff position that pays 57k annually. I have about 26k in student loans, but the rest of my expenses are pretty low (currently pay around $450 but expect it to go up to $650 in the next 6 months).

I’d really appreciate any advice, thanks!

Edit 2: Already budgeted and received an insurance quote. Included retirement and emergency fund. Still have income after to reallocate afterwards/put to savings

Last Edit: Thanks to everyone who responded. I ended up buying at $15.6k out the door. For those that don’t know, that’s about $3k bellow KBBs fair price, so really feel that I couldn’t pass on it. "

Zaken en Werkgelegenheid over fouten bij keuring van zieke jongeren  
&amp;#40;ingezonden 16 januari 2019&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1.        
Kent u het bericht ‘fouten bij keuring zieke jongeren’ waaruit blijkt dat  
de beoordeling van een op de vijf jonggehandicapten verkeerd is? 1&amp;#41; Wat is  
uw reactie hierop?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1.  
Ik ken het bericht. Hieruit trek ik overigens niet de conclusie dat de  
beoordeling van 1 op de 5 jonggehandicapten verkeerd is, maar dat in 2016  
in 1 op de 5 gevallen de rechtmatigheid van de beslissing niet gegarandeerd  
was. Natuurlijk vind ik dat ernstig. Tegelijk zie ik hier de waarde bewezen  
van het interne proces van kwaliteitsborging dat UWV heeft ingeregeld. UWV  
heeft deze ernstige tekortkoming in het proces onderkend en  
verbetermaatregelen ingezet.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2.             
Onderschrijft u dat het onacceptabel is dat 33% van de jonggehandicapten  
geen Wajong-uitkering krijgt hoewel hij of zij blijvend arbeidsongeschikt  
is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2.  
In het bewuste artikel wordt gesteld dat 33% van de gevallen die UWV heeft  
onderzocht ten onrechte geen Wajong-uitkering is toegekend. Dat is onjuist.  
Het rapport waarnaar wordt verwezen geeft aan dat in 6% van de afgewezen  
Wajongaanvragen de kans bestaat dat dit onterecht was. De algemene  
conclusie van het rapport luidde dat in 20% van de onderzochte gevallen een  
risico bestaat op een onjuiste beoordeling. Dat vind ik en met mij UWV,  
inderdaad niet acceptabel.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3.          
Hoe gaat u zorgen dat het werk van arbeidsdeskundigen de toets der kritiek  
kan doorstaan, nu uit het onderzoek blijkt dat slechts zeven procent van de  
arbeidsdeskundige beoordelingen een voldoende scoort?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3.  
Uit de analyse van de bevindingen van het kwaliteitsonderzoek uit 2016 op  
basis van rapportages van de verzekeringsarts en/of arbeidsdeskundige kwam  
naar voren dat vooral de redeneerlijn op grond waarvan men komt tot  
oordeelsvorming, het gebruik van de juiste terminologie en daarmee de  
kwaliteit van de rapportages voor verbetering vatbaar was, met name bij de  
arbeidsdeskundigen. De rapportages moeten toetsbaar, inzichtelijk en  
reproduceerbaar zijn. Dit is door UWV opgepakt met gerichte bijscholing  
voor arbeidsdeskundigen waarin rapporteren centraal stond. Het onderwerp  
loopt sindsdien mee in de periodieke kwaliteitscontroles van de betrokken  
divisie. Hieruit blijkt dat UWV een verbetering in het professioneel  
handelen van genoemde beroepsgroepen heeft weten te realiseren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4.          
Waarom is het betreffende rapport niet naar de Kamer gestuurd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4.  
Binnen UWV worden, als onderdeel van de reguliere bedrijfsvoering,  
periodiek kwaliteitsonderzoeken verricht. Waar nodig, voert UWV  
verbeteracties uit. Daarmee geeft UWV blijk van de professionele  
taakopvatting die ik ook van de uitvoerder verwacht. UWV doet dat over de  
gehele linie van de taken die zij uitvoert en moet daarbij een eigen  
inschatting maken van de risico’s die zij daarbij aantreft.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het bewuste interne onderzoeksrapport is destijds niet ter informatie aan  
mij aangeboden. Dat laat onverlet dat mijn departement en UWV steeds in  
gesprek zijn over een goede balans tussen openheid over de lastige opgaven  
waar de uitvoering voor staat en de ruimte voor de uitvoering om te werken,  
te leren en te verbeteren. De Minister van Sociale Zaken en ikzelf pogen uw  
Kamer ook deelgenoot van te maken door halfjaarlijks een brief met daarin  
de ‘Stand van de uitvoering’ aan u te sturen &amp;#40;zie TK 246448-608&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5.            
Kunt u een overzicht geven van alle onderzoeken die de afdeling intern  
kwaliteitsonderzoek vanaf 2014 heeft uitgevoerd? Is in deze periode ook  
onderzoek gedaan naar de Wet werk en inkomen naar arbeidsvermogen &amp;#40;WIA&amp;#41;-  
keuring?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5.  
Zoals eerder toegelicht, zijn kwaliteitsonderzoeken van de afdeling  
Business Control en Kwaliteit onderdeel van het primaire proces van UWV. In  
dat licht acht ik het niet zinvol om alle interne kwaliteitsonderzoeken los  
van hun context in de externe verantwoording te brengen. De verantwoording  
aan de Minister en mijzelf als opdrachtgevers is via een andere lijn  
georganiseerd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
UWV is graag bereid een nadere toelichting te geven op de werking van het  
centrale kwaliteitsborgingsproces, de doorwerking naar de primaire  
processen en de interactie tussen kwaliteitsborging en externe  
verantwoording.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6.            
Hoe gaat u bevorderen dat de afdeling intern kwaliteitsonderzoek van het  
UWV haar kritische en onafhankelijke werk kan voortzetten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7.             
Kan de afdeling een onafhankelijke positie krijgen, zoals het Bureau  
Risicobeoordeling &amp; Onderzoek van de Nederlandse Voedsel- en  
Warenautoriteit &amp;#40;NVWA&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6 en 7.  
Ik heb geen aanwijzing dat de afdeling haar werk niet zou kunnen  
voortzetten, dan wel dat zij dat niet kritisch of onafhankelijk doet. Het  
rapport laat in mijn ogen juist zien dat de afdeling de ruimte heeft om  
onvolkomenheden in processen bloot te leggen. Ik zie daarom geen aanleiding  
tot nadere actie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8.             
Wat gaat u doen om te voorkomen dat geldgebrek de belemmerende factor is  
voor jonggehandicapten om in beroep te gaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8.  
De mogelijkheid van bezwaar en beroep zijn geregeld in de Algemene wet  
bestuursrecht. Het maken van bezwaar is kosteloos en vergt geen juridische  
bijstand. Het griffierecht voor een particulier voor het indienen van een  
beroepszaak bedraagt in 2019 €47. Ook het indienen en voeren van een  
beroepszaak vergt geen juridische bijstand. Zowel in bezwaar als in beroep  
kan men ervoor kiezen zich te laten vertegenwoordigen door een familielid  
of naaste. Het is gebruikelijk in het bestuursrecht dat de partij die in  
beroep in het ongelijk wordt gesteld, niet verantwoordelijk wordt gehouden  
voor de proceskosten van de wederpartij.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik zie geen aanleiding, noch mogelijkheden om de toegankelijkheid van  
bezwaar en beroep verder te vergroten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
9.           
Op welke manier gaat u ervoor zorgen dat de jonggehandicapten die ten  
onrechte geen uitkering krijgen, alsnog een uitkering ontvangen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 9.  
De rechtmatige verstrekking van uitkeringen op grond van alle  
materiewetten, waaronder de Wajong2015, is een van de wettelijke taken van  
UWV. Gesprekken over de scores op rechtmatigheid vinden plaats binnen de  
reguliere verantwoordingscyclus. De mensen bij wie een risico is  
geconstateerd op een onjuist proces, zijn opnieuw beoordeeld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast is de Wajong2015, met als belangrijk onderdeel de beoordeling van  
het recht, in 2019 onderwerp van evaluatie. De rapportage hiervan ontvangt  
uw Kamer met de integrale evaluatie van de Participatiewet eind 2019.

minister en de staatssecretaris van Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid over  
het bericht dat jonge gehandicapten geregeld geen uitkering krijgen terwijl  
ze er wel recht op hebben &amp;#40;ingezonden 8 januari 2019&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1.  
Kent u het artikel ‘Jonge gehandicapten krijgen geregeld geen uitkering  
terwijl ze er wel recht op hebben’?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1.  
Ja.  
   
2  
Wat vindt u ervan dat er in 21 procent van de onderzochte dossiers sprake  
was van een ‘onjuiste conclusie ten aanzien van het recht op een  
uitkering’?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2.  
In het artikel wordt verwezen naar een intern dossieronderzoek van UWV naar  
de ‘aanvraag beoordeling arbeidsvermogen’ uit september 2016. UWV toetst  
hiermee de kwaliteit van het professioneel handelen rondom de beoordeling  
Wajong2015. In het interne onderzoek wordt vastgesteld dat in 20 procent  
van de onderzochte gevallen een risico bestaat op een onjuiste uitkomst van  
de claimbeoordeling. Dat betekent dat de onderzoekers vanwege de kwaliteit  
van de onderbouwing &amp;#40;zoals opgenomen in de rapportages&amp;#41; niet hebben kunnen  
achterhalen of de uitkomst van de beoordeling correct is. Er kon dus niet  
met zekerheid gesteld worden dat er een onjuiste conclusie is getrokken.  
Desalniettemin waren de resultaten verontrustend. Dat concludeerde UWV  
destijds zelf ook, hetgeen heeft geleid tot een reeks aan  
verbetermaatregelen &amp;#40;zie verder&amp;#41;. UWV heeft mij laten weten dat de  
kwaliteit van dit proces sindsdien is verbeterd. In 2018 bestond in 7% van  
het aantal beoordelingen een risico op onrechtmatigheid en bleek hier in 1%  
van de gevallen ook sprake van te zijn. Ik vind het uiteraard een goede  
zaak dat kwaliteitstoetsing onderdeel is van het reguliere proces van UWV.  
Uit deze casus blijkt dat dergelijk dossieronderzoek bijdraagt aan  
kwaliteitsverbetering van de uitvoering door UWV.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3.  
Wat is volgens u de oorzaak van dit hoge percentage?  
&amp;nbsp;    
4.  
Hoe verklaart u de bedroevende kwaliteit van het handelen van de  
arbeidsdeskundigen &amp;#40;waarbij in slechts 7 procent van de gevallen het werk  
voldoende was&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3 en 4.  
Met de Wajong2015 is er een nieuwe systematiek t.b.v. de beoordeling van  
het recht op Wajong2015 geïntroduceerd. In dat licht is het aannemelijk dat  
een deel van de foutmarge toe te schrijven is aan de onbekendheid met de  
beoordeling en de bijbehorende processtappen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit het kwaliteitsonderzoek uit 2016 kwam naar voren dat vooral de  
redeneerlijn op grond waarvan men komt tot oordeelsvorming, het gebruik van  
de juiste terminologie en daarmee de kwaliteit van de rapportages voor  
verbetering vatbaar was, met name bij de arbeidsdeskundigen.  
De rapportages moeten toetsbaar, inzichtelijk en reproduceerbaar zijn. UWV  
heeft naar aanleiding van het rapport gerichte bijscholing voor  
arbeidsdeskundigen ingezet, waarbij rapporteren centraal stond. Het  
onderwerp loopt sindsdien mee in de periodieke kwaliteitscontroles van de  
betrokken divisie. Hieruit blijkt dat UWV een verbetering in het  
professioneel handelen van genoemde beroepsgroepen heeft weten te  
realiseren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5.  
Ligt de oorzaak mogelijk in het capaciteitstekort dan wel onvoldoende  
budget bij het UWV? Zo ja, welke maatregelen zijn hierop genomen of gaat u  
hierop nemen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5.  
UWV heeft de Participatiewet en de daaropvolgende aanpassingen  
geïmplementeerd in een periode waarin sprake was van een artsentekort en  
hoge druk op doorlooptijden. Medio 2015 is UWV overgegaan tot de invoering  
van een gecombineerde beoordeling arbeidsvermogen waarbij tegelijkertijd  
wordt beoordeeld of iemand in aanmerking komt voor een indicatie  
banenafspraak, beschut werk of – vanwege ontbreken van arbeidsvermogen -  
recht heeft op Wajong2015. Daarnaast is in die periode extra capaciteit  
geworven. Het kost de nodige tijd alvorens nieuwe medewerkers beschikken  
over voldoende kennis en ervaring opdoen met het verrichten van deze  
indiceringen en beoordelingen. Dat heeft impact op de kwaliteit van de  
dienstverlening gehad.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Inmiddels is de capaciteit voor het verrichten van de beoordeling  
arbeidsvermogen op peil, hetgeen ook is terug te zien in de  
rechtmatigheidscijfers &amp;#40;zie antwoord op vraag 2&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6.  
Wat is er gebeurd met de resultaten van het onderzoek? Welke actie is door  
het UWV ondernomen? Is er onderzoek gedaan naar de achtergronden en  
oorzaken van de slechte kwaliteit van de beoordelingen? Zo nee, bent u  
bereid dit alsnog te doen?  
   
Antwoord 6.  
De resultaten van het onderzoek zijn besproken met managers,  
stafmedewerkers en professionals, tot op casuïstiekniveau. Er zijn centraal  
maatregelen genomen zoals aanvullende opleiding, coaching en het opzetten  
van een kennisbank. Daarnaast is besloten om het onderwerp sinds najaar  
2016 te laten meelopen in de reguliere kwaliteitscontroles binnen de  
betreffende divisie. Per uitvoeringsdistrict is een plan van aanpak gemaakt  
waarin beschreven staat hoe de kwaliteit van de beoordelingen verbeterd  
wordt. De uitvoering daarvan wordt centraal gecoördineerd en gevolgd.  
Plannen van aanpak en de uitvoering daarvan worden periodiek bijgesteld.  
UWV meldt mij dat de kwaliteitsinvestering effect heeft. De kwaliteit van  
het handelen van de professionals is verbeterd. Uit de kwaliteitscontroles  
blijkt dat over 2018 het risico op een onjuiste uitkomst is gedaald naar  
7%, waarbij in 1% van de gevallen sprake was van een niet juiste uitkomst  
van de beoordeling.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Naast de verbetering die UWV op het interne proces heeft doorgevoerd, merk  
ik op dat de werking en mate van doelbereiking van de Wajong2015 zal  
meelopen in de brede evaluatie van de Participatiewet die uw Kamer eind  
2019 zal toekomen. De beoordeling van het recht op Wajong2015 zal hier  
onderdeel van uitmaken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7.  
Waarom zijn zowel de Nederlandse Vereniging voor Verzekeringsgeneeskunde  
&amp;#40;NVVG&amp;#41; als de Nederlandse Vereniging van Arbeidsdeskundigen &amp;#40;NVvA&amp;#41; niet op  
de hoogte gesteld van dit onderzoek?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7.  
Of en op welke wijze het UWV rapporten die zijn gericht op interne  
kwaliteitsverbetering van de uitvoering van wetgeving door het UWV, deelt  
met beroepsverenigingen is aan het UWV zelf.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8.  
Is het ministerie destijds op de hoogte gesteld van dit onderzoek? Zo ja,  
welke actie heeft het ministerie hierop ondernomen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;

van de uitvoering’ aan u te sturen &amp;#40;zie TK 246448-608&amp;#41;.  
   
9.  
Bent u zich ervan bewust dat onterechte afwijzing grote gevolgen heeft voor  
de betrokkene, en dat in beroep gaan vaak te veel gevraagd is? Hoe wordt  
dit meegenomen in het proces van beoordeling?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 9.  
Ik ben mij er terdege van bewust dat de uitkomst van een beoordeling diep  
ingrijpt in het leven van de mensen die het aangaat. Juist daarom vind ik  
het van belang dat de kwaliteit van de primaire beoordeling van het  
arbeidsvermogen op objectiveerbare gronden wordt genomen en goed wordt  
onderbouwd. Een goed onderbouwd dossier draagt bovendien bij aan het  
voorkomen van bezwaar en beroep. Zoals ik u eerder heb gemeld in het  
antwoord op vraag 6, is de kwaliteit van dit proces inmiddels weer op orde.

ainjhw,2,2019-01-22,[M4F] Little bit of Space Magic (World Building) (Long Term),Experimentallove,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ainjhw/m4f_little_bit_of_space_magic_world_building_long/,"Not long into the future, it happened. Actual alien contact. It came in from a distant planet; a repeating message, one of peace and friendliness. Then again a month later, then again. Scientists around the globe worked together to pinpoint the location of the message. It came from a planet near the center of the Milky Way. An expedition team was made from the finest scientists around the globe, top of their fields.

There is Kylie, our pilot. She has been on many spaceships before. Rather relaxed type of girl, pretty cool most of the time but can focus really hard if necessary.

Then there is the engineer Luna who just finished university and her PhD before she came to the space fleet. She is still insecure about a lot of things but you can tell she is intelligent.

Sydney is not your typical security officer. Unlike all of the big and muscular guys who usually fit in this role, she mainly thinks about everything in a tactical way. She is known for her high accuracy with guns and her quietness that can almost get scary.

Jayla is the medic of the team and also cares for the bunks of the small ship. She is dutiful and loyal but full of energy all day.

Lana is my Vice-Captain, and probably the most experienced one on this ship. Nobody knows what kind of trouble she got into to land on this mission full of rookies. Despite her position, she is quite clumsy and naive but also always honest with others.

Penny graduated as one of the best students of her year. She is diligent and always busy, secretly worrying about her looks and about doing everything right all the time.

Chloe is working as an intern. She is the captain's assistant and still totally happy about what happens to her. She fell for him pretty quick and dreams of becoming like him, even though she probably never will.

Kagami is the chef and probably the least educated of the crew but is always smiling and happy and likes to take care of everyone.

(Pictures of all crew members available upon request, since DPP doesn't like a lot of links)

And their fearless captain, me. I was a last minute replacement. NASA and other space agencies didn't want any co-mingling on the flight so they decided on an all-female crew, but the previous captain was pulled last minute due to pregnancy and replaced with me. One male captain, on a multi-month flight, in uncharted space territory, with 8 women. What could possibly go wrong (or right)?

Our setting for this story is the SS New Horizons [https://www.deviantart.com/stingra/art/Amity-Class-Medium-Tonnage-Space-Habitat-735252906](https://www.deviantart.com/stingra/art/Amity-Class-Medium-Tonnage-Space-Habitat-735252906) It is Titan Class habitat ship designed with artificial gravity, crew quarters (2 per room and a captain's suite), cafeteria, rec room, lounge area... anything you could want. A floating mansion in space. The journey to the unknown planet will take up to 3 months, and we will lose all contact with Earth after two weeks. What happens on this ship is entirely up to us and what we determine.

So that is a somewhat detailed opening to the new world I'm looking to build. I wish I could thank the person that help me set all this up, but they deleted their account. So I'm left with all the assets we had going into the story, lucky you! Despite this all seemingly looking done and completed I'm open to modifications and tweaks of certain ideas, just let me know your thoughts.

I am open to having just a 1-1 story or involving multiple characters with each of us taking a role (or multiple). I want this to be a collaborative experience that we both enjoy doing. I've been itching to bite into a great story and write something epic, and this may be it. I just need the right partner. 

I hope this hasn't scared too many people off! I know it's long and ambitious but I promise it'll be rewarding and fulfilling at the same time. Look forward to hearing from you and reading your replies and ideas. "
ainlrk,3,2019-01-22,Relationshit?,pointlesstioning,relationships_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/ainlrk/relationshit/,"Dear Reddit, am I in a relationshit?

Briefly, here's my case. I'm a young man in his 25's, relatively successful and surrounded by amazing people. Initially from Northern Europe, I obtained a visa to work in the USA and started my life over at 22. But the thing is I'm damn picky when it comes to women. If you want an idea, although I've had multiple hook-ups in the past, I never introduced a woman to my beloved ones before. Mainly because I never fell in love. About 10 months ago, I had to stay isolated in a place I didn't know well for an internship. Turned out one of my acquaintances (with whom I do not have any contact now) knew a girl, 4y older, who was ending her own internship in the same city a few days after I started mine. He gave me her number so that she and I would meet friendly and feel less lonely for at least a few days.   
So we met. Once, actually. And pretty briefly, since none of us really had a lot of spare time in our schedules. We had a beer, and instantaneously felt the ""spark"". I guess that's what people call *love at first sight*. I'd add *love at first chat.* So we kept texting each other for weeks. And then for months in a totally platonic (although not totally uninterested, I won't lie) way. Until both of us eventually ended up moving to New York, and started dating.   
But here's the thing. I'm proud as hell, she's proud as hell. We try to meet at her place (I have an inquisitive roommate at home) at least once a week. Generally not more since we both have a really tight professional schedule. Every time we meet, we have the same kind of date. Every single time's just as amazing as the time before : I bring the wine, she cooks, lights candles, and after an excellent dinner, we *make love*. She certainly thinks we're only *having sex*, but from my point of view, we're not. There's something more, things we would definitely not do if it were all purely physical. She might obviously not be a good mind reader, because I highly doubt she got that I'm totally fond of her. Every single thing about her that would have annoyed me or turned off on some other woman deeply attracts me. When we're apart, I can't focus on anything but her. I'm reminded by my memory how it felt when she cuddled me, how she breathes heavily when we have sex, how she bends her lips when we look at each other and she's trying to hide a smile. Could literally spend hours imagining what she'd be doing right now. And I **HATE** that.

Now why do I **HATE** it so much? Once again, I'm proud as heck, and I have the feeling that my concern isn't reciprocal. I've tried to talk with her about what we'd both expect from that relationship already, but she really seems awkward talking about that kind of things, and I never dare annoy her. Moreover, the answer is always the same : ""I really thought you weren't interested in anything serious, so I didn't expect much at first"". Yes, my dear. *That, I get*. 

However, she keeps inviting me every single week, keeps sending briefs ""forgot to tell you about that, but something funny happened last time..."" texts when I'm not replying, bought me a toothbrush (I mean...) so that I wouldn't have to carry mine at her place every time I sleep there, regularly shows me pictures from her childhood, mentions what we could do one of those days, in a few months, etc. But still, even after admitting openly that I care about her enough to refuse being a mere lover, after trying to be a little more platonically tactile, buying her a meaningful (clueful may I say?) Christmas gift, showing her I'm genuinely interested in knowing how her day went, how she's been doing at work, etc. : I feel like there's literally no progress whatsoever in our relationship. And it's going to be about 7 months we're seeing each other almost every single week. Not putting a tag on our relationship isn't much of a problem to me. Not being introduced to her friends (even casually) is okay I guess, even though it raises questions I'm not ready to answer yet. Once again, we're both independent people, and none of us really pays attention to that kind of details. But it's that FEELING of not being loved back that tears me apart. About once a day, I'm thinking ""maybe I should stop seeing her and move on"", ""you're worth better than just a lover"", ""she might love you physically/intellectually, she doesn't love *you*"". But as quickly as I receive a text from her, it's like I forget about that instantly. No matter if I'm not even being asked how I'm doing, I still can't help but convince myself that she loves me back and remember how much *it felt like she did* when we were physically close. And I might be no romantic man, but it really did. I swear.

As much as I hate the idea of sharing that part of my life with strangers, no matter how anonymously, I think only a stranger can really understand one's situation without any subjective/emotional *a priori*. 

So, my one question is : objectively, and from what I wrote and only what I wrote, what do you people think of my partner's behavior? Am I being blind, am I being too obsessive over meaningless things? Am I her puppet, or is she only extremely clumsy with her own feelings? I guess I just want to know if our relationship is worth fighting for, or if it's really doomed to become a ***relationshit***."

ainzyr,39,2019-01-22,"Graduated Spring 2018, was just randomly let go from my firm. Need some advice on how to title my previous position on my resume. More details (and a mild rant/horror story/legal field cautionary tale) inside",The_Great_Hambriento,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ainzyr/graduated_spring_2018_was_just_randomly_let_go/,"**If you just want a TL;DR:** Graduated May 2018, though unable to sit for the bar until February 2019. Accepted an ""associate"" position, though obviously was unable to act as a full-fledged attorney. [Was randomly let go last week while I was off of work studying for the February bar.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/d2/33/22d2335f0ee17d477de9a041bc4edd43.png) Unsure how to put this on my resume. I was more than a clerk, but I feel the term ""associate"" is misleading. I don't want potential employers to think I have only been able to find clerk positions since graduating.


Longer version with more detail... here is my basic situation:

* Worked at various civil defense/insurance defense firms as in intern during law school
* Graduated Spring 2018, but was unable to sit for the July 2018 bar due to a misunderstanding and mistake on my end
* Got a job offer for an associate position at a mid-sized worker's comp firm, with the understanding that worker's comp was a pretty specialized area I had no experience in. Managing partner and I agreed that we would use the time between hiring and the 2019 bar to basically train me on worker's comp with the hope that I would be able to handle a claim from start to finish after the bar. I was still introduced to the rest of the firm as a new associate... I was also given an office (non-attorneys/all other staff shared kind of a common area), and a standard company attorney e-mail address. We agreed that I would be paid a reduced rate while I was in this ""training period"" while still being paid a decent salary, and I would get 6 weeks off to study for the bar. After the bar I would get my full salary, my billable hour requirement would kick in, and I would be able to get bonuses for meeting my goals. At no point was it implied that my offer was contingent on this training period.
* My experience there was.... not good. We were a smaller satellite office of a larger office on the other side of the state. Everybody thought somebody else was ""showing me the ropes,"" but in reality, I was getting no guidance and basically just thrown into the fire. People assumed since I had worked civil defense, I would intuitively understand WC, which was not the case. I was pretty blunt and vocal with multiple partners that I was concerned by my lack of training/guidance, and they all agreed that they needed to be better in getting me up to speed, but nothing changed.
* Had a performance review, I was apparently (and shockingly) on target for where they wanted me to be. I reminded my boss I would be taking off for the bar, and there were no problems there.
* Last week, got a random call from my boss. Pretty casual small talk, he asked me how bar prep was going and how my new puppy was. Then he kind of casually told me that I no longer had a position at the firm. He said they had gotten some new clients, had to move attorneys around and needed someone in the smaller office that was able to take a new claim start to finish with no guidance, and that they no longer wanted to dedicate resources to getting me to that point. I was pretty much in shock. I wish I would have told him that I probably would have been at that point with the sufficient training I had been asking for, but I just told him I understood and the call was over.

So, obviously, I need a new job. And an updated resume. I think associate might be misleading because I could not act as an attorney while I was there, but that is technically the position I accepted. I was more than a paralegal... I drafted a lot of pleadings and arguments which is something that paralegals do not do at that firm (I don't know if they do at other firms. Probably, but I have never seen it).

Essentially, I don't want someone to look at my resume and think I have only had clerking positions my entire career, or that I have been unable to secure a long-term offer to this point. The obvious answer here is to reach out to my former boss and ask what they would be comfortable with, but honestly I am pretty upset about the situation and I don't really want to be in contact with them right now. I think I would end up being passive-aggressive or unprofessional, and honestly, all of my time and effort needs to be put towards the bar exam at this point anyways. Any advice/opinions would be GREATLY appreciated.

**The rest of this is unrelated to the point of the post. It's just some more info on the firm, my experiences there, and what I should have done differently:**

I am not overly upset about losing this position.  I am VERY confident that this will be a blessing long-term. I did not really enjoy the area of law or the culture there, but I couldn't justify looking elsewhere without having passed the bar. One rogue attorney there actually at one point came in my office, closed my door, and told me that this firm was not the best place to be and that the owners were not as friendly as they appeared. The salaries were underwhelming, but the incentive-based bonus structure there was (supposedly) incredible. He said the two owners were very good at finding reasons to keep people from getting their bonuses, and if you did meet your goals, they would be set higher next year, though the bonus would remain the same. Candidly, he told me that despite being the managing partner of the smaller location, having 20 years experience in the field, and billing over 250 hours/month, he did not make over $100,000 most years. (If you're wondering why he was still there, he was in a wheelchair and it was just a pain for him to come into an office every day. They were really great about letting him work from home. He didn't really care about the money because he did biglaw early in his career, he was just too restless/bored to sit at home and collect disability without having a job.) He encouraged me to pass the bar and then look at other options while I was young and employable before letting myself strictly become a workers comp guy. In my area at least, there is just no money in the field unless you are at the top of it. I took this job in desperation because other firms were scared of my bar exam situation, and I am really excited to hopefully land a position that is a better fit for me and my skill set. It was short-sighted of me but hey you gotta pay the bills. 

Things I *am* upset about: Obviously it is shitty to take on an associate, knowing they have to be trained in that area of the law, and then failing to do so. I have done very well in my other internships, and I have a good resume and decent grades. I am not an idiot, but I felt absolutely fucking stupid every day I walked into that office. That was mentally exhausting, and I would never wish that feeling on anybody. 

A friend of mine who is very into workers' rights and is critical of the legal field/firm practices in general put an idea in my head that I can't shake: He basically seems to think that the firm was not actually that interested in keeping me long-term. Obviously, if I came in there and really blew them away I likely would have kept my position. However, he thinks they just saw me as a desperate guy and the perfect opportunity to get some good cheap, work out of a guy with a law degree while they looked for a long-term candidate. My law degree allowed them to bill me at a higher rate, but my lack of a bar card allowed them to pay me at a rate that was far below market value. Looking back, there are definitely some signs he may have been right. I was never allowed to see our client list or client contracts, I was not able to access any information on firm financials or billing rates (including mine, which I thought was odd), and all other sensitive information was blocked from me. When our firm manager was setting up my account, she even mentioned it was very strange that all of this stuff was blocked from me. I was put into the system with attorney privileges, so my default setting was that all of this stuff was visible. They had went in there and changed the default settings so that all the stuff was not visible to me. Every other new associate got business cards and was added to the firm website immediately, but I was not. And I was replaced literally a week after I took my scheduled time off for bar prep. It smells fishy, and I am not saying they exploited me for cheap labor, but at the very minimum I think they misrepresented my ""training period"" (actually turned out to be more of a long-term tryout period I suppose) and they overstated their long-term plans for me. 

I guess it's fair them to blow a little smoke, because I was kind of doubting my future there anyways just a few months in. But I did feel a sense of loyalty to them because they were the only firm willing to take me on with my bar situation. I didn't have any hard offers from other firms, but I definitely passed up some opportunities that likely would have been available to me had I pursued them, including a positioning finally opening at the firm I spent most of my law school career clerking for. Moving forward, I am going to be loyal to myself and family only. Of course, this doesn't mean I won't at some point be loyal to a future firm, but I will only be loyal to a place if that loyalty will definitely benefit me in some way down the line. I was pretty naive to be loyal to this place, especially after I had been warned by one of their top guys.

Finally, I am most upset about this whole situation because it just adds to the stress of the bar exam and makes it even more crucial that I pass it on the first try. I have some mental health issues, including bipolar depression and sometimes crippling anxiety. They knew about this. I disclosed it to them, as well as my medication list, when I accepted their offer. I also cited that as a reason I wanted to take full time off for the bar. If I get overly-stressed (it has to be pretty extreme), I kind of just shut down, and it sends me into a depressive state. I am trying to use my frustration as motivation to crush the bar exam, but I am really having to fight to keep from shutting down. I hope I can keep these feelings at bay for the next five weeks.

If you've made it this far, congrats. If you're a 1L or 2L just starting your firm experience, please take what happened to me and be smarter about things than I was. Ask around your community about the firm, ask people who work there for candid opinions, and reach out to former employees to hear how their experience was. This really turned into a rant. I didn't intend for it to happen, but I do feel a lot better getting it off my chest even if nobody reads it."

aiolmy,49,2019-01-22,Quitting Intern Year: My Story,[deleted],Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/aiolmy/quitting_intern_year_my_story/,"I quit residency during intern year, which is likely a death sentence for any future residency program. I started becoming depressed and anxious as intern year began and it gradually worsened over time. I wanted to go into OB/GYN because of the positive birthing experiences I had with my own children, with other patients, and I viewed my mentor as a hero and wanted to be just like him. This guy spent most of his practicing life on call and was the beloved hero of the city he practiced in. He appeared immune to whatever challenge presented itself.  I wanted to challenge myself because I believed in the end, by choosing the most challenging field and by working hard, I would gain the most personal satisfaction and sense of fulfillment in life. There is also a spiritual component to me choosing OB because I viewed myself as bringing spirits or God’s children into the world.

I had doubts about entering residency in my field due to some experiences as a medical student, especially with patients increasingly not wanting males present. Some of the worst memories I had as a medical student, especially when I got my ass chewed out, were on OB. But, some of my greatest memories were as well. Even after matching, the doubts continued.

As a resident, a lot of patient’s refused for me to take care of them. While I was the only intern on the floor, I often had to turn to my senior females to help out, which often lead to a delay in care since they weren’t often present. This ultimately increased their workload, which they weren’t happy about. Some got upset at me and wanted me to do everything except the exam, which I often felt uncomfortable doing because some females don’t like sharing such personal information with men. I had instances on patients who I took over on labor and delivery who I went into the patient’s room, eventually did a cervical exam, and then the patient reported to their nurse that they did not want me as a provider anymore. I recall an attending telling me I was worthless due to not being able to see her patients because they denied wanting a male provider. I was continually behind my female colleagues due to needing a nurse present with all of my interactions.

I viewed the nurses on labor and delivery as my friends, often joking with them. I often displayed a happy and cheerful attitude, which I began to realize did not go well with many nurses or physicians. Some things I said got interpreted wrong, which was entirely my fault, and I eventually in trouble with my PD. The entire nursing staff turned against me. It got to the point where some nurses refused to let me see patient’s and they themselves updated the attending physician about a patient’s progress without involving me.

I chose the most procedural heavy program in the country. In this program, there was competitiveness among other programs on how many numbers their residents can put up. This led to some procedures being a lot more the minimum requirement. I was on-call/pager 24/7 all year long, usually waking up multiple times in the middle of the night at home to deal with patients. I wasn’t sleeping, and I was continually worrying. Most of L&amp;D was run with other physicians being involved only by phone call and subsequently billed as such, which was something I wasn't used to as a medical student. Often, providers would miss their own deliveries.

With programs only having the same number of resident’s per year and the number of patients admitted to teaching hospitals increasing per year, I began to understand that I was doing more work per year than those who were in residency beforehand, sometimes by a significant margin. There was a reason the procedural numbers weren’t updated on the institute’s website when application season came around. There was also a reason nobody in my class ranked the program number one. I thought I could handle the high numbers, but I found out I didn’t have time to think, or even take a shit. Often things were so busy I didn’t have time to eat for a full day. Some medical students felt bad and had to bring me food from the cafeteria.

I couldn’t handle the continual stress, worry, and lack of time to think. It got to the point where I didn’t even want to deliver babies anymore because I knew I’d fall behind managing the numerous patient’s in labor and triage. I knew every shift I was disappointing either my senior residents, attending physicians, patients, or nurses. One of them would get upset at me, and often it felt like I had to pick and choose which one to upset. Most feedback was negative, since practically every resident who was close to finishing residency had a malpractice case against them.

I started breaking down and crying during work. It didn’t help that my other interns were doing the same. I started thinking about the negative feedback I’d received every waking moment and became afraid to work with some physicians who were most critical. I started seriously contemplating suicide. I eventually attempted suicide via drop-hanging but somehow was able to recover my footing after nearly passing out. I started visiting suicide websites strongly contemplated buying a shotgun. 

Long-standing anxiety is likely the culprit, with depression on top. As a youth I went through a tough few years where I was on an SSRI and eventually an antipsychotic (which I’ve been off for years). I met with psychologists and psychiatrists. I had to deal with abandonment issues since my biological father walked out. I’ve always wanted to be accepted. My parents told me they talked with a psychiatrist who mentioned I may have Asperger’s syndrome, but after looking over the traits they demonstrate I doubt I have that. I’ve often wondered if I have a neurotic personality trait. 

When I look back, I realize I chose the wrong specialty. I’ve likely ruined potential career earnings, likely in the millions. I’d like to go back to my home institution where I did medical school and do either a TY year to prove myself or IM residency. I’m more stable now. Some people bitch about rounding, and I did as a medical student, but I’d love to go back to that environment where I round half the day and type notes the rest of the day. At least I’d have a little more time to fucking think, and maybe more patient's would like to see me.

Since resigning, I was able to sell my house, move across the country and accept a job outside medicine for now. I'm more stable now. I still have nightmares and bad thoughts about my times in residency. I'd like to go back to my home institution, but I know since I quit in the middle of the year I would look like a hazard. 

If anyone has questions about how things are, the jobs I've looked at and interviewed at since resigning, thought process, etc I would be happy to answer. I'm skeptical making this post in the first place due to fear of being doxxed.

It would be easy to think so... but I think there’s more than a grain of truth to it. The reasons an older man would like a young woman are clear enough, and I think the opposite is true too. Maybe it’s the allure of the forbidden, a married man and the taboo that comes with it?

Or maybe the experience and expertise, the dominant edge that college boys just can’t bring. One way or another, there’s something undeniable and urgent about the older man, younger woman dynamic, don’t you think?

A boss, powerful in his suit and tie and corner office and confident in who he is. A subordinate - perhaps his secretary, but maybe a new hire or curious intern. Right there, there are a number of ways to go to break the cliché... but what really turns into into something more is the dynamic. Power versus submission. Your attitude versus my confidence, my will to bend versus yours to fight but ultimately be bent and molded. 

Or is it a student and a professor?  A college student home on break, attracted to the neighbor next door? Maybe it’s that tension, that mental connection, ultimately that give and take of sass and submission and mutual understanding and, at the heart of it, the trust - knowing that domination isn’t just being an asshole and pleasing yourself but just the opposite. It’s a gift to be earned, and once it’s given it’s important to use it well - to take you places you may not even know you need to go. It’s not an abusive dynamic but one of well-earned trust and then the boss treating his assistant like they both need, during playtime and after. 

Interested in a whip-smart, well-dressed older man?  Someone to explore the kinky, erotic, imaginative side of your fantasies that boys your age can’t do justice to?  I’m in my 40s, fit and slim, well-traveled and well-read and most of all as willing and excited to cross that line of the decade or two that separates us, and do it in the most heart-pounding way. 

Write me. 

Together we’ll craft a scenario that will have us both eagerly anticipating the next red envelope, with our pulse quickening when it arrives. "

[Translation]^^1 


Margaret Thatcher’s premonition for Germany

Some time ago, when I was sitting with my British colleagues, all of whom worked in the European Parliament, one of them, in an alienated and uncomprehending tone, related an incident in their apartment.The residential community consisted of several young professionals from different nations, all of whom worked in the Brussels EU bubble. One room was inhabited by an intern.As it turned out over time, this worked at the Front National (then called that). That was not what she took offense to. She was completely irritated by the efforts of her German roommate to throw the eighteen-year intern out of the apartment. He had taken initiative and asked the landlord to terminate the contract with her, explicitly referring to her political background.

My colleagues have the qualities you need if you want to work in politics and still want to lead a happy life: they were for the most part apolitical. They kept everyone at the table just as little from the UKIP as the FN.Nevertheless, they immediately and unanimously agreed that this behavior was undemocratic and condemnable. No one could understand what was driving the Germans. The dehumanization of the intern had deeply outraged my colleague. Since then - and by the passionless Gekicke the German national football team - I hold in international matches to England.

I told this story several times in Germany. No one was ever outraged - all found the behavior of the German right. My result may be falsified, after all, I live in Berlin, but I’m sure, this self-evident-tolerant-democratic attitude, which showed my British colleagues on this evening, you can hardly find here in Germany. She does not seem part of the culture.

National Socialism was not an industrial accident

What makes you, the culture of Germany? Why is no other country in the world trying to impose a diesel ban without making rational arguments? Why is no other country in the world so fanatically moving to „green“ energies? Why was it Germany once again that plunged Europe into the migration crisis in 2015, and why is Germany still convinced four years later, while the few other countries that initially participated have long been silent again? Why are politicians in Germany again committed to civilizing Eastern Europe?

Why is this country - which has only 601 righteous among the peoples (1), although it had the opportunity for the longest time to revolt, while Poland counts more than 10 times as many - suddenly filled with „anti-fascists“ the tireless #Nazisraus tweet ? What I want to say: National Socialism was not an industrial accident. When I saw the agitated and euphorically clapping people at the train stations in the news in 2015, I understood Goldhagen.

Of course, all this can not be grasped. The question of national characteristics can not be scientifically answered and a whole nation can not be condemned. Many will be able to call counterexamples in the circle of acquaintances or point out excessive developments in other countries - mind you, even my French friends did not understand the indignation of the British.

Likewise, I do not want to succumb to historicism and propagate historical laws, or to deduce from a single observation an entire theory. The historian Gordon A. Craig sums up the failure of a search for national characteristics in the introduction to a political history of the Prussian army:

„To attribute national character to a people is in any case a daring thing, and conclusions drawn from such admittance can easily fall into nothing. That more recently authoritarian forms of government, militarism and aggression characterized German political life and action can hardly be denied. However, this book starts from the basic premise that such things are by no means innate to the German character, but rather - to speak with Franz Neumann - are the results of a structure that thwarted the attempts to create a viable democracy ' (Gordon A.). Craig, The Prussian-German Army 1640-1943 State in the State, Dusseldorf 1960, p. 11) It is just about this structure.

Tendency to overestimate one’s own powers and abilities

The question „What does history tell us about the character and behavior of the Germans and have they changed in the last forty years?"" Asked Margaret Thatcher in March 1990, after several rejections of the reunification of Germany, American and British experts in Germany. Four historians (including the above-cited Gordon A. Craig) and two journalists invited them to their county seat to discuss these and other issues informally. The summary of the „Seminar on Germany“ published the British National Archives 2016. It can beread here . (2)

As participants of the meeting emphasized in retrospect, the document by the private secretary Thatchers, CD Powell, partly pointed and written with a certain irony. Thus, the summary immediately begins with the description of the national attributes of the Germans that have been shown in the past: „Their lack of empathy (especially in their behavior regarding the Polish border), their obsession with themselves, a strong inclination to self-pity, and the desire to be liked.

Some even less flattering qualities were named as a consistent part of the German character: in alphabetical order, fear, aggression, certainty, harassment, selfishness, inferiority complex, sentimentality. ""(3) The document goes on:"" Two more features of the German character were in the Looking to the future as reasons for concern. First, an ability to excess, to exaggerate things, to overestimated.Secondly, a tendency to overestimate one’s own powers and abilities.

An example of this which greatly influenced subsequent German history was the conviction that the victory over France in 1870 was the result of a deep moral and cultural superiority, instead of - as indeed - a modest advance in military technology. "" Gordon Craig ) The historian Gordon Craig said in a statement in 1991 to have said this in analogy, but distanced himself - as all participating historians - from the concept of national character in the mouth.

Old habits the hard.

In addition to the introductory provision of certain characteristics that can be deduced from history, the historians pointed out in the course of the conversation that the Prime Minister’s reservations about Germany after Bismarck and until 1945 were true, but that the time after that was a turning point. They emphasized that Germany had learned from the crimes of the past, that it had dealt with them intensively and was therefore no longer an uncontrollable danger - even as a reunified nation. Germany has changed in the last forty years.Thatcher remained skeptical until the end, but proved to be reasonable. The FAZ and the ZEIT reported with reference to the Checkers seminar (the questionnaire, which had been sent to the experts in advance, was leaked to the press) that the experts had made Thatcher, regarding the reunification, milder.

Would the experts draw the same conclusion today? The last few years provide a variety of examples in which Germans lived out their tendency to excess, to the exaggeration of things. I hardly suspect an organization comes in January, in the greeting to their employees for the nine year, without an embassy to the mainstream political. Every public service editor, every senior official, every established politician is a little McCarthy. With the difference that the American society remembered after a few years of a better. In Germany, one does not correct mistakes - the world is supposed to recover on the German essence. Let’s agree with disagree is not available in German. And what better than the tendency to overestimate your own powers and abilities together as „We can do it“?

Old habits the hard. Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster, whose books were among the first works to be burned by the National Socialists, wrote in 1937: „Germany has always been the great laboratory in which the hypotheses of the whole world have been thoroughly tested, thought through, and tested.“ Hitler Foerster, in his application of the European nationality principle, in contrast to the other countries, does not revert to any conclusion.At least did we learn from the past, as historians and journalists described Thatcher in 1990? Did Germany really deal so intensely with its crimes and is it really aware of its mistakes that led to this manmade disaster?

I’m not a historian, but have gone through the German education system. National Socialism was far away for my classmates. It was more like groaning to revisit this part of the story every year.Where, we really never dealt with it. It always stayed in the abstract. The horrors of the Holocaust are unthinkable for an eighth-grader. The mental attitude that paved the way for mass destruction was simplified - as in the required reading „The Wave“ - ​​without it ever being personal, unpleasant. The exclusion, because of the color of the eyes, was so ridiculous that we all thought ourselves in resistance. It had nothing to do with us.

Although Germany has built a memorial in the center of its capital, the „why we“ never answered; never want to answer.The re-education came from above, it was not internalized.We have never learned at school that teaching is from the past, that we must always engage in an open discourse and never dehumanise the other side.Instead, we have learned what is good - left - and what is bad - right - and whom we need to stick to to arrange things accordingly. We were still educated as subjects.

I spoke to my seniors during my internship and they said that if i’m interested in e-commerce Pdt Dev then i should take some classes to gain knowledge on IT related stuff.

aiq3or,3,2019-01-22,"Careers, motherhood, mental health, oh my!",isweedglutenfree,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/aiq3or/careers_motherhood_mental_health_oh_my/,"I grew up trying to fit in with my brother, his friends, and our boy cousins that we were always around while having a very proper mother. I’ve been in conflict with that ever since - yearning to be accepted but not allowed to even be myself. 

My family is naturally very competitive but I think this made me more so. However, there was a bit of learned helplessness in there from my mom’s demands and criticism. I feel like a lot of me is in conflict with a lot of me.

My brother, his friends, and our cousins would tell me to take care of our baby cousins instead of playing baseball with them, so I had a chip on my shoulder any time I came in competition with a guy. I even decided that for a job, I would be the best in a specific male dominated role and industry just to prove that girls can do it too (I stuck with that and am currently ignoring that career that was once a dream to write this lol). Around middle school though, my mom criticized a lot of how and what I did. From then on, while still feeling competitive and vindictive and driven to succeed, I joked about giving up and being a house wife. I joked but I didn’t think I would be able to accomplish much career-wise with my mom always putting doubts in my head (“no one wants someone who gets sick all the time,” “you can’t dye your hair bc your picture might be seen by future employers,” “what would future employers think,” etc). Anything I did that she didn’t like would be phrased as employers not liking something, so I was afraid to even be myself. I made her proofread all my emails for internships bc I felt I wasn’t good enough...

Anyway. All of this is to say that I got to that career faster than most people in that field and proved to everyone that I can do it. Yet every day I doubt myself and question everything I do. I want to give up bc then at least I don’t have the excuse that I failed - you can’t fail if you don’t try! But I’m so competitive that I can’t imagine backing out. Then I think about if I were to be a house wife... I can’t even do that. I am not hot enough nor clean enough to have that be my focus (bc then I’m REALLY failing if I try at that). 

I told a professor one time that I wanted to be a stay at home mom and he asked me, “how? You are so ambitious and career driven. I can’t see you giving up.” So I stopped making those jokes and started to put all that weight back on career. But then being a mother should be the priority when the time comes and people also look down on focusing on careers. 

In college, a lot of people said to study what you love because money isn’t everything. Then they say that’s dumb bc you can’t find a job. Now people say that the focus shouldn’t be on career and we should do what we love. I guess the easy answer is to do what makes you happy but while I do like my career and where I’m currently at, I always doubt myself.

I started this with the intention of asking this question but obviously got side tracked:
How important is career to you? How important is being a mom? How important is your mental health? "

I wrote a post last year asking for some advice, and since then have had an internship with a company in Ottawa. I would like to continue building my experience, the traditional methods of online applying after months and months aren’t leading me anywhere so far. I am currently waiting for a security clearance to be able to apply for government jobs, but it’s taking a while given my short Canadian residence. 

I would be ever grateful if someone could point me to volunteering opportunities, do they exist in the IT sector? I scour sites like Indeed, Peter’s New Jobs, Glassdoor, etc. and have been in touch with a number of agencies but often find the positions are filled, or I’m not selected because of lack of experience. Internship/co-op posts seems to always require the applicant be a student as well. Do you know of any companies taking in seasonal internships?

I’ve done teasing, push and pull, favour asking apart from kino. Still the office, I don’t want to get any harassment incidents. However, she always finds away to make me touch her (like showing a minor cut or some spot on her hand)

She got my number a few months back but I didn’t ask for hers and she didn’t message me up until now. The first message was ‘come to the front’ (for smoking) but then I was at the back and she knew it. Story short, she came to the back. A few hours later I responded ‘nice picture’ (what’s app profile) after that nothing new

At the beginning she constantly said something about her boyfriend but now never hear about it

In one way or another I will try to slide in. But first I need your piece of advice as wise men.

aisjdo,2,2019-01-22,I just want to vent. I know the people on this sub get it. My mental illnesses are ruining my life and slowly killing me.,professionalsexhaver,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/aisjdo/i_just_want_to_vent_i_know_the_people_on_this_sub/,"I don't know why I'm making this post. A gut feeling tells me it will make me feel better. In this post, I'll attempt to summarize the problems I've dealt with at different points in my life.

Background: 18M. I was born and raised at a small, shitty town in India. Moved to a suburb of a major city in the US in August 2018 for college.

**Ages 0 to 6:**

I always had an EXTREMELY high degree of 'other'-ness right from when I was very little. I was an extremely impulsive child. I was unable to sit still, would disrupt any games with other kids, couldn't participate in any group activity without disrupting, would say embarrassing things, was fickle, was really smart but didn't really do well in class because I was too fickle to write anything on paper - was a constant embarrassment for my parents and myself. We had a substitute teacher who would beat me to bruises for trivial shit like I couldn't be bothered to do the dumb busy work he'd assign us. MY PARENTS DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. :)

**Age 7 to 12:**

Same problems - some of them got better, some of them got worse. Got incessantly bullied, LOST MY STUFF ALL THE DAMN TIME - my parents tell me that during my 18 yrs with them, I've lost stuff worth more than $50k in total. Got in trouble with 'authority figures' all the time - constant arguments with teachers - teachers would get triggered because I said something that they didn't want to hear. FUCK SUCH TEACHERS. Fuck all school teachers. They have such an easy job and they can't even do that honestly without leaving scars on a child's mind. I feel like I was bullied the most by teachers. Academic performance was extremely inconsistent. I'd either do extremely well - or do just above average (which is really bad given that I have an IQ of 148). Also, about the teachers, they were the worst they could possibly be. They straight up called me retarded on my face and behind my back, asked other students to avoid me - all of this for my slight quirks and eccentricities. Trust me, at this stage, my behavior was tame enough to not even slightly affect others. BUT THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS DECIDED TO GO AFTER ME. I'm in my dorm alone and I can't help thinking of these events and screaming out loud. LIKE I LITERALLY WANNA SCREAM MY LUNGS OUT. I WANNA SCREAM SO BAD. Near the end of 7th grade, I started to get really into programming and computer science.

**Age 13 to 15**

I'd spend hours learning stuff related to programming online and doing personal projects but I was extremely distracted so didn't make a lot of progress. Was pretty obsessed with competitive programming. This is the only interest I've been able to sustain over the years and I'm extremely grateful because it's the only reason I could make it to a first world country and it also makes me pretty good money.

I got harassed over petty shit for the entirety of eighth grade by a teacher and it made my life miserable. Certain teachers would use me as a prop to laugh at in class. Was severely hit multiple times by bullies. Had multiple traumatic episodes including one where I had to hide from my bullies for 3 hours and it had the entire administration searching (mother was a teacher in the same school). School and parents would always side with the ppl who hated me and hurt me. ONCE AGAIN, A BUNCH OF TEACHERS KEPT HARASSING ME OVER TRIVIAL ISSUES LIKE HANDWRITING. Like yes, I had a horrible case of unmedicated ADHD and my handwriting is hard to read. I TRY. But I struggle. What you don't do is chastise me about how I should try harder.

**Age 16 to 17**

Enter internet addiction, relationship drama and depression.

I didn't have proper access to the internet before I was 14. Weird, I know but whatever. But I got addicted to 20 different sites of the internet real fast and honestly browsing the internet is all I remember doing in high school. I could do decently in tests because I was smart and got rly good at last-minuting and half-assing almost everything.

This is also the I began eating impulsive during depressive phases. By the end of hs, I was 50lbs overweight and I'm still working to fix that.

I had little to no romantic or sexual inclinations till 16. Kind of a late bloomer. Even now, my interest levels are extremely fickle. The longest relationship I've had in HS lasted like 2.5 months. I lose attraction to people really fast. Also, I spent a lot/most of high school seeking the 8/10s when I could have gotten the 6/10s. I also had some sort of a relationship with another person who also had bipolar toward the end of hs. It got toxic af but welp. I tend to get really obsessed with ppl but also lose interest very fast. Ppl have accused me of leading them on in the past.

But here's the thing. I JUST COULD NOT GET MYSELF TO STUDY IN HS NO MATTER HOW MUCH I TRIED. I turned off the internet. I just got distracted by other stuff. I'd spend 10s of hours thinking about random crap. My mind was/is like a restless 5-year old, begging for every sort of instant gratification. But I did well bc I was smart.

**Age 18+**

Doing pretty well in college - at least on paper - good grades, doing fine with the ladies, making good money, got internship offers from big N companies in the valley. But I AM NOT WELL. There are so many days I can't get out of bed. So many days I'm reminded of a past incident and can't stop crying. I constantly bang the walls of my room and scream when I'm alone. There are also periods I just can't go to sleep. I constantly interrupt people. I fidget. I'm still kind of a meme among my friends. I struggle to get things in on time. (Though I get it done last minute) I struggle with paperwork. I sometimes go days without showering. Days when I barely eat. Or eat a LOT.

I just want to feel good. I'm willing to try anything. I have no moral framework. If you can convince me that killing a puppy will make me feel better, I'll fucking do it. If I need to do illegal drugs to feel better, I'll do it.

I feel like the entire world's falling apart. I feel like my insides are crashing. I'm living in my own filth - haven't cleaned my room in several months. The only reason my clothes don't stink is because I own a lot of them so I can get away with doing my laundry like once a month. There's trash all over my floor.

I have more money than I can imagine needing, but I'm behind on my bills.

I have been procrastinating some vital paperwork that keeps me in this country legally for 2 months. Every time I try, something comes up.

I have a constant urge to hurt myself. And idk what I'm gonna do.

ALSO, GETTING PRESCRIBED ADHD MEDS TAKES SO MANY STEPS I DONT THINK ILL BE ABLE TO EVER COMPLETE THEM.

Also, I got diagnosed with bipolar, adhd and aspergers only after I came to college - but now that I think of it - EVERYTHING IN MY PAST MAKES SENSE. I just wish ppl were kinder. I know there's a LOT worse ppl have been thru. I know that I'm lucky in many ways. But I just needed to put my thoughts out there.

Also, all my life, I LIE. ALL THE DAMN TIME. IDK HOW TO STOP. At this point, it's hard for me to not lie about anything. It's almost the default."

aitqj9,5,2019-01-22,How to get my [21] mom to give me space?,oppositeofhomesick,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aitqj9/how_to_get_my_21_mom_to_give_me_space/,"Throwaway, even though my mom definitely doesn't Reddit. Looking for advice, but also just needed to vent, because I'm not sure there's even a way to resolve this and I'm going insane.  


I've always been very independent. My parents got divorced when I was 2, so I went back and forth between them and developed a routine for myself that wasn't dependent on which parent I was with or whose house I was at, etc. Of course, I depended on them for the things that most kids depend on their parents for but, if I could do something myself, I did. My freshmen year of high school I went to boarding school, so I was really doing everything for myself (think, everything a college kid does for themselves.)  


When I transferred back to non-boarding school my sophomore year and started living with my mom again, it was an adjustment. There were some things she was happy for me to do for myself, like my laundry, but there were other things that she wanted to do for me ""as my mother,"" like make and eat dinner together, etc. Like most mothers, she wanted to hear everything about my day, everyday. I was never someone that told my mom everything, but I was even less inclined to after boarding school because, again, I'd gotten used to not having to report on the days events every evening — unless it was to my friends, in which case we probably weren't discussing things anyone would want to discuss with their mother; again, I know there are some people that tell their mom everything, but on the occasion that I did tell her about boys/parties/etc. she'd get anxious and berate me with questions until I became anxious, too.  


When I was 18 I moved to New York. I supported myself; half because my mom wasn't in the financial position to support me and half because I wanted to support myself. So I paid my rent, food, etc, all on my own. Since then, my mom has gotten a much better job and always offers to help. She always asking if I need anything for school, work, etc. Sometimes I do and I'll let her get them for me, because it genuinely seems to make her feel like she's ""a part of my life.""  


Even so, she texts me all day and calls me multiple times a day, berating me about where I am (even though we're not in the same city), what I'm doing, how my day was, if there's anything new, etc. I usually screen her calls and just answer the messages if she's asking a question or something. Eventually, maybe once a week, I'll pick up a call and have a conversation, hoping that'll tide her over for a few days. But she always calls again soon after, sometimes even again in the same day. My life is busy (full-time student, part-time intern, three jobs, AND a social life), but it's barely eventful (when it comes to the topics I'm comfortable talking to her about, anyway) enough to fill a conversation week-to-week, much less day-to-day, and definitely not multiple times a day!

  
I know some people are going to say she's just trying to be a good mom and I should feel lucky that I have a parent that's so interested in my life, but I feel suffocated. The more she pushes me to interact with her, the less I want to. I've tried to get her to tone it down, indirectly (by ignoring her calls/messages unless it's something important) and directly, by saying something. Whenever she calls me or messages me several times in a row while I'm busy, I'll explain what I'm doing and ask what she needs, but she calls me ""mean"" for that. I've tried to explain that I'm not trying to be mean, that I'm just busy and don't have time to talk everyday, but she doesn't listen. How can I communicate my need for space effectively without hurting her feelings?  


TL;DR: My mom wants to be in constant communication even though we've never been that close."

Today I have a packed agenda including but not limited to: 
1. Planning my life/education/getting my Mac 
2. Building up my relationships so I build up my bros first then me, such a conspiracy 
3. Revenge against three sets of people 
A) wbgs 
B) wbgs students (certain individuals)
C) Purcell students (certain individuals) 

These people defamed me with a conspiracy theory of putting a bomb in my school, crazy stuff 
I’m not familiar with these individuals 
Will never understand their motives 

But I intend to 
Conspire against them through exposing them which will include their efforts to conspire against my attempts to expose them 
It’s all limitless 
Every conspiracy they try and make affiliated to my name/reputation will be pre empted , sent to  the police etc 

As said I’m not familiar with these people and they’ve caused me a lot of stress
I wish only love and happiness for them but they will he 100% exposed 
Can link to my suicide note which is my very last resort if they continue to denigrate me without just consequences. Might need legal representation. 
They also made social media posts attributed to my name to further gaslight me 
Nice 

All the more motivation to be a better person 

My social life/$/photos/learning/gym/lifestyle is all on the up (: 

Leaving my parents house better off then when I came in when I go to university too ❤️

Anyway, this is my life plan 

1) do the above revenge , and make my whole conspiracy work like tick tock and dominate the narrative, no tolerance of bs, no backchat , I’m getting justice from those who slandered me. 

2) Look at the defamation post I made, I did badly with my grades, luckily I have a solution 

There’s an LLB Law degree offered by the Open University Which is Basically all online. 
I’m doing it from student accommodation in London hopefully whilst partying with my London friends. 

This will take 3 years. 
Hopefully 
Will intern with my cousin who works with Legal Services in New York City, and also network with my twitter following, my church community and my friend Aditya for internship opportunities. 

After my degree, I hope to do an Ma Law at either Cambridge, LSE, Macau , Hong Kong Etc so I’m skilled up in terms of my education 

I manage most of my relationships/communication through the devil that is social media 
It’s this huge conspiracy because instead of being an influencer on ig , I’m really woke politically on my twitter, Dennis rodman is my dad and I’m an anarchist, daddy would be proud 

But yeah, linked my twitter @ online if this matters. I automated a bot on it which shows my future mansion lol. 

After my Ma Law /Mba/JD /management 
I would like to locate to Singapore or the States and 
Practice Law or Work in Real Estate or work with influencers or join the military to then be qualified to be a mercenary etc 

What is for certain though is im a shameless sycophant 

My school/uni/online connections etc are engaging in a wild conspiracy 
We’re running up money together, property, opportunities, education, girls, social life etc you name it 
It’s a huge conspiracy as said 
Bigger conspiracy then a wife cheating on her husband and putting it on Reddit. 

Particular Employment that appeals to me includes: 

Miami: Dezer Development 
NYC: JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, all the law firms on my twitter feed, 
LA: The Daily Wire Lol 
Anywhere: Any media organisation, it looks lit, idc what politics
Political: Lib Dem/Tory/Labor in the U.K., idc I could be either and be a successful mp if I put my mind to it 
Anywhere: any property development 
Forbes 30 and 30 
Anywhere that sells yachts fr 
Las Vegas/Macau: casinos 
Anywhere in the world: a bank 

Get experience. 
Employ people to my social media etc 

Potentially start my own political advocacy group. 

Potentially do a JD (Ma) at Harvard/a top 30 law school (school of foreign relations/government) 

Everything hinges on OU lmao 

Also interested in Fashion, Commercial Space Mining, Fried Chicken. 

The apartments I put online? 
I want one in Switzerland like on my twitter
One in Malibu 

Because it’s all being choked out online 
You can’t tell me nothin - Kanye 

Financial Loans? I don’t mind 
My friends can run it up 
We could theoretically get unlimited money 
Pay back borrowed money with interest, keep profit 
Then borrow more 

Like 

Borrow
100
Make 300
Pay back 150 
We have 150 

Borrow 100
Make 750
Pay back 150 
We have 600 

*4 scale factor the gang 

For example 
A flipping business model 

Loads of opportunities 

No conspiracies 
Just making eachother better 
Improving eachother ❤️

For motivation; 
My biggest thing isn’t success per sé
It’s about earning societies trust 
I can be successful as a bitch, and be exposed in the guardian , be ruined and then my suicide note where I reason out my death and what snakes say at my funeral actually bears ground lmao 

But yeah 
Must win

aiwj7j,2,2019-01-23,Line between friend and love interest is fuzzy,disposableac427,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/aiwj7j/line_between_friend_and_love_interest_is_fuzzy/,"This is typed from a throwaway account. Having trouble distinguishing between mere friendly gestures and gestures for actual romantic interest. I still have a lot to learn so please go easy on me XD  


Quite a bit of context to go through since I had it bottled up for a while and finally decided it is better to open up to seek advice.  


I \[M18\] met this girl \[F17\] at an internship at the local paper back home a year and a half ago as part of a summer program. I was trying to meet new people, so I cracked a few more jokes as usual and made friends with her and exchanged numbers. She was very shy, had no social media, and generally preferred to stay alone with a modest friend circle.  


I was very inexperienced, so after a few weeks of friendly conversation and a brief lunch, I interpreted as interest and confessed my own feelings for her. She reasonably turned me down citing that she really doesn't know me that well.  


I still like her as a friend, and recognized that she wanted to continue being just friends as well, so I cast aside my feelings to try to be genuine friends with her. She isn't a good texter, and I had to discreetly collect my own feelings after being rejected. 99% of the texts was initiated by me, though I do get sentence-long replies.  


The texts faded away through the seasons into 2018, with every reply now taking at least a week, if not a month to be responded to-- and it took me a lot of ""poking the shell with a stick"" (which I now know is bad texting behavior) to get a reply. She seems to always be busy with the school curriculum, and I tried to respect that by not texting her anywhere close to the realm of being frequent.   


During that time we still share tidbits of our own hobbies, with her proudly showing her art contributions towards her school projects and me showing her my publishing novels and select photos of me giving a speech at a middle school as part of a publisher-sanctioned public appearance. Like I said though, these texts are scant.  


This past July, with the knowledge that I'm headed to the United States for college, I asked her out to some ice skating as part of the ""horribly conceived farewell activities"" to my friends back home (to make them memorable) since I have no idea how to ice skate. After a few schedule-related discussions, she agreed, and after she told me to chill since ""we're hanging out"" but promising that she will dress up for me, we went ice skating. Since I'm prone to falls, she caught me by the hand a few times before I worked out from her how to do basic slides and short walks to encircle the rink. I let her skate a few laps after she let me know that she used to have ice skating classes, while I slid alone.   


I've never seen her smile that brightly before, and while my back is turned as I was leaning against the sidewalls for a break, she swooped by without me noticing and I felt her hand touching my right hand a few times before finally catching the railing. I had no idea if this was intentional. Before we left, we snapped a picture of us both, and our texts became more and more frequent, happening basically every day.  


I regained feelings for her, but since I wanted to be respectful of her rejection, I never acknowledged her physical contacts as I interpret it to be purely instructional, but I spent my entire freshman semester just fantasizing us both together. The texts never did stop, though sometimes it was spaced out due to her return to the curriculum, and I continued trying to be supportive as a friend. I asked her more about herself, and even sent a few gifts back home after learning that she likes stuffed animals.  


I went home during the winter and asked her out by literally saying ""Do you wanna go out?"" (which I still have no idea if it is purely platonic or not), and her immediately making plans. We spent a few hours catching up and playing video games together. She was visibly nervous at times, and purposely touched me for the first time as we are getting coffee.   


The texts continued after that, and about a week after I returned to the US, she began cluing me on how she has been failing in some of her exams, something deeply personal that she has never divulged to me before, and began initiating texts every day, without fail so far.  


What do you think I should do?"
aix1jd,81,2019-01-23,[Rant] My terrible experience with my universities lgbt club,Sgtguy123,LGBTeens,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTeens/comments/aix1jd/rant_my_terrible_experience_with_my_universities/,"So 2 weeks ago I decided to go to my schools lgbt club, I figured it would be a good way to find a boyfriend. Since these people are pretty well known around campus some of them get propositioned by closet cases and then they always share the details.

So onto the story I went to one of the meetings and at first everyone seemed friendly and I was introduced to the ""president"" of the club and he and I striked up a conversation with him. He asked me why I joined the club I told him the truth that I was using it to find a relationship.

After hearing that he told me ""say no more"" and started trying to set me up with another member of the club saying that were both single gay and looking for a boyfriend. Long story short he wasn't my type I talked to him until the end of the meeting and then we parted ways. I hung back for a little while because the president asked me to. He sked me what I thought of my ""boyfriend"" and I told him he seemed like a nice guy but he wasn't my type.

The president kept asking me why I wasn't into the guy he set me up with and I didn't want to answer why as because I didn't want drama in case he told him, and I wouldn't have told him if he hadn't said that he needs to know my type if he's going to set me up with guys in the future so I told him my preference was that I like masculine guys and that the guy he set me up with while nice wasn't masculine enough for me.

The president was clearly taken back by this and said how about fats and asians. So I told him sorry man I like what I like we all have our preferences. He gave me the typical speal about how my ""masc4masc"" preferencw was internalized homophobia caused by years of exposure to toxic masculinity. As a psych major with a 3.9 gpa and a really exclusive internship I knew what he was saying was bullshit because first of all I grew up in a very tolerant town went to a very tolerant private school my whole life came out at 15, second of all it's nonsensical to assume that everyone who has a prefrence has it for the same reason.

I decided to just leave instead of explaining myself he already made up his mind about me. I didn't go to the next meeting but I saw it on snap and it was about masc4masc and the moment their beloved president mentioned how everyone who says that is struggling with self hatred and internalized homophobia and br gif a standing ovation . I noticed this attitude is very common in the gay community and I cant stand it I hate when people assume they know more about me and my subconcious then I do. So lesson learned don't go to lgbt spaces"

&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht ‘IND ontbreekt vaak in de rechtszaal bij zaken afgewezen asielzoekers’ 1&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, ik ben bekend met dit bericht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herkent u het signaal dat afgegeven wordt door de voorzitter van de Nederlandse Vereniging voor Rechtspraak dat de IND in 75% van de zaken niet komt opdagen op de zitting? Zo ja, wat is uw verklaring hiervoor? Zo nee, hoe vaak is de IND volgens u afwezig bij zittingen? Hoe vaak leidt de afwezigheid van een procesvertegenwoordiger van de IND tot uitstel van de zaak?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit cijfers van de IND blijkt dat de IND vanaf april 2018 in circa 20% van de zaken niet aanwezig is geweest bij de zitting. In deze gevallen is een afweging gemaakt om niet ter zitting aanwezig te zijn en is een schriftelijk standpunt ingestuurd. Voor het plaatsvinden van een zitting is het niet noodzakelijk dat alle procespartijen aanwezig zijn. Het niet ter zitting aanwezig zijn van de IND leidt dan ook niet tot uitstel in een zaak.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is de reden dat procesvertegenwoordigers van de IND bij zittingen afwezig zijn? Op welke wijze wordt gekozen welke zaken wel en welke zaken niet worden bijgewoond?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De IND heeft de rechtbanken eind maart 2018 laten weten dat zij vanwege het hoge werkaanbod in een gedeelte van de zaken volstaan met een schriftelijke reactie in plaats van aanwezig te zijn bij de zitting. In rechtszaken die vanwege de korte termijnen alleen mondeling worden behandeld zal de IND in beginsel altijd aanwezig zijn. Dit geldt ook voor zaken met een bijzonder belang zoals zaken die verband houden met de openbare orde of nationale veiligheid en zaken die worden behandeld door de meervoudige kamer.     
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het zorgelijk is als de IND een grote rol speelt bij het veroorzaken van vertragingen in asielzaken door afwezigheid tijdens zittingen, en dat dit zoveel mogelijk voorkomen moet worden? Zo ja, welke maatregelen gaat u nemen teneinde dit probleem op te lossen? Op welke termijn verwacht u resultaat van dergelijke maatregelen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u van mening dat het afwezig zijn van de IND tegenstrijdig is met uw inzet de wachttijden bij de IND juist terug te brengen  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 4 en 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er is geen sprake van automatische vertraging van de beroepszaak door de afwezigheid van de IND. Een zitting zal ook zonder aanwezigheid van de IND doorgang vinden. Als de IND afwezig is bij een zitting dan zal de rechter in eerste instantie bezien of hij door middel van alle in het dossier aanwezige stukken, waaronder de schriftelijke reactie van de IND, voldoende geïnformeerd is om over de zaak te beslissen. Als dat niet het geval is dan kan er een korte extra termijn gemoeid zijn met het beantwoorden van schriftelijke vragen die ter zitting zijn gerezen en die bij afwezigheid van de IND niet beantwoord konden worden. Doorgaans wordt daar enkele dagen voor gegeven. Ook in zaken waarin de IND wel verschijnt komt het echter voor dat er schriftelijke vragen worden gesteld.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Waarom lukt het nu niet goed de wachttijden terug te brengen, terwijl de instroom in voorgaande jaren hoger was?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
In 2018 was er een hogere en andere samenstelling van de asielinstroom dan vooraf was geprognotiseerd. Veel meer asielverzoeken dan verwacht zijn bijvoorbeeld terecht gekomen in de verlengde procedure omdat ze complex zijn. Dat maakt dat de IND voor de uitdaging staat hierin mee te bewegen. Om die reden heeft de IND, zoals ik uw kamer eerder heb gemeld, extra personeel aangetrokken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herinnert u zich de antwoorden op de schriftelijke vragen van het lid Groothuizen &amp;#40;D66&amp;#41; over de wachttijden bij de IND waarin u schreef dat de strategische personeelsplanning van het IND wordt aangepast teneinde de instroom en werklast beter op te vangen? Hoe staat het met de door u genoemde strategische personeelsplanning? Wanneer verwacht u hiervan resultaat? Bent u bereid in de wijziging van deze personeelsplanning ook aandacht te besteden aan de problematiek rondom de afwezigheid van de IND bij de zittingen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Begin 2018 is door de IND in het Meerjarenperspectief IND 2018 – 2022 &amp;#40;MJP&amp;#41; de stip op de horizon geschetst voor de &amp;#40;door&amp;#41;ontwikkeling naar een toekomstbestendige IND. Uit dit MJP volgen verschillende ontwikkeltrajecten met de daaruit voortvloeiende personele gevolgen. Momenteel vinden onderzoeken plaats naar hoeveel van welke functies wanneer in de tijd &amp;#40;nieuw&amp;#41; zullen ontstaan, veranderen of vervallen als gevolg van informatiegestuurd werken en E-dienstverlening. Ook is er in 2018 een nieuw tijdschrijfonderzoek gehouden. Met de uitkomsten van deze onderzoeken zal de IND in de loop van 2019 de strategische personeelsplanning nader vorm geven.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast heeft de IND, zoals ik reeds eerder aan uw kamer heb bericht, in de afgelopen periode reeds actie ondernomen om extra personeel aan te nemen om ervoor te zorgen dat de aanvragen om een verblijfsvergunning  tijdig behandeld worden. Ook is de IND inmiddels een wervingstraject gestart, dat erop gericht is om eind 2019 weer voldoende procesvertegenwoordigers te hebben geworven, opgeleid en ingewerkt om bij alle zittingen te kunnen zijn.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe staat het met het aantrekken van nieuw personeel bij de IND? Bij hoeveel van de 198 fte vacatures die openstaan, is het tot nu toe gelukt deze in te vullen? Hoe lang duurt het gemiddeld voordat een nieuwe medewerker volwaardig kan meedraaien in het werkproces? Krijgen nieuw aan te trekken medewerkers een vast dienstverband? Zo nee, waarom niet? Bent u van oordeel dat een dienstverband bij de IND voldoende aantrekkelijk is voor goed gekwalificeerde mensen in vergelijking met andere werkgevers? Zo nee, welke knelpunten ziet u en wat gaat u eraan doen om deze op te lossen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
De IND heeft het merendeel van de vacatures die recent openstonden kunnen vervullen. De 198 vacatures waarvan eerder sprake was zijn inmiddels allemaal vervuld. Het is in het algemeen afhankelijk van de aard van de vacature &amp;#40;niveau, intern of extern, de duur van aangeboden contract, vast of tijdelijk, et cetera&amp;#41; hoe lang een vacature openstaat. De IND loopt hierbij vooralsnog niet tegen specifieke problemen aan, alle vacatures worden binnen redelijke termijnen vervuld. Echter, met het aantrekken van nieuw personeel is tijd gemoeid, niet alleen als het om het werven gaat maar ook als het gaat om opleiden en inwerken. Afhankelijk van de werksoort kan hier 6 tot 18 maanden mee gemoeid zijn voordat medewerkers volledig en zelfstandig inzetbaar zijn.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Gelet op de investering die het vraagt om medewerkers in te werken hecht de IND er dan ook aan om medewerkers voor langere tijd aan zich te binden. De IND vindt het belangrijk om een goede werkgever te zijn en goed personeel aan zich te binden. De IND heeft daarom in 2016 en in de afgelopen maanden ook veel gedetacheerden in vaste dienst genomen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik ben van mening dat een betrekking bij de IND voldoende aantrekkelijk is voor goed gekwalificeerde mensen. De veranderende arbeidsmarkt maakt het natuurlijk wel uitdagend om snel goed gekwalificeerd personeel te vinden en ook het verloop hoger is dan enige jaren geleden gelet op de mogelijkheden die er momenteel op de arbeidsmarkt zijn voor goed opgeleid personeel. Dat is geen uniek probleem voor de IND maar speelt bij meerdere organisaties zowel binnen het Rijk als daarbuiten.

aiyj2y,1,2019-01-23,Student with some debt and finance issues,thisbearisgood,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/aiyj2y/student_with_some_debt_and_finance_issues/,"Hey guys, i'm a full time Californian student and I have some debt that is eating away at me and i'm struggling to make headway on it so I was hoping to get some advice.

I currently have $3,200 in CC debt on a high interest basic bank of america card. This thing is really messing me up and I've only been able to budget the minimums the past 6mo and the interest is so high that it almost negates it. I haven't missed payments but since maxing it out my credit dropped to the low 700s from 790. 

I also have $500 left on a low interest car loan that i'm putting $60 toward each month (minimum). But, I have $300-400 in registration, plate, and late fees on it that i've been avoiding due to lack of money.

I'm a 3rd year with a full ride grant/scholarship to my uni for engineering but I haven't been able to work due to my course load. Thankfully this quarter i'm only taking 4 classes so I was going to pick up a job and chip away at this debt and into the summer where i'll get a paid internship.


I guess my question is how do I deal with my CC? I feel like I should balance transfer it onto a better interest rate card but I haven't really done enough research on it (everything's been on the back burner with school). 

Just been stressed cause i've never been in debt like this but had to max it out due to some family and health concerns. 

Any suggestions or financing tips for the future are appreciated. Thank you all."
aiyv6v,11,2019-01-23,Success story,universemessages,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/aiyv6v/success_story/,"I haven't posted here in many many months, maybe even a year or more. But hi, my name is universemessages, I'm 25 years old, and I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2, borderline personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder. I don't work and I'm on disability financial assistance.

In May of 2017 I started to see a therapist for the first time. She was awesome. She made me write a list of all the things I don't want in a relationship. And all the things I won't accept in my life. I also bought the DBT workbook for myself around this time.

On July 1st, 2017, I broke up with an abusive boyfriend and immediately reinstalled tinder. I was recently taken off of depakote because it was worsening my PCOS symptoms. I was on no medication, I went completely hypomanic, and decided I wanted to be the biggest slut ever. I bought tinder premium, swiped right on every profile, and messaged every match. I made an account on a camming website and made a few hundred dollars in a night just for showing my naked body.

Two weeks later I got a message back from a guy on Tinder that had an actual conversation with me. That Friday we talked on the phone for four hours. The next weekend we went on our first date. He was really nice, had been sober for years, and lived at home with his parents. My bipolar kept wanting me to sleep with him and then ghost him. But my BPD wanted to be his favourite person. The day after our first date, I saw my psychiatrist and he prescribed me lithium. I was lucky and felt results in the first two days.

My therapist finished her internship and I had to stop seeing her. The new guy took me on dates every single weekend from then on.

Labour Day weekend that year I went out with friends and got drunk. I drove them all home then picked up some McDonalds. I parked beside the cafe by my place to eat before I parked at my own place (I don't know why). A girl got into the passenger side of my car, held a knife to my stomach and told me to drive. So I did. The situation went on for hours and then I got home safely. My car was vandalized to the point of being written off the following week. The guy I was seeing ended up buying me another car.

On October 28th, 2017 at 12am I had my last drop of alcohol. I've been completely sober since then.

I started therapy again and went every 3 weeks.

Me and this guy were very serious at this point. We went for a vacation trip in the mountains in May 2018. He convinced me to apply to university even though I don't even have my highschool. I applied as a mature student and I was accepted. I'm now in University, part time.

We got engaged Christmas Day, 2018.

Last Thursday I was driving to his parents' place an hour and a half away from my city to announce our engagement over the weekend. It was the coldest day of the year and I hit a deer on the highway, writing off my car. I'm completely fine, was very shaken up. Usually I would have been inconsolable. This time I dealt with it fine, I even laughed after. I guess I don't need a car right now anyway, lol.

My fiance and I plan on moving in together in April.

I didn't want to post this story to just tell my life story, or to brag. I just wanted to show that life goes on, and therapy can show some serious results.

I ended up being extremely lucky in several situations. For instance if I had never met my fiance, I had plans to go into prostitution. Doing that without any type of protection or under a business is extremely dangerous.

I'm also lucky because I went from relationship to relationship SO quickly, and ended up finding someone that encourages my growth and recovery from my illnesses. I had been in many awful relationships in the past, even bad friendships. And don't get me started on family. It was a breath of fresh air and still is.

I know most people aren't that lucky. But I've been through a ton of shit and I had no hope. Therapy, getting sober from all drugs and alcohol, and good medication really showed a difference for me. BPD is a personality disorder, it's totally possible of minimizing symptoms just with therapy. Some people even get undiagnosed if they stop showing enough symptoms. Bipolar is a little more tricky for me, but I got the hang of it for the most part.

I started seeing psychiatrists and taking meds when I was 12 years old. I started hearing voices when I was 7 years old. I had so many misdiagnosis, I took so many meds for such a long time that just made me worse and worse. It was hell, and I can't believe it went on for that long. So many attempts and so many hospitalizations.

If you're a person that has been in the mental health system for a long time and you aren't seeing any changes, hang in there. Keep fighting. Stand up for yourself. If you aren't getting what you need, DEMAND it. Be a fucking can-I-speak-to-the-manager-haircut kind of person and fucking harrass your doctors! And if your doctor is a waste, change doctors. And if your town or city's selection of doctors sucks, move! Life is short and there are people, doctors, social workers, and therapists out there that can help you get to where you wanna be.

My heart goes out to all of you and I hope you have a good morning!"

I submitted a request yesterday, but I was able to get some money so I don't need nearly as much and I also don't think my last post was sufficient. 

Due to unexpected situations, I have fallen dangerously behind on rent and some of my bills. My fiance has been out of work due to her internship for her master's program. We need $400 via PayPal and we can provide proof of our current loan/bill account balances. The $400 plus an additional $250 will be paid in full on or before September 1st. I can make a payment on the 11th and the 25th, but my fiance has a school refund coming in as well so paying the money back will not be a problem. Thank you for your time.

aj21x9,3,2019-01-23,Ohio CPA license requirements,EmbraceRisk2222,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/aj21x9/ohio_cpa_license_requirements/,"  

I am sitting for CPA exams in Ohio but currently reside in a different state. I went to college in Ohio and worked in Ohio for a little bit less than a year after college and before I moved to a different state. I am planning on applying for Ohio license once I have passed all exams. I have couple questions on applying for CPA license in the State of Ohio: 

Residency

According to Accountancy Board of Ohio: “A candidate must fulfill the residence requirement by passing a section of the exam as an Ohio resident and the credit is valid, or be a resident of Ohio at the time of application for the CPA certificate.”  

I might move back to Ohio in the future but may not be a resident of Ohio at the time that I apply for license. Therefore, the latter does not apply in my case. I did pass audit section when I was a resident of Ohio but the credit is expiring soon (3/31/2019). What happens if I lose the audit credit and had to take it under resident of different State…? Was anyone in the same situation?  

Experience

I had a cumulative working experience of 13 months, including two internships back in college and one full-time job after college. Both internships and full-time job were in public accounting and was supervised under licensed CPAs. As far as I know, the internships hours can be counted toward CPA experience. However, there are gaps in these employments as internships were during college years and full-time job post college that lasted 9 months before I moved. I don’t know if that could be an issue when determining the experience requirement. The board states that a minimum of one-year experience is required but I feel this part is a little bit vague. Considering folks in big4, they work numerous hours during busy season. Their 9 months of work in terms of hours might be equivalent of someone who work in the industry. 

Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions."

I'm sure you all hate these types of posts but I am just feeling really down after my friends pretty much convinced me I had no chance of getting accepted into Madison. I'm out of state, so that really hurts my application I'm sure. Im applying to the Computer Science program. Anyways, here are my stats:

GPA: 3.8 W

ECS: Varisty Baseball, Internship with Xilinx, Musician of many types (piano, keyboard, jazz band, many different compositions, etc), DECA Officer and state qualifier, and I have had several different jobs as well (Competitive Baseball Umpire, Retail Job, etc). 


I have taken just about the hardest curriculum at my high school, with the exception of the AP History classes. 



If I had to guess I would say that my essay is about average but my Why Wisconsin? response was well above average.

I’ve been in a slump for a couple of years now. Im currently in college trying to finish my degree and supposed to graduate in May if everything goes smoothly, but I’m struggling. I feel okay sometimes but most of the time I feel down. I live at home with my great grandparents and my brother. A couple of years ago my great grandmother had a stroke and went to a rehabilitation center. She now struggles with dementia and hears things that aren’t there but that could also be because she never wanted to wear hearing aids and can’t hear so well anymore. I quit my job after being accused of something I didn’t do, got a right up for it and couldn’t stand being there anymore. Most days I’m home now since I cut my classes down to part time; I usually spend a lot of time in my room watching tv or playing video games. Sometimes, I pick up my guitar and play it and teach myself new things. I also like to draw but I had a hard time doing that because I lack the motivation to do it. My mom doesn’t live with us but comes here to assist my great grandmother as part of her job but hasn’t been coming everyday like she’s supposed to. Which in turn leaves me in turn to assist her which I don’t mind but it’s just another thing on my plate. My grandmother works really hard takes time out of her day to come help out at the house. She struggles with money issues. Right now I’m falling behind in class and got an email from my professor saying she was concerned that I wouldn’t be able to pass the class with the amount of classes I’ve missed. I have these two classes and two others next tri in progress and my internship then I’m finished with the requirements for my degree. Sometimes I feel like even though people tell me my work is good, I don’t feel like it is and that even though I’ll have a degree I won’t have any luck of making it in the industry. I want to succeed, attend class, and graduate but I’m struggling with getting there. I’m constantly thinking about negative things and the thought of death always pops in my mind, not in a suicidal way but like thinking of my great grandparents passing away here and me finding them or something because of their numerous health problems. My appearance is another thing to the way I’ve been feeling. I was once 300lbs but I lost 130lbs a while back and recently put on a significant amount of weight where I’ve been sitting at 245lbs for a while. I’ve been trying to go back to the gym like I used to but I have no motivation for that either. I’ve also been smoking weed for a while. I used to smoke a couple of blunts a day and and it never used to be a problem. Overtime I’ve cut it down to making a gram or two last about a week. I’ve been trying to get myself to stop but I’m having trouble with that too. I can’t  get out of this rut that I’m in. I apologize for this jumbled mess; I’m just trying to speak about what’s on my mind. If someone could give some advice. "

I met this amazing girl at a concert in June of 2017, lets call her K, K is from Canada but came down to a concert in the states to see her favorite artist. I live in the states but pretty far north, total travel time from my house to her's is around 2.5 hours with no boarder traffic. After the concert we went on two dates but ultimately decided to stay friends and not pursue anything further because we didn't see a foreseeable future where we would not be long distance. Fast forward to march 2018, we still have feelings for one another and decide to go to a concert together knowing that we will have to make another hard choice. This time while having the talk she tells me that she has always wanted to move out of Canada and might have an internship lined up in the states in October of that year. With a light at the end of tunnel we decide to try things out and took the dive into a long distance relationship. 

**The Relationship**

For the first 3 months things were great, we would go on weekend long trips to each other once every two weeks. K was the most kind, patient and understanding person I have ever dated and we got along great. K then told me that her internship fell through since it was probably going to be unpaid and there would be no way she could afford to live in the states on an unpaid internship. So we had to push back the ""move date"" to June of 2019, when she would graduate from her college and look for a job in the states. Around month 5 K was dropping some heavy hints that she was ready to drop the ""I love you"", I on the other hand was not ready. My fears of our long distance held me back emotionally, I was scared that because of the distance between us our relationship could end. Then in October 2018 K comes to me with more bad news, that she is switching majors and schools and her graduation date will probably be June of 2020. My initial reaction to this was to end things right there, the fear of waiting 2 years for my girlfriend to move was almost too much for me. I did some self reflection and came to the conclusion that I didn't want to end things because of my initial shock of having to wait more. I decided that in 2019 I needed to figure out if K was the one for me, if she was going to be the person I spend the rest of my life with.  I wanted to start truly enjoying our relationship instead of always looking out for the day she would move to my city. We stayed together and spent new years together, we rang in 2019 with another concert and I really started feeling myself let go of my long distance anxiety and fall for her. I was planning on telling her on valentines day how I felt, if things went well. 

**The Break up**

It was maybe a week into 2019 when we started to have really bad fights. My job started pushing me to work 13 hours a day, she signed up for some classes and money was tight for her, it had an emotional drain on both of us. We had a huge fight about me feeling unappreciated and her feeling insecure about the future, it ended with a break where we took a step back from each other for a day or two. K and I talked it all out over the phone but then she broke the news to me, her grandmother who recently had some severe blood pressure issues told K ""to not leave Canada until she passes"". I said we should table that conversation until we are in person next. Unfortunately the next couple days K and I were still more distant than ever.  K then asked me why I would never move to Canada for her, I told her that I never wanted to move but she did, her move to the US would be for her dreams of a fresh start but also for us. Ultimately she wanted an ""I love you"" from me and I couldn't say it even though a part of me does love her. For me to say ""i love you"" means that I would be willing to move for her, willing to do anything to make this love last, which unfortunately at the time of her asking I was not ready to do. With the situation of her grandmother's wishes she couldn't give me an end date to our long distance relationship. We both wanted different things that the other couldn't give so we decided to end our relationship and both agreed it just wasn't the right time for us. 

**Current Situation**

K reached out to me three days after our break up and said that it was wrong for her to put that much pressure on me. She said it was unfair for her to push me to say ""I love you"", I told her I understood why she wanted it, going nine months without an ""I love you"" is a long time.  We agreed that our relationship was too special to end over the phone and that we will meet one more time to talk about what to do in person. However we both agreed if we had that face to face meeting soon we would just get back together because we are still in shock from the break up. We agreed to reach out and plan that face to face when the hurt of losing the other person has lessened. So now I am here, wondering what I should do next, with a million questions running through my head. With her grandmother's health in question we no longer have a date on when our long distance will end. However there is only 2.5 hour drive and a boarder between us. But the boarder between us means that if she cant find a job to sponsor her that the only time she will be able to move here is when we get married.  All my friends and family want us to stay broken up, they never had a long distance relationship go successfully and want me to start fresh with someone in the US before I get too old. Looking for advice on what to do when I see her next, thank you for listening!

**TLDR:** My girlfriend and I of nine months live only 2.5 hours away from each other, she lives in a different country and planned to move to my city in 2020. Recently her grandmother told her she doesn't want her to move until the grandmother passes away. We had a mutual break up over this saying it wasn't the right time for us, but agreed to reconnect in person to decide if we should stay broken up or get back together."

aj2m75,2,2019-01-23,Family Issues,throwaway1929331,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/aj2m75/family_issues/,"This is quite obviously a throwaway, cause a few IRL friends know my reddit tag. This is possibly going to be a very very long post, I just 1 or 2 of you guys will read it and if possible offer some advice. Being the only child to my parents, I cant mention this to anyone else. I do have friends, but I don't want them to see me like this, and I don't want to it to spread. English isn't my first language so forgive any grammatical mistakes.

I'm going to start with a quite a bit of background,okay here it goes. I'm currently 21 years old, living in a developing country. I am almost done with my engineering and have secured a good job with decent pay considering where I live.

The issue started from I was about 6-7 years old cause that's the furthest I can remember. My dad's business partner cheated him, which resulted in him loosing all cash. To add more weight to this incident, I'd need to give you a little background about that. He grew up with very little money (poor enough not to be able to afford footwear), with that he worked his way up to a lower-middle to middle class wages, where we could afford a house for rent which is fairly okay. Going back to the original part, once he was betrayed (which happened when he was in the hospital, from an road accident) (he's fine now although his left ankle kinda got fucked which makes it hard for him to walk long stretches like a kilometer) . Coming back, that accident left my dad spiraling, he left town completely (partially due some argument with maternal grandparents) changed professions to a project consultant, where he would get paid only and only when he completed a project completely making it an very unstable source of income. My mom who is also a working women, made enough to live an average life and raise a kid. In about 1.5 years back then, my dad only spoke to my mom, maybe thrice which did affect my mom. During this time I lived with my grandparents and my mom. After the 1.5 year break I mentioned, my father came back to town after making enough money to live comfortably for a year. Me, mom, dad and my dad's parents, started living under one roof again. Till date(2007-2019) due to his poor decisions and bad luck he hasnt many any significant money. Whereas my mom has continued to work which did end up becoming the steady financial income that has kept us going. In the last 10-11 years my mom has had continuous cycles of depression, where it has gone to her talking about suicide often even when I was barely 13-14 years old, which definitely scarred me to some extent. They came close a divorce in 2009 and 2015. My mom over the years had a lot of disagreements with her coworkers which she didnt take very well, which was also a major cause of her depression. I've first hand seen what devastating effects depression can have on you. From when I've been emotionally mature enough I've tried. I sat hours sitting beside my mom both crying trying to make her understand that work and home pressure isn't the end, it will get better. In 2015 her depression worsened, her short term memory went to shit. She wasn't able to focus on anything. She works in a government job, so only thing that she had going for her was job security. She started lashing out at home, by insulting my paternal grandfather, which my dad is extremely short tempered didn't take very well. This caused them to end up taking a break. My mom again moved back into my maternal grandfather's house. This was right around the time I had to leave for University. I ended up getting a couple of good universities, 2 of which was like an 8hour drive from home and another in the same town where I lived. I really didn't want any of this, so I chose the one outside town which I thought would be best for my education. The fees of this university was around 1/4th the total salary of my mother early, which my maternal grandparents hated and tried to get me to stay in town and get my parents back together. My dad now almost income-less, started using my grandfather's pension to survive, for the both of them. And yeah BTW my paternal grandmother died in 2008. Now both of them (my dad and his dad), could afford the house he was living in. So my uncle, dad's younger brother (along with his wife and two kids) who also was in financial trouble decided to that all of them living under one roof would work out financially. They tried for a year, and then due to some other argument they had a falling out. Now my dad and grandfather moved into another smaller house in some other part of the city. After a year and half, somewhere mid 2016 they got back together, and in 2017 my mom took out a loan and bought a house. Everything seemed to go fine, for a while. Then things went back to the normal cycle where some work incident causes my mom to go into depression which in-turn leads her to lash out at home, which causes my dad to throw a fit and everything going to shit. From 2015-2019 I was at University, spending my holidays split up at either my mom's place or my dad's place. And somehow I convinced to my mom to fund my  security deposit for a flat I just moved into with a college friend who is also a colleague. And when I think I'm finally doing well at my internship, I get a call today where my mom is crying over the phone after some coworker of her indirectly insulted her at the office. She can't really turn for emotional support from my dad. A couple of sad things I also forgot to mention, I got bullied in school for 2 years, I also have had no relationships in the past, and only recently made a few female friends. I was addicted to Pot and gaming for 2 years at college (never been caught). My parents have no idea that I drink, and that gives a guilty feeling about using their money to do something so selfish. The only thing I am happy about is that I'll always have this group of 10-15 friends ( from various circles), who I know I won't loose contact with. A few of them I know since I was 5 years old. Today during an company sports tournament I got injured, I'm definitely in some physical pain, but this emotional pain greatly exceeds any physical thing.

My parents maybe a terrible wife and a terrible husband but they have always been great parents to me. They have never told no to any sort of expenses if it involves my education. They have sacrificed multiple things so I could have a better life. They have complained about each other to me for the last 5 years, not realizing the emotional stress or burden I go through. I'm sorry for the terrible formatting or the chronological order. I have never told this entire thing to anyone before. Even if you don't comment or DM, thanks for reading I'm happy someone knows my plight. I don't know what I'll get from this, but typing it all out helped. Even though I want to leave this country and go somewhere, I know I won't be able to afford a education for masters in such colleges and neither will my parents."

aj343y,65,2019-01-23,"Freeuse, Ohio",AlexLaurrose,freeuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/freeuse/comments/aj343y/freeuse_ohio/,"Entering the eighteen-and-over school cafeteria, Alyssa scanned her surroundings. She saw her friend Becky waving at her from across the room.

“Over here, Alyssa, I have saved you a seat.”

She grabbed some lunch and sat on her friend’s table.

Becky Anderson was her best friend in the whole world. Maybe a bit vapid, but good-hearted. And, quite honestly, the most popular girl in school. It didn’t hurt that she had a smoking hot body, complete with the most amazing big, perky and amazingly natural set of tits.

Unsurprisingly, those tits were the center of attention at their table. A boy whose name Alyssa couldn’t quite remember was sitting next to Becky and mauling her ample bosom. He was running his hand up and down between them, and he had the most stupid look on his face.

That wasn’t a rare occurrence at all in the cafeteria. All around them, horny young boys were groping, mauling, fucking their female classmates. And the girls were sure enjoying the attention.

“How are you doing, Aly?” asked Becky. “Do you know Chad here?”

“Brad,” said the boy, not stopping playing with her boobs for even a second, in fact not even lifting his eyes up. He had now lifted her shirt, exposing her Double Ds to the world, and pinching her pink nipples.

“Whatever,” said Becky. “So, how’s your day going?” turning back to Alyssa.

“Oh, you know, this and that. Where’s Dorothy? I haven’t seen her all morning.”

“Yeah, she started her internship today, over at Sommers and Emerson.”

“Oh my god, seriously? My mom works there. She’s Mr. Sommers’s personal assistant.”

“Heh, small world, isn’t it?”

“Maybe I’ll call her later and see how she’s doing or if she wants me to pull some strings for her,” she laughed.

“Oh, don’t worry about it. If I know Dorothy, she’s perfectly capable of pulling some strings herself.”

“Haha, that’s true.” Dorothy was really smart, and her intelligence combined with her tight teen body, especially her juicy ass, guaranteed that she would go very far in life. “What about you, are you going through with what you were talking about? My dad didn’t say anything.”

“Yes, expect to see me at your front porch tonight. Also, expect to have to turn the music in your room way up, if you know what I mean.”

“You know he’s going to want to put it in your ass, right?”

“Yes, I gathered as much when he made me agree to let him do whatever he wants to me. Still, it’s not like I haven’t done it before. Isn’t that right, Chad?” By now, Brad had slipped his hand inside Becky’s shorts, and he didn’t seem to have time even to correct her for using the wrong name again. “Yes, Chad has fucked me in the ass plenty of times, and he’s not the only one. I think I will be able to handle your dad.”

Alyssa wasn’t so sure about that. She had heard stories from other girls about her dad’s size. She was contemplating saying something when she felt a tap on her shoulder.

“Excuse me, Alyssa.”

She turned around and looked at the owner of the voice. “Oh, hello Josh. How’s it going?”. It was Josh Simmons, a boy from her chemistry class. Lanky physique and bespectacled, but cute in his own way. Alyssa always had a thing for geeks.

“Good, good. I was wondering...”

“Sure, I will scoot over, give you better access to Becky.”

“Actually, I wanted you to, you know...”

That came as a surprise. Alyssa wasn’t a bad looking girl, and she wasn’t a virgin either. She had been used by men plenty of times in her own right. But it was really rare to be asked when the mighty Becky Anderson was right there.

But now an actual boy had asked for her services. Not a homeless guy on her way home from school, not a stranger on the bus, not one of her older neighbors. An actual boy. And a rather cute one at that!

“Wanted me to what?” she asked, trying to sound cool, and not particularly succeeding at it.

“Wanted you to suck my cock, if it’s not too much trouble,” he said. By now, he had turned a bright red, and couldn’t seem to manage to keep eye contact with her.

“Certainly, honey. That’s what I’m here for,” she said, and reached out and cupped his bulge over his pants. She found shyness in a guy to be a huge turn on, and her little pussy was tingling inside her shorts. Judging by what she felt when she touched him, this wouldn’t take long. She hurried up and undid his pants, releasing his member. It was already like eighty percent hard, and it was getting harder by the second. She decided to be a little conservative in her approach and started licking his balls.

“Do you like it when I lick your balls, baby?”

“Yes! Yes! I love it!” She hadn’t touched his cock yet, but it was twitching like crazy nonetheless.

“Let’s see how you’ll like this then.” She ran her tongue up the length of his shaft, reaching and flipping his circumcised head at the end. She felt it hardening even more, and he heard him groaning.

“Tell me again, what do you want?” she asked.

He looked her straight in the eyes. “I want you to suck my dick.” He sounded more confident now. Having a girl’s lips on your cock does that to a man.

“Mmmm yes, sir.” She shoved as much of his rod in her mouth as she could. She began slobbering all around it and pushing it further. And she kept her big eyes locked with his, daring him to cum.

It didn’t take him long before he grabbed her head with his hands and kept it in place. His cock exploded in her mouth, flooding it with semen. God, how much semen! Alyssa wondered how long he was saving up for that load. She couldn’t possibly swallow it all, but she did her best. Much of it ended on her face and on her clothes.

She looked up. “That’s some quite impressive volume, Josh, but you have to work on your stamina. Anyway, thanks for the lunch,” she winked at him.

Even though Josh had just come, he seemed to be straining. She realized he was trying to say something, and she stopped talking to give him the chance to say it.

“Willyougooutwithme?” he blurted out in one breath.

“What?”

“Will you go out with me?” he said again, composing himself.

“Nothing fancy, a movie and some dinner.”

Now it was Alyssa’s turn to blush. Josh was her type, geeky and shy. She would absolutely love to go out with him.

Informal find/haul/review since I got this before I created an account to post on repladies and I don’t have any pics of what it looked like. It’s also mostly unbranded stuff as I was testing out taobao for the first time and scared of seizures. This was supposed to be a comment in the daily thread but it ended up being so long so I decided to make it a post.

Stats: 5’2, size 6/8, 8.5ish feet

**Shipping/Agent** 

I used Taobao Direct and shipped via SF Express. This [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/4yr51a/guide_to_taobao_direct_buying_without_an_agent/) was super helpful. Took about a week and a half and about 3 days to get to me once it was in US.

got the size 115cm, probably fit for a size 10/12, really should’ve measured myself but was being lazy, and will rebuy them in a size 105cm, I just figured they would be asian sized and bought the largest size. The belt buckle loop thing that moves around freely has a tendency to fall off the belt in the non circular version of the belt just a heads up.

[sterling silver mini star studs](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=558030903384&amp;_u=n3tcmaitb872) \- **would rebuy** 

these were bought for my sister, she loves them. Haven’t checked if they were actually silver, but no reactions yet, but also she doesn’t have the most sensitive ears. If you’re a fan of minimalist small jewelry I would check the rest of the shop.

[silk tank everyone has](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=568629411328&amp;_u=n3tcmaitd44b) \-**would rebuy** 

copped the white one in 2XL, nothing wrong with it, if you have big boobs it might not sit flush, planning on altering it a little so it does, but otherwise super cute will be worn underneath a jean jacket.

[it cosmetics brushes](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=555470982776&amp;_u=n3tcmait4290) \- **would rebuy** 

these are also for my sister. She loves them a lot and like the other people said, I’m pretty sure these are gray market and damn are they the fluffiest little brushes. If you’re in the market for brushes buy these they’re amazing, you’ll have no regret.

[light sweater](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=578335303716&amp;spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;_u=n3tcmaitfd68) \- **maybe rebuy**

 for my sister, they’re pretty decent, but definitely small, got the XL and it fits a size 2/4 well I would say. The sleeves also aren’t short enough to be 3/4 but also aren’t quite full length. They’ve also held up well after washing, no weird collar issues, so I’d probably buy them again if I was thinner

[unbranded gucci brixton](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.10d82e8dzd36Rt&amp;id=566120073687&amp;_u=o3tcmait5723) \- **would not rebuy**

 I think I read too many reviews and hyped myself up too much but these were not as amazing as I thought they would be, but length wise the size 40 fits pretty well. I do find it to be loose around the sides though, but they look like the gucci ones, but for $30, I wasn’t amazed, if it was about $20ish I’d probably buy another. Don’t know if this will matter to anyone but the inside of the shoe for mine was also black like the outer not tan like it shows in the picture.

[branded nk beya](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=545496360053&amp;_u=n3tcmait3ca7) \- **would rebuy**

everyone’s seen these, but these did live up to the hype. I bought a size 39 and they were way too small, like way too small def size up. However I do love them and think they’re pretty decent. Definitely planning on picking up a couple more pairs before my internship this summer but probably in a size 41. Also while they’re branded the bottom of my shoes definitely say gigi kendoll.

[bulk pearl studs](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=522966558239&amp;_u=n3tcmaita226) \- **would rebuy**

lol I say I will rebuy but I’ll literally never run out. I have a bunch of piercing but I like just wearing pearls in them so I legit just got a pack of 100 of them. Don’t have crazy sensitive ears, but have had no reactions so far. If you like pearl earrings, but as my boyfriend puts it “shed pearl earrings like hair” then this is a must cop for you.

[dior rose de vents necklace](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=563476185064&amp;_u=n3tcmait56bc) \- **rebuy in a heartbeat**

legit the first thing I looked for when I figured out how to reverse image search tb. It’s unbranded but I love it so much, worn it for a few days and has yet to tarnish, if I remember will give updates on the tarnish status. If you’re just looking for a cheapie version of this necklace or just a lightweight add I would say buy.

[coco crush ring](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=543134137632&amp;_u=n3tcmaitd0b4) \- **maybe**

I thought I could get over the rose gold but I couldn’t so I haven’t worn this all that much. It’s a decent ring kinda like the amazon love ring that was super popular, and by that I mean not amazing, but for the price it’s fine.

[joule rain jacket](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=557302397060&amp;_u=n3tcmait8865) \- **rebuy** 

bought this for my sister, got it in red, I have a different jacket in the same color and it is spot on. There’s no way that this is not gray market and I’m lowkey salty that I paid like 3x the price for mine, especially because the auth even has like weird/bad stitching and threads sticking out. Order TTS and double check since I think it’s in European sizing just heads up.

[hermes twillies](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=568573201642&amp;_u=n3tcmait5a78) \- **would not rebuy** 

they’re cheap but they’re so shiny, definitely would not recommend if you want anything near passable, I was excited to get some cheap twillies for my lil nano robot, but these are p awful ngl, they’re shiny and the pattern isn’t that great, but I bought them since I was obsessed with the bride de gala design and didn’t want to spend a lot since I was testing out the tb waters. If anyone has any nicer versions of this lmk!

saw another commenter that said that these were grey market? I’m not sure if they are but they’re definitely way nicer than one would expect but I guess the nk stamping on the heel is slanted pretty badly. They definitely are smaller than expected I got a size 39 and I feel like I could have sized up one more. Definitely a super cute summer shoe, they don’t have a lot of sizes any more but would repurchase for sure.

[brandy melville erica bear sweater](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=546201188542&amp;_u=n3tcmaita72a) \- **would not rebuy**

was decent then washed, and now the collar is so horribly janky it’s not even funny. It would be far more effective to literally buy a walmart sweater and embroider your own bear. Definitely would not rebuy. Idk what to say other than it sucks.

[muji earmuffs](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=524157125253&amp;spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;_u=n3tcmait8ca5) \- **maybe rebuy** 

official muji store earmuffs, they’re about 1/3 of the price in US, but the ear muffs themselves are weird and don’t quite fit the head, other than that muji is wayyy cheaper on tb and even with international shipping it’s still cheaper so go ham fam. (haha\^don’t\^hurt\^me)

[dior constellation twilly](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=571442925094&amp;_u=n3tcmaitc0b5) \- **would not rebuy**

 the twilly dimensions are way off, I have an auth dior twilly, and yea it’s uh nowhere close it’s like an inch wider. Would not cop, but at least there’s no weird shiny look to it, just horribly off shape.

[unbranded celine small alphabet necklace](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1b132e8dzY2z0N&amp;id=575183706329&amp;_u=n3tcmait9d67) \- **would rebuy**

it’s a listing for earrings, but they list the pendant for each initial separately and a chain. For being an unbranded one, it has yet to tarnish which is always great and it’s super cheap and chic, especially because I was also looking for the small version. Also idk what’s up with the reviews, but I received the right thing and my skin has yet to be irritated. I would definitely rebuy this in a heartbeat if I ever lost it. Especially since I can’t even find an auth in store anymore.

I bought both black and white, they suck. I broke the black one as I opened the package and called it an L. Spend a few dollars more and get like a $20 rep of it, because I think for the price it’s difficult to get a. the shape of the clover right and b. the pearl to sit flush with the gold. I’m pretty lax with my standards of unbranded necklaces since I’m in college and the people I hang out with don’t know designer, but would not wear this one at all.

the clasp is kinda hard to put in and wear, and they do irritate my ear a little (tbf I’m not sure if it’s because I’m struggling to clasp the thing when it’s in my ear) I don’t wear these a lot, so I don’t think I’m super qualified to give a review. But I do think they’re cute and can add a little pop to a plain outfit. I do wish the knot were a little lower or the hoops were a bit smaller? Idk something’s a little off design wise for me I think that’s why I’m not completely sold.

**Lessons Learned**

I paid extra because you can store it for free up to 20 days in Taobao terminal (??) thingie, there’s a countdown timer to when stuff arrives but nothing super obvious that indicates your time is up, but you get charged extra once you try to consolidate and ship stuff.

I don’t know why I didn’t do this sooner, but I just checked a shoe size conversion chart as I was writing this review and it said I should be about a size 39, so half of these sizing issues could probably be alleviated if I had like any common sense. So uh yea...

**Final Thoughts**

I honestly don’t know if I would use taobao anymore for stuff like the twillies, and I’m glad I bought the knot cuff and earrings off of aliexpress, for me personally I don’t think it’s worth it to pay for the price of twilly and shipping and build up a haul to make the twilly shipping worth it if that makes sense. I’d rather just wait a long time with epost and buy one at a time and not feel the pressure of a “haul”.

I hope someone found this helpful, I love lurking in this community and hope to contribute a little more in the future, fingers crossed for an aliexpress ref haul and a celine review in the future!

I know this was a little long, but y’all thanks for reading if you made it to the end!"

I’m a recent arrival to Canada, came here in July 2018. I have a degree in computer science, but finding it difficult to stand out in the already flooded job market. 

I wrote a post last year asking for some advice, and since then have had an internship with a company in Ottawa. I would like to continue building my experience, the traditional methods of online applying after months and months aren’t leading me anywhere so far. I am currently waiting for a security clearance to be able to apply for government jobs, but it’s taking a while given my short Canadian residence. 

I would be ever grateful if someone could point me to volunteering opportunities, do they exist in the IT sector? I scour sites like Indeed, Peter’s New Jobs, Glassdoor, etc. and have been in touch with a number of agencies but often find the positions are filled, or I’m not selected because of lack of experience. Internship/co-op posts seems to always require the applicant be a student as well. Do you know of any companies taking in seasonal internships? 

I’d really appreciate any advice, feedback, and pointers. You can see my resume here (I’ve removed identifying information): [https://imgur.com/gallery/gY64pBR](https://imgur.com/gallery/gY64pBR)

&amp;#x200B;

I am guy in my twenties I am an intern at a company but due to some past incidents and no self control and low self esteem I just don't do anything that will improve myself eg take care of my looks, health. I just waste a shitload of time. My biggest problem seems to be eating hotel/street food. I have been a fat guy from past few years.

I feel I am in vicious cycle where I order out over eat get fat and keep going on a cycle for no reason. I order food sometimes for no reason. I mean I get fed up of the taste when I am half way through the meal but I over eat anyway, by continuing this way of life I barely save anything after rent and few monthly expenses. I also end up watching and fapping to porn.

In my free time I always think about going for swimming or some other activity. But I quickly feel like oh its so far oh how am I going to make time for all this etc etc.

I wish to know from the community here how do you guys stay focused on something, I am ready to take drugs(legal) too as I feel If I continue this way I will anyway end up having diabetes or some other disease how do you find time for activities like gym etc and your work how do you balance it.

How do you get rid of thoughts like oh I dont have time oh this might impact my work performance cause I will be tired in the office whats the mantra?

&amp;#x200B;

How do I lead a more disciplined life?

Please Help I really wanna get out this shit cycle"
aj45nf,1,2019-01-23,[LONG READ] An intertwined tale of a NMom survivor,MonsterNarc,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/aj45nf/long_read_an_intertwined_tale_of_a_nmom_survivor/,"Hi peeps, today I'll share my story with you all, hoping to get some insight that will help me and others who may have found themselves in a similar situation.

Let's start off by saying that I come from an upper middle-class family, but who never got to live as comfortably as one might think. My father was a stoic and very frugal person and a workaholic who took his job very seriously and the topic of money has always been a touchy subject. In fact, I did not realize he was the CEO of his own little construction company until I was well into puberty. For years, I thought he was just another employee who did a lot of overtime. Though he was the boss, he never liked bossing people around, he was the kind of leader that gave the example by working alongside his employees, and then some. Though this reflected on his family relationships. He would wake up at 5 AM, leave at 6 AM, and come back at 9 PM, 7 days a week, 364 days a year. He almost never took a day off (except Christmas), nor went on holiday with his family, even though we owned holiday homes near the sea. Never indulged in any luxuries and the mere suspect of either me or my mom doing so would spark a heated discussion. I basically wasn't allowed to wish for anything or I would make my parents fight over what was basically spare change. My mom quit her job when she became pregnant with me and has been penniless throughout my whole life. We survived off of grandma's pension, but for reasons that will be clear later on, it apparently was never enough, so basically nothing could be spared for me, and whenever it was, I had to fight with tooth and nail for it and I always ended up feeling guilty in the end. So, compared to all of my peers, the only thing I had more than them was a nice, big house. But it was an empty, luxurious prison. Everything else, I was missing it. After summer break, I would come back to school to hear all my classmates, telling about the great time they had with their families at theme parks, camping, hiking, canoeing, and tropical retreats, while I had basically nothing.

But wait, wasn't this about an NMom?

Well, dear readers, this was paradise for an NMom.

For the reasons above, I was never financially educated. When my father suddenly passed away without a will when I was 17 to a cerebral aneurysm, we found ourselves with a shitload of money. All that money that was never used on us, was suddenly in our hands. Me and my mom suddenly had over €500'000 in cash, combined, and the whole ""pot"" was split three-ways (the third recipient was my step-sister, who will come back later in the story).

I still had to graduate high school, I didn't know what to do with my life (or rather, I did, it will be clearer later) and my mom was unemployed (and basically unemployable) and my grandma was getting older and sicker. It wasn't exactly smart to start spending that money now.

Me and my mom opened a joint account and invested a good chunk of the money in 5 year-bonds in 2013. Then I had to open my own personal account. I figured that if we ever ran into financial issues, my mom ought to have access to my share of the money aswell, we were a family after all (remember, I wasn't financially educated, I had no idea that kind of cash was going to take a really long time to run out, under normal circumstances). We both had access to each other's accounts. We also had made a ""silent agreement"", where I'd focus on graduating and getting a career going, while she would take care of paying bills, taxes and whatnot. The only luxury I indulged in was buying an expensive computer rig (I always have been a huge computer nerd and as you can imagine, the computers I was given access to weren't exactly top of the line)

Anyways, I graduate high school, overwhelmed with deep anxiety and insecurity,  I fell for the ""useful degree"" meme and choose the wrong path for university. I spent two years struggling to do something I hated. I became deeply depressed, skipped classes and I often couldn't wake up before 5PM. I'd spend most of my days playing video games. In this time, my NMom started to reveal her true colors. First it started with pouring money into materials for her hobby, but never indulging in in it. She spent one year after my father's passing doing nothing but sitting on the couch all day. The whole thing had been hard on her as well, so I let it slip. If that wasn't enough, when going through my father's things, my mom and my aunt discovered that he had started cheating on her shortly before his death. Then, I started seeing unknown withdrawals on my bank statements. She was stealing my debit card from my wallet and withdrawing money in the morning while I was trying (and failing) to sleep my depression away. I challenged her about it and first she said *""what about all the money you stole* ***from me****?""* (??????????? when? when I was 12? and what money? ice-cream money???? I never had much else anyway), then she gave me an ultimatum: ""*get your shit together with school or I'll spend all of your money"".* Of course, I took the blame. It was true, I was failing hard at school and at life. She stopped stealing my debit card after that. I started seeing a therapist, and it helped to keep me from falling off the deep end.

Then, the turning point: I rediscovered what I really wanted to do in life, but the school was expensive, not really needed for that line of work, and the degree itself was worthless. I wasn't keen on spending money with what my NMom was doing, but I still took the risk. Turns out it was the best decision of my life. I became extremely invested in it, I did great and was by far the best student they ever had. I didn't need the therapist anymore (didn't even have the time for it anymore), but I was still overly anxious. Something deep inside me knew there was still something wrong. Then, one year ago, another turning point: I met a person over the internet who changed my life. In short, this person is the incarnation of all the values I hold dear, of everything I wished to be, in terms of both personal and professional success. Something that for years I thought just wasn't possible. I reached out to this person and we became instant friends. They went through their fair share of deep troubles aswell, but managed to come out on top of everyone else, despite the odds. Well, it inspired me so much that I managed to achieve a comparable success. Right before graduating, I didn't just land an internship in one of the most renowned companies in my line of work, I landed my dream job. What I always wanted to do, but always thought wasn't possible to achieve for the simple reason that I grew up believing that whatever I wished for was wrong. To put into perspective how much of an effect this person had on me, I had planned to travel all the way to the other side of the world to meet them (and they agreed to do so after merely a month knowing them, over the internet!). I had a plane ticket in my hand and an hotel booking that I had to cancel because of the giant opportunity that I managed to obtain, all thanks to the newly-found courage this person had instilled in me. Without it, all that work I had put in that expensive school would've been for naught. As the saying goes, you miss all the shots you don't take, and I would've missed that shot if it wasn't for this person. I even had took up smoking for a couple of years (my father was a heavy smoker as well) and right after meeting this person I quit cold-turkey and never felt the need ever since.

But the worst is yet to come.

So, as you can imagine, I had rediscovered how to smile. Finally, I was happy. Something was going my way after all that happened, my future was looking brighter for once, I was about to go get paid to do something I love, and my mom didn't have to worry anymore. I graduated, got my worthless piece of paper, and then right after I signed my contract. I had to start ten days after graduating, and I had to move countries, all the way to London to do so.

I was so invested in that line of work that I completely ignored everything else. My online banking account was locked for inactivity. Well, I had to go get my money to move out and go live my life and... there wasn't any. I had €100'000 in cash that would've covered the school and living costs 3-4 times over. I signed 3 checks in my entire life, to pay the tuition of my school for 3 years. When I went to close my bank account (the only thing that was left for me to do), I had 4... checkbooks on record.

Between all the bank accounts we had and everything else, I had completely forgotten my NMom had her signature on my personal bank account. So instead of stealing my debit card and withdrawing from the ATM, she wrote checks to herself or went directly to the bank teller.

The joint account we had with all the money invested? Empty. Investments, bonds, life insurance, all gone, with huge penalty clauses on top. Another €100'000 of mine gone.

Her own money was gone too, and we had equal shares. You do the math. To make up for it, we have wardrobes stuffed with clothes she never wears.

All that was left was €10'000 in my bank account, which she tried to get me into giving to her. One day before I had to move out to one of the most expensive cities in the world. 

Well, I obviously kept the damn money for myself and she gave me the silent treatment. When I rightfully asked what the fuck was she thinking, I was told various things:

&gt;*-""You're just like your father""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*-""The money was ours""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*-""I meant no harm to you""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*-""What's love to you? Is it just money?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*-""You always had everything you needed""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*-""It's not like you spend much money anyway""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*-""When we have to split the properties, I'll take your share of this house you grew up in, because I earned it""*

Then, in what was probably a way to further manipulate me, she shed the NMom skin and burst into tears, trying to make me think she knew what she did was wrong.

It was all an act. She soon put it back on again and started blaming anything and anyone else for her own behavior, except herself. 

Panicked, I called my step-sister and told her everything. The only thing she surprised about was her going as far as touching my own the money. Apparently she has always been like this, and she has been like this with her (my step-sister moved out after a fight with her when I was 9), my father was just keeping her at bay.

So that's how I moved and started my new life. Needless to say, I spent a lot of my free time just trying to keep my rage at bay. 

I stumbled upon articles about sociopath and narcissistic moms and it's like reading her description. Everything fits. She checks all the boxes. Both what she did and how I felt and all those broken promises. All those insecurities and anxiety I suffered through? Her influence. No wonder my father was so strict, no wonder he cheated on her. But obviously, for years she used that as an excuse to look like the caring and loving mother to not only my eyes, but to everyone else's. For years, she made me believe my step-sister had mistreated her when she moved out, but it was the other way around. There probably was always money for me when I was little, she just spent it on herself instead (believe me, grandma did not have that many expenses, now I know).

One month after I moved out, she went to my uncle asking for money saying I had taken all the money from her when I moved. She left out the ""fine details"", of course. So my step-sister stepped in (no pun intended) and told them everything. (side note: my uncle and my father have been business partners throughout their lives, but they never were in good terms with each other, so I never got to spend much time with that branch of the family. My uncle also acts as the person we refer to for the inheritance stuff) 

When I came home from Christmas, NMom first made sure to act like nothing had happened, then right on Christmas Day we had to dig everything up again, and made sure to blame me for ""telling on her"", trying to shift the blame on my uncle and step-sister for acting like I didn't exist throughout my life (which may be in part true, though they didn't steal an entire house-worth of money from me, though!!!) or the cheating and other stuff like the classics *""after everything I did for you""* or *""You had your first 20 years of life ruined, but what about* ***my*** *last 20 years on this world? You still have your life in front of you, I don't""*. Well, I would, if you didn't ruin my next 40 years you dense bitch. Like my first 20 years aren't the most important and precious ones, anyway.

Anyways, ""telling on her"" was equated to her exploiting me in a moment of weakness and stealing a literal fortune from me and trying to pin the blame on me.

Oh yeah, and then she softened up again. Of course, now the money has run out, my grandma is getting sicker by the day and needs a person to take care of her and I'm the only one with a job. She already claimed that ""after all, I get more money than her.""

The first thing she asked me when I got my first paycheck was how much was it.

When I was seeing the therapist (full into her spending spree) and I was getting something positive out of it (a.k.a. I was starting to realize that she was the root of my issues), she tried to coerce me into stopping therapy, because it was ***too expensive (!!!).*** I didn't stop until I felt like it, but it's all these little things that have come back to me over the last six months.

And my internet friend? She's jealous of him. Because me and him have been regularly exchanging lengthy emails throughout last year while I don't want to even think about her, let alone talk to her.

And on top of it all, she puts up an act with all her friends, who don't know who she really is, so they don't just pass off what she did as a ""temporary"" moment of weakness, but then brush off my achievements as luck (and not me working my ass off for 3 years), or worse, brush off everything I went through because I still achieved something good in the end, or worst, believing her blabbering about being the victim.

Oh, and she gets all worked up if anyone else but her tells about my achievements. And she also tries to shift the attention to her in public. You know, like *""he 'made it', and so in turn, even I did"".*

&amp;#x200B;

So, TL;DR: textbook NPD. I wish I had gotten wind of it sooner though. 

Right now I'm in a limbo. I'm trying to get my life going, while NMom tries to become a permanent burden.

Soon, my grandma will pass, and so will her pension, which NMom uses to keep going. Her social security check will be miserable because she hasn't worked in 20+ years, she can't obviously be trusted with savings so there's that out of the window.

I still have some more inheritance to get and she claims she's going to give me the money she stole back (doubt it, because it's mostly properties, so I can't have the cash back)

Shortly before I departed (before I fully realized she's got NPD) I signed her to be my proxy in the inheritance proceedings (because, you know, I was stupid enough to think my mom wasn't a heartless narcissistic bitch). It shouldn't be a problem, because the rest of the family now knows, and if she tries anything funny, they'll notify me and I can simply step in and prevent her from doing anything.

At some point she's gonna ask me for financial support, but there's no fucking way in any of the circles of hell that I'm going to support her in anything. I'm still pretending to be in neutral terms with her because I need her to ship me my 3k+ worth of computer equipment (on which is stored most of my life and work). After that, I'm going NC. 

Some of her friends keep trying to convince me to trust her a little more, but I simply can't. They mean well, but they don't know the whole story, they haven't known her like I did, they haven't had her for a mother.

Right now I just want to keep a close relationship with my internet friend, because he's been more family to me than anyone has ever been and I want to make sure I don't accidentally mess anything up with him because of any shitty behavior I may have unknowingly ""inherited"". 

I'm just curious if anyone has anything to say, at this point anything is welcome, and I thank you if you read this far.

aj527e,9,2019-01-23,Has anyone found a way to improve communication and stop him yelling all the time?,viddy-this,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/aj527e/has_anyone_found_a_way_to_improve_communication/,"I love my SO, we are engaged and have been together for almost 5 years. But he has no control over his emotions and it is making me question whether I deal with this for the rest of my life.

Whenever he is mildly inconvenienced my something I do unintentionally, there is no communication on his part. He starts yelling and name calling straight away and then gives me the cold shoulder and refuses to talk about it or apologize for anything said.
After a day or two he goes back to normal and we pretend it never happened.


I used to get so upset, crying and asking him why he is saying these things. He would respond by mocking me and getting angrier. Early on in our relationship however, he did show some remorse and apologize. But this hasn't happened in years now.


Now I have learnt to apologize straight away for whatever i had done, and cry alone until I have the strength to go back and pretend it never happened. I used to try and have a discussion about his anger and abuse but it always started the yelling again straight away, so it is easier not to bring it up.


I have been reading a lot and was thinking of next time it happens, to try and show no emotion and state,

""I wont listen to you while you are yelling at me. It makes me scared and emotional and I can not properly take in what you are trying to communicate. 
I want to listen and understand how you feel but I need it to happen when we are both calm so that we can fix the issue. When you are ready I will be here to talk.""


I haven't had a chance to try it yet as I have been working at night when he gets home so there hasn't been a chance for him to yell at me, but I hope that he will understand and not see it as an attack or blaming. U have tried before to tell him that it is wrong the way he yells and says horrible things, but the way he was brought up, it is normal and he thinks I am being over sensitive and stupid.


I just want to know before it happens again if anyone has successfully tried a communication method that works, and stops the yelling long term?

I am sick of apologizing for stupid things like being cold, sharing a different opinion on a political topic or not having his singlets washed or dinner ready by 5.30. 


I know it is only validating his treatment of me but I am so tired of the abuse it is just the easiest way to deal with it. The things he says are very hurtful and affect me emotionally and I feel like my self esteem has rock bottomed. My social skills are getting worse - I am now stuttering and apologising and cant look people in the eye or find anything to say because I am numb.


I need to do something to fix it because I do want to stay with him, and I know he has issues from his childhood that affect his behaviour. He does so much for me - pays the rest, sends me money when I need it (i have been on an unpaid internship), and says he loves me. The only thing is the anger and I have some trust issues over him speaking to girls inappropriately online. But he has been faithful since the last time as far as I know.


Any advice, anything that has worked, please share it with me as I dont know what else to do.

aj6bkp,202,2019-01-23,[Serious] The most disappointing aspect of medicine is the people in it...,Apophilius,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/aj6bkp/serious_the_most_disappointing_aspect_of_medicine/,"Honestly I feel like the idea might be a little bit too vague to exactly pinpoint, but I’m nearing the end of my MS3 year and I think I’ve discovered that I don’t like most of medicine, simply because the staff, the patients, the other physicians, nurses, etc... are very often good, normal people, but far too often are truly awful to each other. So much so that I notice little pieces of it every day, and every few days somebody does something that makes me double take at how rude and inconsiderate and unempathetic these healthcare workers are being.

It’s too many for me to count. But just yesterday I remember being on call with two residents in the workroom, and we were having a conversation. There’s a small gap in it, and I start to speak up, get out several words before the residents start to interrupt me and start speaking like I wasn’t even talking. I’ve seen an OBGyn attending call a nurse a “fucking idiot,” because she wasn’t familiar with the lubricant gel packs for a digital vaginal exam because she’s on the med surg floor and he’s here for a consult. He made absolutely no effort to consider her lack of familiarity with it, it’s 2PM on his Saturday call day, so I can sort of understand his frustration, but it most certainly was not warranted. This same guy I had to explain later to what the fuck a PPI was, mind you.

I saw one resident speak about to another about the work they were doing and how many labs they had to take down, and when he spotted a med student in the corner (this student wasn’t even on their service) he piped up and said “you’ve got a med student right there that can do it for you, what more do you want?” Exact words.

Surgeons shitting on radiologists and pathologists. Scrub techs chewing out med students for not-even microtransgressions in the OR, not to teach, but just because it’s someone they can yell at finally. ICU nurses telling fast-moving staff they don’t like how “fast they are walking,” and make a point to berate them (this happened to me. She literally told me she didn’t like how fast I was walking, and was deadpan serious about it). And med students trampling over each other to gun for evals, and doing what is obviously brown-nosing to residents who take advantage of it for themselves, who hated brown-nosers when they were med students not even 5 months ago, and then reward them for it. 

I saw another intern in October teaching a med student how to suture, and he made the comment “so I notice med students make this mistake a lot when suturing.” You mean like you when you were a med student four months ago? This guy was probably taught by an attending in July, but god bless him if he wasn’t constantly letting med students know that he’s more advanced than that now. 

A lot of medicine has some very good people, and there are lots of classmates and staff that I admit I thought I had pinned that very much pleasantly surprised me how human and caring they are, and how they are able to maintain relentless grace under pressure. But then I find some real twats, and I suppose it’s a value judgement thing, but people’s bad behavior in healthcare outweighs the good behavior by not a small margin. 

Some other examples: residents screaming for work-life balance and ushering away malignant behavior, but when they do shitty things to med students, their justification is (again, exact words) “the faster you learn that in medicine shit falls down, the better off you’ll be,” or “if I got through it, you’re gonna be forced to go through it too.” No effort to actually improve anything for anyone other than themselves. If it doesn’t benefit them, they just do not give a shit. 

I’ve never been more disappointed in people. "

aj7mgw,1,2019-01-23,Life has pretty much sucked since I graduated 4 years ago. I can't remember what it's like to be hopeful about the future.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/aj7mgw/life_has_pretty_much_sucked_since_i_graduated_4/,"I'm just gonna spill my life story because it's relevant. 

I was always a weird kid and a nerd as far back as I can remember. When I finished high school, I was an immature idiot with nothing going for me. I had never had a girlfriend, and outside of the odd drunken hookup women weren't all that interested in me. When I entered my 20s it was like being born anew - I moved away from the old social circles where my failure of a teenage identity resided and was determined to spend my 20s on becoming the man I wanted to be. It was a hell of a grind, but I started checking boxes. I got into shape. I built a huge new social circle which I benefit greatly from today. I started dating girls and had a gorgeous girlfriend for a while. I can vaguely remember how it was like - looking 5 years into the future and seeing a goal. Thinking about how I could reach it, and eagerly taking action to get there. 

From the start of my college years I quickly realized I had a quick, analytical mind, and the ability to structure myself. Applying those two things gave me more energy than anything - especially when efforts were made towards long-term goals. I could discipline myself into doing just about anything. 

As with all people - life decided to throw a few curveballs my way. There were severe setbacks along the way, but I got up like a champ. If life put up a stone wall - I scaled it. If I couldn't scale it, I dug around. I failed and fell so many times, yet I always knew that If I just kept pushing on I'd get where I wanted to. 

That is, until graduation came near. 

I was among the most eager students in my class. I had signed up with extracurricular responsibilities. I was pulling straight A's. I attended all the career fair events offered by my university, and eagerly networked with all of the companies I found interesting. I had an internship. I had two part-time jobs in relevant fields. Nothing was going to stop me. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it did. Slowly but steadily my classmates started getting job offers. I didn't think much of it at first - I had interviews lined up. But they all turned up the same way... rejection after rejection. Eventually (I started the application process 1 year before graduating) even people who started applying 6 months after I started my well prepared process started getting offers. After a while it seemed like I was the only one left who hadn't gotten a job. Then I graduated. During this time something strange happened to me - all of the rejections started going to my head. I started doubting myself. I eventually convinced myself that I was a fraud. I didn't deserve anything I had achieved so far - the employers interviewing me obviously just saw through me. 

I started applying for jobs below my educational level. Jobs I thought I was going to hate. Because what the hell did I know, right? 

At the end of another exhausting slog, I finally ended up with an offer at a recruitment agency. I approached it with the humility of someone who thought he was the biggest, most useless loser in his peer group.

And then something funny happened: I mastered the job in a matter of weeks. In the course of six months, I was landing twice as many deals as any coworked in my department. And as if that wasn't enough - I was doing this while having roughly 50% of my day basically being dead hours, while my colleagues were complaining about not having enough time for anything. 

And speaking of stressed colleagues - I started running into my classmates on reunions and such. And what do you know? They were all complaining about being overworked. And here I was being underworked. I longed for something challenging. Recruitment was everything I had predicted it would be from the start - easy and boring. I hated it. I hated that job. It was braindead, and It was a dead-end job. Thankfully my boss was a good guy and put me on several development projects, but in the end it was a recruitment firm. After a few years, I quit with nothing lined up for me, figuring I'd find SOMETHING. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been over a year now since then, and I still haven't found anything but temporary contracts. My life is a walking haze now. I used to have dreams. Direction. Energy. 

Now all I have is apathy and distraction.

I feel like a marathon runner who has trained all his life to run, yet the starting pistol just won't go off. And to top it off - there's some completely irrelevant test applied before you can start running the marathon. Job interviews are my bottleneck. I have no idea why I suck so much at them. I've coached applicants into getting offers before, I've coached employers in interviewing. I know very well how the process works - but it just doesn't seem to work for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to plan vacations with my friends months in advance. Now I can't stand to think ahead. It's just the same shitty fucking disappointment waiting around every seasonal milestone. I can't bear the fact that I'm getting older while my life is still perpetually frozen in progress. Is this how it will be for the rest of my life? I put in the fucking work. All I ask for is one chance - one opportunity to prove myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to feel like my life has some direction again. "

aj8qu8,89,2019-01-23,How I Became A Business Major,college-golf-duh,stupidslutsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/aj8qu8/how_i_became_a_business_major/," This happened when I was an undergrad 15-20 years ago.

I went to a small college where everyone knew each other — especially the faculty. It was labeled a liberal arts school but we also had a pretty big business school. And it was sort of divided between the two. The artsy/indie/punk types all floated to the liberal arts school. And the frat/bro/sorority types were usually business majors. This wasn’t a universal truth but it basically worked out that way.

I was one of the indie types. I looked the part of a Wes Anderson/Pixies fan — bangs, schoolgirl hair pins, dye jobs, intentionally outdated outfits, band t-shirts, etc.

There was one professor in the liberal arts side of the school — Justin. He let us call him that. He was a creative writing teacher and very supportive. He was about 50, longish hair, boyish face. A lot of my classmates had a thing for him. I did not. But he was really encouraging of me and even hinted I look into a literature MA program after graduation.

We were required to take at least one business class. This sounded like an absolute nightmare to start with. Even worse, the only class that fit my schedule was an intro to accounting. I could not think of anything I would want to take less.

I sat in a back row. There were about 20 kids. I think all of them were freshman business majors. Most wore what you’d see in college, but there were a lot of button up types with “serious” looks. I really never knew or could understand people like that.

The professor was Dr. Bruce. He was almost 60. Tall. Thin, but in shape, no doubt from his golf habit. He was bald save for the sides, which were almost fully gray. He wore big, thick-framed glasses before they were stylish (and, even now, they would not be stylish). And he also wore a suit with a bow tie.

I did not think anything of him at first. He introduced himself. He was an undergrad at our school. On top of having a PhD, he had worked in private practice and still consulted (hence his love of BMWs.) He was also on one of the big boards of the school, too. He had a bit of the cadence of the teacher from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, but with this arrogance and confidence.

We had to introduce ourselves and our majors. After mine, he cracked a smile and had a haughty laugh. “Oh, are you one of Justin’s?” He then continued. “I sometimes get someone from that side of campus over here. They come in bored and arrogant with a thought that the business school is beneath them. That is fine. Many drop out of the class. Many get average grades, at best. But they all walk out of here realizing they are not nearly as smart as they believe. And they also walk away realizing the ways of the world. Being a creative type is hard. It is valuable. But, at the end of the day, you end up working for someone who spends his or her time in this building.”

I felt this shudder of doom.

The weeks went by. I was doing okay in the class — just enough to stay afloat, but nothing more than that. And, one night, I had the strangest feeling. I had an assignment to do for my poetry class. But I just thought of Dr. Bruce and his stride. His sarcastic laugh. His smirk. He took hold of me. I put my poetry book down and instead buried into a lesson about cost accounting. I am probably the only person alive who was turned on by a lesson in managerial accounting but I absolutely was. Dr. Bruce just owned me. I never had a thing before for someone that much older. Or any sort of authority figure. But now I understood why.

I handed in the assignment and could barely function waiting for its return. I earned an A with a simple “Nice Work” in red.

I waited a few minutes after class before I headed to his office. I knocked on the door and he peaked up over his copy of that day’s Financial Times. He smiled and folded up the pink newspaper. “Ah! Well, this is pleasant. My star pupil.” His smirk was devilish.

I awkwardly smiled. And I was so nervous. “Yes. Well, I was hoping you would think I did well. I put in a lot of effort into doing that assignment.” He said it showed.

“I put in a lot of effort for a reason.” Deep breath. My stomach was in knots. “Because I have never been more attracted to a man in my life.”

He flinched a bit. And I started to profusely apologize. That it was inappropriate. I crossed a line. I could drop the class. I didn’t mean to cause any trouble —

He adjusted his glasses and leaned back in his chair. His fingers steepled. He lifted a hand up and I knew to be silent.

“What you said is absolutely fine. But is it truthful? Because if if is...” He places his hands on the arms of his chair. “Then come one here and get on your knees.”

I found myself quickly before him. He stood and I knew to ask. Please, Dr. Bruce, Sir. Please let me suck your cock. My hands fumbled with his belt and zipper. Soon, his slacks and shorts were pulled down. Even with his age, he was ready as he sat back down in a kingly posture.

My hand gripped his shaft and I started licking around the sides and the tip. My lips swallowed the head before I took him in slowly and deeply.

“Yes...” he said. He moaned a bit but was in control. His hand gripped my head and steered me. “That’s right.” Such confidence and control.

“I know why you feel this way. You never had a man tell you life was hard before. That your individuality did not make you special. That it made you lesser.” I moaned because he knew exactly why I was there. “You never knew you wanted to conform before.” And “don’t think you’re going to get good marks for this. In fact, I should grade you even harder now.”

There were only a few minutes more before he exploded on my face. I screamed more loudly than he did. I took a tissue and cleaned myself off and he cackled a bit.

“You know that there are better mentors to have than Justin...”

I nodded.

“Next time you visit me, maybe think about dressing a bit more professionally.” And I was getting off of my feet and nodded again. Finally, I regained my nerves right as I headed to the door.

“May I say something, Dr. Bruce, Sir?”

He nodded.

“Thank you so much for letting me go down on you today. I know how lucky I am.”

He nodded, smiled and leaned back. He took off his glasses and held them up, his head back a bit triumphantly.

“Very well.”

He put his glasses back on and picked up the newspaper.

I went out and bought some nice new dresses that next day. And I had my hair colored so it looked natural again. I still looked myself. But it was clear I was no longer trying so hard to fit the alternative image.

The next time I went to Dr. Bruce’s Office, he clasped his hands behind his head. And he asked me to spin around to see my new outfit.

“Better. Much better.”

It was only a few minutes before he had me over his desk, my panties down and him in me. I just moaned and uttered his name. He grunted. It was at his tempo. His pace. He started saying things about how much potential I had... how I was starting to learn. And I told him how grateful I was. I lasted almost ten minutes before I had an orgasm.

This went on for a few more weeks. I served as he saw fit - on my knees or over his desk. Each time was hotter than the next.

The semester was coming to an end. And Justin informed me of an event. He was the advisor of the literary magazine that I worked on. He had an event on A Saturday for the magazine and asked me to read one of my submissions because it was going to be the lead of the publication. I would have cried tears of joy knowing that I would have had that honor my freshman year. 

But Dr. Bruce also invited me to an event that same day. There was a big event with major donors to the school at a local golf club/hotel banquet center. He was the brains behind the event and described who would be there — most of the school’s wealthiest alum, CPAs, executives, a few local politicians. Powerful people. People with influence.

And he said they needed student workers to assist. To find the right name tags. To serve the coffee. To basically kiss ass to people in hopes of one day becoming them.

It was nerve wracking. But I did what must be done. I went to Nordstrom’s and bought a blazer, blouse and skirt combo — more money than my entire wardrobe combined. (And I explained it to my very angry parents that it was for an internship opportunity.) I went to a hair salon and had my hair done very well - wavy, etc. I looked in the mirror. I looked like a young woman trying to make it in corporate America. Or maybe someone you would see with a phony smile in a real estate advertisement.

I was a sell out.

And I felt so hot.

I went to the event. I did not know any of the other student workers, but they had already mastered the art of that phony business speak and smile. I was scared speaking in that tone. It was so forced. At first.

But soon it became natural. The guests mostly had white hair and expensive suits and laughs of confidence and authority. Any younger men there had power bellies from steak dinners charged to expense accounts. The women wore humorless shoes that clanged with intimidation and presence.

“Here is your name tag, Mr. Davis.” “Oh, I love those pearls, Mrs. Hoffman.” “Oh, you’re a President’s Club donor? It’s an honor to meet you. Please allow me to bring you to your seat.” “Oh, you are a senior VP? My family has banked there for years and have always had great customer experiences.” “I asked the manager and he said it is perfectly fine for you gentlemen to smoke cigars on the patio. May I freshen your drinks?”

I thought about the other event. I would have been lauded at that event. Applauded. I would not be there to give directions to the ladies' room of the wife of the region's leading property-and-casualty insurance firm (Class of 'XX). But I would be around illustrious graduates -- people making $19,000 a year writing for some weekly alternative paper, just a few years before they gave up the ghost to become a teacher or head to law school and pretend like that what the plan all along.

Later towards the night, after a few speeches were made, I saw Dr. Bruce by the bar. He looked at me and said something to the older gentleman with him who looked at me, shook his head, and whispered something in Dr. Bruce’s ear. They both laughed with glee as he smiled walking past me. I said hello to Dr. Bruce.

“Well... now you look like you are living up to your fullest potential.” Pause. “Shall we talk more in private?”

His hand was on the small of my back as we made our way to the elevators, not saying much. We went to a suite on the top floor he had reserved. The lights were on and he took off his dress jacket and hung it over the back of the chair.

“My dear, would you be so kind as to pour me a Scotch?” I did. I brought it to him. And I stood before him. I did not need direction. My jacket was off. And my shoes. The most undressed I had been in front of him was not much. I unbuttoned my blouse and unclamped my skirt. I was now in just my bra and panties as he sipped his scotch.

“Wonderful,” he said. He placed the drink down and told me to come closer. I did. I straddled his lap as he leaned back, my hands over his balding hair and then over his glasses, on his shoulders and up his chest. I thought pulling off a bow tie was going to be complicated. It was not. As I did, and it dangled over his neck, I almost came. It was so sexy. I started to unbutton his shirt. He stood up and pushed me back and told me to take off my underwear and I did.

He had white chest hair and tan skin. He was soon naked and on top of me. And he entered me almost immediately. I was in that room with him for three or four hours. Him on top of me. Me on top of him, learning every inch of his body. I have no idea how many times I climaxes, except it was many.

That Monday, I went to Justin’s office. He looked worried. He asked me if I was okay. And where I was Saturday. I was dressed like I was an executive.

“I went to another event that was better for where I want to be in my life. Please sign this form. It’s my change of major to general business.”

He asked if I wanted to talk about it.

“No. Please sign the form. You are no longer my academic advisor. I found someone better than you.”

He flinched and signed the floor and sighed.

I then went to Dr. Bruce’s. He was smiling at me as I came in.

“Dr. Bruce, could you please sign my change of major form?” He looked at it and saw Justin signed it already.

“This makes official what we have both known. I am not one of Justin’s anymore. I am yours.”

He signed it and leaned back, hands behind his head. And I got on my knees.

“Please, Dr. Bruce, Sir. I am eternally grateful for all you have done for me. You showed me my true place and destiny in life. I beg you for the honor of showing my gratitude by going down on your right now, Sir.”

And that is how I became a business major."

I'd vouch for him, but as a microchip designer in North America, I think I need a little faith from you guys in getting the job done. ;)

If anything does pan out and I can repay someone, I'm in more than an adequate state to do so.

I used to be nothingbutbraindump. Was 17 F, now 18. I disappeared right after a controversial post about not wanting to go to CC because my nearest CC sucks and mom will make me stay with her. 


Since I had grown “rebellious” against my tiger mom and got rejected from my first choice so she locked me in my room- all electronics taken away. So i ate some expired candy bars and studied for finals. Got severe food poisoning or a stomach bug. 


Went to the ER because I was screaming my head off and throwing up the first night of symptoms settling in. 

Doctors thought it was appendicitis. I chickened out and didn’t say anything to the nurse about not eating. But I got my phone back because it seems more normal when a teenager has a phone on her. After that, Mom got even more pissed at me for spending “sooo much money”. I paid for my bills, called my grandparents (dad’s side, they don’t like my mom anyway). Since they’re wealthy, they helped me out. Since my grandparents “said so”, my mom couldn’t not listen to them, so ta da. I moved out senior year winter break.  I’m on very minimal contact with every single member of my family right now- grandparents are giving me time to settle in but I’ll have to call later to thank them. 


Mom wasn’t my guardian in the first place so that was fine. I turned 18 a few days after. 

——————


There’s more! 


While I didn’t get into my first choice, I got into uChicago with enough scholarships  (didn’t tell my mom). 


I talked to my UC professor/research mentor about this and he said he would help me out. 


Managed to score an interview with dean of admissions in Columbia, went wonderfully. Offered a research internship at Columbia (I suspect UC prof pulled some strings) but admission comes out March. 



However, I missed other deadlines for college apps since I was in the ER.  I think I’ll stick with Chicago. 


——————

For now, I’m living by myself, I have an CA ID but my visa is expired. Immediately indulged in a feast of pizza and half a chocolate cake after I moved in. Need to gain a bit weight after not eating. 


Currently tutoring kids, studying at school, and working on my radiology certification (quelle horreur that I actually wanted a blue collar job!) 


My prof is a fuckin savior. I can’t thank him enough. 


I have not gone to therapy or the doctors yet. Recommended but it’s expensive. 


Tl;dr:  lucky food poisoning got me out of my moms house. Got into a college when a redditor told me I only deserve community college. I miss my mom though. Just a bit. Still tryna figure things out. 



So yup. This might be the last post I make on here. Thanks y’all for the wild ride. "

If you're a fan of androgynous boys, feminine boys, traps, girly-bois and everything like that under the sun, then this is definitely the prompt for you! 

Like to top? Sure! Like to bottom? Why not! Like to switch it up, get kinky with it? Absolutely! Do you roleplay in the real world? That's fine! Like to roleplay in more fictitious settings? That's awesome too! 

I'll play with anybody, regardless of gender or sexuality, so just send a message! Below I'll drop my limits, and add some scenario ideas based on genres I find appealing.

Limits: blood, gore, feet, scat, death, watersports, bimboification, torture, and other extremes.

Scenario ideas:

**Fantasy:**

- I'm a diplomat for an Elf race that resides not too far out from your Kingdom. As an offering of peace, they send me to the castle to act as a servant, not realizing you have other plans in mind...

- You're the king or prince of a large kingdom that needs to grow, but can only do so with the marriage of your royalty to another country's royalty. Unfortunately, the biggest nation nearby has only a prince as well, but they're willing to dress him a little different if it means your hand in marriage.

- I'm a simple servant, a peasant that was chosen to go on a divine quest with you, the Chosen One. I mostly carry your stuff and act as a Squire, but this armor you got me recently is a little revealing, don't you think..?

- You've recently risked your life to rescue me, the Elvish Princess, from a dangerous situation. Little do you know that there might be more to me than meets the eye, but I am bound to serve either way.

- You attend a prestigious Wizard and Witch's Academy, finding success and standing out amongst your peers. But there's one Wizard who you haven't been able to keep your eyes off of. A love potion it is...

- As the weakest member of my Orc tribe, I have to do a lot to make sure people don't think I'm so helpless. But when the time comes, I'm no different than the breeding-women we keep back at our campsite...

- I, the Chosen One, am sent to a nearby cave or temple to appease the dragon/monster/god living there. My fate rests in their hands once I arrive...

**Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi:**

- I'm an intense corporate businessman who steps out of line with the local crime lords. They decide to upload my conciounsess into a computer and download it into a more...fitting android body for me.

- You're a hardboiled detective, and after my parents are murdered in a case you decide to take me under your wing. We even disguise me as a girl to get information from some people, but you're noticing more and more how well it fits me...

- You've never visited this club, the newest of it's kind in the Mega-City limits. Dancers, hot tubs, private rooms. But what you find is a very special type of exotic dancer, one that the whole club is filled with, and can take your every desire as a request...

- I'm a spry young intern working at one of the biggest high-tech labs in the country. But I didn't realize volunteering for this kind of experiment would involve so much robotic probing...

- We've been role-playing for a long time in the VirtualNet, using our full-body stimulation suits to basically simulate sex between your avatar, a guy, and my avatar, a girl. But when we decide to meet up in real life, you notice something different about me...

**Post-Apocalyptic:**

- You're a fearsome gang leader, stealing supplies from settlements and small towns trying to scrape by. But the son of one of the townsfolk is willing to do anything if you'll spare his home...

- I'm a wandering drifter, going from town to town. I meet you, and you sell me on a deal that's too good to pass up. Little do I know you're a cheat, and I end up in a place far worse than before.

- We were lovers before the Great War, but the radiation warped my body into becoming slimmer, taking away my female traits and adding a few new male ones.

- I'm an orphan living on the post-Apocalyptic streets of a city that hasn't crumbled yet, just trying to survive, doing anything I can to earn a meal for the next day...

- I'm a lost trader who's been captured by a war gang or group of mutated creatures! I don't know how I'll get out of this one now, hopefully somebody will try to save me...

Modern:

- We're lovers, and have just decided to buy an apartment/house together. Time to make it ours by moving in, decorating, and having sex everywhere.

- A wedding night that neither of us will forget, or perhaps the accompanying Honeymoon to some place far off where we can do as we like.

- I'm a celebrity idol, known for my acting, singing, and uncanny ability to look like the opposite sex. You've won a backstage pass to one of my shows or maybe a VIP ticket to a movie I'm in. Don't worry, I love interacting with fans, especially in costume...

**Misc. Settings:**

- I'm the criminal that everybody knows around these dusty towns, and despite my weak-looking body I'm a crackshot with a revolver. That is, until I run into you, the Sheriff of a small town you vowed to protect...

- On the high seas, treachery and theft should always be expected. But I never expected I'd find myself a prisoner of war, captured from the Royal Navy by pirates as their own form of booty... 

- We're rivals on separate teams, both of which have gone pro and made it to the finals. Now, despite who wins, you know how you'll take your own reward against me. And I'm never going to say no to a passionate locker-room hatefuck.

Established Universes/Rule 34:

- Marvel/DC/Superheroes are all the rage, so let's have some fun and make some heroes, some villains, and a lot of kinky superpowers once either is defeated.

- Star Wars is also quite popular, but this setting is extremely varied, so let's come up with something on the spot and play it out.

- Overwatch is the world's largest peacekeeping Organization! But who knows what will happen when a new member stirs things up?

- As it turns out, U.A. High School got a new super-powered student, and everyone is trying to figure out their real gender...despite being very attracted to them regardless.

- Perhaps you've fallen into your favorite anime/movie, only to find that your character's ""love interest"" may not be entirely...female.

**Other:**

Got a suggestion of your own? Just tell me! And as a side note, if I don't answer you tonight, don't assume you've been ignored or forgotten. I'll answer each and every post as soon as possible, though it may be tomorrow at the latest. Let's have some fun together!"

I am an NTU 2nd year engineering student and have been called up for my first low key cycle.

Since I want to search for an internship in the summer(which is when i would need to serve my low key(1 week), I was wondering:

1. Should I raise the fact that I have reservist coming up which will lead to me being away from office for one week during the internship interview? 

2. Would any companies even want to hire me as an intern?

3. Should I defer instead? But preferably I would want to go back and serve it with my NS friends.

All replies are greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

To use: make a personal copy of the appropriate spreadsheet by right-clicking the LOCKED (padlock icon) version of the spreadsheet you want from the tabs in the bottom left. Or duplicate the entire file to your Google Drive (File &gt; Make a copy...) if you want to hide the evidence that you no-lifed the event for the first three days and have already cleared out the shop. Also, your boss knows you faked your sick call and is taking that into account when he next considers giving you a raise. You can rename your personal tab by double clicking it if you want to pretend another user isn't going to futz with it.

Spreadsheet cells outlined in red require your input, for example the amount of oil your clearing/boss node fleets cost, or how many of each token shop item remain unpurchased in the shop. For the daily normal mode clear bonus column, enter ""0"" for each map you DO NOT clear daily, and the base (non-multiplied) token value if you do clear daily.

All of the calculations will update automatically. Many of the analysis cells are fed by your input into fleet oil costs and which dailies you do, so please take that into account as you fill out the sheet.  Feel free to change whatever you like in your copy, not like I could stop you. Scroll down, scroll right from the first visible modules. I couldn't fit everything in one screen, and the module organization system makes it easy to miss something just outside your visible window. Cells with black triangles in the upper right have explanatory notes. Hover your pointer over the cell to read the note. I don't guarantee the note will be useful.  When the note isn't useful, it'll probably contain a gem birthed from my razor wit.  Hopefully anyone you live with isn't asleep, or you'll surely wake them with your uproarious laughter.

&amp;nbsp;

**This is the preview/placeholder for Winter's Crown EN version, based on information from the JP Rerun version.**  While the event hasn't been officially announced yet for EN, recent Discord leaks (and abducted interns) indicate that it's coming towards the end of February.  Please be aware that the rewards, drops, and possibly node levels are likely to change drastically for EN.  As all of the info is taken straight from the JP wiki, this calculator should work for JP players, and CN/KR if the reward layout is similar.  As of this post, the event isn't live yet, so I'll make minor adjustments in the morning if token values or other easily viewed data is different from the original run.

Keep in mind that, as I'm only a part-time JP shikikan, this version isn't closely error-checked or frequently revised like the EN Live version will be.  Please look forward to the full release on day 1 of the EN event!"

In late June I moved to another city (Bremen to Munich) and started an internship making about 1250 a month post-tax. Now I am trying to use SteuerGo to file my returns since I was told I could get a decent bit of money back since;

* I paid several thousand euros in tuition fees to my University
* I relocated for work
* I paid my health insurance as a student


How valid are all these statements? How can I make sure to properly file my return and get the max refund available?

I know it's been a long time coming. I'm so happy the day is finally here!

Today’s AMA is coming to you live from the Plague House. My clan is sick. Very sick. Wretchedly, shivering in a pile-sick. In an effort to pull myself together, I’m trying out this new cough syrup I got from an online Russian Army Surplus Store. It was packaged inside a road flare. Oh my. I feel it kicking in...

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Dr. Josiah Bancroft, XV. I am the author of the Books of Babel.

My agent’s personal assistant’s intern (Peter) will be responding to your questions today using only answers which have been vetted by Capt. Bancroft’s legal counsel and reviewed by a focus group of wood elves. All opinions expressed below belong solely to Peter, who is legally liable for any disappointment, confusion, or injury that results.

The legend of Gen. Josïah Bancroft, XL, began when the first novel in his Books of Babel series, **Senlin Ascends**, was distinguished by the New York Times – Book Review, who proclaimed: “We have received your submission.” The second book in the series, **Arm of the Sphinx**, was heralded by the U.S. Copyright Office as being “Under review.” The latest (though not final) installment in the series, **The Hod King**, was awarded 5 stars by Star Registry USA / Name a Star for Only $39.99.

 Admiral Bancroft will be popping in and out over the course of today. He has jousting lessons this morning (he is an instructor, of course; not a student), and his fancy dress yoga class takes place this afternoon. But any questions that he doesn’t have a chance to answer during the course of the day will be answered this evening before Peter is allowed to go home to his cat or whatever.

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

Q: What?! There's going to be a fourth book? But Amazon says...

A: I know, I know. And I'm so sorry! I can't get them to acknowledge that the series is a tetralogy. I apologize for the confusion. The fourth and FINAL book in the series is slated for release in 2020.

Q: Are there audiobooks of the Books of Babel?

A: There are indeed! And they are wonderful. John Banks is the narrator, and they're generally available wherever audiobooks are sold.

Q: Will the Orbit edition of *the Hod King* match my set of your self-published books? I'm very particular about having matching spines on my shelf.

A: Oh, me too! But unfortunately, no, the Orbit editions are different sizes and have different spine designs than my self-published books. 

Q: Wait, is this Peter?

A: Nnnnno.

EDIT: Took my little girl to the doctor, and now their sending us to the ER for an x-ray to check for pneumonia. Thank you for being patient with me.

EDIT 2: We’re being admitted to stay overnight at the hospital so they can run tests and observe Maddie. I’m going to answer questions as I can. I’m very grateful for the distraction.

EDIT 3: Maddie’s sleeping for the moment. Still doing tests, but she’s no worse, which is a relief. I’m pretty wiped out, but I’m going to try to get through a few more of your wonderful questions. Whatever I don’t get to tonight, I’ll be sure to answer tomorrow. Thanks for your patience!"

I have been sober and a law abiding citizen since my conviction in 2013. I decided to go back to school for mechanical engineering and will graduate in may this year. I have been offered multiple internship positions only to have the offer pulled after a background check.  I did disclose my criminal history during the interview in each case. Do you have any suggestions that might help me actually land my first position?

ajcpps,2,2019-01-24,[M4F] The Virgin Cumslut: An Anal-Only Life,dpone,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/ajcpps/m4f_the_virgin_cumslut_an_analonly_life/,"*This is a prompt for adults, by an adult, and is purely fantasy.*

One of my favorite fantasies lately is denying a woman access to her pussy, her primary pleasure center, and training her to prefer life that way - to thank me for it. I want to take that a step further, and groom a cute teenage girl to live this way right from the start. Before she's had more than a first kiss, maybe experimented with touching herself. Her life is to be one of service, but it's happy, enthusiastic service.

Here are a few ways this could go down.

If you dig incest:

**Daddy's Little Pornstar**: In this world, the age of consent and the age for appearing in adult films has dropped to 14. Whether Daddy or daughter had the idea first, the daughter is going to become a pornstar. But she's inexperienced. Plus - she needs Daddy's permission, and Daddy has one condition. Lucky for her, it's a gimmick that could make her career.

**Fixing Daddy**: You (and your sister, if you like) have watched me over the past few years as I've dealt with the pain of losing your mother. As you've grown, it's become more difficult. You're the spitting image of her, and the increasingly skimpy outfits haven't been helping. After watching Daddy be miserable for far too long, you've decided you're going to make him happy - no matter what it takes.

If you don't:

**The Swallow Salon**: There's a place where men with enough money can go to enjoy service of a specific sort. You're one of the employees of the Swallow Salon, purchased when you came of age and trained to do a particular job.

**The Assistant**: You've applied for a competitive internship at a secretive company known for all kinds of clever inventions. The company's owner, CEO, and lead inventor is known for liking to keep things ""pristine."" You get the job, and find out that he's looking for a certain type of assistant.

~~

Regardless of which prompt you go with - or come at me with your own! - this is a prompt with orgasm denial and vaginal chastity at its core. If you want to take it even further, any of these prompts could lead to your character receiving chastity piercings - cute little heart-shaped locks and a clit shield making sure you never forget what and who you are. Whether you're spending your days sitting and squirming on Daddy's lap or working at the Swallow Salon, you'll be trapped in a needy, horny haze and come to prefer it that way.

This is an ageplay prompt, so I'd want to play with girls aged 14-17. It can be a daughter, twins, a neighbor, I'm open to ideas.

Even if something about this prompt does it for you that isn't ageplay related, I love the concept in general and would love to hear from you.

**KINKS**

Kinklist, 2019: https://i.imgur.com/ogBCvrX.png

Mainstream kinks: anal and oral, forced/denied orgasms, slutty outfits, stealth/public toys, collars and leashes, cumplay, cock worship, hypnosis/mind control/drugging, free use

Niche Kinks: anal-only, vaginal chastity (required for this one!), ageplay, incest, beast

Turnoffs: blood, barf, bathroom, impreg, lactation, cuckold, feet

**COMMUNICATION**

I prefer to RP here. I'd rather keep RP here until we find out if we're compatible and going to hit it off. Initial replies should be a **few hundred characters long** at least. You can jump right into the RP if you like, but I'd love to chat first - tell me what appeals to you about the RP, what kind of relationship you'd like to play out - that kind of thing.

I don't have the time to do rapid-fire back and forth messages, but I'd love to exchange a few a day, or one really epic one a day. I can do first or third person, and prefer if we have some flexibility over character control but am open to other ideas. Give me some indication that you've read this far!

**Any of my previous posts are open for play too!**"

ajd7j6,6,2019-01-24,Landed an internship at a hospital's lab. How can I incorporate machine learning into their data worK?,Loodyeyes,MLQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLQuestions/comments/ajd7j6/landed_an_internship_at_a_hospitals_lab_how_can_i/,"- Hello everyone, I'm a 2nd year CS student who has some theoretical knowledge but no hands-on experience on data science and machine learning. Today thanks to the help of one of my professors, I had the chance of getting an interview for an internship at a local hospital's biochemistry lab. Thankfully they seemed to like me and wanted to give me a chance to work on their data. They didn't ask me for any specific task, so I have the freedom to think about any kind of project that would mutually benefit both me and them and I will hopefully have their support on whatever ""project"" I come up with. I'm very happy and eager to learn about data science but as a newbie in this field I need you guys' guidance on what I can do. 
- The hospital is a public hospital in a developing country, and I’ve noticed that they are mostly using older technology for their data related work (storage and analysis). I will have access to their patient data to some extent, which I imagine could be fed to some machine learning-driven system to aid them in their analyses? Maybe there’s some new software I can introduce to them that may boost their quality of life in terms of the way they handle their data?

- I’m open to all kinds of advice, thank you for your time in advance."

ajduw5,16,2019-01-24,Plan b failed,throwaway837466292,abortion,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/ajduw5/plan_b_failed/,"I regularly use condoms, but the condom failed (got stuck inside me), and then I got plan b within 24 hours. The pharmacist, or anyone that has ever mentioned plan  b, failed to mention it stops working at 176 lbs and I'm about 180-185 depending. So... I used two different birth control methods and neither worked. I found out Tuesday night and confirmed yesterday morning. I scheduled to have the surgical procedure next Wednesday, because I spent last weekend very sick (and had to take off on Friday) and I don't want to be stuck vomiting again all day from the medical one.

It sucks having to wait a week. I could get the medicine tomorrow since there was an open appointment, from everything I read it's much easier on your body to do the surgical procedure. For anyone who's experienced it I would appreciate advice and encouragement. I'm grateful I'm in California and this is covered under medi-cal.

I'm also going to get the implant asap after this is over. I never had an issue before, and the few times in my life a condom failed and I used plan b (probably weighing less) and never had an issue.

So far I've only told one friend who's a huge supporter of feminist issues and pro-choice. I don't know if I'll tell anyone else, possibly my roommate.

My partner has been supportive. Neither of us could deal with this financially right now, and I'm planning to start graduate school this fall. I'm just sad this happened, and really mad the pharmacist didn't indicate anything. I'm going to call them and voice this.

Edit: Told the manager of the Walgreens so he could pass it along. Then told the pharmacy intern where I'm currently picking up an RX. I told him I discovered on Reddit and they should be telling people, and then he was like well the internet, so I showed him a case study (because I knew he wasn't going to take my word that I read a case study based on his response, ugh). He let me know it wasn't in his education, even though that article is from 2014. People should really know.

https://endocrinenews.endocrine.org/august-2014-pregnant-pause/

Upon further frustration and contemplation, I submitted a complain to the Board of Pharmacy for CA because I think all Walgreens and pharmacies need to tell women about this. 

Update- I had the surgical abortion yesterday and everything went through well. My partner ended up getting time of work to be with me and that made a huge difference. They held my hand during the procedure, and told me about it afterward bc I remembered nothing. The people were super nice, and I got a ton of info (more than I ever have in my life) about birth control and have one I'm hoping works for me. This was an awful thing to through, but I think I handled it as well I could have. I think having the surgical was the rofjt choice for me, and alltogether everything was pretty painless. I just needed a few strong ibuprofins last night and today, but the pain has been mild with that."

Fast cars usually, I’ll get into that in a bit. 


So here’s what I’ve written down in my dream journal today:




Incredible fucking dream. With (kid from real life) and (kid from real life) and we step inside this beautiful mall. It’s not very big and there’s lots of police wandering around. Someone mentions how being dead is so content, and how rain calms him and that being dead is just rain. (Real life guys) and I go around and we just look, amazed by the mall and never wanting to leave. But we realize we can’t, no exits and police are everywhere, it’s a literal prison. We decide to make a break for it and charge out the side door, (real life guys) run off and a guard is behind them at the door, I push past the guard and run to a parking lot. This parking lot had everything, Subaru WRX (late models), Toyota Supra, drift S13s, all sorts of beautiful Japanese cars. For whatever reason I spend a bit of time trying to choose and I choose the bright blue Subaru. Hop in, and for whatever reason, the inside is like my Volvo, green backlighting, all the same buttons. I start it up, and it’s so fucking hard to drive, no traction and I can barely turn. I lock the doors and the guard comes out with that super cold shit (I still forget what it is, like super cooled nitrogen or something I think)  and blows it on door handle trying to get in. I dump the clutch and slam the gas. I’m speeding past and all the sudden I pull the hand brake and spin her around. I speed past the mall again and back to the streets I go. Weaving between cars. Then for some reason I’m Spider-Man trying to get another car to follow a train. But these dudes kill me and I wake up. I remember a game over screen and having the camera pan past my dead, ragdolled body like a video game, I also remember feeling “wow this fucking sucks” 

Another dream I think was before the one above, I don’t remember it all:


Also, I had a dream in the beginning about something like a substance that’s sticky but gives you some crazy powers or something, super important. (Sister) and some other weird kids were outside my window rubbing it on my house. I got up and I said bro what the fuck. I remember I said “I’m not afraid to kick out this fucking window bro” Then I kinda got an establishing shot of this house in the woods, can’t see through the windows on this rectangular extension outside of the house. There’s maybe like 20 people here and they go inside and see that you can see outside of the glass, but not inside. I believe they said “wow he fucking did it again!” Not sure what they meant by that one. I think I was lucid but I’m not sure, I felt lucid in subaru dream, fucking great dream 9/10. 



Never been on this sub before, felt like I had to tell someone. My mom let me stay home today if I got some work done for this one class, so I was woken up at 6:00 and I had a discussion with her about it. I texted my internship and told them I wouldn’t be coming in today at 9:00, if I remember correctly I should have been fast asleep, but my writing was coherent and made sense. I woke up maybe 10 minutes ago, did that have something to do with if I was lucid or not? 


Also I was high as shit last night so maybe I was a bit more creative "
ajekh3,1,2019-01-24,Playing a region locked game in another region,Blasmere,uplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/uplay/comments/ajekh3/playing_a_region_locked_game_in_another_region/,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days ago, my sister won a contest on school in which she won a key for Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Since she's no gamer, and since I don't have the game yet, she gave it to me. However when inspecting I saw it's a copy that's locked to Europe. Which is fine because we do reside here, only in September I will be moving abroad for  a couple of months for an internship I have to do for school.

So my question is, can I still play ACO when I go to the US for my internet? Or is the only possibility that I have to go trough support to get a US version and, if so, can I change it back to EU if I didn't land a job and move back to my home country?"
ajep0p,1,2019-01-24,My Humble Advice for Getting into Grad School,ExpressingStardust,OTStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/OTStudents/comments/ajep0p/my_humble_advice_for_getting_into_grad_school/,"I want to make this clear that I am no expert, but I am going to tell you what worked for me and may work for you as well. I go to a US top 35% ranked grad school. 

&amp;#x200B;

To start, **talk to your prospective school's OT Advisor(s) as soon as you begin college**. I waited late, but regretted it because they were able to tell me exactly where I was weak and strong. Of course, they cannot tell you their opinion on whether or not they think you'll get in, but they can help strengthen your portfolio. EVEN IF you think you can do this on your own, still talk to them because you never know. Additionally, be professional both virtually and in person when you talk to them. Sometimes they are on the decision board and if you showed up to a meeting in your pajamas and were unprofessional, they'll remember and it \*could\* sway their decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Shadow OT's.** Not after three years of school. As soon as you are able. You may find you don't even like OT and then you have three years of schooling for nothing. **Shadow soon.** It may seem boring, but trust me. If or when you start grad school you will find your time spent shadowing as priceless. Shadowing can also look good on an application.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grades. Grades are important regardless of whether or not you agree with them.** In school, you have to demonstrate that you know how to study and take in information, this is reflected through your grades. First and foremost, you need **high grades in your prerequisite classes.** This shows you effectively learned the basics you need for grad school. I would say that keeping **a good GPA** is your second priority. In grad school, you will study for hours and hours. If you cannot do this in undergrad, grad school will be a challenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of schools require **references**. Be sure to keep this requirement in mind as you start school. You don't want to look back and realize that you texted in every single one of your classes (don't do this in general, but just an example) so you have no academic references. Be active and engaged in your classes and talk with some professors you connect with. You'll have a great person to go back for a reference. Same for your work or volunteer work, people from these settings can be great references as well, depending on your school's requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

**Join your school's student OT association** if it has one. It will be full of graduate students that have been in your shoes and can give you advice and encouragement to get where they are at. This also looks good on an application. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other requirements can be weighted differently in importance depending on the school you go to, but having a lot of strengths definitely doesn't hurt. This is why I'll emphasize **talking to your advisor** once again. They know what is important and they are there to tell you. Utilize them! Some schools want a certain standardized test score (such as the GRE), some like research, some leadership, some volunteer work, and some like a lot of shadowing. 

To reiterate, focus on your grades, but, add some icing on that cake as well. Do you like research? Find research opportunities. Are you a strong leader? Form a student org or join one and work your way up.  
A list of things that can definitely help are:

* Working in a medical setting (even as a secretary or a person who answers the phone)
* A medical internship
* A higher standardized test score (if they require one)
* Volunteer hours (bonus if it is focused on people or community)
* Shadowing hours
* Leadership Experience
* Research
* Involvement in your school (joining clubs, the honor's college, etc.)

Now, expect the best, prepare for the worst. Not everyone will get into grad school. It could be you despite putting your best effort forth. You can apply to many different schools if you want (which if you are able to and plan to do this, talk with those schools advisors as well about what they require that is different) and you can usually apply more than once, but sometimes people just don't get in. Have a plan B from day one. This plan can alter and change, but still, have one. Maybe you try OTA school instead? Or Recreational Therapy? Or Sports Medicine? Health Administration? Social Work? Or maybe something even entirely different that interests you! But have something, and something you can get a job in. Sure, maybe you can afford to switch back and forth in college for many years (lucky!), but many can't. So do your research and reflect on what will work for you! 

Again, I am not an expert and you shouldn't take my advice as the end all of advice. Every program is different, and so is every person and their circumstances. Talk with your advisors often, and good luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you have any other advice!

ajg4nt,5,2019-01-24,Should I [21F] contunue my 8 years relationship with my bf [22M] after I move to anoter country?,StatusAccountant,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ajg4nt/should_i_21f_contunue_my_8_years_relationship/,"First of all - I am truly sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language.

My bf (22M) and I (21F) started dating in school and dating since then (8 years now). When we started dating, I wasn't very sure about what should I do with my future, and what I want to study, etc. He've shown me a world of IT, I've started coding, and started computer science major after finishing school. So, basicly, everything I am now is because of him.

Afterwards, my studies went pretty well - I've done several internships in huge IT companies and last one finished with an offer, which I accepted. I am going to move to another country in several months.

His studies wasn't going so well, and it turns out that he is going to stay in our country for next two years.

Now, we have a big choice. One variant is marry now (which will give him a status of my dependant) and he will move to me in two years. The other one is breaking up.

I must say that our relationship wasn't very smooth all the time. Our views on fashion, politics and almost everything are different. As an example, he really despite the idea of marriage (except for the reason I've described above), while I see this as a normal step in relationship. For long time I was thinking that this differences thing is great, but actually, it makes me very tired. Also, he often say some rude things, which can make me cry. Usually he wasn't really meaning them, but still. On the other side, as I've previously said, he is the main reason of my success. And he loves me.

I am not sure about what should I do. Marriage seems like a huge step for me, and I am not very sure if we can handle these two years.

*tldr* We've been together for 8 years, but now I am going to move to another country and he cannot join me for next two years. I am not very sure if we can keep this thing going on a long distance.

ajg8zu,45,2019-01-24,"So GoLocalProv’s a Scam, right?",Bmet1,providence,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/ajg8zu/so_golocalprovs_a_scam_right/,"Looking through Glassdoor today and saw two very damning reviews that align with things also seen on reddit. Throwaway account because Josh Fenton sounds like a crazy person.

Review 1:
Pros
While at GoLocalProv, I had the opportunity to meet several interesting people outside the company and improve my professional network.

Cons
I was hired at GoLocal under the promise that I would be given the opportunity to learn. My salary was less than the listed minimum because I ""lacked sufficient experience."" It quickly became evident that I would not be given sufficient time to learn and adapt to my role, nor the support I requested and was promised.
I was frequently berated for my ""substandard"" work and was expected to constantly work overtime without receiving anything for it. Emails belittling my work were sent at all hours of the day. Work-life balance is completely nonexistant.
 I witnessed my coworkers getting the same treatment every day, many to the point of quitting to escape the abuse.
After I left the organization, it took me several months and outside intervention to receive my final check.

Advice to Management
Mr. Fenton is not interested in listening to anyone's opinion other than his own. If you don't do everything exactly the way he would, prepare to hear about it.
My advice to him: listen to your employees. Appreciate and promote their talents. Your ego is sabotaging the reputation of your company and the mental health of your employees.

Review 2:

Pros
Even for the low pay, this could have been an enjoyable and informative job, if it wasn't for the person in charge. The other employees were nice.

Cons
Sketchiest job experience ever! Do your research before you apply, especially on CEO Josh Fenton.
During the interview the Mr. Fenton, went out of his way to tell me ""don't worry, you won't be a slave or anything"", which is... a pretty major red flag. He also was very illusive about paperwork. He even changed my job description AFTER I had accepted the job, and the salary of the original job posting was not what I was offered.
Mr. Fenton has no real background in journalism. He has set himself up as the dictator of this news site and cycles through interns and young reporters because nobody else would tolerate such a job. This means he also has no idea about the appropriate role of an editor, and if he catches anything he needs to edit, he will use it as an opportunity to demean you (the exact opposite of what an editor is supposed to do). The journalist/editor relationship is poisoned from day one, the work environment gets completely silent and even hostile the second he enters the room. Eventually all his employees walk out.
He also doesn't remember the things he says, so he may get upset at you for following the very instructions he gives you!
I once saw him bring an employee outside and yell at him because he turned around in his chair to participate in a conversation.
Worst of all, he didn't pay me for months after I left, and every time I emailed him he'd invent some new excuse, grovelling and weaseling in an attempt to make me wait a few weeks longer. Eventually I threatened to go to the labor bureau and (surprise!) the check arrived in a matter of days.
Do yourself a favor and look up the reputation of GoLocal and Mr. Fenton before you apply. Look up the failures of ""GoLocalPDX"" and how he didn't pay several employees. Look up ""GoLocalProv Turtleboy"" and see how he threatens to sue former employees.

Advice to Management
Hire a real editor. Pay your employees.

——
I looked up all this Turtle Boy stuff and complaints from the past and I am fascinated that nobody’s done anything about it. It’s like a #MeToo moment waiting to happen. Not to mention his shit relationship with the government in Providence. 

Is Go Local just an all around scam? How has nothing been done about it?

ajgd0h,2,2019-01-24,I am starting to question my beliefs and need help,SonneKrieger7,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/ajgd0h/i_am_starting_to_question_my_beliefs_and_need_help/,"I grew up Greek Orthodox, was an altar boy, and now I'm in college. Only about 5 of the hundreds of people I met are Christian (all denominations). They aren't very religious either. So, I only have friends that are atheist. Every time religion comes up, people ask me why I believe. Generally I would say that the Bible doesn't conflict with science or the passage you are talking about is being misinterpreted yada yada... After 2 years of being asked these questions, I really started to think about it these the past 6 months. I realized that:

1.) I was going to church just to be there. I would participate half the time but I wouldn't really care

2.) When I really thought about it, I was saying God exists but I didn't TRULY believe in God

3.) Stuff I thought might be demons or God answering prayers could be explained away

* Ex. I ""felt"" like something was watching me when I was sleeping. The priest blessed the house and it went away for a little bit but then the feeling came back. When I started getting more comfortable in the dark, the feeling went away completely
* Ex. I thought I lost my $100 jacket and then prayed, when I woke up the next day, I found it in the closet with my roommates stuff, where I didn't look the day before

&amp;#x200B;

First I went to my priest and he suggested I started building a strong relationship with God, so I started kneeling in front of the icon of Christ and praying every day. I also started reading the Bible. Well its months later and it still feels like I'm talking to nothing. No indication I'm doing anything right or God is listening.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as churches go, I've started to get annoyed at Orthodox churches. I don't look Greek or Eastern European, so every time I walk into one when I'm traveling, I get singled out and people become cold to me. When I was researching the other denominations, a lot of other people experienced this too in Orthodox churches.

&amp;#x200B;

There's one thing holding me back from outright giving up on Christianity. There are Christian conversion testimonies of people on the internet. Some of them seem shady, but then when I was doing an internship this summer, one Protestant guy told me that he talks to God like I was talking to him right now. He said he was born with a disease that made him allergic to water. But, because he had such a good relationship with God, God made it so water didn't hurt him. (Or something along those lines)

I'm Zach, as my character will be as well
5'11"" short brown hair spiked up in front light brown eyes, average body build with mild-moderate muscle tone. 

Looking for long-term RP. My main style of RP is romance based erotica that has plot and build up, going right into it ruins the anticipation and tension behind the big scenes, I enjoy a lot of flirtatious vibes and a lot of close encounters that are either ultimately stopped due to either interruptions or other events in our characters world delaying the smut scenes. 

Ideas:

A romance of a young CEO who's inherited his fathers company early due to family death. You play the young female intern. The CEO falls for the young intern but wont say anything due to his current status, and she wont say anything due to her being the new intern.
**Bonus points for females who can play switch. 

A military RP. We were left behind in an emergency evacuation of our current assigned mission. We're stuck fighting to survive deep behind enemy lines. Trying to find a way to get in contact with our superiors to get out. 

I'm the leader of a large, modern day mob. You'd play as the sister of one of my associates. You know about your brothers being connected to my dealing and originally want no part of it. 

You've ran away from home and ended up in California. I'm a rookie Police Officer who finds you wandering a bad part of town, after a short discussion I offer to help you get on your feet. (Will elaborate the direction of story through kik) 

I'm very open to others ideas, so long as there are realistic rules. Not big into fantasy and Sci-Fi, etc. 

I tend to type 1-2 paragraphs, I expect the same in return. If only 1 paragraph then I would like at least 5-6lines, highly detailed as possible.

I am done with feeling like I am wasting my time in an office that could care less of whether I show up to work or not.
You don’t want to give me work? Fine, I’ll work for myself.
It’s against office rules? Well what you’re doing is considered sexist and racist which I believe is against office rules as well.
You can go stick a giant crow bar up your as*"

I'm Zach, as my character will be as well
5'11"" short brown hair spiked up in front light brown eyes, average body build with mild-moderate muscle tone. 

Looking for long-term RP. My main style of RP is romance based erotica that has plot and build up, going right into it ruins the anticipation and tension behind the big scenes, I enjoy a lot of flirtatious vibes and a lot of close encounters that are either ultimately stopped due to either interruptions or other events in our characters world delaying the smut scenes. 

Ideas:

A romance of a young CEO who's inherited his fathers company early due to family death. You play the young female intern. The CEO falls for the young intern but wont say anything due to his current status, and she wont say anything due to her being the new intern.
**Bonus points for females who can play switch. 

A military RP. We were left behind in an emergency evacuation of our current assigned mission. We're stuck fighting to survive deep behind enemy lines. Trying to find a way to get in contact with our superiors to get out. 

I'm the leader of a large, modern day mob. You'd play as the sister of one of my associates. You know about your brothers being connected to my dealing and originally want no part of it. 

You've ran away from home and ended up in California. I'm a rookie Police Officer who finds you wandering a bad part of town, after a short discussion I offer to help you get on your feet. (Will elaborate the direction of story through kik) 

I'm very open to others ideas, so long as there are realistic rules. Not big into fantasy and Sci-Fi, etc. 

I tend to type 1-2 paragraphs, I expect the same in return. If only 1 paragraph then I would like at least 5-6lines, highly detailed as possible. 

My kinks: To be discussed over kik

Hard Limits: Vore, gore, scat, any bodily fluids.

ajgo30,2,2019-01-24,My [24m] gf [23f] does not get along with my friends,Boardgame222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ajgo30/my_24m_gf_23f_does_not_get_along_with_my_friends/,"So to keep it short, I met my girlfriend 2 years ago when she did an internship in my (European) country. She is from SE Asia and we dated for a year, when she had to return home for a bit. After three months of LDR she started college here, which was about a year ago.

From the very start our relationship had always been difficult, seeing as it is an interracial and intercultural one. There were and are many things in our respective upbringing, that made finding solutions to fights difficult. But all in all we have constantly been getting better at communicating, even if we are far from perfect.

So the problem that I am asking you about is the following: Over the years there have been a few get-togethers with my circle of friends. Sometimes I went alone and sometimes I brought my gf. Of course there was always a certain language barrier, as she does not speak my language perfectly (about B2 level, so she is able to hold a conversation on her own.). There were some awkward moments and sometimes also misplaced prejudiced jokes, but at least they were in good faith. My gf usually kept to me and would go sleep if it got too late (she is quite introverted and gets tired in big groups), but before she had a good time, if you were to ask me.

Now a few days ago we went for dinner with two other couples. We had a good time, talked for a bit, my gf was quiet but also joined the conversation if only briefly. Afterwards we texted a bit and I could feel something was wrong. Long story short, we talked on the phone and my girlfriend broke down, saying that she would have to leave me because she felt she would never be able to spend time with my friends, she was always an outsider who couldn't hold a proper conversation and that she'd rather leave me than have me chose between her and my friends.

I could feel that she sometimes had trouble keeping up with conversations, when we were talking about difficult topics, but I always tried to include her.

Gf had told me beforehand that she feels like my friends don't like her because they never talk to her and in a way I could see that. They are kind of shy, and I figured maybe it was because they did not know how to properly speak to her, or they were afraid of not understanding her.

So yeah, here I am, sorry for this wall of text, English is not my first language and I am kind of lost right now. I don't know what to tell my gf, we have spoken since but it is incredibly hard to get more information out of her, she immediately shuts down if I pry too hard on what is bugging her.

Any advice on how to speak to her about this?

Tl;dr: GF is a foreigner in my country and does not get along with my friends due to language barrier, how do I proceed?

I’m a P4 graduating this May and I’ve been working in CVS/Target for 6 years now as a tech turned intern. I have a job lined up after graduation which I’m thankful for, but I always get so down reading the forums and seeing where the market is headed. I feel like I’m entering the worst part of the field and the future prospects aren’t good. I’m not against branching out into other areas of pharmacy but I actually really like retail - honestly the biggest stress in retail for me stems from the understaffing. If we were adequately staffed and not taken advantage of, I feel like retail can be a wonderful fulfilling career. 

I try not to worry too much and do what I can but it seems like there’s a general consensus of giving up on retail cause it’s a sinking ship. But I really have enjoyed my time in retail and I think with adequate staff it’s a great job. I love the longer shifts with more days on and the flexibility as well and those patients you build rapport with are amazing. 

Any opinions from pharmacists who’ve been in the field? I’m all about improving conditions for EVERY pharmacist cause we’re all in this together - but I don’t wanna give up on retail either. "

There was a fair amount of breaking up and getting back together. During one of our breaks she had gotten an internship at Disney in Florida. I decided to be sweet and surprise her because she was home sick and I was young and could just be like ""yo mom and dad I'm going to Florida for the weekend, peace!"". I got a friend to ride with me so I didn't have to go alone. I kept it a secret that I was coming until I hit Florida and then I told her. She got me set up with a room in the park by the time I got there. 


It was always magical seeing her. You know that one ex that you wanna be mad at and hate but the second you see them you fall back in love like nothing ever happened. That's what she was. And that's what I was to her. 


She takes the next day off so she can hang with us. We do some fun stuff here and there. Have a great time. That night we get ready and head down to the pool shaped like a guitar. It's probably 930pm or so but its Disney so its packed with kids and adults. But my God did she look hot in her bikini. 


She had a little meat to her. Curvey girl. Had a breast reduction after high school from an H cup to DD cup. Hair down past her ass. Memorizing hazel eyes. Pale skin. She usually dyed her hair super dark purple or Auburn. 


So the 3 of us slip into the pool. Its summer time so the water was warmer than  it was outside. Which is fine. I swim up behind her and wrap my hands around her waist. We are both facing our friend (a girl). She starts wiggling her ass against my cock. Seconds before it's hard and trying to burst out of my swim trunks. When our friend turned her head or looked at something else I saw her glance at me and bite her lip. 



I'm thinking how am I gonna pound her in the hotel room all 3 of us are sharing. Because there's no way I would have a 3 some with the friend. She's just not attractive at all. However she had other plans.


I feel her hand slide down my stomach and straight into my trunks. Gripping my shaft and slowly tugging back and forth. I'm moaning into her back/shoulder as quiet as I could. Reaching down and rubbing her pushy from behind. She turned around and out her arms around me. Saying outloud how she's missed me. Legs wrapped around me. Fuck this. 



I reached down and pulled my cock out. Children swimming by bumping into us. Adults laughing and playing games with each other and their kids. Still talking to our friend. I push her bikini bottom to the side and press the swollen head of my cock to her opening. She uses her legs to impale herself on me. I clench my jaw to keep a straight face. 



We start to ""swim""  little which was an excuse to move her up and down. A little bit. She grinded her hips against me as hard as she could up and down. It was soaked inside her pussy. So soft and tight. She pressed her face to the side of my neck and started whisper moaning and talking to me. Telling me how bad this is. How hot this is. How much she loves my cock. I keep a straight face (I think?) as I continue listening and responding to the friend. 



She starts grinding her tight young pussy harder. As discreetly as she can. She whispers she's gonna cum and begs me over and over and over to cum inside her. Right there in that crowded pool. I felt my cock throbbing as rope after rope of cum exploded inside her. She said she could feel me cum. Kept grinding. Our hearts pounding against each other as we sway in the water.



She lifts herself off and pulls her bottoms back. Turns around and continues chatting with our friend. Nobody questioned why her face was red as an apple. It was certainly a night I'll never forget. "

My W-2 has 2 pages, one for CA and one for PA (curiously, no PA income tax was withheld, only a city tax from Philadelphia where I live). TurboTax is apparently double counting this and saying that my adjusted taxable income in PA is around 94,000 when in reality I only earned around 48k this year. Is this correct?

I made this call after 15 days of agony with my family and friends but especially my girlfriend of almost 1 year. She saw a side of me that she never knew before and it was not pretty. It was very difficult for her, in a way that she now has to deal with her own problems because I can't give her the support anymore due to my own problems. I have to do the same, because I can't go on like this. So I will be returning home after the weekend but feel that our relationship is in a though spot. I have to give her space because that's what she wants, but I am in dire need of her affection, which is what I want (now). I have decided that it will be best for her (and probably eventually me) that just for a while I see her less, and on her agenda (before the internship in the end of the day we were almost always together). But I still feel this desire to be with her all the time and am really sad that things can't be as it was before. I am going to seek help for my own problems, but I am so afraid that our relationship will end now or after I have changed due to my own quest to get better. Before this all we made plans to move in together. I know we still love each other a lot and want to be together forever, but I am so insecure from time to time that I am not thinking straight and think everything is done. I hope my therapy etc will help me with this but what should I do now? I am going to live with my parents again because they don't trust me to be on my own anymore (I have never really be on my own before). I want to eventually be free of these insecurities and live together with my girlfriend.

Is this too much to ask? Are we lost? Am I just overthinking everything? How can I shut off my head, thinking that everything will be done due to me these last 2 weeks? "

In the last 5 weeks, a lot of my life just sorta crumbled away. Just for background, I had an extremely troubled childhood that culminated in multiple suicide attempts during high school.

My grandma died a few days before Christmas last month, and she was the closest thing I had to a maternal figure after my dad died. After he died, my mom sort of became unhinged. For example, she believed people were spying on her through the computer, so it stayed off for years while I did homework at the library. Then I would go home and just be alone until around 10pm. Which was for the best. She always came home either in a rage where she would immediately scold me basically because she just didn’t like looking at me and beat me if I made a squeak during her rants (as in, there was a time where she threw my head against the wall strong enough to make me bleed) or she would just have a weird kinda silence where she basically just sat down next to my sister and me and watched TV, and I couldn’t be sure what she was going to do.

But anyway, that’s just the context. I had to go back to my hometown for my grandma’s funeral a little while ago, and being there brought back a lot of really painful memories which have all been sort of been coming in waves. Some days I’m gone, sometimes I’m fine. It really just depends on how much I remember during any specific moment.

Then on new year’s eve, I had an internship that ended. For further context. I just graduated college but that was my first real industry job aside for student organization experience. I was hoping they would offer to extend my internship, since I worked alongside another intern that worked there for 3 years in college (and continues to work there). So I basically was told to leave on new year’s eve and that I could use them as a reference whenever I needed.

Almost immediately after that, my mom started threatening to kill herself over my sister moving out (I still live close to them). So I had to go over and talk her down, while trying to help my sister move.

Recently, she called my sister doing similar things that she would do with me. I intervened immediately and drove back to her home, because I wanted to talk her down and tell her it was inappropriate to do that I my sister. She ended up threatening to call the police on me, and I had to leave because she’d done that before. Then just a few days ago she demanded I give back the keys she gave me to her house, and essentially told me I was no longer welcome at the place she would decorate with words like ‘home.’

That was the day I was supposed to leave for a drive to Florida for a networking event/conference with a friend. I scheduled the trip as a way to try and find another job in an industry that’s almost entirely about who you know (I graduated with a journalism degree, but I am trying to pivot to marketing since I realized journalism isn’t for me).

While in Florida, I got absolutely shitfaced drunk just because with so much going on, why wouldn’t I? It might as well have been a vacation as well as a work-thing (part of the convention was a bar crawl and a friend from college ai went with agreed to take care of me beforehand).

Then, the next day, I was still a little drunk, but we went to the panels because I knew he wanted to go. Only I told him to leave me in the car while he went in so I could sleep it off. While sleeping it off, I considered suicide then and there, in a similar way to when I was in high school. Those events led me to being hospitalized (I’ve been seeing a therapist ever since, but there’s still a lot I don’t tell him). However in Florida, I decided it wasn’t my time yet and didn’t do it.

Now, I’m back home. I ate an edible a little while ago and while high, thought about the shit going  and considered killing myself like I had in Florida. It made me incredibly frightened, and I decided that I wanted to text a close friend and ask him to check up on me every week or so to make sure I didn’t try anything.

As a result of the shit with my parents growing up, I never had friends. Now that I have some, I’m terrified of losing them. Yet, I never told any of them of my flirtations with suicide, or the fact I was hospitalized and diagnosed with some mental illnesses (lol, you should be able to tell that by now, I guess) before meeting them.

I just don’t know if just asking someone to check up on me like that may push them away.

At the same time, this particular friend has called us best friends in the past. He said he’d do anything for me. But I’m worried this is a little much, since it’s tied into things I never told him about.

I’m worried about pushing him away, but could also use that kind of support right now, so I just don’t know what to do.

Sorry for the wall of text, obviously I have a lot to get off my chest at the moment. And, this was therapeutic."
ajjx8c,16,2019-01-24,I manifested a car!,rustyeye,lawofattraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/ajjx8c/i_manifested_a_car/,"(Wrote this on January 22, 2019) 

After three weeks of searching for a car, I finally found one on the day my rental was due back. 

Luckily, I had a rental but I was getting so anxious because nothing was coming through. I kept telling myself that it was going to come, not to stress. Which worked sometimes but other times I’d get so upset about the situation but I’d just try to change my mindset or just let go. 

Today, my rental was due back &amp; I start my internship and I am scheduled to work tomorrow. I was stressed. So (not going to lie) I smoked some weed right after crying (Crybaby, I know lol) about it being 4pm and my rental being due back by 6pm and I still didn’t have a car. 

I completely let go. Smoking weed can go either way with me, I guess I was so focused on the conversations and the moments I was sharing with a friend, I forgot about the car situation. Once I was done, I touched base with my father (who helped with the search) and he informed me of a potential car. 

After a few messages with the owner, we agreed for a time to meet. I can now happily say I am a proud owner of a lovely car. A car that drives like new and has a good radio system(which is important lol jk definitely something I wanted for sure). Mechanic approved and dad approved. 

Some actions things that I do contribute to manifesting it are: 
- I cleaned out my rental. I had my rental for three weeks, I had a rosary hanging from the review mirror. Red ribbon on the gear stick (small cultural things that I hold dear) I feel by doing so, I let the universe know I am ready to move on. As I put my belongings in a bag I let the universe know I was ready to move these items into my new car. 
- I expressed gratitude as I dropped off my rental. I tend to record my life because I enjoy sharing good news with the world (see next action) and as I did so, I spoke in present tense. “So excited to go pick up my car” etc. 
- I shared the news with my immediate family who’s all been on the same search with me. No one else. Energy is real and I do sometimes I do believe people mean no harm but their own negative thoughts effect you. 

Another way the universe helped me tonight that I want to express gratitude for (again) is all the green lights on the way to drop off the rental. My father and I left at 5:52pm and Enterprise closed at 6pm, we live about 7 minutes away. The ride there was clear and we got there right on time. Some may say it’s a coincidence but maybe that’s what this is all about, appreciating life when it does work in your favor. No matter how insignificant.

Now if only I can master my financial abundance lol "
ajk2c6,0,2019-01-24,Seeking Opinions on Personal Statement,Christian_J_Ledford,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/ajk2c6/seeking_opinions_on_personal_statement/,"Hello all! Mind giving my personal statement a quick readover and some surface opinions?

​What is the purpose of the law and, accordingly, what is the purpose of the state? For the longest time, I hadn’t the slightest idea. I had lived years of my life blinded by the ideology of Republican-distorted conservatism, all too often and all too easily subscribing to misguided notions that regularly and nonchalantly emphasized justice as a punitive rather than rehabilitative measure, excused undeniable injustices committed by agents of the state, and ignored various vital natural rights that didn’t align with my socially conservative worldview. My view of the law and my view of the state was narrow; to put it as simply as possible, I regrettably held the disposition that the purpose of the state was to preserve and maintain a worldview of social conservatism while the purpose of the law was to strike back at any who objected. Philosophies of self-ownership and individualism were lost on me as I apathetically supported laws and measures that unintentionally, in the name and for the sake of a worldview which I had seldom taken the time to question, tightened the grip the state held on the individual. Fortunately, I was not destined to remain in the dark forever, as two key components forever changed the way in which I regarded both the law and the state: education and experience.
​From the very first day I stepped into university, my preconceived notions and unquestioned ideals were placed on the defensive. Professors with a passion for education and truth, without disparaging my character, allowed me to escape my former worldview by guiding me on a path that exposed me to knowledge and allowed me to make my own conclusions from the facts I encountered. The liberal arts education I’ve received at a university level has proven invaluable my own moral and philosophical development as an adult. During my time at university, I became enamored with Enlightenment political philosophy that emphasized the rights and dignity of the individual above all else. Among others, the writings of John Locke, who emphasized that the only justified purpose of a state is to protect the rights to life, liberty, and property of its denizens, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued that government can only ethically exist as a contract where the state vows to protect the rights of its citizens, permanently transformed the way in which I viewed the world. My own political philosophy shifted as I developed a passion for the preservation and protection of individual natural rights above all else and recognized, for the first time, that the ideas which I had subscribed to and fought for before had been misguided and misinformed.
​It was not education alone which changed my ideas, as my experiences also fostered development which I’ve had the privilege to undergo. The summer of my sophomore year gave me the opportunity to work as an undergraduate intern in public defense. Admittedly, I entered this opportunity still in the midst of my previously-mentioned philosophical transition and my placement in this internship was a mere coincidence, the result of being placed in any intern position available to satisfy college credit; I had naively entered this opportunity with the ubiquitous question in mind of how a lawyer could stomach to defend the guilty. Perhaps this coincidence of placement was luck, or even fate, as I soon learned that this question I held ignored the point of defense entirely. My supervising attorney shared with me the truth: defense was not about assigning or determining guilt or innocence, but instead about protecting the human rights of the accused and insuring, at all costs, that justice was served ethically, equally, and fairly. This simple assertion, along with the experiences that followed that summer, destroyed my formerly dichotomic view of the law and revolutionized the way in which I view criminal justice. I witnessed firsthand the way in which unjust and unnecessary laws that senselessly regulated victimless crimes burdened the underprivileged and gave ample excuses for the state to intervene and impose upon the liberty of individuals and realized that notions of guilt and innocence were secondary to the paramount notion of justice for the individual. I came away from this summer enlightened but also, more importantly, changed.
​Accordingly, this education and this experience have shaped the form in which my personal philosophy of the law exists. For too long the law has operated as a sword when it, according to classically liberal philosophy of natural rights and the social contract, is meant to be a shield. For too long the state has sought to impose upon the rights of the individual rather than dutifully protect those rights. For too long our system has stood idly by while the underprivileged, the dispossessed, and the most vulnerable among us are victimized by unjust and predatory laws in system that wantonly strips them of their natural rights. In my legal education and following career, I intend to break this frightening trend; I intend to be a check, in the capacity in which I can, on the growth of the more authoritarian, unequal, and anti-individualistic tendencies of the state and its criminal justice system. I anxiously dream of a career in law working to defend those at risk of losing their fundamental rights to the overreach of the government and its agents. I fervently envision a future in which I have the legal ability and moral steadfastness to stand against destructive laws such as those enforced in the War on Drugs, fight unjust legal practices such as civil asset forfeiture and unconstitutional ones such as warrantless searches and seizures, halt disturbing trends such as the normalization of police brutality, and prevent the further entrenchment of mass incarceration in American society.
​Consequently, the philosophical change I’ve painstakingly detailed above and resulting worldview which I now inherit make your university and myself a rightful fit for one another. While nearly every graduate student aims to make the case that they would contribute to your university by adding to its preexistent social vibrancy, moral character, and culture of perseverance and diligence, I earnestly hope that this is readily apparent from my proven record of academic success, productivity, and honesty alone and I instead aim to make the case that your university would be vital in the achievement of the dreams of justice I have detailed. With a world-class legal education such as the one your university offers, there are scarcely any limits to what I can achieve; with the instruction of your university’s renowned scholars behind me, there are few boundaries that can hold me back from procuring justice for the wronged. My passion for the philosophy of law, which every great lawyer must possess, and drive to succeed allow me to promise you my triumph.

ajk2uw,1,2019-01-24,Working on camera crew wasn't for me. Should I turn to a production company?,ritzcrackerjacks,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/ajk2uw/working_on_camera_crew_wasnt_for_me_should_i_turn/," 

So a little background info about me, I got my BA in Sociology and Psychology about a year and a half ago and decided I wanted to be a Cinematographer. I spent a lot of time PAing on sets and eventually found a camera crew that was willing to train me to be their 1AC. I did that a couple of times then realized that the stress from working long hours and not knowing when the next gig would come would most likely be too much to handle for me (and I also preferred making my own short docs with friends instead of working on set). So I've decided to let go of the Cinematography dream, at least for now, and look toward other career options in film. I had a brief internship with a production company over the summer where i helped screen a film they were trying to sell to distributors and I figured that maybe working with a production company might be the right path to lean into next. I'd still love to be surrounded by film and people who are passionate about it while having stable hours and pay but I really don't know what goes into production company life outside of my very limited experience.

I consider myself to be a very creative and research oriented person and I also some admin experience in addition to set experience but outside of that I don't know what skills I should work on to be more marketable if I do want to go into the field.

What's your position/what has your experience been like? What are the roles? What are the positives and stressors of that environment? What skills does it take to do well?

Thanks to all who answer!"
ajksp8,9,2019-01-24,AITA for making the bride refund me for my bridesmaid dress after she kicked me out of the wedding?,sailortaylorr,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ajksp8/aita_for_making_the_bride_refund_me_for_my/,"The bride is my cousin. She is very selfish, spoiled, and childish. 
I moved in with my aunt and uncle (her mother and father) in order to attend school. Within that time, my cousin and I became very close. She even asked me to be the Maid of Honor in her wedding! (Which later I found out, she also asked the other 2 bridesmaids to be the MOH. All of us said yes.) 
As time passed, I began to realize how shitty of a friend and person she was.

Every topic had to be centered around her life. The only interest she took in my life and my own personal struggles was when she wanted to share the details with our other friends. 
In one specific instance, I was seeing a guy I knew my father disapproved of. After telling my cousin that I didn’t want my father finding out about our quick ‘fling’, she got drunk told him 2 weeks later. 

This is when I learned I could never trust her. 

If I hung out with anyone else in her absence, she would come to me crying, asking why I was upset with her and why I didn’t think to invite her. This happened on multiple occasions with one of the bridesmaids in her wedding, which I began to get very close with. 
Our friend, Anna, was the friend I never knew I needed. She was charming, supportive, and upbeat. This was a stark difference from my cousin who was constantly negative and self-centered.

Then, I accepted an internship and have to move away for 4 months. The wedding is going to be while I’m away. I tell my cousin that I will fly in for the wedding. In my last few months of staying with my aunt and uncle, I knew I had to be very strict about how I delegated my time. I admit I was very selfish. I wanted to be with Anna and my father more than anyone. I would spend many nights bouncing back and fourth between the two. 
Anna and I would go to the mall or have sleepovers. When we would go out, we would shoot my cousin a text inviting her. She always had a bullshit excuse like “I have a class tonight so I need to take a nap” or “My fiancé and I are packing (Granted, this would be a solid reason if we knew she was ACTUALLY packing.)” 

Finally, a week before I left, my cousin asked me every single day, “Are you going to be able to take off for the wedding?” To which I reply, “I am honestly not sure. They are very strict about days that I take off, but I will just leave and get reprimanded if I have to.” 

I move all of my things 2 hours away, to my mom’s house, so we can leave Saturday to head to my internship. (A 14 hour drive)
As soon as I arrive to my mother’s, my cousin sends Anna and I a text. And I quote, “Do yall even wont to be in my wedding, because neither one of you have treated me like you would like me around  for the pass month or so. I will give u the money back on ur dress.”

I replied, “Anna and I are friends, just like how you and I are friends. We didn't kick you to the curb. We asked you to come along more times than I can count - you just always had something else you had to do.
We understood that. We never got mad and upset at you for being busy - just like we never expected you to be upset when we continued our plans without you being there.
If you don't want me in your wedding, that's fine. It's your call to make. I just think you picked a very opportune time to kick me out. You should have told me to my face. And yes, I would like for you to pay me back.” 

She texted me a giant guilt trip about how she always felt left out and unwanted. I know she’s simply being manipulative, wanting me to feel sorry for her, but I do feel sorry for her. I’m starting to feel guilty for her paying me back. 

AITA? Should I return the money? I’m still out of the wedding, but I feel guilty or taking her money.

Edit for clarity: She wasn’t joking about kicking me and Anna out of her wedding; she was dead serious. She made herself very clear in the messages afterwards claiming Anna and I were horrible friends and she didn’t need us. "

I was approved by my Team Leader, her boss, and the two VPs of our company (small company). But when it came up to the CEO to approve my conversion, he said that he did not want to convert any more interns at this time. 2 other interns that were hired in around the same time as me got converted. So I continued to work hard and looked for other opportunities to get converted, but the stars did not align. I was let go because they didn’t have any spots to extend my internship again (got extended twice). And I was unemployed Between mid December of last year and now.

I found a job that is similar to what I used to do as an intern, but they are paying $14/hr. My internship was paying me $18/hr.  I had to take this job because it’s better than being unemployed. I am still continuing to search for better paying jobs, but I am getting anxious just seeing the requirements that these companies are expecting for these positions. I am just worried that it’s going to take a long time to get back to how much I was making as an intern and more.  

I am 26 and still living at home with my dad and little brother. I had saved a lot of money ($7000) from my internship, and I know saving money will be harder.  Already getting pressure from my Dad to start considering to look for houses/apartments to move out. For the record, I am wanting to move out, I just think I need to save more money right now. 

I also made the bad move of looking at other people I know and try to compare myself to them (which I shouldn’t have) because it made me feel shittier that I am not at where they are at at my point in life. Also with pressure that my Dad making a lot of money at his job puts pressure on me to get up to where he is at.

I just felt I needed to vent out here to see if anyone has advice, or going through a similar situation to see how they handle this. 

Thank You. "

Today I overheard her talking quietly to another coworker about what sounded like a struggle with depression  and my heart aches for her because I also struggle with depression. Sometimes I see her making an effort to make a joke but no one seems to hear her except me. She’ll try to join the group discussion but she gets overlooked and I see her defeatedly return back working and give up socializing. I can tell she feels hurt and left out sometimes, and every time I see it happen I almost want to cry because I know how hard it can be. As a lowly intern I don’t know how to reach out and help her either, and I can tell she’s the kind of person who is very private about her struggles. I just wish I could wrap her in a hug and tell her I laugh at her jokes and hear her comments and that I appreciate how much she’s helped me in this experience. Watching her struggle has made me so (perhaps irrationally) sad and now I am understanding a little bit what others might have thought when they saw me struggling on my worst months. "

I'm a student from Vietnam and currently pursuing a PhD degree in mechanical engineering (ME) at an reputable university in the US (let call it Hogwarts)

Although an ME student, My work involved mostly with Plant Science. I have previously trained a disease detection model and port it to run on an Apple Iphone using CoreML. I also work extensively with graphic stack (namely OpenGL and PCL) with to process point cloud of plants and objects. All in all, although my title is PhD in ME, most of my work related to Computer Science.

This is my second year at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, due to recent change in political climate, funding for my lab has been depleted. My two advisors decided that the best way out for me is to take a master degree and exit. I'm just been told yesterday and I have a few month lefts to finish up all the work. I have no family, no friends in the US other than some PhD students here. It's just sad, it's very very sad. I don't know if within 6 months I can finish my paper, complete all the course works and graduate on time. My paper is at an advanced state so it's a bit assuring but other than that, everything is just overwhelming. What should I do? If I can't finish my degree before Fall semester, I will have to pay $10K for tuition and about $5K for food and housing for 6 months. I'm thinking about applying for an intern and use its pay to finance another semester...

I started dating at 16 and went out with M. We dated for 9 months. It was an unequal relationship in the fact that I pursued him and I did more nice things and gave more than he did. The day he broke up with me he went and hung out with his new girlfriend that night.

Fast forward a year and some change and M and I rekindle our relationship in college. It starts out alright but after a year it goes sour. He tells me I'm fat, he settled for me, I'm bad in bed, and that  if he broke up with me again he could easily date me a third time.

Throughout the 3.5 years we dated the second time he'd get on tinder when we were apart and tell me it was meaningless. He'd stay in touch with exes. Right before our last semester of college he broke up with me for a girl he met at his summer internship. They started dating immediately.

He posted about her all over social media, took her on extravagant trips and spoiled her. Things he had never done for me.

Fast forward a year and I meet N at the gym. He pursued me. We ended up in a FWB type relationship. After 2 months of that I told him if he couldn't decide if he wanted to date me I was going to quit seeing him. We get in a relationship.

We date for 6 months while finishing college. He put some effort into the relationship but for the most part it was hanging out at our respective apartments. He tells me he's head over heels in love with me and doesn't want to break up when we both graduate. 

We date long distance 9 months. He moved in with me in April 2018. Moving cities and quitting his job. He was unemployed 3 months while I financially supported him. N had applied to get in the air force officer program and I supported him through that. Tutored him in classes and for his entrance test. 

He told me we'd discuss marriage once he got his ship out date and he knew very clearly I wanted more commitment before he left or before I'd move bc we had been together 2 years at that point and I was uncomfortable giving up my career without increased commitment.

He finally finds out when he's leaving and breaks up with me saying it's him not me. He's not ready for marriage. I'm the love of his life, he's making a mistake and will come back from his training with a ring. He had already lined up a place to live so there was planning on his end.

3 days later he's posting about how beautiful his new girlfriend is and how much he loves her all over social media. Something which he never did with me the entirety of our 2 years together. I think he posted 2 pictures total of us. They met at my family gym and I highly suspect he cheated on me. 

The girl is younger than me (22), chunky, works a minimum wage job and is still in school. I don't know what he sees in her. I have a graduate engineering degree, am in good shape, and pretty enough. I supported him pretty heavily financially and emotionally through the 2 years we were together. Like my prior relationship it was unequal where I gave and he took. 

Essentially every time I have been broken up with the guy has not missed a beat. It makes me feel so small and replaceable. I've been trying so hard to not let it impact my self esteem but it's so hard. Any advice is highly appreciated.

Tldr: always broken up with for another girl. How do I not let it mess with my head and break my self esteem "

Which is, still a lot, and I wish she would stop, but it's better than talking every day. 

Now, I feel better, I am doing better, I have a relationship with my sister for the first time in my life. A lot of the times, she calls me to say hi or ask for help, she no longer takes years to respond to my messages and we are to talk genuinely. I actually like her now. 

My dad was, the typical Edad, I think. Parents divorced a few years ago, and I had always blamed my dad for it. Now, I am starting to see he had actually put up with a lot from my mom. And he is not the narcissist she had made him out to be. We actually have subjects to discuss now! He is helping me look for internships. I even went as far as talking to his girlfriend, whom Nmom blames for the divorce and painted as some sort of human reincarnation of Satan. Turns out, she isn't Satan at all! She even seems cool, and I will meet her soon. 

I'm less anxious, less depressed, more confident in my sexuality, I'm able to talk to people.. 

And this is all the work of a really good therapist, and me finally realizing what my nmom is. 

I actually feel like I'm living now, for the first time in my life. I feel like it will all be okay, that it has started to be okay. "

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of my warranty, my laptop's headphone jack broke, so I requested an on-site repair. During this on-site repair my finger print reader was broken and the right click button connected to my keyboard was also broken. I then sent my machine in to a service depot for repair. I received my machine back after warranty had expired and I found that it would not turn on (it would get stuck in a loop where the fans and lights turn on and off every 1.5 seconds until power was removed). At the time I was in the US for an internship, but I was going to be back in Canada in 2 weeks to be back for school, so I decided to hold off on getting my laptop repaired/replaced until then BUT I made a service request explaining that which was ignored because I was now technically out of warranty. Once I got back in Canada, I called in to explain my issues and a new service request was made but with incorrect info (wrong phone number), I tried calling to fix this issue right afterwards and I was told that it was fixed but it was not and this led to a 2 week delay. 

Anyhow, I decided to escalate the issue, at this point I was requesting a new machine because my laptop had been mishandled twice already, once in front of my own eyes during an on-site repair (the technician had never handled a P51 before) and the second time I received my laptop and it wouldn't boot up. During escalation, I was told that I was not eligible for a replacement because I was now out of warranty (although my machine was broken during a repair while in warranty, kind of odd lol) I was told that they would make an exception for a one-time repair, which I reluctantly accepted for the time being, just to get some progress made on the case. I then made that post a post on lenovo forums which i linked above, sent my laptop in to a depot for repair, and then requested a call back on my case so I wouldn't have my laptop returned to me but rather have a replacement machine sent over because It has already been about 6-7 weeks that I haven't had my laptop and because even if it is repaired successfully this time, I expect that the machine has lost a lot of its durability during these repairs. My posts on the lenovo forums were ignored, as was my call back request.

What should I do? "

I am looking for a detailed female rp with little to no limits for an abusive roleplay including domination from my side.. I love the rps do be as detailed as possible, and for thwm to be in first person(i am fone with you writing in third too, if its absolutely necessary, and me being in first) The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)The wrath of a God: This one is a bit more creative and will take place in ancient Egypt. Your character can be Cleopatra, or any other persone you would like who is celebrated for her beauty. However, this beauty was a gift from the God Anubis, in order to spread his word. But since you used your beauty to be wrongfully know as a God, you will have to fave punishment 

4)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

5)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

6)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo"

ajqh02,6,2019-01-25,An Abusive Home and A Spineless Family,Consume_Pant,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ajqh02/an_abusive_home_and_a_spineless_family/,"I, at 21 have just recently gotten a paid internship at a telecom and networking company. The pay is decent and things are starting to turn around for me. I work a 12-8 shift and work with people who I consider lifelong friends.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I wake up, and when I come home.. All I see is drunken failure. I see a father who used to be so sweet suddenly turn sour as he takes another shot of vodka, another swig of cognac and another glass of wine. I see my mother, arms folded on the other side of the couch, that has now become her bed. And I see that same father, sprawled out on the couch, as if he was a king in a Disney movie, laid upon his side and watching the television. A man who used to ask for me to hang out and I'd happily listen, now is a man who is so lazy that he can't even sit up to speak with you. You must stand in front of him. He commands it.

&amp;#x200B;

My older sister and I lock ourselves in our room regularly to escape the fighting and the slurring. She goes out with her boyfriend to bars to escape, and I have to watch the new puppy. I am stuck inside. I can hear the shouting, the argument is impossible to describe. He is a monster the entire night, antagonizing my mother because he wants to take another day off of work because he's ""sick"", or that he blames her for him not leaving the house for the last five years.. He doesn't even come to family events anymore. He just lays about popping xans and drinking.

  
But naturally, it's not him, it's her fault.. Somehow he blames it on her. He will command me from a dead sleep at 10:45 at night to go get him chewing tobacco, with not a care for the fact that I have worked overtime the previous day, and that I was tired.

&amp;#x200B;

But instead of defending me, or themselves? The rest of my family does nothing. They yes him to death to shut him up instead of trying to band together to stop him. My sister runs out to those bars, my mother sits on the couch and plays the victim, and I am the only one who tells him ""No.""

  
But I am told I need to apologize time and time again. I am the one who is told I am causing drama.

&amp;#x200B;

I've become so apathetic and depressed. I know I just need to get out.. But I can't at this time. I just lock myself away and shut myself out. I internalize my emotions so I can remain rational and I refuse to drink.

&amp;#x200B;

I need this off of my chest. I need to know if anyone else knows this level of internal struggle. You want to help the ones you love, but you're the only one who is willing to stand up, willing to fight.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's true what they say-- you can't help somebody who doesn't want to be helped."

##Personality
 
**In General**
 
Carefree and simple, though she does still have a certain level of respect for the rules and figures of authority. But she also doesn’t just give respect to anyone, and believes respect is both earned and should be returned. She often lacks a filter, and says what’s on her mind without holding back.
 
Her sense of humor lies on the dark side of things, and she has an appreciation for a good prank, as long as those pranks remain innocent and don’t cause any harm. She can be flirtatious, but most of that is lighthearted and playful, only really stepping up her game when she’s fully interested in someone.
 
**Positive Traits:**
 
* Outgoing
 
* Honest
 
* Carefree
 
**Negative Traits:**
 
* Sometimes too carefree
 
* Often Forgetful
 
* Inappropriate at times
 
**Likes:**
 
She loves people who are like her and have a good sense of humor. She doesn’t, nor has she ever, care about the whole good vs evil agenda of the Wizarding world. Not knowing her own blood purity, she doesn’t really care about that of others. A firm believer in its not the purity of the blood that counts, but the purity of the soul. She just wants to get the most out of life and enjoy it.
 
**Dislikes:**
 
Rudeness she can tolerate. But she doesn’t like those who are quick to judge based of appearance or blood purity. She never has and prefers to get to know someone first before deciding where they fall on the like/dislike spectrum

##Family Background
 
**Immediate Family:**
 
*Father:* Charles Xavier Blackthorne - unknown
 
*Mother:* Stephanie Rose Taylor - unknown
 
**Early Childhood:** 
 
Jackie’s knowledge of her parents extends to a simple photograph of the pair holding a baby girl who she could only assume was her. They died some time after that, though she was never told how they were killed. With no other living relatives, or none that would claim her, Jackie was placed in a muggle orphanage.
 
That went about as well as one can expect of a young witch, who was already socially awkward to begin with. Tack on the weird happenings and being labelled a freak, Jackie spent her childhood in isolation from the other kids within those walls. Those walls that felt like a prison to her, and she longed to be free from them. 
 
That wish would be granted on her eleventh birthday, when a letter came via an owl of all things. The contents went on to explain that she was a witch and was invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Of course she thought this was a cruel plank pulled by the other kids so the letter found its way in the trash without another thought.
 
More letters came and finally she started to believe and got hopeful. So much of her life could be explained if these things were true. So she sought out permission to attend the school. Upon reading it, the muggles in charge thought it was some prank by *her* and scolded her for it.
 
Finally, a member from the Ministry of Magic came with a young wizarding family who were looking to adopt. Not only was she going to be attending a school of magic, but someone actually wanted her. After watching kids come and go for years, it was finally her turn. And she never looked back.
 
**Education:**
 
She’ll never forget that first time she saw the castle. For years she had dreamed of escaping those stone walls of the orphanage, only to return to more stone walls. But these were different and held so much mystery and fueled her curiosity. She wanted to know everything and anything to do with magic, like she had been deprived her entire life and needed to catch up.
 
That want and need for knowledge helped the sorting hat make a seemingly easy decision, placing her in Ravenclaw. She had never considered herself to be clever or smart, and was surprised by this decision. Especially after talking to some of her housemates who seemed leagues ahead of her as to what they already knew about magic.
 
The lonewolf ways of her childhood continued, as she found it difficult to make friends in her early years. Mainly because she didn’t try much, instead devoting herself to her studies, always seeking out extra assignments and help from professors. She quickly fell in love with Charms and Transfiguration, fascinated by everything you could do with a simple piece of enchanted wood.
 
But nothing the school could offer inside the walls would ever be able to compare what she learned outside them, specifically: a broom. She had always dreamed of turning into a bird and flying from her ‘prison’ and now, she learned she would actually be able to fly. And she loved it. By her second year, she had spent so much time on a broom that she was a great enough flyer to earn a spot on the Quidditch team as a Chaser.
 
By the time she reached her fourth year, she was one of the top witches in her class with a wand. Other classes such as Herbology and Potions were a struggle, as they required too much reading and following steps for her. Too many guidelines and how things should be done, and no way to express herself. She had always been a free spirit, and waving her wand gave her that sense of freedom.
 
In her fifth year, her Transfiguration professor realized her potential, having taught her charms and spells way ahead of her time. She was the only fifth year taking N.E.W.T level Transfiguration and learned to cast non-verbal spells earlier than most.
 
**Career:**
 
Jackie had always wanted to travel and see the world, having spent so much of her life confined to walls. But she knew such a thing wouldn’t be possible without a career to pay for such things. And so she applied for an internship with the Ministry of Magic with the Department of International Magical Cooperation.
 
This lead to her earning a full-time position within the Department. Thanks to her new job, she travelled the magical world, visiting various countries and keeping up relationships between ministries. This wouldn’t come without down time, in which she explored the different cultures and experienced all that she could; both magical and muggle.
 
She was bold and carefree, but she started to get careless. Because of this, she had a run-in with a dragon that did not go well for her. She survived, but was badly injured to the point she couldn’t travel for a while. She tried to mend her leg on her own, but it didn’t go so well, leaving her stuck behind a desk within the ministry. She was miserable.
 
When the ministry declined her request to be reinstated to her old position and to travel again, she started looking for other work that would allow her to continue doing what she loved. She had never really considered teaching, but was offered a position at Ilvermorny in America and took the job. She started off teaching Charms, but switched over to Transfiguration after two years. After her fifth year of teaching, she received a letter, asking her to take a job at her old school: Hogwarts.
 
##Introduction
 
*Jacquelyn was fortunate enough to not have moved during her younger years and remained at Hogwarts up until graduation. She had known students who had transferred schools, some during the middle of the year, and now counted herself among them, switching schools over the winter break. Though she had grown up within these walls, it had been over a decade since she had been back, and now needed to get reacquainted, this time as a professor.*
 
*Now, the new Transfiguration Professor sat behind the desk in her classroom, preparing for her next lesson. Piled on her desk were several pieces of parchment, a book, and steaming cup of tea. Jackie had always had an open door policy during her time at Ilvermorny, where if her door was open, students were welcome to come in to ask her questions, and the door stood open on this particular morning.*"
ajrnax,23,2019-01-25,How almost taking TRP almost screwed my mind.,GlobalHawk_MSI,exredpill,https://www.reddit.com/r/exredpill/comments/ajrnax/how_almost_taking_trp_almost_screwed_my_mind/,"**Hello there!** 

Probably my only post to this sub. So I'll make it short. Disclaimer: I was never a RP-er, just a person who almost swallowed the poison. And I say this as a 23 yr old single since birth male.

So I got into depression last October 2018 due to anxiety with the future in general. Long story short I got hallucinations of dying alone and getting life on track so began to look into this TRP thing. 

***Flashback****: I heard it first on May 2018 when I stumble on it due to a research thing I did (that's also how I knew of incels: Toronto attack). Never gave a thought afterwards.*

Going back to October, I began to seek answers by looking at self-help stuff on Reddit. I found TRP again and at first I was appealed to the stuff. Then I began to smell the outward misogyny that it spewed about. Then I began to feel unexplained anger that persisted until the 3rd week of November 2018. **Well.....whaddya know??** A depressed and desperate brain would not act very well. So I gave it a chance and ""was officially on the fence"".

Some good advice are sometime filled with ""women this"" or ""women that"". Sure there are disgusting thots out there but painting all womenfolk by the same brush is rather disturbing. Kinda like glassing an entire planet because someone destroyed your TIE fighter. 

I was also put off by the ""field reports"" as it reminded me of those wacko PUAs. I mean why would you post your private encounters. I mean SEAL Team Six ain't publicizing their top-secret special ops unless it's some very famous HVT. Also I began to smell the hypocrisy. The double standard is strong. Also they are using casual sex tactics to hopefully get a girlfriend. Then I heard of stories of women leaving their red-pilled boyfriends. At that point I was very close to swallowing 75% of the pill. I even went on several ""reconnaissance runs"" on incel spaces like Braincels for some unknown reason while I'm at it. Escaped the blackpill trap as well.

Then I found these sub and relaxed my mind and decided to not join swallow the poison. The misogyny and hypocrisy is simply too strong. 

Afterwards I began to look into dating strategies that are not filled with that crap. I also entered mental health support forums that will keep me on track with my mental state. Though I never dated at all, I did all of that so when my time comes I will be more prepared for what will I do. IMO better face the ordeal that is not be temped by stuff like TRP now than later. 

Because being 23 (at time of writing), it really dawned on me that my work was complete mostly (college degree, project-based job, gaming hobby) and cannot live like a ""neckbeard gamer"" forever. 

The silver lining of all of these is that I not have a new perspective with life and social interaction in general. Trust me, I gave zero fucks about love and sex and relationships during my college years. In fact I blew half my internship budget on a Steelseries gaming mice and an Xbox controller, not to mention my over-focus to my studies, cause Asian. 

What TRP did to me even though I never swallowed it in the first place is that human relationships are meant to be cherished and to be cared and you must care more about your confidence and attitude (pretty much the only good stuff their materials have taught me). My ordeal taught me as well that there is more to life than your 5 hours of PUBG or Rainbow Six Siege. **If not for discovering it then I might have to push through of my dangerous plan to start dating at 30 because priorities!!**

Can you give me some insight/tips?,part_time_goddess,GenderCritical,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/ajs28o/anyone_here_who_works_in_a_male_dominated_field/,"Firstly I'm not an English speaker so sorry for my mistakes...

Also, sorry for the long rant.

I'm currently studying computer science at a university and I work part time at a software development company (it's kind of an internship thing, I go there after classes and I'm registered there as a trainee so it's not exactly a job). I'm 20 years old and most of my co-workers are over 30 extremely conservative men and it's just awful.
I never though I would have problems as a female programmer because I've never experienced a lot of misogyny in my life and most of the teachers in high school (and my current university professors) were very supportive of girls who want to work in STEM fields. 
The problem is not the job itself, because it's interesting and I love it but I feel so alone in the office. My co-workers are the prime example of toxic masculinity and when the gilette ad came out I had to listen to them cry about it for a week. It's just baffling how sexist they are. I mean these people are supposed to be highly educated and intelligent aren't they? Some days ago they discussed it in the office who would they rape if they had the chance to do it and it was just so disturbing because normally they seem like really friendly guys and I talk to them a lot but sometimes when a topic like this comes up it's just... surreal. They also don't take me seriously at all and I kinda understand it because I'm much younger and I'm inexperienced, but my classmate works here too and he's taken seriously and people treat him with more respect. It just crushes my self esteem.

Please tell me I'm just really unlucky with this place and most jobs are not like this. My university classmates are mostly guys but all of them are cool and I'm friends with most of them, they really agree with this feminist GC mindset so it's really promising, but I've never really met/worked with men in their 30s and the difference is so huge. It's really depressing and even though I love computer science now I'm starting to understand why there are so few women in this field. 
But I live in a really conservative eastern european country, maybe that's the problem? Is it better in western countries? I think I'm having a career crisys without actually having a carrer lol.

Please tell me about your experiences."

They could use social media (specifically Twitter) to really get people lathered up:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Have the character tweet something that is irritating, outlandish &amp; most important of all, insulting to a ""privileged"" group (e.g. white men)
2. Hire some interns or something to read all the responses and handle all responses accordingly:

* Roughly 98% of the responses will inoffensively express their disapproval of what she tweeted.  Some will even try to politely convince her she's wrong.  The senders of these types of tweets should be blocked immediately.  
* Around 2% of the responses will come from the wingnuts we all know are out there on Twitter.  You'll have the garden variety rape/death threats &amp; other legitimately offensive/harassing language.  These responses should be screen captured.

3.  Get a rough count of ALL responses to the tweet.  Let's say it's 100k
4.  Have the character tweet again complaining that they're the victim of a harassment campaign.  She should say that she received 100k harrassing tweets including threats &amp; insults.  Have her post the screenshots of the most vile responses being sure to pass them off as the norm.

Silencing people who feel that they are justified and well-meaning while smearing them by painting them all with a broad brush has an enraging effect on people.  This character would have **nuclear** heat before she ever picked up a microphone!"

ajtfr2,21,2019-01-25,Does Shadow of the Tomb Raider portray native american civilizations better than the last pre-reboot games?,Blondbraid,GirlGamers,https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/ajtfr2/does_shadow_of_the_tomb_raider_portray_native/,"I recently played through **Shadow of the Tomb Raider** (and I don't want to put the whole post behind spoiler tags so I'll just throw out a spoiler warning here), and as a longtime fan of the franchise I was massively disappointed at the story.

I never liked the 2013 reboot much, but I think Rise of the Tomb Raider was a step in the right direction, but Shadow of the Tomb Raider feels like a regression in terms of storytelling, not only in terms of the main cutscenes but also in lore and side stories, and the game is just rife with unfortunate tropes, especially in regards to how it portrays the native american cultures.

Firstly, the game makes heavy use of [mayincatec](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec), basically the trope where all big south and central american cultures like Aztecs, Mayans and Inca are presented as an interchangeable blend, and while the game does have Lara remark that the Mayans weren't supposed to be in Peru and it's mentioned that a Mayan group made an exodus to found a city in Incan lands the game doesn't really make any efforts to differentiate the cultures from one another, and having been to both Mexico and Peru myself, I can safely say that Mayan and Incan architecture look nothing alike in reality.

Overall, most of the lore feels like a confused mess, where the devs dedicated [one codex entry](https://tombraider.fandom.com/wiki/Myth,_Magic_%26_Monsters) to a rapist ape monster that has nothing to do with the game (and if they had to include unrelated pieces of folklore, why did they have to pick the most rapey and sexist myth they could find? And having the book with said codex entry placed in the jungle next to the bloody corpse of a man just feels like an incredibly sleazy attempt to falsely psych the player into thinking Lara would be forced to fight an ape trying to sexually assault her in order to scare the player) yet they didn't prioritize coming up with a satisfying explanation as for why Aztecs got involved in a Mayan exodus to Peru or how all three civilizations could so easily blend together to be indistinguishable from each other. Most of the codex entries on native culture are just boring, and feels like they were written by an intern just writing down Wikipedia summaries on ancient mythology, compared to the collectible letters and texts from European explorers and conquistadors, while quite stereotypical depictions of people in a jungle going mad from strife and greed, at least tries to humanize the characters mentioned in the letters rather than just listing facts.

Then it's the depiction of the native civilization itself, and Lara's interactions with the natives. I can't help but feel that the game unintentionally comes off as a depiction of the [white savior trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey), since not only does Lara become the right-hand woman of the queen of the city within minutes of arriving, she also has to rescue both the queen and her son during the main campaign and spend all side missions helping natives solve all kinds of problems that they cannot solve themselves, but after the queen gets killed, Lara has to replace her in order to do a sacred ritual meant to save their city, and despite the queen says that she's had to train all her life in order to complete said ritual, Lara, whom have had no training or preparation, completes the ritual effortlessly. And while the previous game, Rise of the Tomb Raider too featured people still living by the lost city she explores, at least the Russian tribe from that game had already learned to use guns and repurpose old soviet technology for their own needs, and their leader was shown to be competent and helped Lara just as much as he helped her, and while it's left ambiguous as to what language they are speaking, it's implied that Lara knows Russian and the game is in English just for the audience benefit. Meanwhile Shadow explicitly includes a bizarre backstory on how the evil Trinity organization secretly infiltrated the Mayan city just in order to secretly make everybody learn english, which is especially weird considering we still see Lara read native texts and inscriptions, so she should have been able to communicate with them without needing to explain it with a weird backstory, and the ""native language"" option just makes Lara look accidentally arrogant by making every npc speak their native language while Lara still addresses them in English.

It's made all the worse by the fact that during her stay among the natives, Lara is restricted from ever using her guns and is only allowed to use her bow. The problem with this is that a huge reason the real-life conquistadors were able to overtake most civilizations so easily was because they had superior weaponry and equipment, not because the people themselves were inherently stronger or better. Meanwhile Lara Croft kills several dozens of native warriors (whom have presumably trained to use bows since childhood) using only a bow.

And speaking of villains, the villain, [Dr.Dominguez/Amaru](https://tombraider.fandom.com/wiki/Pedro_Dominguez), wounds up being right about most things, because he is a native of the hidden city himself and it's revealed that he only killed Lara's father because he was threatening to expose the entire city to the world and possibly doom them to subjugation and exploitation by the modern world, and Dr. Dominguez big plan was to use magic to change the world in order to ensure that his home city could remain hidden in the future. This all feels like very sympathetic motives, yet apart from a few cutscenes in the beginning, the game ignores this and just treats him as a one-dimensional villain.

Now, many of the reviews, [like this one](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/9/10/17838346/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc), claim that Shadow of the Tomb Raider is meant to adress the colonialist undertones of the earlier games in the franchise, but if that's the case they have failed in my eyes since not only is the tomb robbing and killing of endangered animals still in the game, but Shadow of the Tomb Raider adds a bunch of problematic stuff that was never part of the previous games, most notably, instead of merely raiding empty tombs from long abandoned ruins, she walks around a still inhabited city and picks up resources and collectibles from right under the inhabitants faces, and they are straight up grateful for her coming to them and raiding their tombs.

For comparison, Tomb Raider: Underworld, the last tr game released before the 2013 reboot, also featured Mayan ruins, yet it felt far less problematic than Shadow to me. To make a short list of comparisons between the two:

**Tomb Raider: Underworld:**

- Lara explores abandoned ruins far away from any local populace

- the ruins are clearly Mayan and centered on mayan mythology

- the only people she fights are poachers

- she only fights the panthers in the ruins, which were driven there by the poachers,  in self-defence

**Shadow of the Tomb Raider:**

- Lara explore some ruins, but also a city still inhabited and robs houses while the inhabitants watches without being called out on it

- The ruins and city is a hodge-podge of multiple native american civilizations thrown together

- while she fights mercenaries too, most of her enemies are native american guards and soldiers

- she hunts not only jaguars but also defenseless herbivores for the explicit reason of sewing clothes from their skins

Personally, my opinion is that while the earlier games weren't without problems, at least they were in the realm of fantasy and [the last games before the reboot](https://tombraider.fandom.com/wiki/Legend_Timeline) at least tried to showcase Lara being respectful to other cultures than her own (and she also raids places in her native England too) whilst also accepting that grave robbing is morally ambiguous at best, similar to Nathan Drake from Uncharted or Indiana Jones.

Meanwhile, the 2013 reboot games and Shadow of the Tomb Raider especially, suffers a lot under this notion that a female heroine cannot just be a hero with flaws and moral ambiguity just like any male hero, but she instead has to be a *""good role model for young girls""*, even if it robs her of her agency by denying her the ability to make openly selfish decisions or enjoying herself, even if she's only doing it as part of a character arc about overcoming her flaws, and that's why the reboot feels like such a mess in terms of Lara's character.

In the old games, she was a thief and even started out working for the villains several times, but still ready to save the world once she realized that the villains would use the artifacts she found for destroying the world and making witty quips in the process.

Meanwhile, new Lara is repeatedly forced to do what she does, often by the villains literally holding her friends hostage, and she has to constantly question and doubt herself despite either being forced by circumstances or genuinely not knowing the potential risks of what she did beforehand, and she openly cries and blubbers on camera to really drive the point home that she isn't a bad person because she feels guilty about doing  the things she does in order to save the world and/or her friends.

Considering this approach, I'm not surprised that the developers solution to remove the bad moral implications of robbing the dead was ""let's have the decendants of the tomb builders be still around and give Lara permission to rob their dead ancestors!"" and their solution to the colonialist undertones was having Lara constantly rescue natives and solve their problems for them, because that fit's with the idea of a ""good role model"" who doesn't break the law and helps everyone, but not with the idea of an adventurer who fights enemies and steals things for a living that the entire franchise is built around.

Also, while I will give the reboot credit for making Lara more realistic and toning down the male gaze, Shadow of the Tomb Raider undercuts this by featuring [this character](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6mCRvr4Fgl0/maxresdefault.jpg), who is the only woman in a group of mutilated gollum-like people living in caves, but while her face is mutilated she still has a perfect body and skimpy bikini.

ajtv6f,1,2019-01-25,A question about community college and CPA requirements,pikachiu24,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ajtv6f/a_question_about_community_college_and_cpa/,"To summarize my situation: In my state, I need 150 credit hours to get licensed (along with 1 year work experience and passing the exam). Right now I have 143 credits at my school and I have 2 classes for 3 credits each and 1 credit from an internship I am currently doing. One of the classes is Business Law II. However, my teacher for that class has canceled both the first and second class of this semester. Considering my long commute and the short notice for the cancellation, along with other things like him not even posting the syllabus yet and refusing to give out any contact info, i’ve grown frustrated with him and thinking about dropping the course.

Now before I was in a 4 year university, I was a general business major at a community college and I HAD taken and passed Business Law II over there. During my transfer, my 4 year university says it can not accept Business Law II from a 2 year college. So my question is, even though my university didn’t accept the credit, will my Business Law II from community college still count to my 150 credit for the CPA?"
ajuacb,2,2019-01-25,My temper cost me my job,hcky243,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ajuacb/my_temper_cost_me_my_job/,"So I just lost my temper and it cost me an internship… heres the story

I work from home for an internship and I do a ton of digital design, website building, and social media. I also study in graduate school.

Two weeks ago, my boss and I met where he outlined his ideal commitment of 20 hours a week with two weekly meetings. I built my schedule around this commitment. Now I know I do not make much money with an internship but in this case I make just enough to cover the electricity and cell phone bill while my parents help me with rent during my studies.

On Monday I got a call from my boss and he said “no hours this week and the internship is possibly ending because the other partners do not want it…I will call you back later this week and let you know.” He then ended the call.

I was very stunned and shocked because I had built my schedule around this and was using this internship to pay some bills.

I reached out to the other intern to see if she had heard anything but she ignored me ( she has read receipts on her phone).

I tried reaching out on Wednesday and Thursday to speak to my boss about whether the internship would continue but he continued to ignore me and my emails ( I sent one on Monday night saying “just let me know when or if you are free this week to discuss whether the opportunity will continue “.  I know he might have been busy and that this was annoying but I just wanted to set up a later meeting or phone call time to discuss whether it was ending or not and to start looking for another job and change my course schedule if that was the case. He ignored my emails (I have a service that shows when people read my emails) and I lost my temper.

I sent him a text on Thursday asking if he could speak that night to discuss the internship and he texted me saying “Ill call you tonight to discuss it”. I waited for him to call but never heard back. I figured that I would do some linkedin marketing work since I had been in the process of optimizing the site’s linkedin SEO and tried to log in but noticed that the password was changed.

Today I discovered that the internship program did not end and that my boss was keeping the intern who had been ignoring me on but letting the rest of us go. I did not find out from my boss or the other intern but I noticed it when I went onto our CRM and the other intern was communicating with my boss ( who was at the time ignoring me). THIS IS WHERE I FUCKED UP.

I lost my temper and sent my boss an email explaining that I was grateful for the opportunity and that while I knew that I was not entitled to any internship or job that I had built a schedule off of what he had said two weeks ago so I was frustrated. I also inquired about why he had told me false information about the internship program ended and explained that it came across as personal (with him telling me something, the intern ignoring me, and then not hearing anything) WHICH I ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE. I also said that it was not professional to ignore my emails and texts all week and that I would have appreciated some form of communication. I ended by saying that I respect his decision to end the internship but that I wish it had been communicated more clearly and professionally and thanked him for the opportunity. I also offered to send over any notes that he might need.

I then got an almost immediate text saying “Taking your emails into account- you are fired.” I clearly should not have lost my temper and sent that stupid email but I felt so helpless. How should I have handled that situation better? I know I screwed up. "
ajuzuk,2,2019-01-25,Why do I keep fucking up,Wsoler2,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ajuzuk/why_do_i_keep_fucking_up/,"I don’t understand why I keep fucking up. I know I suffer from anxiety/ OCD, but I think a lot of the anxiety stems from actual serious issues in my life that occur because of my own actions. First off, I graduated from a masters program and am in a ton of debt. I decided to go for the masters because I couldn’t get a job with a psychology bachelors degree. Upon graduating from the masters, my internship was unable to offer me a full-time position. I then I got fired from said internship. I finally landed another job a few months later after running up a ton of credit card debt (to pay off basic living expenses). I worked there for less than three months and managed to get fired from that job (their excuse was that I wasn’t “engaged” enough). I then had to move back home with my dad. During this time, I managed to get in 3 card accidents (2 of which were my fault), plus several speeding tickets because of all the traveling I had to do to get back home. Not to mention, I have an old car that’s at 200,000 miles and needs a lot of repairs done with money I don’t have. Luckily, I got a job that pays 10% of what I used to make just to sustain myself, but it’s not enough to get me out of this hell hole of debt. One of my bosses treats me like a little kid, which I don’t understand why because I feel like Im one of the most educated and hard working people there. Luckily, the main owner likes me, so I at least have a sense of job security. I can be a little socially awkward, but I don’t understand why that has to be held against me if im generally a nice, hardworking person. I had to sign up for a loan forgiveness plan in which I only owe $0 a month, but the interest on the loan is adding up. I won’t be able to take out any other loans if I don’t pay it off because my credit will be really bad (such as a loan for a new car). I don’t know what to do and how to get myself out of this situation. The only good thing that has come out of this situation is that I have an emotionally supportive boyfriend, and I may land a new job, although it’s still grossly underpaid to the point where I won’t be able to pay off all my bills each month. I don’t understand how all of my other friends are living on their own and sustaining themselves. I’m terrified that I will get fired from this new job in the case that they extend me an offer. To be honest, I don’t really understand what I do to fuck up every job I have (I’ve been fired 3 times in a row recently), because I truly feel like I’m smart/ a hard worker. Many times, I end up as the team scapegoat at my jobs. If there’s any advice anyone can give me, it will be super appreciated. "
ajv2wq,2,2019-01-25,Warlock Tiefling Backstory,Brazzelon,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ajv2wq/warlock_tiefling_backstory/," 

The words didn’t always dance. There was a time when only the text laid still as water in a windless pond. Always reading the same, forwards and backward. Always the same as intended by its original authors. A clear message chiseled into eternal being bound by two covers and a spine. Too often people take the stillness of books for granted, too often do we lay in the comfort of the veil of perpetuity of those same words on the page.

I would read books all the time, as many books as I could get my hands on. Although, my hands would look all the same to a distracted passer-by. It was my horns that more often than not kept me from making the first impression. So I read... at night as it was the only time nobody would bother me while reading. Nobody liked a Tiefling reading any sort of book, they’d always assume the worst, and back then they would have been wrong. The more books I read though, the more I realized that in order to truly and irrefutably say that I understood the message in the book, I would have to learn more about the references within each book. Each world shrouded in a mystery greater than the last. The list of things unknown grew with every ending. There was something missing. A better method of study? A way to read more books... Arcana had nothing to offer, children playing with simple toys at the whims of a few complicated if useful magic. There needed to be a more efficient way to gather knowledge. My ambition became the ink which sealed my fate. I became fixated on finding the most successful secret keepers. I went down every rabbit hole I could find which spoke of the greatest keepers of any knowledge. Stories of archaic ruins, scrolls left behind with whispers of long dead-peoples. Reverence of old abnormal entities predating Gods. Years of piecing together old written records, articles, publications, stories told in different tongues, runes, and even hieroglyphics, all seemed of relevance, but impossible to put together. Not by natural means, at least. 

One night, I broke into the local library to see if there were any books I hadn't read, when I came across a book on Thoth, Deity of wisdom, knowledge, writing, and magic. The book seemed peculiar, some of the glyphs on its ornate cover appeared to move in the night light, though I’ve seen better optical illusions. I started to read the text, and it drew me into the text deeply when suddenly I noticed the word “Thoth” began to wiggle free from its eternal holding place on the paper. It slowly pushed its way through the other letters who all began to float independently of each other. It made its way upwards along with a rogue Y and a G. A couple of O’s strutted along with willful purpose leaving the rest of the words, which once lay in an unchanging linear order, to wander the page freely. The words appeared in a cluster of stumbling and confused letters. The words had become alive, like ants at the first drop of rain, scattering, finding their place in the chaos. Yog-Sothoth read atop the pages, lighting up in a golden hue as my gaze grazed the page. Trying to find words in the confusion, I fixated on the next piece of text that I could read. I looked to where the text would naturally fall on the page and the chaos calmed into a legible message, the book started speaking to me, or rather, writing to me. The words appeared and all I had to do was read. What was more amazing is that I could respond in real time to what I was reading, and what it wanted me to know. Communication was seamless and I could answer its inquiries as easily as I could read the fleeting messages. My responses sprung from my head onto the book with my exact and true answer. I had a feeling It knew my life better than I could ever hope to recall. It knew what I was after. How could it? I thought. It knew of my skepticism. Reluctant to read on, I turned my eyes elsewhere, but to no avail, as the only available light was coming from the text itself, that dim purple glow behind the pages illuminated the only thing that needed my attention, everything else shrouded in inexplicable magic darkness. 

The dancing letters then began to spell out accounts of knowledge seekers, whose purpose was to gather all forms of knowledge, from ancient tomes, rituals from all domains of magic, to secret ancient time-forgotten tales. These Warlocks were part of endless many in servitude of Yog-Sothoth, a cosmic entity designated as an Outer God, yet is locked outside of this universe. Those in service of him are imbued with great abilities, as Yog acts through his disciples in displays of unfathomable power. Tales of true keepers of ancient secrets swept across the pages, all lighting up, words change and a sudden flash of a time-forgotten text depicting a horrific fate beyond time, words fade once again and scribbles of demonic invocations appear on the text, I recognize the magic, the book begins to glow brighter as other spells fly out of the pages, the words flashing faster than my eyes could read, yet as the letters form and began to glow in golden eldritch light, I knew what was written maybe even as much as the book knew what I was thinking. It probed my mind for my deepest desires, my thirst for knowledge. My fear that there was too much to know. My terror of the depth beyond my Tiefling expiration date, and my understanding that I could not even hope to know all of the stories that had been blessed with being written down. It proposed a solution to my grief. Yog would imbue me with the abilities it deemed would greatest aid me in my eldritch task, a task which is unfathomable by nature but involved coming to the aid of Yog-Sathoth, in his locked-out-of-universe status and seek, gather and secure knowledge of all kinds for his eternal records\[\[being all knowing means a bunch of eldritch interns\]\]. “I accept.” The Red letters formed as my thoughts were thrust onto the page. The light vanished in the blink of an eye, I was back at the library, couldn’t recall which one, they all started to look the same, then, I noticed, the letters were still dancing. A chaos of scattering letters awaiting the next message from the great beyond. "

###Welcome Home, and In With the New

---
---

*Knock Knock Knock*

&gt; ""Come in!""

The door slowly opened, and the guards on each side of the door stood to attention. She waved them off with a white glove.

&gt; ""Come, Come! Don't just stand there, take a seat.""

---

&gt; ""Oh, sorry where you busy?""

---

&gt; ""No, not too terribly busy, I have company but I am sure they won't mind.""

President Xi's daughter from the opposite side of the desk turned to see who was at the door.

&gt; ""Captain Fan-big sister- is back!""

She stood up from her desk and ran over to her and gave her a hug.

&gt; ""Yes, haha, I'm back.""

---

&gt; ""Look at you, so strong! You're not a small flower any more!""

---

&gt; ""Stop, stop, of course I'm back. Where else would I be?""

The two walked over to the chairs opposite of President Xi's desk. The man still sitting across from President Xi looked over to address Captain Fan.

&gt; ""Good work, comrade sister.""

Walking over to the chairs, Fan Bing Bing whispered into Xi Mingze's ear.

&gt; ""Who is this young, strong, handsome man?""

---

&gt; ""You don't know? It *has* been a while. This is the handsome young gentleman- Ping Wen. He's a rising star. Very handsome!""

---

&gt; ""Is he single?""

---

&gt; ""I don't know! Why don't you meet him? I'm sure he is keen to our beautiful flower of war...""

---

&gt; ""Stop! You are so awkward! Come, let's go take a seat.""

The two of them sit down. President Xi nods off their whispering chatter- unsure of what that was all about. He chuckles a little.

&gt; ""Comrade Fan, welcome back... I'm not sure if you have met my guest. This is Ping Wen, he is a very promising and up and coming member in the Communist Party. Comrade Ping, this is Captain Fan Bing Bing, of the 3rd Fighter Squadron- I'm sure you have seen her on TV at some point.""

Ping Wen nods slightly.

&gt; ""Yes, I am aware of the esteemed Captain Fan's work.""

President Xi chuckles and slaps the desk.

&gt; ""An F-35! Hot dog! Good work Captain Fan!""

She turns slightly red in the face, and waves her hand in front of it.

&gt; ""Just following General Hua's order, President Xi.""

---

&gt; ""Regardless, I've called you here today for your promotion.""

---

&gt; ""Promotion, to Major General of the Chinese People's Air Force... it has already been done. You have proven yourself as a capable aviator that understands combat and planning- something we are in desperate need of.""

President Xi pushes the over the velvet box to Fan Bing Bing.

&gt; ""Congratulations, Major General, you have earned it. You have proven an invaluable resource to our country, in service to our people.""

She opens the box slowly. Two epaulets with a golden star, and three medals side-by-side. The Medal of Heroic Exemplar, Order of August the First, and the Meritorious Service Medal.

&gt; ""You have been awarded these three medals on recommendation of General Hua Ling Tan, for your heroic service, and dedication in combat. Congratulations again, on your promotion, and on your awards.""

President Xi's daughter jumps up and begins pinning on the medals and replacing the epaulets while they continue.

&gt; ""We have arranged for you to attend the PLA National Defense University after assuming your new title. You can pick a specialization and continue your service as Vice Minister of Defense to General Hua Ling Tan. Now our two most senior military officials are qualified women, both having served in combat. Good. Now back to Mr. Ping, sorry for leaving you all in the dark..""

&gt; ""It is quite alright, President Xi- duty calls, and military being the most respectful..""

Ping Wen glances over at Major General Fan, and back to President Xi.

&gt; ""Alright.. While you were off fighting a war, Comrade Ping finished up his PhD in Political Economy and Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, my alma mater by the way. Excellent choice. He helped me get the Building Blocks Plan and the One Family Our China Policy drafted as an intern during his studies. A young buck, 31 years old- very impressive Comrade Ping, not many your age have achieved this level of prestige... I am naming you as State Councillor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and after your successful investigation- you will be named as the Minister of Taiwan when that whole thing gets taken care of. Congratulations, you hold the most council positions, and the most important ones... We were a little concerned with your negative tendencies towards Taiwan... but I think you understand that welfare comes before our prejudices in the early 2000s... Nonetheless, congratulations.""

---

&gt; ""I humbly accept this opportunity... but I must ask, what happened to Wang Yi... he has been running Foreign Affairs for almost 20 years? Surely he...""

President Xi waves his concerns aside. 

&gt; ""That has all been taken care of already for a brighter future. His ideas were not necessarily in line with our own, let's say."" 

President Xi drifts off in thought.

###Out With the Old

---
---

&gt; ""Unhand me! This is absolutely preposterous! I served President Xi loyally as Minister of Foreign Affairs for over 20 years!""

---

&gt; ""Clam it, you traitor!""

One of the guards hits the former Foreign Minister Wang Yi in the back with his assault rifle. Wang Yi, in handcuffs, gasps for air and falls to his knees- handcuffed and unable to resist. Two guards pick him up by the shoulders and drag him as he begins pleading for mercy. They drop him, into a pool of mud in-front of ten armed agents of the Ministry of State Security.

&gt; ""Get on your knees, corrupt fool!""

With assistance he is brought up to his knees, his suit covered in blood, mud, and dirt. A terrible resemblance of the former man.

&gt; ""Take off his blindfold!""

As his blindfold is removed, he cannot see clearly as the power of the sun over takes him. He slowly readjusts to the light, and sees the agents in-front of him. He hears a little bit of crying next to him, but stays focused on the guards as he adjusts to the light. He sees a figure in a grey trench-coat and suit emerge from behind the dark green line of winter trench-coats. Slowly merging the suit and grey coat into the same person, as he can begin to see the figure more clearly. The figure starts moving closer to him, and it all becomes clear.

&gt; ""President Xi! You've betrayed me! All my work! You have betrayed this country! After all we have done together! We went to a party barbecue together!""

As President Xi stops in-front of him, he pulls out a red packet of cigarettes from his trench-coat pocket, taking one out- then lighting it.

&gt; ""Harbin winters are a little cold, aren't they, Mr. Wang.""

President Xi puffs on the cigarette, and breathes out, and sighs.

&gt; ""It is a shame you disgraced us... Don't worry, it won't be too cold for long- unfortunately we will not be taking you to see the Harbin Winter Lights this year, but we will bring you closer to another one...""

---

&gt; ""Wang, do you have anything to say for your actions?""

---

&gt; ""I've done nothing wrong! Let me go at once, and I will forgive you.""

---

&gt; ""So that's the way it is going to be...""

President Xi turns and begins walking towards the three other figures just a few paces away. Holding his cigarette above his right shoulder as he moves towards the other figures. President Xi repeats himself.

&gt; ""So that's the way it is going to be...""

President Xi stops in-front of the shivering, and sniveling small group of figures, that immediately become recognizable to Wang Yi. President Xi bends over and picks up a small folder with his left hand and shakes the mud off, away from his coat.  He takes another puff on his cigarette and walks back over to Wang Yi.

&gt; ""My wife? Shen-jue! My daughters? Qian Qian, Xiao Yu! President Xi what is the meaning of this! They have nothing to do with me, let them go!!""

Wang Yi begins to cry, and shouts out their names.

&gt; ""Qian Qian! Xiao Yu! Shen-jue!""

He wails as tears stream down his face. 

&gt; ""Don't cry! We will all be ok! I'm right here!""

President Xi stops in front of Wang Yi, and drops the open folder in-front of the Foreign Minister. Wang Yi looks down, as President Xi leans down to see his face more clearly. What Wang Yi sees, to his shame, is a series of well-taken photos. Depicting him at a party, looks like KTV, with several topless women- the next picture, depicting graphic and unconventional intercourse.

&gt; ""That doesn't look like your wife, Mr. Wang... Oh look, these girls don't either...""

Wang Yi, still crying, remains silent.

&gt; ""You know the charges and sentences for these crimes... a few years in prison... but using your party expense account on crimes... Tsk-Tsk. You got sloppy, old friend.""

---

&gt; ""Don't you call me that! You coward! I'm not your friend anymore.""

---

&gt; ""Hm... Well that will make this all the more easier...""

President Xi pats him on the shoulder and blows out cigarette smoke in his face. President Xi drops the cigarette in the mud, next to the folder.  He then stands up and walks back beside the agents. President Xi takes off his fedora and waves it towards the family. Wang Yi calls out..

&gt; ""No! President Xi, please! I'll do anything!""

Wang Yi's children look over to their father.

&gt; ""Ba! I don't wanna die! I'm cold and hungry! I wanna go home!""

The guards raise their rifles, and fire into his family, his children and wife.

&gt; ""Nooo!!!!""

He cries out as he watches them get ripped to shreads by the assault rifles. The rounds rip through the mother and children as their bodies fall apart into a bloody pile of limbs, and clothing. Erased.

President Xi waved his hat over towards Wang Yi. The agents shift their aim, and fire.

Silence.

##Bringing it back

---
---

&gt; ""Anyways, Mr. Ping- that has been taken care of, thank you for outlining crimes within the party. We must be more vigilant in the future.""

---

&gt; ""Of course, President Xi.""

---

&gt; ""You know, I have a wonderful idea! Let's all go get some dinner- how about that. I want some dumplings.""

President Xi's daughter chimes in.

&gt; ""Oh, yes please! That sounds wonderful!""

---

&gt; ""Carried u-nanimously! Let's go!""

Ping Wen stands up and moves towards the door, as Xi and his daughter stand up. Major General Fan also moves towards the door. Both of them reach towards the door, and Fan gets to the handle just a little early as Ping Wen grabs her hand.

&gt; ""Oh!""

A little surprised, she exclaims. Ping retracts his hand, a little embarrassed. Fan Bing Bing turns scarlet red, and retracts her hand. Ping reaches back for the door handle and opens the door.

&gt; ""Sorry... Comrade... ladies first.""

Fan Bing Bing exits the doorway, with Xi Mingze, then turns around to see her face.

Xi Mingze winks to her, and Fan Bing Bing raises her eyebrows and smiles. President Xi, now coming through the doorway, puts his hat on-

&gt; ""I'll see you at the car, I'll be with Comrade Ping for a moment.""

Xi Mingze skips down the hallway and whistles. Fan Bing Bing walks behind her and says

&gt; ""What has gotten into you, I'm barely older than you are and you don't see me skipping. You're 35!""

---

&gt; ""I've been drinking!""

---

&gt; ""Oh boy, this is gonna be some dinner- that's for sure...""

ajw1gk,6,2019-01-25,I'm[27 M] having money issues with my girlfriend [24F]. She doesn't seem to be willing to even try to fix the problem.,Infectd-Z0mbie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ajw1gk/im27_m_having_money_issues_with_my_girlfriend_24f/,"sorry for bad grammar I'm really pissed off.

This pretty much started since last May-June. My girlfriend is very family oriented, however, I come from a very shit family so it's never been something I really cared about (parents divorced, a middle child...all that fun stuff). I work full time and pay for my own school expenses and personal bills I still live at home so I don't spend massive amounts of money on rent.

Anyway, I was buying my mom a mothers day gift strictly because it was a formality because she's letting live a home almost rent free. My girlfriend said I should get her mother a gift too and her older sister as well because she's also a mother now and moved back into their house so it would be awkward if I didn't. I barely know them at that point we've been dating for 2-3 months and met her sister a couple of times. 2 weeks after mother's day was her Birthday and a week after that was my own mother's birthday and her mother's as well(they share the same birthday). So that's 6 gifts I had to buy plus all the expenses that came with her own Birthday such dinner, drinks, clubbing...etc. I've always paid for the both of us whenever we did anything. Even during the summer which she completely took over any and all free time I had. Every single event/idea I had for something I wanted to do she vetoed it cause she already had plans to go camping with her for her best friends birthday or whatever. 

I had to go camping 3 times that summer I've never gone once in my entire life because I personally don't see the appeal of spending my money and time off in the woods sleeping on the dirt in a tent dealing with bugs and having to shit in a hole. Anyway because of that I had extra expenses buying the stuff necessary for that. One time I ended up paying for a trip in which her other two friends bailed on us, so there were fewer people to split the costs with. 

Fast forward to the fall months, she was in her final months of school and had to do her final placement for her nursing program which was unpaid so her actual work hours went down to 10-18 max which basically just covered her bills and nothing else. Once again I covered. This entire time she's never once offered to pay for anything. The one and only time she paid for me was for my Birthday in December and then she just complained the whole month about how no one would be getting gifts cause has no money and can't physically do the work hours because of her placement. 

Well her placement finished mid-December and since then has been getting full-time hours at work and literally, all she does is complain about it. She recently paid to write her licensing exam and would complain that she doesn't have enough time to study and would constantly try to give her shifts away when A) she has a couple months to study for it and B) she gets 2 days off a week plus it's not like she's working 12 hour days. It's a retail job right after the Christmas season meaning nobody is out wanting to spend a ton of money so it's not like she's overwhelmed by customers. I confronted her about her giving away her shifts and always complaining about not having money and her response was I care more about my future career than now. Where I'm the one basically paying for everything. 

I had to borrow $1600 to pay for my tuition a couple weeks for this semester because I wasn't able to save up enough, in time. It felt like such a slap to the face. I honestly feel like yelling at her. I feel like I'm in such a one-sided relationship. She often said that I'm so good at giving gifts because their so thoughtful and she never knows what to buy when in reality I think she doesn't want to spend much on me and as a result, it's harder to find something I'd like. Honestly just saying you'll pay for a movie date every now and again means and helps so much more than buying me something expensive.

TL;DR- I feel like I'm in a one-sided relationship where my girlfriend expects me to pay for her all the time because she's broke due to an unpaid internship, but now that she's done and in a position to earn money and actually pay for stuff she's unwilling to work for it and just complains about it.

Hey all,

Trying to get some advice about my current financial situation, hopefully somebody on this thread has gone through a similar issue.

Graduating med school in May 2019, 5-year surgery residency starts in July with an average starting salary of $60,000 my first year. My loans at graduation will be in the ballpark of $250,000 as my tuition and living expenses have been completely on loans for the entirety of med school. I plan to pursue IBR as most residents do.

I took the spare months of MS4 to get married last year, with my wife who had a total income of around $47,000 last year. 

My first question is should I file taxes this year as Married Filing Jointly? Based TurboTax calculator with my wife’s W2 and plugging in all the numbers, we have an estimated tax return of $5400 as a MFJ with me making $0 and her making $47,000. In this situation, I believe I would have declared an income which will start my IBR payments (calculated to be around $300 per month my first year, after 6 months of deferment).

If we file Married Filing Separately, her tax return on $47k is about $1500. I will not get anything with a declared income of $0. However, I will get the advantage of $0 IBR payments for the remaining 6 months of my intern year, after deferment. Yes, I am shooting for PSLF.

Another thing is, we are struggling financially while I’m in med school – we have a decent amount of CC debt combined ($10k) from me applying for med school initially and keeping up with CoL while in an expensive city for school. Basically, after rent and food is gone from my loans (I get $1000 a month), I’m left with less than $100 extra per month. She has a little better budget, but she is trying to pay down her own student loans from undergrad.

It would be nice to take that large tax return and throw it all to credit card. But then I have to declare income and start paying IBR payments around $300, but that is fairly manageable on a resident’s salary (Post-tax income of $4000+).

Anybody on here in a similar situation as a MS4 preparing for residency? What would you do/did you do?

THANK YOU!"

I intend to major in BME but might switch to computer engineering. How are the internship and research opportunities? Are there many big name/reputable companies that recruit at career fairs and such? How does the engineering program compare to VT and other engineering programs? Thanks!
ajx4ir,51,2019-01-25,"An angel, a Pitbull, and A Beard",puffer_fluff,talesofneckbeards,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesofneckbeards/comments/ajx4ir/an_angel_a_pitbull_and_a_beard/,"This is the tale of my series of beardy encounters. The first time I met a truly awful beard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Characters: 

me: I'm a college student training to be a physical therapist. I'm 21, a little over average height, and have short dark auburn hair. I have blessing and curse of having an hourglass figure similar to those that frequently appear in fantasy games. I'm known as quirky by most people and I'm highly protective and affectionate with people I care about. (For this reason, my pitbull, ""Buster"" is the perfect dog for me. He will be relevant later.) My fatal flaw is that I tend to be nonjudgemental and want to always believe in the good of people.

my best friend: ""Puff"" A sweet little thing about a half inch under 5'. She has long blond hair and rosy chubby cheeks. She's 21 also but frequently is mistaken for a high schooler or sometimes even younger. She loves bunnies and all things cute, but she can get fiery if she's truly angry. 

My boyfriend ""Cinder"": He is basically exactly what you'd expect a computer science major to look like: tall, very pale, and willowy with shaggy hair and thick glasses because of his vision just that bad. (However, his thick dark wavy hair, striking eyes, and surprisingly powerful shoulders have always been extremely attractive to me.) He is a great listener and very compassionate in character. His fatal flaw is that he is not very observant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our story starts a little bit after midnight in our small college town. Both Cinder and I work part-time along with our classes so we were often forced to do any errands we needed to pretty late at night. Luckily, there was a 24-hour grocery store nearby. We went together that night. We were in the produce aisle when I smelled something ungodly awful.

 I work with cadavers pretty regularly in my classes and have had an internship at an inpatient rehab where a colostomy bag burst...but this...this was somehow worse than either. Something had to be rotting. I tried to be helpful, spotted a store associate, and walked up to tell them. I must have also been getting closer to the rotten food too because the smell was getting worse. ""Excuse me?"" I said. 

The great hulking mass of a man spun around and when I saw the state of him, I realized the smell WAS him. His face was adorned with a long scraggly beard that was spotted with sores that looked like painful ingrown hairs. His face shown with sweat, which made his greasy shoulder-length hair cling to it. His armpits showed even more sweat. He was massive in all ways imaginable. He must have been 6'3 at the shortest and his shoulders were twice as wide as mine (and I'm no tiny thing). His bulging stomach and fat rolls must have made it impossible for him to see his own feet. His shirt was dotted with a few stains that looked like they may have been mustard. His beard parted into what I'm sure he thought was a charming smile, but chilled me to the bone. His surprisingly small beady eyes zeroed in on me. 

I'm not the type of person who could just tell him he smelled...""Uhm, I can't find the spinach."" I murmured instead. 

""Oh"" he said in a voice much higher than I expected for his size. ""But you look too good to be on diet food like that."" He then licked his lips...I tried to convince myself it was my imagination. His lips must have just been dry.

""No, I like spinach, actually!"" I squeaked. He pointed off in the general direction and I quickly scurried back to Cinder, who seemed to have not noticed much of the confrontation. I grabbed his hand and pulled him along with me while I grabbed some spinach. Cinder leaned in close. 

""You sure you want to get food here?"" He whispered. ""Something smells really foul."" 

""It's that huge guy over there."" I hissed. (This was pretty obvious who I meant because the store was very empty.) 

Cinder turned quickly and looked. ""Why is he glaring at me?"" 

""I don't know...""

The rest of the shopping trip went without incident, though he looked at the two of us a little too long at times when he passed by. 

\*\*\*

Shopping trip 2: 

This was completely normal shopping trip up until the end. Right before we went to check out, I realized I had grabbed the wrong treats for my pitbull, Buster. I asked Cinder to hold onto our things and I went back to the pet aisle to replace them. Buster's normal treats were out of stock, so I had to find something else. He has allergies to both corn and soy, so I had to bend down and read the ingredients on each package. 

Then I smelled something looming behind me. ""How cruel."" The Beard mused. ""He made you walk back all this way. He should treat you better."" 

I was flabbergasted at his attitude. I was a total stranger to him and he was questioning my taste in my life partner. ""He treats me well, thank you,"" I said curtly. ""This is for my dog, not his."" 

""Well, he should be spoiling you. You shouldn't have to do any extra work. I would spoil you like that if I had you. I look better than him anyway."" 

I stormed off without a word. I also threw up in my mouth a little at his suggestion. Cinder wasn't ultra handsome by conventional standards but he was by bare minimum cute. I was shocked that greasy ogre had that level of confidence. 

I rejoined Cinder and left as fast as possible. I had to talk him down from exploding about it when I told him when we got back. 

\*\*\*

Shopping trip 3: 

This time, I made a mistake. I went alone to the store. But it was early morning by now. I had thought the Beard's shift would be over. I was going to take a hike with Buster that morning but was going to pick up some snacks before we went. He was waiting in the car while I was in the grocery store. 

The only worker I saw by the time I checked out was a sweet old lady who I had a pleasant conversation with. I went out with my bags and saw the Beard returning carts to the train of them outside. I hustled to my car as fast as I could. 

""What a beautiful sight first thing in the morning!"" He called after me. He started following me closely with an impressively fast stride for his weight. I didn't dare turn around and was too afraid to speak. I unlocked my car remotely when I was a few feet away and next thing I knew his hand was opening my car door as if he was trying to be gentlemanly. I was shaking like a leaf. 

Buster leapt out. He's a sweet dog who had never disliked anyone he met...until now. I don't know if it was the ungodly smell that hurt his sensitive doggy nose, or he just knew how uncomfortable I was. He growled, bared his teeth, and raised his hackles. I snatched his leash now in fear that he may attack and I could lose him. Buster crouched in front of me, glaring down the Beard growling and barking like he had lost all his senses. The Beard ran much faster than I thought possible. 

Buster went back to his normal self. His tail went back to the nonstop wiggle that it always has, and he licked my hand and looked at me with his bright eyes. He looked so proud as if to say ""Mommy, I did it! I saved you from the scary smelly man!"" 

Someone got a lot of treats that day. 

\*\*\* 

The finale: Halloween Night

I was going out with my friends that night to a party. Cinder wasn't feeling well and I was very worried about him, but he encouraged me to go because Puff was very excited to have a costume that went with mine and she loves Halloween so much. I was an angel and she was a devil. I still insisted on checking in on him via text every hour or so. 

I got ready with Puff. My costume had just come in the day before, so I hadn't tried it on yet. It was...too tight with too much cleavage. I was very embarrassed but Puff encouraged me. ""It's only our close friends at the party. No one will judge you."" 

Puff was right of course. It was a great night, up until the party ended. Puff and I live in different residence halls, and the one she lives in also happens to be the one Cinder lives in. We decided to check in on him.

His roommate opened the door and said ""uh, I think he's not doing well."" Cinder was running quite a fever and was murmuring softly under his breath. I asked his roommate to watch him. (I knew Cinder wouldn't agree to go to the hospital until he felt near death. He was that type of stubborn.) Puff and I rushed to get some medicine to take his fever down. Puff drove to the closest place with a pharmacy...which happened to be the 24 hour grocery store.

Predictably, the Beard was down one of the pharmacy aisles. I ignored him, Puff following close behind me. It was the first time I'd seen him since the incident with Buster. I was sure he'd leave me alone. 

The pharmacy section had some unusually short shelves that were maybe 4 feet tall. I had to squat to get what I was looking for. I looked carefully at some of the products available and tried to find the right one for Cinder’s condition. 

Puff suddenly jumped down to my level too. ""We're being watched!"" She hissed. 

I looked up and saw him, looming over us, staring intensely. Heat came to my face as I realized I was still in that way-too-showy angel costume. 

""Ah,"" he licked his lips. ""A perfect angel and a mischevious little imp."" He was staring down, directly at my cleavage.

I snapped. I stood up with the medicine, grabbed Puff's arm and yelled something really embarrassing in my attempts to be a badass: ""Get lost ogre!"" 

I marched off, pulling Puff along at high speeds. ""Wait!"" he called out. 

When I stopped, and we'd lost him, Puff was tearing up. 

""it's okay."" I said. ""I'm going to report him to his manager""

""N-no."" Puff stuttered. ""You don't understand...I looked back...he had his hand down his pants...and the pants were...damp.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Beard no longer works at the store. 

&amp;#x200B;

Quick note: most of these trips where we ran into the Beard were pretty spaced out, we didn't run into him every time, which is why we kept going to this store.

     My gift is my song and this one's for you-Elton John, the sixties

`After-heroes by Jordan`

On the radio, two DJ's shot witty banter at each other's own hubris. The echo of music was a low-volume groove keeping their talk show on the air. The plug was going to be pulled, and they needed this morning's show to be excellent.

""I'm basically at gun-point, folks. Django's big mouth is stretched out perfectly from his baccy chew. It looks like the second barrel of a pump-action shotgun. Spitfire me to oblivion.""

Pow, pow! Django shot back. ""That hurts, Luke. But it's not a pump-action--it's a sex pistol for knocking out women. They love it, what can I say?""

""You're literally dripping with sarcasm, and brown drool. Don't chew Skoal, kids,"" Luke said. ""And it helps your radio voice, doesn't it?""

""Yes, it makes me sound like a deep character.""

""But you have to get around the chew. You have to project your voice...""

I turned it off. The entire downtown workforce was a slow-moving dinosaur, in the foothills of an erupting volcano--the public. No one ever escaped. No one ever did anything, until I made something happen. Parked beside the street, I was surrounded by busybodies in the rain, running around, ready to respond to the day. They were only as reactive as their system allowed--bottlenecked by the business that employed them. The public made requests, and the busybodies complied according to the rules. It wasn't about pleasing people, or helping them, but performing actions according to the machine of their government jobs. All the jobs were government jobs. Everyone was about to lose their job.

I entered the building, with a confident stride-in-suit like I was employed. There were four floors: the top was for executives. In the basement was a parking garage. Cars were the real capable dinosaurs and faster-moving relics. One car would have more retro value than a worker brain by the end of the fiscal year. I didn't think the building was an anthill full of ants: I thought of it instead as a ziggurat.

&amp;#x200B;

I took the elevator up to third floor, avoiding the topmost floor because it had the furthest to fall.  Why did the talk-show hosts pretend like this wasn't happening? They were aware the show wouldn't survive, but oblivious to the reality that the entire production crew were going to quit, from the executives all the way down to the intern. The radio could at least be used to deliver messages of importance to the public. It was the most valuable asset. It might keep us from going back to the stone age. They thought their tobacco talk would earn listeners. The idea must've crossed their minds that cigarettes wouldn't die out. They made a safe attempt at controversy.

I stormed past the safeguarded receptionist window and pushed open the door. A sign was hung that said ""On Air."" That's how I met Django and Luke.

""Someone's getting our attention--shit,"" Luke jumped out of the radio chair as I knocked Django out with a single blow. ""What do you want, man? Hey, now--"" Django's soppy brown spit was on my knuckles.  Blow number two knocked Luke to the floor, where he remained.

I took the seat, breathed in, and slowly delivered the message.

""Eve nik pol praw so na com set code: execuntibrisolponaget.""

Pause.

I had a few seconds before the commercials began. ""The arc will find you,"" I said to thousands of people at once. The technician cut me off.

""Come on down to Dalton Dodge...!""

I backed from the microphone and exited the studio, making a turn. I grabbed the nameplate of a shocked-looking busybody and threw it at the window pane. My tether in hand, I latched it to something he couldn't reach on the outside of the building, rappelling to the sidewalk thirty feet down.

Everyone was programmable. You just needed to clue into the code."

ajyx5v,31,2019-01-26,What if Chloe never existed?,FuckedupandBeautiful,Smallville,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smallville/comments/ajyx5v/what_if_chloe_never_existed/,"Just finished rewatching S1-9 of Smallville.

Did anyone else feel like Clark getting a job at the daily planet and becoming a journalist was a little rushed? Like, he didn't really care about the news, and he didn't finish college. Instead, Lois hands him an application and he gets the job.

Lois didn't seem to care much for Journalism either until later in the series. Then out of nowhere she became a pro.

It just bugged me, and that got me thinking about another character who was really into journalism but eventually gave up on it....Chloe. 

Because Chloe was the ""Lois Lane"" archetype when the real Lois came then the show writers had to decide what to do with her which lead to her become a computer hacker and watch tower, etc. And it was fine. 

But what if Chloe never existed and, instead, Clark was the editor for the Torch from Season 1? 

In S1, Because Jonathan and Martha did not want him to inadvertently injure other children, Clark was not allowed in playgroups or to play on sports teams as a child. His father also once mentioned that he was never allowed to play baseball with other kids. There’s nothing dangerous about working on the school paper. 

""Wall of weird,"" was Clark's way of trying to find out if there was anyone else in Smallville like him.  Clark developed super-speed around age six. Jonathan and Martha taught Clark that his abilities were ""gifts"", but also that he should never tell anyone else about them. Clark didn’t learn that he was an alien until he was 14 in the pilot episode. Before he found out, he must have wanted to know why he had super-speed and was really strong, and probably wondered if he was a freak. Then other people in Smallville started developing powers too.

Without Chloe around to do research for Clark, Clark would have had to take on a more active role in tracking and stopping Meteor-infected people instead of just random villain of the week. Instead of Clark waiting for the Meteor freaks to come to him, Clark could have been following clues, interviewing people, figuring things out without the use of his powers (of course he would still need to use his powers to capture that meteor infected person and put them in Belle Reeve)

Have you ever seen the Chloe Chronicles? The character of Chloe Sullivan appeared in her own web-based spin-off series, titled Smallville: Chloe Chronicles.  

In the Chloe Chronicles, Chloe investigated what happened to Earl Jenkins after the events of ""Jitters,"".

Clark could have been doing stuff like that. Clark knew Earl Jenkins. Earl worked for six seasons as a Farm hand on the Kent farm. It would have been interesting to see Clark get involved in the aftermath and solve mysteries with Pete (who was very underused in the show)

Example: After the events of ""Jitters"", Clark begins checking into the rumors of the ""Level 3"" facility at the Smallville LuthorCorp plant. Here, he starts investigating the death of LuthorCorp employee Earl Jenkins, which takes him to a research company known as Nu-Corp. Clark interviews Nu-Corp's Dr. Arthur Walsh, who reveals that he knows what really happened to Earl Jenkins while he was working at LuthorCorp. Walsh disappears before Clark can get the all of information. Later, Clark is contacted by an ex-Navy SEAL, Bix, and former member of LuthorCorp's ""Deletion Group"" who has information regarding Dr. Walsh's disappearance. Walsh begins sending Clark videos, which lead Clark to discover that Walsh was working with Donovan Jameson, the head of Nu-Corp, and Dr. Stephen Hamilton on experimentations involving the meteor rocks. Clark and Pete Ross, who accompanies Clark, learn that Jameson is experimenting on meteor infected people in order to steal their abilities. Jameson, exhibiting the same jitters as Earl Jenkins, attempts to kill Clark and Pete to hide what he has been doing, but his jitters become uncontrollable and he appears to die in his lab As Clark and Pete leave the lab they come across Lionel Luthor, leading Clark to realize that Lionel was funding Jameson's efforts

&amp;#x200B;

It might have made a really good episode. Also, S1 was missing something...a villain. Lionel was a villain, but he didn't really interact with Clark in S1. The Meteor infected were episodic and rarely seen again after there episodes. So, maybe Dr. Jamison could have been responsible for some of the powers that the kids at Smallville high were displaying. Instead of just experimenting on Meteor infected people, Dr. Jamison was infecting people in order to give them powers and see what they could do. 

Season 1 with Clark as a reporter and Dr. Jamison as the villain. 

Like episode 7 “Craving,” instead of Jodi inventing her own diet, which consists of meteor rock-infected vegetables, Jodi is finds a flyer for a clinical trial for a new drug that promises quick and easy weight loss. Jodi volunteers and the drug causes her to shed weight faster than she can handle, which forces her to suck human fat to satisfy her hunger. There could have been scenes of her on the phone with the Doctor while binge eating (though his identity would stay hidden). Clark is investigating the strange occurrence of animal deaths that have started happening (Not just spending the episode pining after Lana until people get him involved in their issues)

Pilot: Show a shot of gloved hands injecting green medicine in a comatose Jeremy's IV

Metamorphosis: A scene of gloved hands giving Greg that jar of meteor infected bugs in exchange for money. (Note: it was later revealed in the Chloe chronicles that Dr. Jamison was studying one of the bugs that appeared after Greg was crushed. Jamison claimed that the bug was Greg, saying the bug's DNA matched Greg's.)

Hothead: Scene of Coach Walt Arnold buying rocks for his sauna and someone telling him that they'll help with his high blood pressure.

X-Ray: Dr. Jamison was the doctor involved with giving Tina the experimental treatment for her soft bone disease. (Note: in the Chloe chronicles Tina's body was used by Jamison to study the effects of meteor rocks on humans)

Cool: Gloved hands pull Sean out of Crater Lake and lay him on the ground in the forest. Shot of those hands injecting something in Sean's arm before Sean opens his eyes.

Hourglass: Gloved hands giving Harry Volk a bottle of pills that are supposed to make him feel  seventeen again. 

&amp;#x200B;

You get the idea.  Also, when years later, Dr. Jamison appears, alive, and working as a primary physician on Lex Luthor's Level 33.1 project it would be a shock and make his real death all the more satisfying.

Anyway, back to life without Chloe.

Another thing that Chloe's absence causes in that Clark could take Chloe's place at college. Attending college as a journalism major and work as an intern at the Daily Planet where he would be writing obituaries and classifieds and answering 24 hour news hotlines, followed by small general interest and current event articles.

 Maybe after Jonathan dies, instead of dropping out, Clark could take night classes like Chloe claimed to so he could get his degree.

With No Chloe, there would be more focus on Pete. Maybe in “Drone,” instead of Pete nominating Clark, Clark nominates Pete (in the comics, Pete is Lex’s vice president. So it would be a nod to that.) Then Clark is the one whose conflicted since Pete doesn’t care about the issues. Also, Clark is investigating the attacks against the other candidates and trying to protect Pete from Sasha’s bees.

No Chloe means that Lois wouldn't be introduced until Metropolis because Chloe isn't in Smallville to go missing. Meaning by the time Clark meets her she would probably already be a journalist so her love for reporting wouldn't just pop up out of no where.

Without Chloe, and without Lois there in S5, Jonathan would have to find another campaign manager. Maybe Pete (if the writers kept him this time around)

Without Chloe, Clark would be the one to meet Jimmy at the daily Planet and they would probably form a better friendship without Jimmy having to worry about Chloe having feelings for Clark.

Without Chloe, Clark would most likely be the one to meet Davis Bloome and form a friendship with him. Instead of the Jimmy/Chloe/Davis love triangle, Clark would be in the middle torn between friendships.

Without Chloe, Lana would have never come back in Season 8, because there would be no wedding, so Clark and Lois would have gotten together earlier.

Now, I love Chloe (the Character. Not the actress) and would miss her friendship with Clark and her relationship with Oliver and the Watchtower. 

But without her, Clark might have had to grow up faster and stand on his own two feet. 

What do you think? Do you think this change would have worked? Do you think it would have been terrible? What else might have changed?

\*\*Please be informed that this so called ""Sky's Production Team"" is not the official team of ItsSky\*\*

Let's start with the intros

[OG INTRO : This one is suppose to be her very first intro but it was left unfinished because one member of the production team\(my lady\) did a really good job on the Version 1 \*\*ON THIS PREVIEW ALL MATERIALS ARE UP TO DATE\*\*](https://reddit.com/link/ajyz2y/video/s0zao2wawpc21/player)

[Version 1 : This intro was created on May 30 2018,a week after our first visit on Sky's Twitch channel,this intro is suppose to be used in our job but we decided not to 'coz we want Sky to have it as an intro. \*\*APPROVED BY SKY ON JUNE 8 2018 AND FIRST AIRED AFTER HER Detroit Become Human Playthrough\*\*](https://reddit.com/link/ajyz2y/video/josu1o0bvpc21/player)

&amp;#x200B;

[Version 2 : After a couple of weeks we decided to recreate version 1 because the production team realized that the intro is so flashy and the effects has too many sharp edges.. so this curly version of the first intro is born and the word SkyFam was introduced,this intro had so many retouch and finishing since Ashkenov is colourblind he had a hard time matching Sky's color theme](https://reddit.com/link/ajyz2y/video/cznyhnbltpc21/player)

[Winter Theme : This project is one of the most stressful but yet had a lot of fun to make.. why? because by the time this intro in on process holiday season is just around the corner and the production team is already on vacation..good thing it got finished 2 hours before the flight,it was so rushed we had no choice to use the same materials just like the other intros. \*\*This one is actually requested by Sky but we're ahead of her so its already finished before she told us she wanted a winter themed intro,good thing is she loved it as soon as she saw it 'coz if not.. we're screwed because we're already at the airport when we received her message\*\*](https://reddit.com/link/ajyz2y/video/2tbmvn0bvpc21/player)

[THE OUTRO \/ EXTRO \(unreleased\) : about this one,its created right after the version 1 intro as a follow up,but Sky and the production team decided not to use it coz we realized that an outro \/ extro for her stream is not necessary.. a simple goodbye with a smile from her is enough](https://reddit.com/link/ajyz2y/video/4vuf48mjypc21/player)

[The OFFLINE BANNER : This is a huge project too,one time someone on the chat asks why her offline banner has a League of Legends theme then she said that one of her viewer made it way back.. then one member of the production team light a bulb right on top of her head and said \\""I'm gonna make one for her\\"".. and she immediately draws everything from scratch except the sleeping girl and the cloud,we just googled those,the girl is actually has a short hair and  wearing a plain pink shirt but one of the interns in our IRL job manage to insert the merch on her and Sky added more hair into it..  \*\* also a shout out to Kawkawa for helping us making this banner](https://i.redd.it/tpsddesn3qc21.png)

# ================================

# PROJECT SKY ( unfinished / unreleased )

# We also have this unfinished project and never been teased because after her partnership so many things just happened,its so fast all of the ideas was scratched out of the list

[We got tons of clips \/ videos \/ photos of Sky FYI LOL](https://i.redd.it/a0fvjoug9qc21.jpg)

=========================================

PROJECT SKY 2.0 ( sort of )

""The Partnership Journey""

\*\*Right after her partnership,the team immediately got this idea to create a highlights of Sky's journey to her partnershipThis is the video where we made Sky sweat on her eyes and nose lol

Here's her reaction

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHmnRf8WFoA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHmnRf8WFoA)

===========================================

""Good Things Happen to Good People (ItsSkyLOL's 1st Twitch Anniversary Special)""

\*\*This one is a HUGE project,its not just the production is involve but also SkyFam did a great job contributing on this one.

But we're actually short of time by the making of this because on that time we only have 3 days before the anniversary stream and a BIG SHOUTOUT to ""Laposada"" and ""KingGaming"" for helping us making this video

Here's her reaction

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRltrbIl\_Q8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRltrbIl_Q8)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*IN ADDITION.. we have so many unfinished projects for sky 'coz the team had so many good ideas but as a team we work together as one family and we strictly choose the best output of our work before we show it to Sky

[We couldn't find most of the project file maybe because it was already been over written and lost because of the Windows update,we can only recover some of the temp file but it was already currupted](https://i.redd.it/w9tlvq28aqc21.jpg)

And for those people that keeps asking us if we're getting paid / how much Sky pays us..

NO.. a BIG NO.. we're not getting paid by Sky.. we're doing this by our own free will and we're not asking money from sky

we just love what we do,we love Sky so we want to give support on her channel..

some peeps call us fanboy/fangirl well if that's the case its ok with us...

&amp;#x200B;

That's all and sorry about the long post

Much Love"
ajzpkc,1,2019-01-26,21 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/ajzpkc/21_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Today I am looking for someone to make my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Mako gets lonely being alone on the water, so he cooks a magic fish to turn an unsuspecting duelist into his new hot girlfriend. 

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older. 

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

A few things:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar. 

2. I only roleplay in 3rd person, and I expect you to as well. This is non-negotiable. 

3. I DO NOT INITIATE TRANSFORMATIONS! I am looking for someone to transform my characters. If that does not appeal to you, you have been warned. 

4. Please be an active role player. I understand we all have busy lives, but if you are never online or only reply once in a blue moon, I am not for you. 

I am accepting of people of all gender expressions! My timezone is EST US, and I am off from work today so replies will be fairly quick! I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW/SFW

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM or kik:

## Introduction - What is NavCoin?

* NavCoin is a cryptocurrency that has been publicly traded since mid 2014. It's a fork of the latest version of Bitcoin Core with many additional features and functionalities which differentiate NAV from other cryptos.
* NavCoin has been one of the first projects to switch to Proof of Stake and is still using PoS to validate and generate blocks. NavCoin didn't have an ICO or a premine. It is self-funded from the beginning and primarily, but not solely maintained by developers of Encrypt-S - the NavCoin Core team (see below for more info about the team).
* NAV is trying to simplify cryptocurrencies for the masses. It does this by providing features which make it easy to use like the implementation of OpenAlias, which allows people to send NAV to an email-like address (for example [cryptosif@nav.community](mailto:cryptosif@nav.community)). It also provides very easy to use desktop and mobile wallets.
* NAV also provides optional privacy. You can send transactions publicly or private, as you prefer. 
* It's block speed is really fast with about 30 seconds per block. Transactions are confirmed as spendable within only 30 second which makes it ideal for retail and e-commerce. 
* Extremely low transaction costs (0.0001 NAV/transaction)
* High levels of scalability (260+ transactions per second)
* It currently has a market cap of 11.6kk (as of writing) and trades for about $0.18 / 4'872 Sats per NAV. The circulating supply is 64kk with no max supply (with an inflation of about 4%). 
* Staking NavCoin currently yields about 8–10% of your holdings per year. This number depends on how many NAV are currently staking. The minimum return is about 4% (if every single NAV would be staking).
* NAV is available on many different exchanges with the biggest ones being Binance, Bittrex and Poloniex. 
* In Italy, the adoption of NAV actually is quite high already. Here is a map that shows, where you can pay with NAV in different stores in Italy: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1bkvfwu2GHkgNYF63ryZvUiU4Z3-hZmik&amp;usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1bkvfwu2GHkgNYF63ryZvUiU4Z3-hZmik&amp;usp=sharing) You can use it to pay in Bars, Pubs, Tattoo stores, grocery stores, hotels, recording studios and even for a cardiological examination.

&amp;#x200B;

## The History

**Introduction**

The following chapter will summarize and break down the history of NavCoin in a few sentences. NAV started a long time ago, went through rebrandings and changes of the core team before it became what it is today.

&amp;#x200B;

**SummerCoin**

NavCoin was initially first introduced under the name SummerCoin on April 23 in 2014. SummerCoin was a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. It used to have a PoW/PoS hybrid algorithm with a block time of 45 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

**SummerCoinV2 /NavajoCoin**

Soon after the initial launch of SummerCoin, the original developer left and SoopY (soopy452000 on bitcointalk) took over as the main developer and rebranded the project to SummerCoinV2 respectively NavajoCoin and introduced new features. 

The name NavajoCoin was chosen in honor of the Navajo Code Talker. The unbreakable Navajo code was used to encrypt highly classified military information and commands and decrypt the same in WW II. 

SoopY introduced a technology which allowed sending transactions anonymously and private. This technology was called ""Navajo Anonymous Technology"". SoopY also released a new wallet and set the Proof of Stake rewards at 10% for the first year, 5% for the second year and 2% for every year after.

&amp;#x200B;

**NavCoin**

On August 12, 2014, Craig (current lead core developer, pakage on bitcointalk) started to get involved with NAV by helping to set up a website \[10\]. 

It was officially announced that Craig joined the core team as a ""Wallet &amp; Web Developer"" on November 06, 2014.

The last tokenswap and restart of the blockchain of NAV happened on May 12, 2016.

Soon later, SoopY stopped showing up and Craig stepped into the role of the lead core developer. Since then, Craig has assembled a strong team with which he built NavCoin into what it is today.

Currently, Craig and the NavCoin Core team is located in New Zealand and they are actively developing many ground-braking features which differentiate NAV from other cryptocurrencies. You will read more about that later in this article.

## 

## The Current State

**Introduction**

The year 2018 has been a thriving year for the NavCoin ecosystem. Despite the USD price of NAV not reflecting it, in 2018 the core team has developed a whole bunch of new features. Also the core content creators published the first official guidelines that function as an orientation guide for community content creators. This chapter will give you an overview of the current team, the features, the prior mentioned guidelines and the community of NavCoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Team \[1\]**

Last year, the core team has grown alot. It contains of developers, content creators and interns. The core team are employees of Encrypt S, the New Zealand's leading blockchain R&amp;D lab. Encrypt S is developing blockchain solutions since 2014 and values building open-source software highly.

&amp;#x200B;

***Craig MacGregor - Chief Executive Officer***

Craig is the CEO of Encrypt S and the founder of NavCoin. He is one of the world's most experienced blockchain developers. Craig founded NavCoin in 2014 and is developing software for it since then. He has assembled a strong team of like-minded people. Craig also speaks at seminars and conferenced. Some of the companies and conferences he did blockchain education sessions at are Oracle, Xero, Air New Zealand, Blok Tex and trademe. Together with the team, he is also doing a education series on YouTube where he explains upcoming features in-depth for the community.

&amp;#x200B;

***Alex Vazquez - Chief Technical Officer***

Alex is the CTO of Encrypt S and the most active contributor to the NavCoin core Github. He has incredible knowledge of blockchains and proposes and implements solutions for challenges and features. He supports community developers frequently and answers any questions of the community thoroughly. Like Craig, Alex is developing software for the NavCoin ecosystem for a very long time. Alex speaks at universities at times and educates students about the blockchain technology.

&amp;#x200B;

***Paul Sanderson - Lead Software Engineer***

Paul is the Lead Software Engineer at Encrypt S. He has a flair for technology. His technical and management skills are perfectly suited for consultancy and investment advising. He also frequently contributes to the NavCoin core source code.

&amp;#x200B;

***Rowan Savage - Senior Software Engineer***

Rowan is a full stack software engineer with more than a decade experience in developing complex front-end web applications. He joined Encrypt S in February 2018 and has since been involved in the Valence Plattform, the Kauri Wallet and NavCoin Core. You will read more about these feature/projects later.

&amp;#x200B;

***Carter Xiao - Lead UX/UI Designer***

Carter specializes in user-centric design and is also very talented with 3D animation, motion graphics and programming. One of NavCoins core principle is ""Simplifying Crypto"" and UX/UI is a very important part of that.

&amp;#x200B;

***Matt Paul - Software Engineer***

Like Rowan, Matt is a full stack Software Engineer. He joined the core team in Mai 2017 and has since worked on NavPay, NavPi, the Kauri Wallet and NavCoin Core.  Kieren Hyland - Chief Strategy Officer Kieren is one of the employees that are working for Encrypt S for a very long time. He is the CSO and is a digital strategist and growth hacker with a passion for new technology and has a lot of experience in online marketing. **Laura Harris - Creative Director** Laura has a combination of commercial and creative flair. She manages the social media accounts for NavCoin and ensures, that NavCoins' message is always powerful, relevant and distinctive. **John Darby - Content Creator** John is an internationally awarded Technology and Financial sector marketing communications specialist. He is one of the Core Content Creators for NavCoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Features of NavCoin \[2\]** 

The following features are currently available and have been developed in the last months and years. It is sorted from newest to oldest.

&amp;#x200B;

***Static Block Reward***

The soft-fork for the enabling of static block rewards have been accepted and became active recently at 5th January 2019. This means, that the block reward was changed from a percentage based reward to a static reward. This will incentivize the stakers to have their node online 24/7 which increased the security of the network. It also aligns NavCoin with the PoSv3 specification. With this implementation, the yearly inflation will be 3.6% currently and will exponentionally decrease because of the static value of the rewards. Every staked block will now give the staker 2 NAV. Depending on how many people are staking, the yearly percentage varies. With the network weight currently being around 20'000'000 NAV, stakers earn around 10% rewards from staking 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

***Cold staking***

To provide extra security to participants in the staking process in the NavCoin network, the core team decided to implement cold staking. This allows to store NAV offline and still be able to sign staking inputs. Looking forward, a possible integration into the Ledger Nano S would mean, that one can stake NAV securely from a offline hardware wallet. How cool is that?

&amp;#x200B;

***OpenAlias***

One of the core principle of NAV is to simplify cryptocurrencies. Many non-technical people are deterred from the long, cryptic addresses used in wallets. When sending funds, you have to make sure that every single letter and digit is correct which is nerve-wracking for the average person. NavCoin has implemented OpenAlias, which allows to transform the wallet address into a email-like form. Everyone can register a name like ""[cryptosif@nav.community](mailto:cryptosif@nav.community)"". Funds can then be sent to this name, which makes sending crypto much easier and less error-prone.

&amp;#x200B;

***Community Fund***

This is the one big feature I was most excited about. NavCoin core has implemented the first fully decentralized community fund. Acceptance of proposals and release of funds is all approved by the decentralized network. No central authority has access to the fund. The community fund enables everyone to propose their ideas to the NavCoin community and to get paid to implement these ideas. Everyone can propose whatever they like (of course there is a higher rate of success if the proposal contributes to the NavCoin ecosystem ;-)). In fact, this article was sponsored by the NAV-Community by voting ""yes"" for my proposal. The fund works like this:

For a fee of 50 NAV, everyone can create and present his idea/proposal to the entire NavCoin network. The fee is here to help prevent spam attacks. Proposals can literally be anything - be it development, marketing or anything else you can some up with.

After creating the proposal, everyone contributing to the NavCoin network can then decide if they like the proposal of not. They vote with ""Yes"" or ""No"" for the acceptance of the proposal. Voting happens via staking. Every transaction that gets validated by you gives you one vote. This means that the more NAV you are staking, the higher your voting weight is. 

The proposal stays in the state ""Pending"" until it is accepted or rejected. To be accepted, a proposal has to have a participation of at least 50% of all staked blocks and at least 75% of these votes have to be ""Yes""-votes. Like-wise to be rejected a proposal need 50% participation of the network and 75% of these votes have to be ""No""-votes. Additionally, if a proposal didn't pass after 6 voting cycles (about 6 weeks) it is also rejected. 

After a proposal has been accepted, the creator of the proposal can start his work.  When the work is finished, or at in the proposal defined checkpoints, the proposal creator can create a payment request for the full or part of the requested funds. 

The NavCoin network can then again decide, if the work is what the creator promised to do and vote for the funds or reject the payment request because it was not what he promised. This mechanism ensures, that the funds are only release if the creator of the proposal did what he promised. The NavCoin network decides everything, there is no central authority which makes the community fund 100% decentralized.

The community fund is quite new but there have already been some proposals that were accepted like paying for the development &amp; hosting of NAV block explorer, the creation and distribution of NAV car stickers to the community for free (or paid by the community fund), the funding of interns for NavCoin Core, translation of the website into other languages and YouTube videos. What ideas could you come up with? By the way: this article was also sponsored by the community fund :-)

&amp;#x200B;

***Proof of Stake***

Like said before, NavCoin uses the Proof of Stake algorithm to create and validate blocks. Participants of the NavCoin network can earn rewards by putting their coins to stake and thus validating blocks and securing the network. The reward used to be 4% fixed but recently changed with the implementation of PoSv3. Currently, rewards for stakers that are staking 24/7 is about 10% but it is dependent on how many people are staking. If more nodes come online, this reward will go down. If 90% of all NAVs would be at stake, stakers would still earn 4%.

&amp;#x200B;

***Tutorials And Guidelines \[3\]***

The NavCoin Core team pushes the community to contribute to the NavCoin ecosystem constantly. They emphasize that NavCoin is an open source project and everyone can contribute. The team tries to make it as easy as possible for the average person to contribute and thus created different tutorials and guidelines. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Tutorials To Contribute To The Website***

The whole website is open source. Everyone can contribute to the website. The team created different guides for people to follow \[4\].

&amp;#x200B;

***The NavCoin Developer Manifesto***

The content creator core team has build a developer manifesto. It defines the values that should be uphold like for example that they will always operate in the best interest of the network. If defines the principles, purposes, scope of involvement and operational requirements \[5\].

&amp;#x200B;

***The NavCoin Content Creation Manifesto***

Similar to the developer manifesto, there is also a content creation manifesto. Again it defines the principles for creating content, the purpose, the scope of involvement and the operational requirements \[6\].

&amp;#x200B;

***NavCoin Brand Guidelines***

In addition to the content creation manifesto, there is also a brand guideline booklet. This should help content creators to create images, videos, articles etc. in the same style as the core team. It defines the NAV brand. The brand guidelines contain definitions, the language to use (words to use, words not to use), the tone of voice, what the community aspires to be and what we discourage to be. It also contains the logo pack which can be used in graphics etc. It describes correct logo spacing, logo placement, the colors of NAV and different web assets. It gives tips about gradients and overlays, the typefaces (with a font pack) and many more. Check it out yourself \[7\].

&amp;#x200B;

***NavCoin Educational Series***

The core team has decided to actively involve the community in the creation of new features. For this reason and to allow users to ask questions, they created the NavCoin Educational Series. The core team schedules an online live meetup which can be joined by everyone. On YouTube they do live-streams and explain upcoming features. Examples of these series are explanations for cold staking, static rewards (PoSv3) and the community fund. The community can ask questions live and the core team will answer them immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

***Community***

During the last year there have been an influx of software developers from the community starting to create features for NAV. 

&amp;#x200B;

[*navexplorer.com*](https://navexplorer.com)

An examples is navexplorer.com which is programmed by community developer prodpeak and is a block explorer for NavCoin. Additionally, it functions as a interface to see what is going on in the community fund. It shows pending proposals and payment requests.

&amp;#x200B;

*NEXT Wallet*

The NEXT Wallet is an alternative wallet for NAV and other cryptocurrencies. It has a beautiful user interface and is additionally the easiest interface to interact with the community fund (create proposals, create payment requests and vote for proposals and payment requests). It is programmed by community developer sakdeniz who put hundreds of hours into it during last year.

&amp;#x200B;

There were also some marketing activities starting to emerge with the release of the community fund. Some of these were for example free stickers for everyone in the NAV community to stick to their car / shop / window etc. or YouTube videos of CryptoCandor and Cryptomoonie that explained the details of NAV. I am sure, that with the 500'000 NAV available in the community fund per year there will be an influx of gread ideas - development as well as marketing activities - that will be funded.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Future

**Introduction**

These features are planned for the future. Many of the following features are part of the 2019 roadmap. Some will not be described in great detail because not much is known about them yet. I've still listed them as they are part of what is yet to come.

&amp;#x200B;

**Features**

***Rimu - Improved Privacy Solution***

NavCoin used to be a optional privacy coin. That means, that you could choose to send a transaction in private. NavCoin was criticized for the way it handles private payments because it relied on a few servers which didn't make it that decentralized. The technology was called ""NavTech"" and was a secondary blockchain that obscured the transaction and the amount that was sent. NavCoin Core is currently developing a new improved privacy solution that will make the private payment system completely trustless and districuted and runs at a protocol level. Alex of the NavCoin Core team has published a paper that describes this new privacy solution. It's called Zero Confidential Transactions and can be found here: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330366788\_ZeroCT\_Improving\_Zerocoin\_with\_Confidential\_Transactions\_and\_more](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330366788_ZeroCT_Improving_Zerocoin_with_Confidential_Transactions_and_more). What I want to highlight is the collaboration between Alex as the proposer of the solution and the Veil team, a Bitcoin Core developer and Moneros main cryptographer as reviewers. When the best work together, it will be interesting to see what the outcome is!

&amp;#x200B;

***Valence Plattform \[8\]***

Valence is an applied Blockchain platform that can help businesses realise the tangible benefits of blockchain. You can think of Valence as a platform with which you can build Anonymous Distributed Applications (aDapps) with.  But Valence is a different kind of platform that enables developers to create new types of blockchain applications. The problem with current (turing complete) dApp platforms are their complexity and rigid nature. Security holes in smart contracts and scaling issues happen frequently \[9\].

Valence provides transitional pathways that let businesses migrate only part of their activities to the blockchain without having to restructure their entire business model \[9\].

&gt;Valence will provide a spectrum of blockchain application solutions which sit along the decentralized spectrum, offering businesses simple ways to dip their toes into the blockchain at minimal risk or complexity \[9\].

Thanks to the proof of stake nature of the Valence blockchain, more of a node's resources can be used for processing and routing application data which makes the platform faster and scalable.

&gt;Valence aims to make building blockchain applications as accessible to the general public as WordPress or Squarespace has made building websites.

The developers NavCoin and Valence aim to make Valence extremely easy to work with:

&gt;A Valence application could be an open source mobile or web application that submits unencrypted or encrypted data directly to the blockchain. The only configuration necessary for the app developer would be setting up the data structure. Once they've done that they can start writing to the blockchain immediately.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Valence blockchain interface is language agnostic, meaning developers are free to build applications in whichever language they're familiar with, which greatly reduces the barrier to entry.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the platform progresses, Valence will introduce more and more smart contract templates in collaboration with the development community. These will be like plugins that users can simply select and configure for their application, without having to reinvent the wheel and risk contract errors or spend countless hours of research to program them.

&amp;#x200B;

***NavShopper***

The following information is taken from the latest weekly news: NavShopper is a new project which will allow people to spend NavCoin on a growing list of retailers and service providers. NavShopper sits between traditional retailers accepting fiat and NavCoin users and purchases products on behalf of the user by managing the crypt-fiat conversion, payment and shipping. This project will unlock many more ways for people to spend NAV on existing websites/marketplaces without requiring each site to individually accept cryptocurrencies. Some of the prototypes we are working on include crediting your Uber account, buying products on Amazon and donating to charities.

&amp;#x200B;

***Kauri Wallet***

The Kauri Wallet aims to be an open-source, multi-currency wallet which functions as a foundation for other features.

&amp;#x200B;

***Kauri Enhanced***

Enhancements to the Kauri Wallet will allow multiple accounts, pin numbers, recurring payments and more.

&amp;#x200B;

***Kauri DAEx***

The Kauri DAEx is a Decentralised Atomic Exchange that utilises the features of the Kauri Wallet and enables users to create safe peer to peer atomic exchanges for any currency supported by the Kauri Wallet. NavDelta NavDelta will be a payment gateway that allows users to spend NAV at any business which accepts currencies supported by the Kauri Wallet. NavMorph NavMorph is a fusion of Rimu and Kauri DAEx and will allow to privately send every cryptocurrency supported by the Kauri Wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

## Outro

If you have made it this far: Congratulations! You have learned about how NAV evolved, what its current state is and what the future will bring. To sum all up: NavCoin has made incredible progress during last year and released many long awaited features despite the bear market. Many more exciting features are yet to come and it's going to be very interesting to see where we will stand on this day next year.

&amp;#x200B;

## Giveaway

Unfortunately, the giveaway was not possible in the cryptocurrency-subreddit  because of their rules, so I'm doing it here :-) As a surprise, in the next few hours I am going to send some NAV to everyone who wants to try out the awesome features you have read about above.

To get your NAVs, all you have to do is the following:

* Download a wallet
* Backup your private key (the random words) so you could restore your wallet if your phone breaks or something like that!
* Post your public address, so I can send you some NAVs

If you liked the experience, I'd be happy to hear back from you :)

**42,883** mad cunts *drinking VB* for **6 fucking years!**  
  
Now I know you Aussie cunts out there are tired of all the political shit going on over at r/Australia. Well luckily I've got a great fucking subreddit for ya. You've probably already heard of it, but if you haven't, say hello to r/Straya. Now I sat down with the cunts that moderate r/Straya and asked them some questions, and they gave me some bloody good answers I tell ya what.

&gt; Why'd you decide to all of a sudden join/create the place?

&gt;&gt; /u/Phazon2000 Oh yeah good yarn that. I wanted to impersonate a member of the mod team to get a role on some loose girl's discord and see some cheeky piccies of her, so I asked the mods to put me on temporarily. One of the lads got confused by what I was saying and was asking if I was applying for an actual mod position so I said ""yeah ok"". I had a choice between sending raunchy photos of my girl or me doing something sick to get modded so I grabbed a whip and whipped my hills-hoist while wearing an Akubra and holding giant VB bottle. The rest is history.

&gt;&gt; /u/abigredball I remember finding it in like 2016 but I was also drinking a 4lt goon sack every 3 days and smoking a quarter a week that year (not even exaggerating). So I have no fucking idea how I found this place. It used to be on /r/all, I think I either found it there or there was some shit on /r/australia. I used to fucking check like where shit was also posted and shit and there was some shit that was also posted here. I dunno, I really liked it, posted a lot, and ended up being made a mod like a year later. I was good at stealing good shit off other places and reposting in there. Mostly cause half my mates are bogan as fuck so my FB is just full of it.

&gt;&gt; /u/Biz2324 The drongos at r/Australia wouldn't stop whingeing and being politically biased so I punched some random Aussie slang into google filtering Reddit and r/straya popped up. Made a post about what galahs the ""other sub"" are and got told that was old news. Made a few posts and joined in the banter. Was approached by u/cuntosaurus to be a mod and accepted. The true blue test came as ""Oi cunt why didn't ya lend me money when I asked you at the pub last week?"" to which I replied ""Sorry mate I blew all me dole in the pokies"".

&gt; What's some of your favourite shit that gets posted on the sub?

&gt;&gt; /u/Phazon2000 My favourite is probably short (under a minute) OC videos and anything involving out native wildlife (assuming they're not getting too munted on ciggies or grog).

&gt;&gt; /u/abigredball Anything drug or alcohol related. I cannot hide my roots.

&gt; Why should the cunts reading this visit r/Straya?

&gt;&gt; /u/Phazon2000 Because they're Aussies who love to embrace our cherished culture with a mod team that's the equivelant of your mate getting his hands on a second-hand copper's uniform.

&gt;&gt; /u/Biz2324 Most importantly for a laugh. But also to talk shit, take the piss out of each other and celebrate what being Aussie is truly about without moaning about the wankers in Canberra 24/7.

&gt;&gt; /u/ABigRedBall Fuckin don't fucking come in and pretend you live here. Fuck off we're full and all that. But just don't fucking come in and try to fake the accent. At least lurk a bit before you do. Some people REAALY LOIKE TO THOINK THEY KNOW HOW TAR SPEAK FLAMMING FAIR DINKUM AUSSIE and it's just fucking shit as. But yeah, come on and have a gander. Comment and upvote. Just know that all users who out themselves as seppos on the sub do get the honour of having the legendary 'Seppo2' un-removable flair.

To all you Aussies reading this, Happy Australia Day! Although the bot that posts these is dumb and this will actually get posted on the 27th for the Eastern states, I'd still like to point out the fact that even though not everyone agrees on what the day means, I think we all know that it's a great day for us Aussies to come together and celebrate our great country. Australians may represent only a tiny minority of Redditors, but we're still out there. Anyways it's back to the pub for me! Cheers, fellas!

ak0nwr,2893,2019-01-26,"CMV: Successful people from humble backgrounds have had to work harder, and so deserve more respect than those with well-off families.",WardenAckerman,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ak0nwr/cmv_successful_people_from_humble_backgrounds/,"In my view, people who were born into well-off families, and who subsequently become successful, for whatever reason, don't deserve the same amount of respect as successful people who come from more humble backgrounds. It's always struck me that most of the time, that former type of person has never really known, and likely will never know, hardship - and even more likely, won't have had to work as hard to get where they are as those whose families have less.

Let's illustrate this idea with the current US President, and his 'small loan of a million dollars' from his dad (which, with inflation, would be more like $70 million nowadays). He wouldn't have got where he is today without his family's fortune. He's had a silver spoon in his mouth all his life - how can he truly understand what Americans who are struggling are going through?

Speaking more generally, let's compare their childhoods. The majority of well-off families are going to want to send their kids to the best schools they can, and good for them: after all, most parents just want the best for their kids. Said well-off families are also going to be able to pay for extra tuition if their kid is struggling, music lessons, and so and so forth. Meanwhile, the less well-off families, who in many cases will also want the best for their offspring, would no doubt want to try and get their kids into good schools - but for various reasons (catchment areas, financial barriers, rigorous entrance tests) that just isn't possible. Same goes for the extracurricular stuff - unless it is subsidised, for many working-class families, that sort of thing just isn't feasible.

It's the same story at university level (a.k.a college, if you're American): kids with rich parents are able to take full advantage of uni life; for example, they won't need to take a part-time job to fund studies/living costs (on a side note, in the UK, our student loan is basically a graduate tax which is written off after 30 years, so it's not quite as bad as in the States). They'll probably be able to pay for textbooks/study materials, foreign trips and all the rest of it. Conversely, the poor kid is going to struggle to pay for a lot of this without a job and/or significant financial assistance (in the UK, at least if you're dirt poor, I understand the latter is actually quite decent for students).

Then what about those who move to big cities (London, NYC, LA, etc) to try and 'make it' in whatever industry (i.e. the media/showbiz, finance, creative industries, to name but a few)? The rich kid is inherently going to be at an advantage, because their families can financially support them; meanwhile, the poor kid is at best going to have to take a job in order to cover (if they're lucky) the high living costs in such cities. The rich kid can take unpaid internships, some of which are necessary for certain industries (the media is fairly notorious for them in the UK); for the poor kid, these are basically off-limits. Just how is that fair?

This is why I have so much respect for those who have made it from nothing - as trite as this may sound, they've had to go the extra mile in order to get where they are; meanwhile, someone at a similar level who had many hands up in their life hasn't had to work nearly as hard (even if, in their minds, they've worked exceptionally hard). What have they done? They've had help from Mummy and Daddy all their lives. It seems like nothing they've done has been entirely off their own backs. They were born rich and will probably die rich, never truly understanding the struggles of those worse off than them.

I realise much of this post will likely come across as inverse snobbery, and to be fair, it probably is. It is also, however, a view I have held for some time, albeit one which I realise could do with being challenged.

TL;DR: Successful people from more humble backgrounds deserve much more same respect than successful people from well-off background, because the former will have worked much, much harder to get where they are; meanwhile, the latter will usually have had a lot of help from their families."

I feel a bit silly writing this because lots of people finish uni all the time and cope fine afterwards. And I feel I just come across as ungrateful, I'm back living with my parents who are very supportive and I have a good job, so why am I not happy? But I've been struggling ever since I graduated, I just feel a bit lost and lonely.

I loved uni so much and would give ANYTHING to go back in time and re live those three years. I graduated in the summer with a first class in maths. I was very lucky and bagged myself a well payed intern position shortly after I left uni. They've offered to extend my contract which is great. But I find the work very boring and repetitive and I would prefer to work for a bigger company. I've been looking for other jobs but the problem is I have no idea what I want to do! I find it so daunting. I've also not had much luck with applications so far, I've had a lot of rejections which sucks but I just need to keep going.

When I was at uni I was living with my best friends and boyfriend. It's been really tough going from living with by boyfriend to now living 5 hours away from each other while he's doing his masters. We make the effort to see each other at least once a month and we spent almost 2 weeks together over the xmas period which was lovely, but I miss him so much all the time!! After leaving school I kept in contact with a small handful of close friends but a lot of them are either still at uni or moved away so I don't have many friends who live close by now I'm living back with my parents. It's so hard going from being around my closest friends pretty much 24/7 at uni to being alone most of the time now. I try to see people at the weekends when I can but everyone is so busy all the time/has no money so its hard.

I know this is all just temporary and things will get better, but everything is so uncertain at the moment!! Sorry, think I've been rambling enough now. In short, I'm feeling extremely lost and lonely at the moment. How did other people cope in this weird phase after uni??"

This is important to note because when you work, your rent goes 35% based upon your funds/paycheck.

Younger brother and mother had their disability income suspended since beginning of 2018. I understand my mother made some financial mistakes that resulted in this situation. She has a lot of credit card debts and nothing to pay it off with. We've been in bankruptcy before and she built up her credit only to end up on the edge again.

I'm in university and had already paid for this semester with my remaining funds. My mom keeps hoping I'll get an internship this way but I have not heard anything. I understand I need a job but how can I? I've been applying and haven't been hearing back. We're honestly scared.

Edit: Mom can't get a job because she has mental health issues even though she's on medication plus it would mess up her disability appeal case going on.

I recently got an internship offer in DC, and will finally be making some real money in life. I was looking for housing for my internship period. I found a few good places on Craigslist and some school forums. They are cheap, they are decently located and I was gonna look into a few of them. Then my mom would jump out and try to ruin everything, forcing me to pick a place that's located in center DC, with private bath and everything, and unsurprisingly at a daunting $8000. I tried to convince her that this is way out of my budget range but she said that if I am not willing to pay for it she would just go ahead and book it for me. Being the only child I know a can be a spoiled brat sometimes but honestly I just really want to live my life as everyone else does, get a job, rent a somewhat shitty place and start saving money on my own. How do I avoid falling into the trap of being the type of girl who uses daddy's credit card? It seems like no matter how I insist my parents would just rather outright spend money for me even if I don't want them to..."

I love the rps do be as detailed as possible, and for thwm to be in first person(i am fone with you writing in third too, if its absolutely necessary, and me being in first) The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)The wrath of a God: This one is a bit more creative and will take place in ancient Egypt. Your character can be Cleopatra, or any other persone you would like who is celebrated for her beauty. However, this beauty was a gift from the God Anubis, in order to spread his word. But since you used your beauty to be wrongfully know as a God, you will have to fave punishment 

4)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

5)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

6)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo"

I recently tied my twitch prime, arc, and game accounts together to get the Bundle, but it has been almost two weeks and nothing.  I’ve made sure all accounts are linked probably 10 times, and I’ve written to both twitch and arc support, no response.  

I am starting to think that the reason I can’t collect the Bundle is because I somehow never finished the tutorial.  I went through the wiki and I am missing a couple of what would seem to be tutorial quests, like “Check the Job Board” where you talk to the barmaid. Any ideas??

Thanks very much for the help and for playing what us been a very enjoyable, albeit buggy, game!

ak4of3,0,2019-01-26,TIL: Full-Time employees' code is not necessarily better than an intern's.,Kiwi_Taster,javascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/ak4of3/til_fulltime_employees_code_is_not_necessarily/,"So at my company where I'm currently interning, usually the workflow goes like this: I get a feature request, implement it, then I submit for a code review by a full time employee. So usually I'm writing code from scratch or adding on to something. 

Well a few days ago, we had a critical bug where a part of our login system was completely broken on IE. One of the full time developers asked me if I could take a look at it for the next hot fix. So this was essentially the first time where I would be fixing a full time developer's code as an intern. 

Here is what the login did: there was a drop down menu with a list of institutions the user could use to login. Once the user selected a result, some JavaScript would amend the 'href' attribute of the submit button to redirect to that specific institution's login page. 

When the dev gave me the ticket, he said he thought it might be broken because of the 'indexOf' function being used on IE. I was immediately suspicious about why that function was needed in the first place for this task. 

I was not prepared for the code I was about to see. 

It turns out the way the dev was associating the correct links with the drop-down items was like this:

`&lt;li&gt;institutionName &lt;p style=""display:none""&gt;LINKHERE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;`

So when the dev wanted to retrieve the value of the link, he retrieved the entire HTML string of the element, used indexOf to find the location of the link, then used substring functions to get the value...

I honestly felt a bit bad about how judgmental I was feeling. I was just thinking that nobody that truly knows JavaScript and html could ever write something like that. 

My solution was to strip out the paragraphs from the list items, and give each one a custom html attribute of `institutionLink=""link""` , so I could strip all of his code and do it with one line simply by checking the value of this attribute.. 

What do you guys think?"

I've wanted a relationship more than anything my whole life. had two but both were unhealthy and both lasted less two months. I'm 24 and I have no idea how to be in a long-term or healthy relationship. Like what do I do when she gets upset or has a problem I need to help her with? I can barely deal with my own shit half the time.

Worst of all I think sex kind of changes me as a person. Like when I'm getting laid consistently it turns me into a cocky piece of shit. happened once in my 2nd unhealthy relationship and I basically managed to ruin my whole social life for 9 months cuz I was such an overconfident douche. second time in my life I was getting laid consistently I was just hooking up with this girl and I think I was able to balance the confidence with cockiness. I think the confidence boost helped me land a super prestigious internship (although I built up a pretty good resume at this point.) After getting laid for 3 months consistently and landing an internship towards my dream I turned into a cocky piece of shit. There were alot of factors leading up to this other than overconfidence but basically I almost got fired, because of rippling events resulting from me pursuing a chick I worked with. (very hard to explain but basically I was a fucking idiot and dint do well and only cared about social success and wanting to fuck this chick.)

It makes me wonder: just what would I be capable of if I didn't spend so much energy into relationships and getting laid? I probably would see alot more success in my life.

I think what I really need half the time is sex and a therapist and I'd be much better off than in a relationship. I wish I could just afford a legal prostitute and straighten myself out and not fall in love with every girl I meet that is nice to me. I hate feeling like I have to prove myself every female I want to fuck. I hate sitting around and wondering if shes just nice or actually into me. I hate agonizing over whether I should once again pursue a girl from work or just let this one go in favor of me wanting career success (but then again what if shes the ""one""). I hate how basically every almost every romantic pursuit in my life is either a one night stand or ends with me emotionally broken, over a chick I barely knew. I hate feeling like I have to go out drinking to ""put myself out there"" I rarely turn the opportunity to go out with friends, because ""what if this is the night, what if this is the night you get laid? what if this is the night you meet the one?""

Worst of all is I know I'm crazy for thinking this way. I know im depressed and not exactly mentally healthy. I know ""I need to work on myself and love myself before I can expect a relationship."" but so many of these people who preach this are pieces of shit themselves but just so happen be able to get relationships. theyre either attractive or lucky enough to have found their match already.

Basically my life for the last has either been:

going full workaholic and burying myself I work and insane hours, working my ass off to distract myself from being depressed

hitting the gym a lot and getting a healthy life balance - probably the best option but the hardest to manage (and my current situation doesn't allow for a lot of gym time.)

Or just going on like an alcoholic and getting hammered 4-5 times a week and relishing the chance to get as fucked up as possible for a night. I've pretty much drank 2+ time a week for the last 5 years."

I expect to graduate with at least a 3.0 or better, and I'm on track to ace my classes this current semester. However, I still have bad grades on my transcript from earlier semesters before the life changing medication. How do I explain this to interviewers curious about my low GPA?

Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

My kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, breeding/impregnation. Other kinks can be brought up in your PM.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

Riley Reed

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you.

(I must specify that any roleplay done with other individuals does not promote violence or hatred towards women. I am also only interested in roleplaying with 18+ individuals only.)"
ak7hoq,1,2019-01-26,T4F - Sarah Korhonen: A Monster in Waiting,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ak7hoq/t4f_sarah_korhonen_a_monster_in_waiting/,"It is 8PM in the evening, and Sarah Korhonen is doing dishes. There is nothing particularly sinister about this act: Sarah has simply finished a plate of lasagna, and is cleaning up after having put away her leftovers. Nothing terribly unusual, although she ate the meal alone, which one could think of as being a little sad.

Sarah is not particularly unattractive. At the age of 39 - rapidly approaching 40 - her curves have filled out nicely, and only the odd wrinkle has started to show around her eyes. In four years’ time, she will have her first grey hair, but for now it is a dark shade of auburn that contrasts nicely with her pale blue eyes. Her skin - once again, largely bereft of wrinkles - is a delightful shade of light pink, a product of her Finnish ancestry. 

Genetics have also bestowed upon her a reasonably large pair of breasts, but - superficially speaking - her best features occur below the waist. Her ass is round, soft and full, and perfectly complemented by a pair of exceptionally wide hips; “child-birthing” hips, if you will. Indeed, it’s these two locations, along with her thick thighs, that almost all of her body fat settles, which is not to say that she’s *fat*, by any means. “Delightfully plump” might be more apt.

All of that said, it is unlikely that Ms. Korhonen will be putting those “child-birthing” hips to their titular application. This is for a short, but rather critical list of reasons. The first is that, for all intensive purposes, Sarah is not attracted to men. Indeed, Sarah has dedicated an unworldly amount of her time fantasizing about the various women in her life. Coworkers. Retail employees. Neighbours. Strangers. Even - and this in particular she would adamantly deny - some of her younger relatives. So, to phrase it with some degree of vulgarity: Sarah Korhonen has pussy on the brain.

The second reason is, well, rather anatomical. Sarah wasn’t born like most girls. For the most part, she developed like any other woman: she hit puberty at the proper time, her curves developed exceptionally, her voice became musical in tone, if somewhat husky in timbre. All in all, she appeared to be a perfectly normal middle-aged woman. The only exception was the presence of a 9-inch phallus in place of a clitoris and a pair of egg-sized testicles in place of ovaries.

Just how different would Ms Korhonen’s life have been had her parents been a touch more… *accepting* of her gender? As a child she learned that under no circumstance was her penis to be mentioned, within or outside of the house. There were no sleepovers for little Sarah, and in fact there would be no spending time with her friends *at all* outside of school hours. Instead, Sarah read books, listened to music and learned to cook.

Although she was allowed more freedom as she grew older and more “responsible”, Sarah lived in that repressive household until the age of twenty-four, when she went to college to obtain a degree in Business Management. Still, despite her escape, the damage was done. Anything approaching a romantic - or, God forbid, *sexual* - interaction would send waves of anxiety through the poor woman, sinking any and all potential relationships before they had a chance to set sail.

And now, at the age of thirty-nine - almost forty - Sarah Korhonen lives alone in a very nice, very *quaint* two-bedroom house in the suburbs. She uses the second bedroom as a home office.

That is not to say that her life has been completely chaste and sterile; Sarah’s sexuality has not been destroyed, it has merely been dormant. For one, she’s become an expert at both manual masturbation and the creation and use of improvised sex toys. More importantly, though, is that she has done far more depraved things than most people have dreamed of. Whips and chains, gags and plugs, ropes and corsets, boots and heels, leashes and collars, leather and latex… These are the things Ms. Korhonen thinks of when her hands dip beneath the sheets.

Still, solitary perversion is not her only area of expertise. Sarah has become quite good at cooking and baking. She has a recipe for chocolate-espresso macaroons that are to *die* for, and she’s the type of person who always brings some to share. Most people agree that she’s a bit of a sweetheart, a *total softie*, really, and now that she’s in middle management she does her best to keep everyone’s lives as stress-free as possible. Truly, she likes it when people are happy.

Which is where you come in. *Why is Sarah Korhonen single?*, you wonder. She’s attractive, kind-hearted, intelligent and friendly. Exactly the kind of person you’ve been looking for in a partner - or a fling.

What could possibly go wrong?

You’ll have your answer in a few months’ time, when you’re bound and gagged, whip marks criss-crossing your back while loud, *angry* grunts echo from behind you. There is an unbearably thick cock burrowed deep inside your pussy, threatening to shoot a hot, creamy wad of white semen directly against your cervix. This could happen at any time; SHE has been edging inside of you for *hours*. Of course, there’s no risk of pregnancy: birth control drugs have been slipped into your meals every day since you came to live here.

And besides, at this moment, pregnancy is the least of your worries. Right now, a rubber-clad *fist* - HER fist - is pressing roughly against your lubricated anus. It’s not the first time this has happened, and it certainly won’t be the last.

When that time comes, perhaps Sarah will feel bad about what she’s done to you. After all, she’s not heartless by any means. But she’s spent far too many years holding back, and now that you’ve opened the floodgates, there’s no way in Hell she’ll let them close.

But right now, Sarah Korhonen is doing the dishes.

---

How do you know Ms. Korhonen?

- *The Intern*: You’re new to the company, and you quickly come to appreciate Sarah’s hands-on approach to employee management. She keeps you well-informed on what needs to be done and how to do it, keeps you in the loop on all pertinent information, and insists that if ever you need help or advice, her door is always open. After all, she was the new girl once, and you want to succeed. You know office romance is frowned upon by upper management, but asking her out on a date wouldn’t be *too* scandalous, after all she’s done to help you...

- *The Neighbor Girl*: Ms. Korhonen had been a fixture of the suburb for several years before your family arrived, and was the first to welcome you all to the neighbourhood - with a fantastic fruit arrangement and pastry tray in tow, of course. Soon enough, she and your mother were fast friends, and not long after that you began doing chores around the kindly-natured woman’s house. You certainly couldn’t complain: the pay was exceptional for the kind of menial labor involved, and you never felt so well-fed as you did heading home after a post-lawnmowing ‘snack’ with Sarah. Perhaps - no, almost certainly - because of the hormones running through your adolescent mind - you began to fantasize about the smoking-hot older woman, and soon you began to devise plans to seduce her...

- *The Waitress*: Honestly, you never thought you’d be working at the restaurant long enough to have a favorite customer, but when it came to Sarah, you always knew you would have a pleasant shift. For one, her tips were always exceptional - sometimes going as high as 50%! She would always give it a hand-wave: “Oh, where else am I going to spend it? Besides, you always do *such* a good job…”. Whenever it was a slow shift, you found yourself sitting across from her, chatting sometimes for hours between customers. Talking was always *easy* with her, and sometimes you got the impression that she was a bit lonely. What the hell, maybe it’s about time the two of you eat somewhere *else* for a change...

- *Someone Else:* Surprise me!

---

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I’ll be playing a sweet, almost motherly, middle-aged, Mal Malloy-shaped futa with one hell of a dark side just waiting to come out. I’d like for the story to start out very lovey-dovey and warm in tone, then gradually have things escalate to an almost nightmarish story of kink gone mad.*

*Despite the 3rd-person perspective of the prompt, I prefer doing the actual RP in 1st person.*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.*

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, fisting, dubious consent, impregnation (late-game only), cumplay, sex toys, sweat, spanking, whipping, facesitting, humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are bestiality, blood, vomit (unless plot-relevant), scat and watersports.*

*I hope to hear back from you soon!*

Among the two coworkers and I, I am the only person with a master degree (coworker A has a bachelor degree, coworker B is an intern and will be getting his bachelor degree in the summer, he will start his full time job here and the company has promised him 40k to start with), I am also the only female, the only non-white person, the only immigrant.Earlier this week, I told my employer that I have to move my last day up because I feel uncomfortable that I am being treated unfairly. He was furious about it , he also showed me his pay stub back in 2008 to imply that I am being too greedy.The last conversation with my employer was frustrating. My employer didn't give me any explanation regarding why I am being treated unfairly, yet he blames my early quitting has screwed up his working plan and schedule. I don't deserve this. Given my salary and other facts, is it possible to file a discrimination? How should I put it? Thanks.

ak856j,2,2019-01-26,[M4A] Fucking The New Interns,Enjoyablepartridge,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ak856j/m4a_fucking_the_new_interns/,"This prompt worked really well for me once already, so I'll try something similar. 26 year old male, about 6 foot, with an athletic build. 

When I started this job, I was the low man on the totem pole. Right out of college, I pretty much had to do all the work that no one else wanted to do. Working in a small office, this usually meant mailing letters, filing documents, and planning parties. This was all in addition to my daily tasks, meaning I often stayed late. It wasn't unusual for me to finally leave the office around 9pm. I always had to turn off the lights, and lock up. My social life took a hit, but I was fine with it.

Time went by, and I got into the rhythm of these late nights. I'd been working there for about 6 months, when a batch of undergraduate interns got hired on. I was understandably excited, especially because I wouldn't have to do the busy work I'd been doing. Little did I know, one of the interns was a HOT piece of ass. I couldn't help myself: I had to have them.

Looking for a slight dub-con RP, with either a man or a woman. I don't really care which, just be willing to get bent over in a semi public place, and fucked. Kinks are rough sex, slight dub-con, creampies, sissies, and dirty talk.

Limits are age (all players must be 18+), incest, gore, scat, waterplay, snuff.

Let me know if you want to RP this!"
ak8nt8,3,2019-01-26,Question About Grades And Future (Please Advice?),SuperDramaLlama69,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ak8nt8/question_about_grades_and_future_please_advice/,"By the end of summer 2019, I'll be graduating with 150 credits, and the ability to take the CPA exam. Over the last several years, I've been working in the wedding industry. For the last 1.5 years, I've been trying to get an internship, but unusually enough, every internship seems unwilling to take me because I do not have accounting experience. It's a strange, glitch in the Matrix style cycle, where I need accounting experience to get an internship, but I can't seem to get an internship without accounting experience. 

Graduation is approaching rather soon, and I'm pretty worried about being able to join the work force, considering internships haven't been very receptive to my applications. I have a 3.2 GPA (is that decent?).

I've thought a lot about what I can do to change this. I'd prefer a career in internal audit, but at this point, I'd be willing to do anything except heavy tax to have a job in the industry and get some accounting experience on the resume. There are a few certificates and certifications I could get, but I'm really not sure how useful they'd be. Should I get a...

-Microsoft Excel Specialist (MOS) certification
-Quickbooks Certification

Or should I just throw out some serious cash (a few thousand is serious right now) and jump for the CIA or CPA now?

All of these things require quite a bit of cash, which is something that's not in plentiful supply. The Microsoft Excel and Quickbooks certifications would be a bit cheaper, at a few hundred dollars each. CIA and CPA would be thousands, and take at least 12 months each probably.

Do you have any advice about how my time before graduation (about 6 months) could be used most effectively to break into an accounting job upon graduation or soon after? Thanks in advance for any advice!"

I am a Coq user (Coq'er?) with a bit of experience and I'm currently looking for an internship for this coming summer. I wonder if there are internships that (1) involve Coq, theorem proving, or formal methods and (2) do not require me to already be a PhD student. It doesn't have to be a research internship, and in fact I'd prefer a position in industry (for experience and, well, pay).

I'm willing to relocate, Europe/East Asia/North America preferred but I will consider other locations (particularly Australia) too."
ak958w,9,2019-01-27,I'm taking action damnit,adventurema,Trichsters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trichsters/comments/ak958w/im_taking_action_damnit/,"Looked in the mirror after I got out of the shower this evening.

It's been a busy year this last year. I had an engineering internship over the summer, and last quarter I spent a lot of time at school... This quarter I have another internship and I'm finishing up at school. My poor eyebrows haven't had a break because I am triggered whenever I'm working on calculations at a desk, ESPECIALLY when I'm thinking hard about something... Which is often!

Anyways, I looked in the mirror and I have NO left eyebrow anymore. Not even a shadow of one. The right one has like 5 hairs left. I've always been scared that they're going to disappear... And now they're actually gone. I completely rely on eyebrow makeup now, which SUCKS, and on top of that I feel like my classmates have noticed me pulling.

I am frustrated. I feel like no matter how much energy I put into trying to not pull, it's always going to be with me. As I begin my engineering career, I wish I didn't have to be so caught up in this. It just knocks my confidence down (and I am usually a very confident person).

So I got dressed, went to the store, and bought NAC and a CBD tea. When I got home I ordered a Keen bracelet on Amazon. That's $200 I just spent on this crap. This is my last push for a while though. If I can't fix it now, I'm just going to not have eyebrows.

Any engineers out there with trich? Any helpful tips I'm missing? How do you work in an office all day and not pull? I'm new to this group and I need a bit of a push to help me try and get rid of this. Thanks for listening."

Looking through the window at the busy city street with tears in my eyes.,Space-funeral66,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ak9h9q/im_1700_miles_away_from_home_in_a_small_studio/,"Not really looking for any advice or anything, but comment what you want.

I fell in love with a girl back in August. God she’s beautiful. We’ve been hooking up and hanging out ever since. 

I recently moved away, far far away for a job. She said she’s gonna miss me. She said how different I am from the other guys. How sweet, and caring I am. 

I was hopeful that I would come back to her, since I would only be gone a few months. 

But just got off the phone with her today. I opened up to her because she was being distant. I told her everyday how I missed her. She stopped saying it so I mentioned it.

She told me how she doesn’t want to be too attached to me. I told her I would do anything for her and would give her the entire world if she wanted. And she said “I know you would”, and I’m sorry but I have to let you know what we are. And she assured, what I kinda already knew. Just a casual fling.

I knew she got out of a 3 year relationship before we met. But would hope after 6 months she would change her mind. 

I asked is it possible in the future?

She told me maybe, but she doesn’t want anything serious thing with ANYONE for a few more years.. we’re both 22. 

I told her I’m not gonna try and change her mind .. I probably didn’t help tho. I told her how perfect she is and how I would never ask her to change anything about herself. I would never ask her to do anything she didn’t want to do. 

But I kept my composure and didn’t let her knew how upset I actually am.

She knows me, she knows I mean everything I say. She just doesn’t want to be committed to anyone. 

I told her she’s worth the wait, and I would drop any girl to be with her. And I mean it..

This is the second time we had this sort of conversation. And we cut ties for about a month. Then we found each other again.

She said it’s fine if we continue what we have. I know she feels something for me. Or she would have dropped me months ago.

It just sucks ya know? Everything before I left was going pretty good, not perfect but better than expected. 

So here I am, furthest away from home I’ve ever been. Working an amazing internship at my favorite company in the world doing my dream job. But I’m looking out my window to the busy city street, with thousands of happy people sharing laughs and living their life, and I’m crying. I’m realizing my hope to go back to her with arms wide open is not gonna happen. I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again. 

But maybe I will, maybe when she wants a relationship the timing will be perfect. Maybe that day will come.  I have a strange feeling it will, idk it’s hard to explain.. But maybe I’m only thinking what I want to think. 

Whatever the case maybe, I’m entirely broken at the moment. I’m a grown man crying. I’ve been heartbroken before. Shit sucks.  But for some reason being all alone in a city far away is comforting. I can go to work, and just focus on myself for a bit. Maybe distract myself with some other girls in the meantime, I’m not too bad looking.

But it’s only 10pm here, and I’m in a weed legal state. So I’m gonna roll up a joint and sit on park bench outside my window and get high. 

To the future whatever it may hold. I just hope she’s in it.

ak9vhe,12,2019-01-27,First time with a cock ring!,stopthemadness2015,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/ak9vhe/first_time_with_a_cock_ring/,"Earlier this week I was attending to my Tindr account, busily swiping to the left and to the right and I got a match from a cute Chinese guy. I’m 6’4” with a mid level muscular look and I’m 55. This Chinese dude was about 5’10” and wearing glasses with the classic Chinese look. He was a twink and 25. 

We begin a convo during the week and I was in the mood for a date so I asked him out for coffee at a local coffee place near his home. We agreed upon a date a time, which was today. 

Anxious, I drive 35 miles to meet him. I walk into the coffee shop and he’s saved me a seat. We talk for well over an hour. He’d just been offered a major internship for one of the biggest IT corporations, he’s been all over the world. His parents are both physicians in China and are card carrying Commies! We laughed, we flirted but most of all we enjoyed each other’s company.

I asked him if he wants to visit my home and he was eager. We start the long drive to my house where we talk more and laugh more. Meanwhile, I began to put my hand on his leg and he says he likes that. He stated that he’s got a hard on and has one since he first saw me. He thought I wasn’t into him. Lol.

I begin to grab his cock thru his khaki pants and could feel the hardness and I could feel his balls moving. He was enjoying teasing.  The ride seemed long we were feeling each other up for the 30 min drive. He was moaning when I caressed his ass thru his pants. I knew this boy was a bottom.

I got him thru the door and we began kissing and using our tongues so heavily. Then he asked if he could shower. So I said only if I could join you. He smiled and said, “of course.”

We get into the shower and I see his mid size cock and begin to caress it with lathered soap. I even ran my finger down into his ass crack and oh he began to moan. I barely touched it but I knew this was going to be a treat. We begin to rub each other all over feeling each other’s cocks and i lathered up my now hard cock rubbing it up against his ass. I thrusted my cock to his ass, my cock my throbbing to cum so I back off. I wanted to take my time. I began to suck on his cock with water pouring all around us. Finally, we decided to move ourselves to my bed.

We dry each other off and as I did I noticed how beautiful his skin was and how soft it was to the touch. I lay him down and I begin my tongue surveillance. I’m running my tongue up and down his nut sack and easily taking his uncut cock into my mouth. He begins to moan loudly. I suck on his nipples and he’s grabbing me by the head because he’s enjoying it. 

I pull him closer and I start to play with his hole, oh that hole was so tight. I wet my finger and I gently push it into his hole and Omigod he moans and begs me to go deeper. He’s now begging me to move my finger around. He’s gotten me so hard that he begins to blow me and while he is bobbing up and down I’m pushing my finger and feeling his prostate. He’s moaning and begging for more and then I explode into  mess which pleases him. 

He begins to masturbate really hard and fast shooting a stream of cum so hard it hits his chin and sprays all over his body. I could smell his cum all over and it was intoxicating.

Well when we were done we go to the living room, he was putting his pants on when I told him I wasn’t done with him. He smiles and takes them back off. We sit at the couch where we kiss, lick and rub each other in a very passionate moment. I licked and sucked his nipples and had him hard again.

I feel getting hard so I went to get my cock ring and put it on, it was the first time I’d used it. My cock was throbbing but the moment I put the ring on my cock went into overdrive! Oh my god! He saw my full cock  and dived into sucking it. He sucked it and had to stop for a second because it was so big for him. But I grabbed his head and I began to thrust my cock into his throat and with an amazing feeling I orgasmed with me moaning loudly. 

He looks up at me and asks if I was really 55 and tells me that he just had the best gay sex ever. It made my day and now we’ve exchanged numbers and we will be having more fun. Can’t wait to fuck that tight ass."

ive applied to so many places, hoping that something would stick at some point and someone would want me. ive applied to anything from paid to unpaid internships, any location within the US, small to large companies. literally everything relevant that i felt qualified for

getting through the first step hasn't been too hard for me. over last semester and winter break, I've reached interview rounds for a handful of places. phone, video, in-person.

but that's where things go bad for me. verbal communication has always been a struggle, and i constantly ""script"" what i say and how i move. once they start asking behavioral or anecdotal questions, i stumble terribly

but ive worked so hard at it. I've spent hours upon hours making a huge document of all sorts of questions that may be asked and what my response would be. and all the little life-examples I might reference, I've also worded ways to tell those

but even with all the possible questions i can find, there's still always things i can't expect or prepare for. plus its hard to memorize all the scripts I've formulated

i keep getting rejected from every place ive interviewed with and I know that it's because i have a hard time verbally selling myself. written communication is fine for me though; i have no problem expressing myself and explaining things though writing.

im starting to feel hopeless. i don't know what to do. it doesn't matter how capable i am if no one wants to hire me. im trying my absolute hardest, every last ounce of effort I have but im still struggling.

im continuing to apply to places but im starting to lose hope. anyone have a similar experience and somehow made it through? please tell me how you got through it all."

So my mom is a person that I can only describe as annoying and coward. I'm gonna tell two stories about her  that made me think this way
.

1) I was 16. My best friend at the time was gonna throw a pyjama party (idk if its the right term sorry) for me. So i was VERY excited. The conversation was something like this:
 Me: can i go to (friends name) house?
 Mom: no. I dont like her 
 Me : oh, please mom! She's gonna throw a pyjama party for me!
 Mom: i said no
.
So little me, heartbroken said to my friend that i couldn't go. The weekend of the party come and my mom says:
.
 -Mom: are you ready to the party? 
 -Me:???????????? You said i couldn't go!
 -Mom: i never said that. You need to listen what other people say.
 -Me: you said i couldn't go!!!!
 -Mom: (annoyed and being sarcastic) YES. iam the bad mother who didnt let you go to your best friends house. You didnt listen to me and now you lost your chance to go! (My friend had invited someone else).

I was pissed at this. And then i realize that she do this all the time. She'd say something, when i confronted her, she's denied saying that or she'd be dramatic and says something like ""yes of course. I did this because i wanna to cause you trouble. I am a horrible person yes"".
.

2) everything NEEDS to be about her. So i was talking with my grandparents about my interview on a internship of a big company in my country (very big, big opportunity). I was talking that i was excited and my mom cuts my conversation and says:
.
 -Mom: oh yes, when i did the interview on this company, they were pretty difficult to please! I was one of the last candidates and (famous reporter of this channel) was my competitor!
 -Me: excuse me, mom. I was talking about-
 -Mom: (very loudly)  SHHHHHHHHHHHH. I'm talking

And then she talked for 20 min about the 30+ year old interview. She always does this ""shh"" very loudly and rude, cutting everyone's conversation so SHE can talk.

I've been calling her bullshit for years, saying that she's rude for doing this, for not being true with her words and lying to make us doubt ourselves (she do that to me and my brother). My brother says i should stop because its no use and i end up being The angry ungrateful daughter, but her actions piss me off so much. I still haven't stopped, but am i the asshole to call her out? What do you guys think?

I hope you are all well. I was hoping to find a hot older sugar daddy to take me out on nice dates and holidays abroad all in exchange for my tight teen body. I will play as a college girl who has an expensive lifestyle but no money at all.

You can play as a hot older man with a big wallet, a big sex drive and an even bigger dick. Come on guys what older man does want a horny teen sucking and fucking his big cock, telling him how great he is.

I can be one of your daughter's best mates, a student, an intern, a neighbor, a college girl in a bar or maybe on a beach (love a nude beach), tbh any ideas I'm up for it x

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

I have a huge girl crush on Dani Mathers, Sam Blacky, Tammy Hebrow, basically any hot blonde so would love to play as them!

I am doing a research internship under the guidance of my professor. In this I am supposed to mainly work on something related to parallelising some important algorithm.

**I was suggested by my guide to parallelise FFT on a Xeon Phi Vector Processor or a cluster of Xeon Phi Processors**.

For this, the first task is to formulate a well defined problem. As in why some algorithm is slow and how can we solve the problem. (Think Memory Bottlenecks or something)

My experience:

* I know and have worked on *OpenMP/MPI*
* Parallelised basic algorithms like Matrix Multiplication, Image Convolution etc.

But nothing comes to my mind when i have to think in a  research project within the HPC topic. I carried out a literature search of the most recent problems in parallelising FFT. But most of the work has already been done in this area.

Maybe  some of you with a lot more of experience than me can guide me finding a  topic.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** I am doing a research internship in HPC. The goal is to take an important algorithm and parallelise it using Xeon Phi . I took FFT. What are the recent unsolved problems in parallelising FFT that I can try my hands on?

She was an intern in my office and after talking couple of weeks we started dating in July of last year, after 3 weeks her internship was over and she went back to her college.

For 3 months things were so good and everything was going great. Then things started to shift a little. Our conversations started to become shorter and shorter. Meanwhile her exams started and due to that we were not talking that much and meeting was almost to null at that time.

Her exams have ended and she is free but now our relationship has lost it's intimacy (from her side , I still crave for it), and also the attention is also lost from her side, she doesn't seem/feel excited about me. There is no intimacy from her side whenever we talk.

I talked to her about it and she said she doesn't feel the same for me but she still loves me.

And all of this makes me miserable, I feel frustrated. I know this sounds very stupid but I don't feel wanted and loved, and I want this from her. I feel like I want to talk to her whenever is possible, I think about her a lot of times, sometimes even I am out with my friends, I know this is a problem and I want to fix it as soon as possible, I WANT TO SAVE THIS RELATION

After making the transition I am so happy right now",Wino_403,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/akcy1m/after_ten_busy_seasons_i_went_private_i_wasnt/,"I worked at a 50 person public accounting firm and rose up to senior manager over a ten year period, including a one year internship. I had discussions about being partner and making the big bucks. 

After my second child came along I made the decision to go private. I was struggling in my current role and I just couldn’t deal with the stress. It was a rationalization that I’ll defer my well being and family situation for a super comfortable retirement in 35 years. With a three and one year old, I was missing their early childhood, both from physically not being around and emotionally from all the stress.

The move wasn’t without difficulty. I was being passed over controller positions for people who had been in private already for five years. The first headhunter I met with just totally seemed uninterested. I was probably asking for too much money, I didn’t want to take a pay cut, and actually I was looking for about $8k more in the process. It took months and I was getting to November with no job lined up and the prospects of facing another busy season. In fairness I turned down a few opportunities early on, I didn’t want to trade one bad situation for another.

And I am so happy right now. I landed at a financial institution as an internal controls manager. The job is a perfect fit for my background. With bonus potential and super generous benefits it was a 31% raise compared to my old job. There’s room for upward advancement (at least since a ton of people I work with has a VP attached to their name). 

The one thing is that I’ll truly miss all my coworkers I essentially grew up with. Myself included, we all started out as college kid interns and become managers and above over time.

If you’ve been in public accounting for a long time like I was and see the career choice as a compromise, the change can be made. Public accounting works for some people and can be a fulfilling and rewarding career, it stopped for me. I’m not advocating that public accounting is a hole, some of it was probably firm issues. But if a move is the right thing for you, don’t let time in public accounting be the reason you don’t move."

Especially watching this season and how aimless it feels. 

With Jackson going through Catherine's cancer now and his newfound faith, I think April would have been brilliant to have around. Not only is she the mother of his child, but she was his best friend, but she was a great character. I really feel like she deserved much better. If she had to leave, they shouldn't have made it, ""Oh, look! Matthew's back and ready to marry her again! Don't mind his dead wife, alright?"". 

Vernoff said she had no more story left to tell for her, which I feel is a massive cop out. I feel there was plenty more of April to be seen. But instead they give us recycled plot points. I get in such a long running show that's bound to happen, but did we really need Teddy/Owen/Amelia drama part 37? Did we really need Link and Nico to show up with their cardboard box personalities? Although I will say Nico seems to have had a good effect of Schmidtt. Do we really need to see Meredith in a love triangle... Again!? 

Just some throw around ideas that I think could've been better.
1. Keep April. Would've been nice to have her around for Jackson, plus that could have been the turning point to rekindle that, because their chemistry was wasted. 

2. Have Owen stay with Teddy in Germany when he left. Would have been a good time for him to exit and he would have exited with fans knowing he was off to get all he'd ever wanted.

3. Instead of bringing in new characters, open up the storylines for the new interns. Make them appealing in the way Lexie and friends were. Don't just have them be comic relief. 

4. Sue me, but Koracic would have been a good match up for Meredith. They could have bonded over mutual trauma and the fact they're both amazing surgeons. Plus his natural charisma on screen is just fun to watch and watching his humor bounce off Meredith's stony demeanor and eventually break through her 3000 walls of dark and twisty to the point where she falls for someone she could really be with, would have been cool. 

5. Have Amelia still meet Betty somehow and keep that part of her arc the same, just don't rest Amelia's character on a guy. Caterina is a really good actress and Amelia has been through a lot and deserves to be shown that she can stand on her own. 

I do love Grey's Anatomy, it's been my favourite show for years, but I really dislike Vernoff's writing."
akdl6r,1,2019-01-27,Marketing in Finance help and advice - London,Verenajack16,u_Verenajack16,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Verenajack16/comments/akdl6r/marketing_in_finance_help_and_advice_london/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Wondering if any of you could offer me some advice, tips or anything on the below dilemma I am currently facing in my career.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

&amp;#x200B;

I studied marketing at university, 4 years. I obtained a BA honours in it. I particularly was interested in CRM, how consumers behave, advertising and branding, all things that are subconsciously influencing our consumers.

I ran a small company at university selling bath bombs over Christmas period, I know its a small project but the organisation of events, marketing material, and managing the 26 students gave me a great buzz and I felt a sense of achievement when we won out universities competition.

Post university I received a internship in London, which was sadly not what I had hoped it would be. I was doing little work and often felt bored, under valued and of course was on a really low salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I am from Glasgow, so I decided to move back up north to try find a job maybe as a marketing assistant at an agency or company. With the market being so small there, I was unsuccessful and I landed a job working at one of the (Morgan Stanley, Barclays) banks in their operations team. I worked here for 2 years and the salary for my age was good, I was able to live a comfortable life.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I was 25, I decided I wanted to move back to London to work within finance as I knew how easy it would be to get a job there. I was landed a job in an operations department in one of Europes top hedge funds, I was earning around 40K which was about 10-15K more than I would be if I was working in marketing as a junior and I am currently still here.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel valued in my job and I am now 27, starting to miss the enjoyment I did get out of marketing and the passion I once had for it.

&amp;#x200B;

This year I have decided that ops in finance is not for me and I am wanting to try and combine the knowledge I have gained in finance with marketing.

My question to you all is - is this really possible??? is there any types of experiences you may have had working in marketing in the financial services?? do you have any recommendations on where to search for these types of roles? Is the pay in financial marketing better than that in agency/in house work within other industries??Any tips you may have I would really appreciate as I am struggling to find out where to even begin to find these types of roles in London

&amp;#x200B;

It would be great to know your thoughts and suggestions - its not all about money to me, however, I can't shy away from the fact I have spent 4 years nearly in finance and to start completely new in marketing I would have to take about a 15k play cut, which I know I could do, but would be reluctant.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know"

However, I have heard that DCP is NOT a good way to climb the ranks at Disney. Does anyone have any insight in this area? Thanks."
akeb0i,1,2019-01-27,"Nope, still hate being trans after 5 years of transitioning - still can't accept it [CW: transphobia, throwing a tantrum]",S0OO700aswwoep,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/akeb0i/nope_still_hate_being_trans_after_5_years_of/,"Hi!

Sorry for not posting more often, sorry fo not being more active. CW = content and cringe warning.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25, 26 soon. Being trans is something that I'm very sure of, I knew since childhood and \[...\] started in early 2014. Came out in late 2014, lost all my half-assed friends, it went horrible, then suddenly my parents accepted me, were even proud of me. I socially transitioned in late 2014, shortly before graduating but in another city; specially moved there to start transition and do my last semester. Peers made fun of me but the guys shut up when they saw me at the graduation party (I kinda passed till I turned 16 and then after a few months of HRT in 2013/2014 again) and reacted quiet differently.

Whatever.

It's 2019 now. I'm almost at 5 years of finally easying my dysphoria, starting transition. I passed right away, had some short relationships, an orchi (no SRS yet), relationship to my family including siblings is great, I have my own flat in a major city (but tbh I moved out at 16) - but still, I hate being trans. I don't even like the concept of being trans, I don't even know what to call it overall, how to name it correctly. 

I quit my job in early 2018, visited some clinics again (first in 2016) for suicide memes and am currently in job-training, looking for interesting jobs in my field. 

Yes, transition helped and helped with dysphoria but still, the amount of 'internalized transphobia' is super high. I'm chatting with 7 other trans friends every single day, but have no local friends anymore. I isolated myself completely and currently have no job, although I'm in job training, looking for internships. I got diagnosed with BPD, reoccuring depression, three (!) forms of postraumatic stress disorders, GAD, some organic problems with my metabolic system, the list goes on... in 2016 and earlier.

Yes, I got bullied at my first job and during my thesis in this new city and it nearly drove me to suicide and it may made me more depressed and hate myself even more, but when will it stop? Besides the legal changes with therapist visits for the judge, I just recently started seeing a therapist. I visit a psychiatrist every now and then since 2015 for antidepressants and mood-stabilizers and am on lots of drugs but still, my mood swings, my self-hate, my low-selfesteem are still bad. Genital dysphoria is something I only experience when seeing it, even though the orchi helped a lot.  Ok, GD is kinda bad, sometimes very bad, but there are worse things going on. Sadly, I don't have the money for SRS and the SRS covered by insurance is horrible and in the clinic the orchi had been done, it was a terrible experience.

I visited age-appropriate lgbt and t-clubs for 20-30 year olds, made friends, visited self-help groups but it's only ever about  how the process goes. I have barely met anyone passing and was afraid of being clocked when I walked arround with nice but really bad passing people. Transphobia, yes I know, I'm sorry! I feel like an idiot that I, as someone who is trans myself, has such problems with it. I don't like reading about it (even though good news make me happy) due to it being mostly misinformation, I don't like being confronted by it (oxymoron) and I don't like talking about transitioning-problems (oxymoron2) and I just have enough. It won't ever stop and it didn't get any better at all. Lots of things changed for the better but I still can't accept myself. Others? yes. Myself? no. Is it stupid and is it my BPD? Most likely. I should mention that it's the type that doesn't make me throw tantrums or rage or make others feel bad - it's more about being super sensitive and depressed. I'm not a monster, please believe me :( at least I hope I'm not a monster...

Lots of information is missing, but this is due to my somewhat complicated (medical) history and this text is already long enough.

Basically, what can I do? I'm annoyed with myself, it's a daily struggle and then there are symptoms of a dozend mental illnesses aswell, doing their job to ruin even the small joys of life. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you have or had a great weekend."
akg275,9,2019-01-27,I need help choosing my 20th therapist,clarion5,TalkTherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/akg275/i_need_help_choosing_my_20th_therapist/,"I sat down today and counted all of the therapists I’ve seen since high school and I was shocked when the number was 19. I’m in my late 20s. I am currently working with a therapist who is an intern at a university training clinic and she will leave in August. I like working with students at the university training clinic because I feel like they try harder (e.g. giving me homework and actually remembering to review it, remembering what we discussed during the previous session, showing me a treatment plan with goals etc.). That perception that they try harder may be inaccurate but I have no way of knowing. I also like that they are closer to my age. However, the students/trainees at the clinic only stay for one year before I have to switch to a new person.





I’m wondering if I should consider seeing a therapist through my insurance instead so I can potentially work with someone long term. How do I find a therapist that is a good fit? What factors should I consider when choosing a new therapist? The main issues that I need help with are treatment resistant major depression, social anxiety, chronic suicidal ideation/intent, low self-esteem, and executive function problems (possibly ADHD). I am also miserable at my current job and have family issues (I live with emotionally abusive/controlling parents and two mentally ill siblings who become violent/dangerous when they experience psychosis).  I’ve also tried DBT therapy groups, other types of group therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, EMDR, and 12 medications.




I feel like part of the reason I have not made progress despite being in therapy for over 10 years is the fact that I have had to change therapists so frequently. Nearly every therapist I’ve worked with claims that they do CBT but that means nothing. Some of those therapists did CBT by the book and others just gave me life advice every session.




The frustrating thing about having to change therapists so often is that each new therapist wants to approach the goals in an entirely new way. One therapist wanted to focus almost exclusively on building social relationships. My next therapist didn’t care about that and said that because of my current state of mind I should avoid trying to form new friendships. One therapist gave me worksheets to challenge negative thoughts as homework and the next therapist focused exclusively on self-care as homework.




I did not have so many therapists on purpose. If anyone is interested, here are the reasons why I had to change therapists so frequently:




- Moving from my hometown to a university hundreds of miles away

- My therapist at the university counseling center becoming seriously ill and nearly dying

- Unknowingly being assigned therapists who were students/interns/residents. I was told at the last minute that they could leave after one year or at any time really.

- The university counseling center limiting me to 10 sessions per year

- Having to return home for every summer term due to lack of financial aid. I have limited social support at home and struggled if I didn’t go to therapy for 3 months.

- Losing the therapist I saw through a government program because I was now employed and no longer qualified for services. She did not take insurance.

- Working with a therapist through my insurance for a year and realizing that we had no therapeutic alliance and I had not made progress.






I would appreciate any advice. I'm sick of living with these illnesses every day and making no progress despite seeking treatment. I often feel like suicide would have been a much cheaper and effective solution. "
akgu19,683,2019-01-27,"No, I´m actually not responsible for you after the club is over",valerianfox,IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/akgu19/no_im_actually_not_responsible_for_you_after_the/,"I think this story fits the subreddit, but if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me. Also, English is not my first language, so pardon me.

I was an intern last fall, working for an organization that organizes all kinds of clubs and events for kids. Big part of my job was to keep the local clubs running. Usually they got local teens to run these things, but lately less and less people have been interested in that, so we had to take care of it. No problem, I have experience with clubs. 

  
These kids, however, were mostly little demons. It varied from club to club, but I can't remember the last time I've seen kids who behave that badly. Thankfully I wasn't alone, I had a partner with me at all times, but wow, I can still hear them screaming and shouting. They were probably somewhere around 6-11 years old, but they were already swearing and stuff like that. It wasn't all terrible, sometimes they actually behaved, but it was a tough four months.  


The first form of IDWHL comes from the fact that the kids didn't exactly realize what an ""intern"" was. I had multiple conversations, couple of times with the same kid, that went pretty much like this.  


KID: You can't tell me what to do/what I can't do/how to behave! I'm going to complain to your boss and you won't get paid.   
ME: Ah, but there's a small problem with that. I already don't get paid. I'm an intern.

KID: What? What does that even mean?

And I would explain what it meant and that I wouldn't be replacing my partner, who had been running the clubs all by herself for the last year. A couple of them would, every now and then, threaten to call my boss and complain about me, but obviously they never did anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

The second incident, which this post is named after, has really stuck with me for some reason. We were legally responsible for the kids for the 1,5 hours the club lasted, and the kids knew that. But after the club had ended, we usually walked them to the nearest buss stop, and that would take them home. That was outside of our time, we didn't really have to watch them after the club had ended, but we did anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

It was November, it was snowing, the roads were covered in ice. The eight-year-olds in the group thought it would be a funny idea to start running across the street and back. They discussed it silently so that I wouldn't hear it, and suddenly one of them just sprinted across the street, even though a car had just passed. I think I had a mini heart attack, and they were laughing as the kid sprinted back.

  
ME: Hey, I wouldn't do that if I were you. I really don't think you want to get run over by a car.  
KID: Well, it doesn't matter! You're responsible for us, so it's your fault if something happens to me!  


Really now? The kid had THE SMUGGEST smile I've ever seen on a person, he honestly thought he'd trapped me in some sort of way. That smile still haunts my dreams to this day, just imagine the smuggest smile you can think of... and multiply that by 3.  


ME: Oh, is that so?   
KID: Yup! If anything happens to me, you're going to be the one in trouble!   
ME: Well, that is indeed interesting... Seeing as my responsibility over you ended as soon as you stepped out of that building.  


His smile wavered a little, but he kept on going.  


KID: No, you're responsible. I'm at your club, so it's your job to make sure that nothing happens to me. That's how the rules go.  
ME: That's where you're wrong, buddy. The club ended ten minutes ago. I don't even have to be here right now, but we (my work partner and I) just want to make sure that you make it to the buss. Because we're nice. If a car runs over you, it's not going to be nice, but we're not legally responsible for that.  


The smile disappeared. He seemed to have a really hard time understanding my words, but hey, he wasn't running to the traffic anymore.  


As demonic as the kids could be, I still really loved my internship at that place. It took me a few long months, but the kids really started to grow on me, even though they pulled stunts like this. Even the ""let me just run into the traffic"" kid was actually super smart and nice when his friends weren't there to encourage him to do stupid stuff. Still, I could rant about everything that happened for a good five hours straight."
akhnh8,6,2019-01-27,Puddle Jumping (Chapter 1) [Fiction],AmazingLover96,DrCreepensVault,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/akhnh8/puddle_jumping_chapter_1_fiction/,"Have you ever wanted to be someone else? The answer to that is probably yes. Everyone has wanted to be someone else at one point in their lives. In high school you wanted to be the popular kid. At work you wanted to be your manager or C.E.O? What if I told you that you could do that for real? Yes, it sounds crazy but it is true. I am living proof of it. My name is Eric Chase. No that is not my real name, but it is the name I’m using for myself. I won’t be using any real names of people in this story. I don’t need any of you wanting to play detective and try to track me down. This all started on July 4th, I was at a party that was full of drugs, booze, sex and loud music. I was pumped full of ecstasy, alcohol, coke, I was completely fucked up. I danced the night away like I was in a music video, feeling more invincible than a mustached plumber.

Out of nowhere, an extremely hot and thick blonde girl came up  and started grinding on me. She looked young, probably about nineteen or twenty years old. She wore a pair of short booty shorts that half of her ass hung out of, not to mention they were unbuttoned and I could see that she wasn't wearing anything under them. Nothing but a red bandanna covered her tits and I was totally okay with that. I was feeling awesome, despite the fact that it was hotter than a cast iron skillet in the Gobi Desert. I had one hand on the waist of a hot chick and I was draining a forty ounce bottle of Colt 45 into my gullet. The girl stopped grinding on me and snatched my bottle out of my hand and began kissing me. I put my hands on her hips, she dropped the bottle and wrapped her arms around my neck. I held her close and we kissed passionately like long time lovers. 

We made out in a corner, running our hands up and down each others bodies. My eyes nearly flew out of my sockets when she grabbed my crotch and squeezed a little. My heart raced even more than it already was, I felt myself getting hard as I looked at the mysterious beauty. The sparkle in her ocean blue eyes and the evil in her smile, just screamed for me to sex this angel up.

I wanted her and she wanted me. Before I knew it, I was following her upstairs and down the hall. We went into the last room on the right which was the master bedroom. We began ripping each others clothes off before we could even close the door. We threw our naked bodies onto the king sized bed, I buried my face into her neck with my kisses and I could tell this was turning her on even more. I could feel her heart race as I gripped her breasts.  When I put it, in she gasped and next thing I know we were going at it like rabbits. At about twenty minutes into it, she got on top of me and she started riding me like a mechanical bull. Her titties bounced like basket balls and she was screaming with pleasure. I grabbed them as she continued to ride me. My body exploded with pleasure as I felt myself climax inside of her.

She got off of me and rested her head on my chest. That was when I realized that I wasn’t wearing a condom. I was too drunk and high  to worry about any diseases so I just cuddled with my new found girl for a few minutes. Next thing I knew another couple scrambled into the room. As they took their clothes off, my vision began to blur and I blacked out. When I woke up, the sun was beaming into the room and my head pounded like a drum solo. I raised up and I noticed that the room was full of people. It was absolutely wild, everyone including myself was naked. Used condoms were all over the place and needles and various other drugs were scattered all over the room.

I felt a breeze run across my body, I reached for the blanket but I noticed that it was not on the bed. Around me was a group of passed out girls, to my right was a chubby brunette with two other girls laying on her stomach and to my right was a redhead that was covered in chocolate syrup and whipped cream. I got out of bed and found my clothes next to the passed out body of the blonde girl from last night. She was laying on her stomach with a guys face planted in her ass. After I got dressed, I stepped over the naked bodies and left the room. Down the hall even more people were passed out. I saw guys with dicks drawn on their faces and people with beer spilled on them. When I made it to the stairs, I found the host of the party wearing nothing but a green G-String and clutching a bottle of champagne in both arms.

Compared to last night, the house was quiet despite a few people snoring. I took advantage of this and began scavenging for drugs. In case you hadn’t caught on I’m a bit of a junkie. I have been doing drugs since I was sixteen. I’m not the stereotypical drug addict. I don’t steal from my loved ones. I don’t trade my body for drugs and I don’t look like I do drugs either. I look like your average American white guy. If you saw me walking down the street you’d think I was a hipster that works at a Starbucks. The reason I do drugs is because I hate my life and want to escape it. I’m twenty-six years old and I’m up to my eyes in student debt. I’m in an internship but it barely pays anything.

So that is why I have my second job, which is selling heroin. That is how I pay all of my bills and have some disposable income as well. I’m the guy to go to if you want the good stuff and I make it myself. I inherited the recipe from my brother. I say inherited because my brother was shot to death during a deal that went bad. The thing about this kind of work is that a lot of your regulars will be the stereotypical addicts that you see on T.V. Old, dried up junkies doing anything for their next fix. Those people are fucking crazy and they are always trying to get more dope than what they can pay for. After I gathered as many drugs as I could fit in my pockets I began searching for loose cell phones. I grabbed five, just enough to where nobody would get suspicious.

As I was driving home, I hoped to god that I wouldn’t get stopped by a cop. The last thing I needed was to go to prison on drug charges. I already did enough time in the pen for assault and battery, I knew if I got caught with over a grand worth of drugs on me I would get some serious time. Luckily, I got back to my house without that happening. When I walked in my house I found my roommate making breakfast in the kitchen.

“Rough night last night?” He asked.

“Is it really that obvious Rodger?” I laughed.

“You look like Hell bro. Sit down and let me make you a plate.” A few minutes later Rodger and I sat down at the kitchen table with our omelettes, english muffins.

“How was your night?” I asked.

“Pretty laid back. Me and my girlfriend went to church and then to the bowling alley.”

“You need to loosen up man,” I said. “Your out of your parents house now. You don’t have to go to your parents church all the time or worry about childish crap.”

“It just feels wrong,” he whined.

“You’ve been a sheltered church boy all your life. Don’t you want to have some crazy stories to tell your kids and grandchildren down the road?”

He gave me an uneasy look.

“Think about bro,” I told him.

I finished the rest of my omelet and I made my way to my bedroom. I told Rodger he could have the rest of my english muffin. I needed more time to rest since my head was still throbbing. I closed the door to my room and I unloaded my new stash from my pockets. I had five sandwich bags of cocaine, I also had two bags of weed and L.S.D. However my attention was on the mysterious bags of red chewable tablets. I could tell they were chewables because I used to take antacid tablets for acid reflux in high school. I had three bags of these and there were ten in each bag. I was feeling lucky but a little bit leery about this drug. I had no idea what it was but I knew there was only one way to find out.

I popped one tablet into my mouth and chewed it up. It tasted really good, it tasted like fresh strawberry yogurt. Similar to those yogurt burst cheerios they used to make. Before I laid down, I put my stash in my brothers old safe and locked it. I crawled into bed and I waited for the drug to kick in. I started to feel relaxed, the only way I could describe it is when you watch an ASMR video and you feel light and sleepy. I got scared when I began to sink into my bed, I flung my arms around as I plummeted into a red void. It reminded me of that scene in the movie Get Out when Chris falls into the void when he is hypnotized by Roses mother.

I knew was going into a bad trip and all I need to do was relax. I had to tell myself that none of this was real and I couldn’t do anything stupid and get myself in trouble. So I let myself float in the red void, it must’ve been about five minutes before I blacked out. When I woke up, my vision was blurred and I was very tired and groggy. Suddenly a loud beeping noise filled the room I was in, it was an alarm clock but that was weird. I use my phone’s alarm clock, I haven’t used a real alarm clock in years. I looked to my left and started feeling around it for the off button. I turned it off and went back to sleep.

“Playing hooky today dad?” a voice said.

I jolted up and I was met with the face of a teenage girl in pink Disney Princess Pajamas. She looked about fourteen years old and had brown hair and green eyes.

“Dad?” I croaked in a tired voice. “What are you talking about? I’m not your Dad.” My voice was deeper and I sounded a lot older than I was.

The girl giggled, thinking what I said was a joke.

“John called looking for you,” the girl said. “I told him you weren't feeling well but he was okay with you staying home. Your lucky to have a boss like him.”

Suddenly, my body started tingling. My head started feeling like it was vibrating. Pain shot through my body. I howled in pain as I closed my eyes really tight. I began to have visions of what looked like various memories. I saw myself proposing to a woman. I saw myself in the hospital with that same woman who was now holding a baby in her arms. More visions flooded my brain until I finally came back to reality. Stuff about this man’s divorce and remarriage. I realized that I was a different person, I was a man named Bob Jones. I lived in Los Angeles California and I was incharge of payroll at Fifth Third Bank. I had a wife named Rachel and two kids named Ellen and David. I also had a dog named Oscar. 

I was forty-two years old and I was two years into my second marriage. When I snapped out of it, I had full knowledge of this other person. I felt like me but I also felt like someone else at the same time.

I got up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I was a middle aged man with salt and pepper hair. I had green eyes and a five o’clock shadow. This couldn’t be real, there is no way I switched bodies with another person. This was some Freaky Friday type shit. I went from a twenty-six year old junkie to a family man in a white suburban neighborhood. However, I knew my situation was everything but a dream. I froze, I can’t tell you how much time passed as I gazed at my new self in the bathroom mirror. 

I was really another person, but how? I just popped a tablet into my mouth, it wasn’t something I hadn’t done ten-million times. I considered that this could just be a very vivid hallucination, but I knew that wasn’t true. Before I could continue to process my situation the girl started knocking on the bathroom door.

“Dad are you okay?” she asked with concern in her voice.

“I’m fine, I’m just having stomach problems,” I replied obviously lying.

“Can I get you anything?” she offered.

“No. I’m good.”

I heard the girl walk away from the door. I quickly splashed some cold water on my face in hopes of waking myself up from this, but it didn’t work. I realized I needed to calm down, I put the lid down on the toilet and I sat there and began to think. I was a well off man who was an accountant at a well known bank. I lived in L.A which meant there was a lot too see. I had the opportunity to see what it’s like to be someone else, but for how long? Would I eventually turn back into me? Would I stay like this forever? I knew I couldn’t worry about that right now. So I got up and left the bathroom I was going to see how I could use my situation to my advantage.

I went back to the bedroom and began going through his clothes. His closet was full of suits and ties and fancy coats. Fancy wasn’t my style, so I looked through the mans drawers. I found your basics, jeans, T- shirts, socks and underwear. I put on a pair of jeans and a Pink Floyd shirt. I then heard the sound of a phone vibrating. I looked behind me and found an Iphone going off. The caller I.D read, Unknown but I answered it anyway.

“Hello,” I answered.

“Hello, Eric or should I say Bob?”

“Who is this?”

“Just call me Anthony. I’m here to give you a little bit of an orientation to this new poison you just put in your system.”

I knew by the tone of his voice that was not really his name but I just went with it. He sounded like he was in his late teens and really needed to knock his ego down a few pegs.

“The drug is named K3 565. It is a drug that puts your consciousness in the body of someone else. There are some ground rules for your safety.”

1. You can’t take more than one pill at a time
2. You never know who you will end up as.
3. Don’t die as another person.
4. You only change into other people who took the drug.
5. You can only be the other person for twenty-four hours.

“You are free to do as you please as the other person and learn as much as possible, but just remember there are consequences for your actions.”

akhspr,4,2019-01-27,Anybody heard of “Southwest family of companies”?,katthekickass,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/akhspr/anybody_heard_of_southwest_family_of_companies/,"Well, my spidey-senses are tingling.

I’m a first-year college student, and a few months back there were a few people on campus - looked like students - asking people to fill out surveys for them. I did, because why not?

And now I just got a call from them and I think they’re part of an MLM. The guy on the phone wanted to “confirm some information” I had provided (like my GPA, major, ...). And then asked if I’d be interested in an internship opportunity over the summer. Of course I said yes, because experience, especially so early on, would be fantastic.

I figured, since he was confirming my major, he was with a group that would be aligned with that area of work (I’m studying criminal justice, and he even asked what I want to do with that - I told him the next step is law school). So he launches into this mini spiel about how he works with a group committed to helping college students, and how they have a summer internship open to students of all majors that pays $8,000 for the summer and provides great experience and so on.

At this point I’m a little bummed, since it doesn’t sound like what I want at all. But if it pays that much it could still be pretty great - my current plan for the summer is to go back to retail,  and I’ll probably only make $5,000 over the entire summer there.

He says they have informational sessions in the upcoming days, and lists out a few dates and times and asks if I would be interested in attending any.

But then it started to get a little weird - he wanted me to confirm to a date and time, and once I did he asked if I would consider myself responsible or reliable, because they don’t invite many students and he wants to make sure I’ll actually show up. But right after he said that, he said some students invite their friends to come, and that it’s totally okay if I bring a few people.

He didn’t mention the company name either, so at the end I asked him who he said he was with. And he said (at least I think he said) the “southwest family of companies”. I’ve been doing some googling and come across “southwestern family of companies”, which includes Southwestern Advantage. Don’t know which particular company he’s supposed to be with though.

Needless to say, I doubt this is a real opportunity at all, though I’d love to know what you guys think. Could this actually be legit? And if not, then what should I do? I said I’d go to a meeting on Wednesday, but obviously I don’t want to waste my valuable study/free time on what looks like, at the very least, a scam. Any advice on how to proceed?"

What does that mean? I’m studying the hottest points in IOT including rapid prototyping (3D printing, laser cutting, CAD, Arduino), data analysis (machine learning with Python), hardware design (PCB layouts, sensor integration, analyzing equipment), real time operating systems (Linux, ARM), embedded systems, robotics, and electronics. 

I have applied to about 75 positions with 6 first round interviews and 1 second round interview (although all 6 said they would call again) these seem like normal numbers to me but I can’t help but think I’d have better results if I was talking to the right companies. 

My thought is that the large companies know they need IOT to follow the trend but their teams and recruiters are still learning what they’re looking for. Startups are too small to support an intern. 

Any advice on where to look/want to network?

TLDR; studying everything needed to develop the internet of things. Need an internship but not able to find proper companies to apply to. I need advice. "

I had two male mentors/supervisors for these positions. When I left the position, I received text messages asking if I could go out for a drink (both), and making sexual comments (Government internship). I am a very nice person so I kept the conversation going, trying to keep the relationship going (I would try to steer the convo away from that). However, I got sick of it and decided to not reply back to either of them. 

Well the time is here where I need a letter of recommendation and I have no one. The professor I worked with for three years never comes through when I need her. I DM'd the marketing department guy, and he did reply back to my first message but not the second. I am desperate as I've run out of options. These were the only three people that knew me the most.

I gained a full-scholarship there and gained a full-scholarship in high school too. Although, I have grown to be OK with rich people, in high school, I deeply resented almost all of my classmates as I felt that it was unjust the circumstances I grew up in (living with family in one bed room apt, subletting,  being food insecure, and even cleaning offices/houses with my mom on weekends). It was so frustrating that all my classmates lived in mansions and enjoyed things such as vacation abroad, personal training, SAT tutoring, and luxury cars. I felt that in high school, people could tell that I was poor because I am a brown person. That is not a necessarily true assumption. It's just in my head, I thought people could tell just by looking at me that I did not belong in that school. Of course, though, I managed to take the most advanced classes and even hold some leadership positions. However, I always thought that I could never be true friends with my classmates because they would not accept me for being poor. My mom even discouraged me to go over to my classmates house in HS for fear they would come over to my house and then ostracize me. I wanted to hang out and make friends but all the time they'd blow like $200 on shopping,. Honeslty, I didn't have that. I felt terrible.  I did become self-conscious and alone. Always, I tried so hard in school because I thought people assumed I couldn't do it. I always felt like an imposter. I had nightmares very very often and would wake up at like 4 or 5 AM to edit group presentations just so i wouldn't let other people down. 

In college, it's a lot better since people can't come over and what not and are somewhat more mature. But, now that I am an upperclassman, I feel an immense pressure to go into IB/Finance. I received some Bulge Bracket firm interviews and even made it to final round, but didn't get the summer internship. I felt like I was a failure to my family and to myself and to the expectations of my colleagues in college. I don't know what to do anymore. I sometimes feel that IB/finance is meant for the rich and that they ovviously have an upper hand while I have to fight to get myself a position. Even stupid jocks get jobs just b/c of alumni connections. It's just discouraging ......

When I started this job, I was the low man on the totem pole. Right out of college, I pretty much had to do all the work that no one else wanted to do. Working in a small office, this usually meant mailing letters, filing documents, and planning parties. This was all in addition to my daily tasks, meaning I often stayed late. It wasn't unusual for me to finally leave the office around 9pm. I always had to turn off the lights, and lock up. My social life took a hit, but I was fine with it.

Time went by, and I got into the rhythm of these late nights. I'd been working there for about 6 months, when a batch of undergraduate interns got hired on. I was understandably excited, especially because I wouldn't have to do the busy work I'd been doing. Little did I know, one of the interns was a HOT piece of ass. I couldn't help myself: I had to have them.

**PROMPT**
___

:Prompt 1:

In this prompt your lead character will be my uncle, the loving caring uncle. The one who is friendly yet the one who doesn't have a strike on his name. However that's how you showcase yourself to everyone within family until I came along. The first girl in family, all my cousins and siblings before me were boys. I was the first one in our family to be born as a girl. Things changed as I came into the group, I had to play with the boys, however everyone treated me with care and respect.
 But things changed as years passed, specially when I turned the age of __ (Your choice) my brothers and cousins started acting weird, as they'd leave me all of a sudden and sometimes they'd act annoyed or worse too caring. So did my uncles and grandpa. Where as my mom was buying me baggy clothes where as my uncles gifted me skirts and sundresses. And Today I'm going to celebrate my __ birthday, as almost everyone showed up to the family event. The day focus on your lead character breaking the ice, as my mom gets an urgent business call for the week she puts you in charge to take care of me and the rest of the family members, including my birthday party. 

You are gifted with her credit card with the freedom to use and purchase anything you may find suiting for the day and for my gift. And this is where you decide to make some changes, as you'll start with my birthday outfit, since mom is out of the picture you decide to buy me something she won't perhaps it's not too slutty yet. You'll be the one to buy the cakes and other gifts from dad, grandpa, brothers and cousins. Perhaps you'd even plan a game for me to play with the whole family with a penalty or punishment. Perhaps you even sabotaged the game to make me loose.

You may take things with different approach, as you can provide and corrupt each of the other family member with either a dose of Viagra spiked on their drinks to make them have the urge to be done with, and even giving each of them a pre-boxed gift, as I open it each will be humiliating from the other.

:Prompt 2:

In this scene you will be focusing and playing as my loving dad. I want you to be a normal dad without any dirty or perverted mindset yet. I want you to control the other characters who may corrupt your mind set. I'm looking for a slow burn in this one where you are indeed married and she is live and well. As you'll have me and perhaps a son too. This could take place in many forms, as we are in a good dad-daughter terms, I'm not bratty or someone who brags about anything. As things kicks off at the wrong time. 

You work for a fairly decent company, with a strict boss and co-workers. As one day your office planned to host a party, as it's the first party they are inviting you to go for. However there is a catch you are given to entry passes where you can either bring your wife,or your daughter along with your son. Unfortunately your wife , my mom got sick for a couple of days and you decided to bring me along with you and my brother. 

This is set a scene where you will have to get me a decent party wear to dress in where your son would wear something matching your style. But things aren't how I expected it to be, as we arrive at the entrance of the location, we'll be going through a series of scanners and metal detectors. As you'll notice onto the left it'll be a open search station for the guys but onto the right it'll be something similar for the girls too.

But just as you two pass through you'll be stopped by  the guards as they frisk your jackets and pockets, but as I pass through you'd notice two male guards stopping me from proceeding further as they slowly asks me to keep my hands raised or apart while groping me in public in ways to make your blood boil in anger. This would set a humiliating point for me as you may decide how the frisk goes for me. But nothing too extreme.

And once we are inside you'll be welcomed with love and respect by almost everyone, as they'd show the same care towards me and my brother. However you maybe given a gift by your boss before they engage in some sort of party games involving me as their main target, as you'd also notice that most of the other staffs came with their sons or along. leaving me as the only female other than the maids and waitresses.

:Prompt 3:

What could go wrong while you work as an Air Hostess? The fancy suit and the elegant look? The classic make-up with a fancy cabin crew? At-least that's what I thought when I started my intern ship as an Air Hostess trainee for a young age. But things went to ways I couldn't even imagine as my decent costume and salary was more than enough. But just as the flight took off, my supervisor who boarded the flight to evaluate my performance took me aside as he gave me a different outfit to wear for my duty. As he made me do things that revealed parts of me to other customers and even to my own flight crew.

It didn't stop there as I was called into the cabin along with the Air Marshall when one of their regular customer made a complaint about missing his expensive wrist watch, as I was forced to under go a frisk search infront of him. Or perhaps I was told to spoon feed the pilots as they were having their focus on me? 

But things took an unexpected turn when few of the passengers revealed to be some sort of bad people wanting to make use of me and force others to use me?


:Prompt 4:

The wardens daughter, Life was always joyful for me. As my dad being a officer and being in an active prison was something I was proud to brag about to my friends and family. And yes he was indeed a respectful man who took control of one of the strongest prison on earth. As he took care of all prisoners based on how evil and nice they were. He made sure that no one could escape these walls without him trying to stop them.

However me on the other hand, I was able to go through each and every entrances. Almost every guards knew my face as they knew who I was. It felt as if I was more trusted around these walls after you my dad. But one recent visit changed my life. As you were having a new prisoner being transported in, one of the baddest and brutal suspect. He looked evil, and stronger than you ever where. He wasn't alone, as his followers were already a part of your prison. Or maybe even one or two of your co-workers.

The sky was bright and the wind was cold but the day didn't feel that lively as I walked down the guarded hallways while you were on the other side of the prion helping everyone with transporting the new intake. As I strolled down the hallway one of the hallway door was left open in an unusual manner, which raised my curiosity to divert my stroll to that specific hallway with prison doors on one side. As I walk past each prisoner, could it be possible that I make a friend? or foe? Or perhaps someone snatches my teddy bear? Or do I see something I should see? I'm not looking for a straight up free-use or rape. I am looking for something slow burn, slow tease and manipulation. Corrupting my mind. Or even involving my own dad and his guards.

**:Prompt 5: NEW**

In this prompt I will RP as a mom and daughter, With main focus towards the daughter. As we are driving on our road-trip down the highway with fields and open landscape on either side of the road. As the road was rather empty with another large truck driving next to us. Our car wasn't the best as it usually had trouble starting or even running the A/C as I almost laid on the rear passenger seat with my window down I didn't realize that I was being watched over by someone driving by, As I slowly opened my eyes in mid dream, I did see those predatory eyes glaring at me, or somewhere down on my body. I wasn't sure, was my skirt being raised by the wind? Or was it something else I couldn't never find out as I quickly dozed off seeing the truck speed faster leaving us alone for miles ahead.

And just as the sun started to settle,we drove out of a gas station filled with truckers and bikers but as we went past a quite long distance our car quickly began to make some sort of rumbling nose, before the engine started to smoke , My mom panicked as she pulled over the car as I  continued to sleep while hugging my teddy bear. That's when the familiar truck drove past and quickly pulled over. As a fairly old main, fat chubby and rather unattractive walked out with a  friendly smile to my mom as he offered his help. How could this lead to? Will he offer a drop off for the lost family? Will he take advantage of the daughter behind her moms back? 
I do have ideas for this prompt. such as watersport and stuff.

**:Prompt 6: NEW**

Aren't priests supposed to guide you down the right path? Specially a young girl who slowly started to discover the changes happening around her? At-least that's what I was expecting when I kneel down within the confession booth, confessing everything I had in mind. but the way he advice me under gods name wasn't something I thought he would ask. I found myself being guided by my priest from modest young girl to not so modest. i found myself going back even more as he pealed each layer of my soul one after the other turning me into what I feared to be.

**:Prompt 7: NEW**

**I'll add new prompt here soon, Come back JACK! stay tuned**


My previous prompts are still open, feel free to **check my post history** :)

My kinks are : Watersport, Beast, underage, ageplay, old-young, incest, forced incest, corruption, coercion, manipulation, food play, public, exhib, forced lesbian, clothes, outfits, tease, denial, cum play, edging, forced orgasm. etc

**I'm a visual person, so if you are reaching out to me please do include a ref picture for my character. I'll also ask for reference picture for my outfit so that I can set my visual imaginative mind into action and be entertained throughout the roleplay**

**Please don't send shorter PM at first, as if you liked it or wanna make modifications please do mention those, as well as your kinks and limits. Not the link just the few that you can think off would be enough**

akl2p0,1,2019-01-28,Do I (20F) have a crush?,PrettyAkaashi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/akl2p0/do_i_20f_have_a_crush/,"Sorry, I’m sure this kind of question gets asked all the time, but I would definitely appreciate some feedback.

My university has a 3-week period before spring semester called intersession, during which students are free to take extra courses, get an internship, slack off, etc. I chose to stay on campus to take a course and to work at my lab. During this period, one of my suitemate’s friend came over quite often— once every three days or so? It was a little surprising since I hadn’t seen him too much during the semester, but I didn’t mind since he was good company.

At one point, he messaged our group chat to come over to his suite instead. So I did. It was immediately obvious as to why he had come over so often— the suite was dead silent, and the overall atmosphere was quite dreary. I’d planned to stay for 30-45 minutes while finishing my dinner, but I ended up staying for ~10 hours until 4 am. We mostly talked in his room— politics, high school backgrounds, personalities, mutual friends, physics, math, etc. I’m not that closed off in the first place, so I think I opened up a bit.

Coming back that day, I realized that I’d really miss his company. During the semester, we’d both be dead busy— I don’t think either of us would be free until ~9ish every day. He was a constant presence during those past weeks, and it was nice to hang out with him and my suitemates, playing card games and chilling.

In any case, I’m not sure if all that information is necessary. I want to figure out if this is a crush or just a longing for a potential friend. I don’t really have many, partly because I’m reluctant to accept people as friends (i.e. I think of them as acquaintances), so the prospect of losing someone I remotely considered a friend is quite saddening.

Evidence for this being a crush:

- I find myself thinking more about him than other people, such as my parents and suitemates.

- I like talking about him.

- I noticed that my suitemate also likes talking about him, when I’m generally not that observant. I assume this was only possible because I’ve been paying attention.

- I’d like to see him more.

- If there’s an excuse to contact him, it appears that I’m willing to take it.

- I’m not being as straightforward about this topic as I would with other ones, so there must be something tugging at me, right?

Evidence for this not being a crush:

- He’s an Engineering/CompSci student who loves math, and he often goes on these ridiculous “lectures” (not actually lectures, just explanations of concepts) about things he’s learned. It’s rekindled my enthusiasm for those topics, and while it’s far from the sole determinant, his passion has been a factor in me deciding to pursue CompMedicine and AMS minors. I’m immensely grateful to him for this, and I feel that I learn a lot from hearing him speak. So it seems quite natural that I would be disappointed to lose the opportunity to talk with someone this bright.

- He’s good with people, and he changes the group dynamic. It’s not just him that I miss, but also the overall camaraderie I’ve felt from our suite during this period.

- I don’t have a lot of friends, and this sort of interest is what I feel when I start making one. I wouldn’t say it’s the exact same as what I’m feeling now, but this isn’t an entirely new sensation.

- I don’t find myself daydreaming about kisses or anything. Hugs maybe, but nothing beyond that.

- The last time I dated was in middle school, and while there have been infatuations here and there, I haven’t really felt anything for a while. I don’t see why it would start now.

I’ve been thinking more about this than I should have, so I’d like to get it resolved. If it is a crush, I’ll have to decide whether or not I want to act on it. If it isn’t, then I can stop thinking about this entirely and appreciate the casual friendship for what it is. I hate dealing with uncertainty, and this is something I should resolve before the semester gets harder.

TL;DR: I became closer to someone I think I may have a crush on. Strongest argument for it is that I think about him a lot, and the strongest argument against it is that he’s inspiring and good company in general.

Thanks!"
aklbjl,3,2019-01-28,(M4F) Female Celebrity Ideas!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/aklbjl/m4f_female_celebrity_ideas/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

My kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, breeding/impregnation. Other kinks can be brought up in your PM.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Pokimane

Katsuya Moonfox (Craving)

Nonsummerjack (Craving)

Riley Reed

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you.

(I must specify that any roleplay done with other individuals does not promote violence or hatred towards women. I am also only interested in roleplaying with 18+ individuals only.)"
akliwu,2,2019-01-28,Need opinions on freshmen years,WhaleConductor,STEM,https://www.reddit.com/r/STEM/comments/akliwu/need_opinions_on_freshmen_years/,"Repost from other subs, same acc.

So I'm about to finish my exams for my first semester in EE (well, a mixure between EE and Programming) and I'm going to have some month and a half of free time, before I start lectures again. I believe that filling up my CV with relevant internships would be the best long term decision on my part, during this time frame.
Now, in all honesty, I have 0 skills whatsoever, besides in some basic Social Media advertisements. I am most interested in software development, since I got interested in high school (my school made sure we get a very profound beginner's grip in C++), but to say that I have any applicable knowledge on that matter would be a joke.

My plan is to volunteer, or sit my ass and work, completely for free, as longs as it brings at least some sort of experience for the future. 
My questions would be - especially for those with similar experiences - What could a useless freshman like me offer? What should I look for? Should I scrap the plan entirely and just focus on learning to  code, hoping to get some internships in later semesters?

I'm just looking for some advice and some viewpoints, it doesn't have to be concrete answers. Be sure to fucking smack me if you think I'm naive, though.
Thanks in advance!"

akm6vw,4,2019-01-28,College: Not feeling motivated like I was before,blep__,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/akm6vw/college_not_feeling_motivated_like_i_was_before/,"Hey, I’m 19 years old and in my second year of college away from home. For the past five months since the start of the school year in August, I’ve noticed a great decline in my academics and my motivation for doing well in school. My performance throughout the last Fall term was certainly alarming compared to that of my high school years and my first year of college. I received a 2.3 GPA during the term, which is abysmal compared to my average of 3.5. This was not due to the rigour and difficulty of the material, but simply due to my lack of effort in doing homework and studying. Now, I’m afraid that the same will happen in the current Winter term and future terms if I can’t do things differently and change raise my mindset. 

I’m not sure exactly what changed in my life that had degraded me to this state, so I guess I’ll give my accounts from high school up until this point (apologies for the long narrative). 

During high school, I excelled in regards to my academics and was at the top of my class, getting me admitted into a prestigious college and instilling a great feeling of confidence in me. The major I selected was a joint major between math and computer science, and I picked up a minor in math education. I had hopes of working in the tech industry when I graduate and also becoming a math or computer science teacher later on. Throughout my first year here, I studied and lived my life in pursuit of that plan. I still had moments when I was feeling down, but those were not long term and I still found ways to perform well academically. Although I was in an environment where I was no longer at the top of the pack and was being academically and socially challenged, I wasn’t deterred and kept carrying on. My first year ended. I was certainly humbled by college, but I was still confident in my abilities. I spent the first half of summer tutoring high school students in math and attending a summer class. I really loved my job and interacting with the students, and also did well in my class. 
During the second half of the summer after those activities ended, things took a downturn. For this half, I had plans to work on a programming project for fun and to gain relevant experience, to apply for internships at companies, and to review and learn more technical material in preparation for interviews. These endeavors didn’t turn out the way I envisioned. Firstly, the project flopped; halfway through I realized that it was not useful and I was approaching it the wrong way. I lost a fair amount of time and motivation from that, so I didn’t even touch the other two activities mentioned above. I was feeling down, and ill-prepared. I started seriously questioning whether I wanted to keep pursuing my career goals and began drafting plans for a potential switch of major. 
I entered into my second year with this mindset of uncertainty and lessened self-confidence. I was feeling unmotivated throughout the term and was not feeling the drive that I had during the first year. I was not studying for my exams (something I had never done before) and was feeling the lowest I had ever felt in my life. I pulled an excessive amount of all-nighters in attempts to get my work done and was constantly enveloped by stress. I somehow lasted until the end of the term after three months, but this time I was not ecstatic to return home feeling I did a solid job. 
I spent the ensuing winter break doing things I enjoyed and giving another shot at a project, both of which I believe I successfully did to an extent. Though, I was still feeling socially recessive, unfulfilled, hopeless, and unmotivated. I ended the break on this, which brings us to today. 

I am unsure whether my behavior can be attributed to my unfulfilled goals, as being only a sophomore, I am really not that far behind what my peers are doing and am in fact ahead of some. 
A more likely suspect is perhaps my loss of career prospects after so much hard work towards my original goals coming into college? 
I’m just not sure. Normally I could bring myself to study for these subjects (math &amp; CS), but I just can’t now. My prospects for teaching has also suffered; how do I care for students if I can’t even for myself? 

Being in this state really scares me since I’m attending college not only to better my own future, but also those of my parents. They immigrated from Vietnam in the ‘80s and had me here, and neither of them had completed high school. So getting to the stable financial position where we’re at now was certainly not easy. Being the first one in my family to go to college, I want to give back in any way I can. Not even being able to help myself, however, has led me even further down this path of self-destruction and hatred. What makes me even more pissed off at myself is that I’ve been lying to them saying that I’m still doing well in school and am busy with my studies. I also feel even more added pressure from the fact my family and relatives view my brother and cousin with disappointment after their college, in which neither went to a good one or did well. Both are lying around at home now being leeches. 

I’m not sure about my goals for making this post, I just wanted to get my thoughts out. 
Thanks for taking the time to read.

If you're a fan of androgynous boys, feminine boys, traps, girly-bois and everything like that under the sun, then this is definitely the prompt for you! 

Like to top? Sure! Like to bottom? Why not! Like to switch it up, get kinky with it? Absolutely! Do you roleplay in the real world? That's fine! Like to roleplay in more fictitious settings? That's awesome too! 

I'll play with anybody, regardless of gender or sexuality, so just send a message! Below I'll drop my limits, and add some scenario ideas based on genres I find appealing.

Limits: blood, gore, feet, scat, death, watersports, bimboification, torture, and other extremes.

Scenario ideas:

**Fantasy:**

- I'm a diplomat for an Elf race that resides not too far out from your Kingdom. As an offering of peace, they send me to the castle to act as a servant, not realizing you have other plans in mind...

- You're the king or prince of a large kingdom that needs to grow, but can only do so with the marriage of your royalty to another country's royalty. Unfortunately, the biggest nation nearby has only a prince as well, but they're willing to dress him a little different if it means your hand in marriage.

- I'm a simple servant, a peasant that was chosen to go on a divine quest with you, the Chosen One. I mostly carry your stuff and act as a Squire, but this armor you got me recently is a little revealing, don't you think..?

- You've recently risked your life to rescue me, the Elvish Princess, from a dangerous situation. Little do you know that there might be more to me than meets the eye, but I am bound to serve either way.

- You attend a prestigious Wizard and Witch's Academy, finding success and standing out amongst your peers. But there's one Wizard who you haven't been able to keep your eyes off of. A love potion it is...

- As the weakest member of my Orc tribe, I have to do a lot to make sure people don't think I'm so helpless. But when the time comes, I'm no different than the breeding-women we keep back at our campsite...

- I, the Chosen One, am sent to a nearby cave or temple to appease the dragon/monster/god living there. My fate rests in their hands once I arrive...

**Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi:**

- I'm an intense corporate businessman who steps out of line with the local crime lords. They decide to upload my conciounsess into a computer and download it into a more...fitting android body for me.

- You're a hardboiled detective, and after my parents are murdered in a case you decide to take me under your wing. We even disguise me as a girl to get information from some people, but you're noticing more and more how well it fits me...

- You've never visited this club, the newest of it's kind in the Mega-City limits. Dancers, hot tubs, private rooms. But what you find is a very special type of exotic dancer, one that the whole club is filled with, and can take your every desire as a request...

- I'm a spry young intern working at one of the biggest high-tech labs in the country. But I didn't realize volunteering for this kind of experiment would involve so much robotic probing...

- We've been role-playing for a long time in the VirtualNet, using our full-body stimulation suits to basically simulate sex between your avatar, a guy, and my avatar, a girl. But when we decide to meet up in real life, you notice something different about me...

**Post-Apocalyptic:**

- You're a fearsome gang leader, stealing supplies from settlements and small towns trying to scrape by. But the son of one of the townsfolk is willing to do anything if you'll spare his home...

- I'm a wandering drifter, going from town to town. I meet you, and you sell me on a deal that's too good to pass up. Little do I know you're a cheat, and I end up in a place far worse than before.

- We were lovers before the Great War, but the radiation warped my body into becoming slimmer, taking away my female traits and adding a few new male ones.

- I'm an orphan living on the post-Apocalyptic streets of a city that hasn't crumbled yet, just trying to survive, doing anything I can to earn a meal for the next day...

- I'm a lost trader who's been captured by a war gang or group of mutated creatures! I don't know how I'll get out of this one now, hopefully somebody will try to save me...

Modern:

- We're lovers, and have just decided to buy an apartment/house together. Time to make it ours by moving in, decorating, and having sex everywhere.

- A wedding night that neither of us will forget, or perhaps the accompanying Honeymoon to some place far off where we can do as we like.

- I'm a celebrity idol, known for my acting, singing, and uncanny ability to look like the opposite sex. You've won a backstage pass to one of my shows or maybe a VIP ticket to a movie I'm in. Don't worry, I love interacting with fans, especially in costume...

**Misc. Settings:**

- I'm the criminal that everybody knows around these dusty towns, and despite my weak-looking body I'm a crackshot with a revolver. That is, until I run into you, the Sheriff of a small town you vowed to protect...

- On the high seas, treachery and theft should always be expected. But I never expected I'd find myself a prisoner of war, captured from the Royal Navy by pirates as their own form of booty... 

- We're rivals on separate teams, both of which have gone pro and made it to the finals. Now, despite who wins, you know how you'll take your own reward against me. And I'm never going to say no to a passionate locker-room hatefuck.

Established Universes/Rule 34:

- Marvel/DC/Superheroes are all the rage, so let's have some fun and make some heroes, some villains, and a lot of kinky superpowers once either is defeated.

- Star Wars is also quite popular, but this setting is extremely varied, so let's come up with something on the spot and play it out.

- Overwatch is the world's largest peacekeeping Organization! But who knows what will happen when a new member stirs things up?

- As it turns out, U.A. High School got a new super-powered student, and everyone is trying to figure out their real gender...despite being very attracted to them regardless.

- Perhaps you've fallen into your favorite anime/movie, only to find that your character's ""love interest"" may not be entirely...female.

**Other:**

Got a suggestion of your own? Just tell me! And as a side note, if I don't answer you tonight, don't assume you've been ignored or forgotten. I'll answer each and every post as soon as possible, though it may be tomorrow at the latest. Let's have some fun together!"
akml1l,4,2019-01-28,Internship in Peace and Conflicts Resolution,seekingapurpose,IRstudies,https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/akml1l/internship_in_peace_and_conflicts_resolution/,"Hi everyone, 

I have been enrolled in a Master's in Global Studies ([https://www.gsp.uni-freiburg.de/](https://www.gsp.uni-freiburg.de/)). Being in this program has given me the opportunity to study in Germany, South Africa, and India, where I am currently studying. 

Not only am I struggling to find a topic for my thesis, but also for an internship. Despite not having any background in *Peace and Conflicts Resolutions*, that is the one field I feel the most passionate about. I think it has to do with the fact I have lived in Colombia and I have seen how conflict has affected my country. Ideally, I'd like to work in international mediation or conflict resolution.  The master's I am currently enrolled has definitely prepared me for a career in academia or international development, but I think I lack what it takes to be successful in the Conflict resolution field.

I'm currently considering NGOs and International Organizations that work in the field but I am wondering if my background and degree are enough to be considered.

***Background***

*BSc: International Business.*

*MSc: Masters in Global Studies.*

*Spoken languages: Spanish, German and English.*

*Professional experience:* 

*1. Volunteered in Turkey, Egypt, and Serbia with AIESEC International.* 

*2. Volunteered in Austria with an integration project with Syrian refugees.* 

*3. Volunteered at a Federation of NGOs in Colombia with the aim to collect information on projects developed by social organizations during the Colombian conflict.*

&amp;#x200B;

How important it is to have a degree in such field? Any of you who work in the field who can give me some sort of feedback?

I have finished all the courses/exams from my university, but I still need to do an internship of at least 3 months to get my degree in mechanical engineering. I have been delaying this for years now. I could have finished at least 3 or maybe even 4 years earlier, but I procrastinated, staying at home all those years and basically not going outside. I am deeply depressed all the time and have no motivation to do anything anyways so it is a constant struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been taking all my courage to write applications, but I don't know if I will ever be able to actually follow through with it, in case of getting a positive response. I can't even talk on the telephone most of the time when it comes to work related stuff or government stuff etc. I can only do it on a select few days/occasions. On these days, I somehow feel different, and everything seems so easy. But I only have those days a few times a year. Obviously that would be how a normal person would feel every day of his/her life. 

For example, I have done my taxes for the first time this year and the tax agency has been calling me for 3 weeks, apparently they want some more informations etc, but I am simply too scared to call them back. The stress is eating me up inside. I am taking escitalopram but it doesn't really do much for me in this regard. It seems to have helped me in some other ways though.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like I am not able to live this life. Everything is such a nuisance and I can't do anything, I just want to stay in bed all day and avoid people, avoid responsibilites, avoid life."

I want to raise my GPA from a 2.92 and just remain at sbu due to internship reasons. Is there a minor i could take that I could complete over this semester, summar, and next fall semester?

I was looking at a minor in conp sci since I am good with computers/programming, though that may not be the best idea for increasing my GPA.

Graduating uni, getting a job in your favourite company, going on exchange, getting a job and an internship. Im proud of you all.

Dont get me wrong, but I must admit that I feel jealous and left behind. I feel like you guys are on your way to achieve your goals and dreams, while I continue to hate myself.

Also I am always questioning myself, ""are we really all friends?"" Idk why, but I always feel like I'm the final choice and irrelevant in our group. With what happened last time, when we had 3 cars, I was expecting that I'll have at least a person with me during the drive, but fuck no one decided to come with me. This really makes me think how important am I really to you guys. 

All I can say is that I am grateful that I have all met you and even got to spend 5 years with you guys so thanks for all the happy and fun memories we created and share. I truly treasure every single one of them. Just want to say that if anything happens to me, dont blame yourselves, and just keep going forward and continue living your lives.

I know I barely say this, but from the bottom of my heart.

I love you all.

MISSION STATEMENT: 

The Human Bio-Preservation Group (HBPG) is dedicated towards establishing and protecting the rights of humanity. The HBPG was founded and operates under the principle that biomodification will undermine the efficiency of our bodies and result in the illegitimacy or dismissal of personal ownership. Though it may be somewhat helpful, Thinktech is ultimately a global health hazard. 

We are focused on securing protection, legal guidelines, and medical care for those who suffer from SES. 

The HBPG works through public education, legislation, demonstrations, funding, investigations, and, when needed, direct intervention. 

All operations are funded by our members. No amount of financial support will influence us. 

OPERATIONAL TACTICS:

The Human Bio-Preservation Group is not politically sponsored or recognized. We do not cooperate with corporations. We view ourselves as the representatives of original humanity, the soapboxes of the vocally discouraged, and, when necessary, the warriors in the fight to defend your individuality from the intrusive expansion of capitalism. 

But we have even more ambitious goals. Few realize that the presence of non-biological materials in the human body can affect its neurological functions and help businesses with controlling the crowds. To put things into perspective, when the first model of the ThinkTech chip was released, there were twenty protests a month; almost fifty countries took part. Half of the global population has been modified. Today, the number is almost two. 

With the help of liberal news organizations, combined with the efforts of the SES Victims Union, and the co-operation of medical officials, we are close to being able to secure a public inquiry into the illegal actions of Globex. 

OUR VALUES:

CHRTE: Care, Honesty, Responsibility, Teamwork, Education 

The HBPG is the first organization established to fight further expansion of bio-capitalism, no matter the cost. Founded by former Globex employee Rachel Kelly in July 2033, the HBPG embodies the ideology that biotechnology represents the end of human sovereignty. The corporations can control what we want and what we don’t want. It’s up to each and every one of us to resist this gross appropriation of social and scientific progress. 

The HBPG is a nonprofit organization that relies upon the support of both the biotypical and biodivergent communities. With your help, we are committed to spotlighting the mistreatment of those tricked individuals who were left to deal with the consequences of modification while the world turns a blind eye towards the implications of the 2033 accident. 

OUR COMMITMENT:

*“The aftermath of an accident like the one at the school always shifts with public interest. The unaware will act all shocked, recite their prayers, and then move on with their lives. They’ll forget about the reason why innocent lives were lost. But why should we forget? Speaking as someone who was unable to tell her son how much she loved him, all because of some faulty signal, I believe we must never forget that they were responsible for his breakdown, for that psycho’s actions. And that they haven’t apologized.”*

Rachel Kelly [Television Interview, 2033]

SUPPORT US:

Any amount of donation will be appreciated. 

Funding allows us to:
-Actively engage with Congress and influential political officials.
-Provide education on the risks of biomodification. 
-Organize marches and other nonviolent activities to spread awareness of our mission. 


If you want to help, please call our donation hotline at 888-409-5221. 

MEET THE TEAM:

[E/UOM]
*Rachel Kelly*
*Founder*

HBPG founder and activist Rachel Kelly has committed her life to exposing the truth about Globex’s involvement in the incident at the school in 2033. After losing her teenage son and being fired from her position as a secretary, Rachel now leads a team of medical professionals and other biotech victims at the HBPG. 

[E/UOM]
*Carlos Hernandez* 
*Bio-Technician* 

Carlos Hernandez was training in bio-technical studies at Buckley before the school made him rethink his dream of attaining an internship at Globex. Now, Carlos is one of the HBPG’s loudest advocates and our resident expert on redefined technology. He wishes to restrict modification to medical fields. 

[E/UOM]
*William Peebles* 
*Medical Professional*

Formerly a pediatrician who strongly opposed the bio-modification of young children, William is now the HBPG’s chief medical expert. He has toured the city with his lectures about the dangerous effects biotechnology has on fetal development. In addition, his research papers have been circulated by underground publishers. "

Time for a *huge dump*:

* Damian trades dually to Chris for 2 months rent. He says the swap is gonna pay for itself; Chris is gonna make a bunch of money on it and sell the junk on it to pay for the perfect swap and then sell it for like $12K. Now he has more money for the Prelude and the Subie because he wont have to pay rent. For ten weeks. Damian states ""That he talks shit about himself because of us"". He states that with his free months of rent he's going to make some SICC content in February. He closes out the video saying the most ""adult thing he could do"" is trade his vehicle like a fentanyl addict for a few days of shelter. Damian we aren't excited for the future; we're only watching to see who's going to get the channel fail prediction right.
* Imagine being Damian and being so broke that you have to trade a legacy channel vehicle for rent. Then, after making the trade, not even being able to hide like Orion but having to film your shame for $40 bucks. Literally filming your failure for two twenties. Damian, I'll pay you to stop.
* Cleetus's Chow makes so much money he's got his own fleet of cars. Video opens on a CTS-V Cadillac wagon ripping an ignorant burnout. Cut to Cooper saying he just bought the Caddy as his new daily. The Caddy Wagon is almost a total unicorn but is missing the final piece, the Man-Stick. Cooper opted for an automatic. As an auto man myself [editor's note: *ha gay*] I support the decision. 2012, 49k miles Glittery Factory Black with a smattering of high dollar bolt ons good for 620 wheel horsepower. Video goes on with an update on all Cooper's Cars. 320 volt aftermarket alt is going in the OG CTS-V that's looking for 10s, the MK3 Supra is getting a 1000 hp 2J and the Tahoe is moving to back up daily. Cleetus only drops bangers, even his squad rides better than the rest of youtube.
* More Skids elicits a rare Orion Interview. These goofballs must have a few more synapses firing then they let on, because in exchange for use of their Junk 240 for the wheel spacer vid, they got to conduct an indepth Q&amp;A with Mr. Dajnowicz. Rather than asking Onion about Weed and Tinder they delicately get the Master of The Internet to talk about the golden era, drift team haggard and Orion's END GAME. The Vid takes a Dark Turn when O'neil goes all Alex Jones about the fort he wants to build in the woods. He says that he ""hopes he has enough time"" to get everything done and his mom moved over before this whole thing goes tits. up. So after Orion competes in Formula Drift roasting 10 sets of brand new tires an event, wrecking race cars and lighting barrels of cash on fire to chase his dream, he's going to start building a fortress in the wood that can feed ""40 people and his mom"" for a year. Orion that PNW Thunderfuck Weed got you fucked up son, come back down to earth with us.
* Motion Auto TV- The Sand God got mad at his faith, after what was looking like another 40 video series on primer, guide coat and SAND Trevor found himself humbled by the idea of doing a $10,000 dollar paintjob on a rat hood dump Civic. He vowed to shut the fuck up, get down to work and paint this fucking car. He did the B&amp;W meme but later revealed the color, it's Indy Yellow Pearl NSX Color. At first I hated it but it's come to grow on me. Say what you will about this guy he doesn't cut corners.
* Mr . Oakes - 2 Videos, first is exploring Bobby G's and Dj's cave of a shop. DJ's 240 is getting that TUCK in the engine bay. Next vid Jimmy throws some fuel lines on the 1J while the whole gang fucks around on the quarter pipe. DJ takes a legit digger trying to do some skate bizness. The intern Travis shows up and plants some sweet tricks. Jimmy's shop legit feels like a good hang. Do you think Damian plays Jimmy video in the background so he feels like he's a part of the gang? Also who were the homeless randoms in the back of the vid, they came down from Jimmy's loft and they looked like they had been fucc'in and squattin up there.
* Fresh off selling the 135i, Chris ""Ricer Miata"" Rudnik struggles with his inate desire to set money on fire; currently considering importing either a 180SX, Pulsar, or GTR. Chris and Roberto pull apart a spare SR20 in the Rodknock Ranch one car garage. When is Chris moving into his new shop space?
* Cam Currier returns from a one year hiatus, but he left his charger at home. The fiery 302SX is traded for a caged E36, which Cam takes to the UConn Mexico Lot and rips for nostalgia points. Of the Haggard North crew, the guy who stopped making videos seems to be better off.
* Tommy disappears for four days, then returns to announce he is hijacking the 12YO Hater Podcast niche to start his own podcast

Your **12YO Hater Podcast, a week from this Thursday at 6PM EST** song of the day:

* [Reel Big Fish - Where Have You Been?](https://youtu.be/fS6A65AJC80)

Topic: 

* Let's do a thought exercise on Orion. You start making Dumb Money at 17, like dumb dumb money 5 figures a month.  You do giveaways, make videos and buy a trailer. You live in the trailer for a year with an Asian. You don't make videos. Then you start to make videos and every-time they get millions of views. You meme your way into a professional motorsport. You literally never take L's. Life unfolds like a flower before you and showers you with fame and wealth. How does that happen to someone and then they think the world is going to end? Is Orion so self aware that he realizes that if the world is elevating him to an exalted level then something must be fundamentally wrong?

(confidence, self-esteem, growing hobbies)",PuzzleheadedAbroad3,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/akph7g/how_to_be_happy_alone_confidence_selfesteem/,"Hi, I'm a 21 y/o female attending university and have never been in a relationship, haven't been kissed before and have never been someone's crush. I've been happy on my own up until highschool/early university, until everyone around me started getting into relationships. My one bestfriend had 2 boyfriends in the past 3 years, my other best friend (much more conservative than me!) she at least has gone on a date with a mutual friend and was even asked out by one of her school peers (and HER sister just got into a relationship). She recently has been feeling the same loneliness, and since she's on an internship rn, is trying on dating apps (which she is having no luck on). It especially hit home when my own sister got into a serious relationship a few months ago so now I feel kind of isolated and alone since we were really close, but never do much anymore (she's usually with her bf instead). :(

It's hard to be happy alone when your surrounded by relationships (esp with Valentine's coming up). I've never had this be an issue before too, but I have doubts in myself as person. Maybe it's because I am 21 but look like I'm 16 smh (so maybe it's because I don't look like a ""woman"" i.e. flat chest/stick). I literally have no qualities that would make me unique or stand out. My parents were busy providing for me and my siblings so I never grew up learning a sport, musical instrument or did dance lessons so I'm not special there. All I do is study in university. It sucks even more that I haven't made many friends in university, as the program I'm in is VERYY introverted so it's hard to make friends. Lately I've also been self-conscious about how I look, starting to doubt whether it's because I'm ugly or something...idk.


What are ways to be happy alone and stop letting these thoughts get to me? I literally think about this everyday now, and it makes me sad. What types of hobbies could improve me that I could try taking up (low cost?) How can I improve my confidence and self-esteem which I reeeeeeeeallly need to improve on?"

Reinforcement learning is my field of interest and ideally I want to end up working at some place like Deepmind. To take me closer to my goal, I want to for a masters after my undergrad. So I decided to look for summer research internships but most research internships seem to be looking for PhDs.


As a candidate,

My pros:

Have done research projects with two professors and have letters of recommendation from them (one in RL and another in distributed computing &lt;- working on a publication in this one)

Have done various other ML projects including one for a small startup and another winning a corporate competition

Studying in my country's best university (IIT Bombay/India)


Cons:

My major is not computer science, it is mechanical engineering

My major GPA is just 8.3/10 (though my grades in computer science courses are much better)



I was advised to mail professors directly but have only been offered non funded internships that way (I did get one paid offer but it was later rescinded because the professor became too busy).

Given my goals and my current skillset/profile, what do you recommend I do in the summer? Any internships that you think would perfect for a guy like me?"

For background, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia as a teenager. But, I've always dealt with health issues, from infancy on. Some of that stuff is being diagnosed now, and things are making a bit more sense. 

7 years ago, I was working a full time job where I was 3 major oversight units. (When I left, they hired 9 people to do what I was doing.) I had an online private practice. I was supervising interns for their hours toward licensure. I was out on weekends, with my camera, shooting to my heart's delight, letting me sell a bit of my work. And I was finishing my second masters. 

I don't say this to brag. I pushed myself so incredibly hard. 

And now, I'm pretty much bed bound. Over the last 6 years, I've become so incredibly sick. I pretty much only leave the house for medical appointments. 

Lately, I've been reading a lot of things. Part of me wonders if I pushed myself to this point. Another part wonders if I could've done something different, if I stopped pushing, and that's why I'm so sick. Like, would my dysautonomia would be so bad if I could just keep going. Or would my pain level be so bad. 

Logically, I know I didn't cause this, but I find myself blaming myself for being this sick. I keep doing the ""what if"" thing. (This, along with the ""maybe I'm not really as sick as I seem to be"" thought process is great for painsomnia.)

Anyway, if you've read this far, thank you. 

TLDR: 7 years ago I was able to function (and overachieve) even though I heard chronic illness.  Now I'm pretty much housebound and frequently bedridden. And I'm blaming myself. "

Anyways, on TurboTax, it's asking for the ""Adjusted Gross Income"" and ""Tax Paid"". He is being taxed by Oklahoma, so I'm applying for the ""taxes paid to another state"" credit so we aren't double taxed.

I'm a long-time reader, but have never contributed.  I'm at a point in my career where I just don't know what I want anymore.

For background, I have a little over 8 years of experience.  I did a couple of internships and did 2.5 years in state and local tax in public accounting.  I then did a 180 when I realized tax wasnt for me.  For a little over 4 years, I joined a mid-sized firm where I had a ton of success.  After 8 months in a staff accountant role, they promoted me to a special project implementing our software system.  After that project, I was promoted to senior accountant, where I did intercompany, consolidations, foreign currency and a little revenue.  After excelling in that role, I was promoted to senior analyst within our financial reporting and technical accounting group.

That's where my career seems to go a little haywire.  It wasn't a great fit within the financial reporting and technical accounting group, though I did meet their expectations.  After being promised a promotional raise I never received, I looked for new opportunities.  

I was offered a job at a smaller, but growing, company doing revenue, cash and fixed assets work.  I quickly learned the grass wasn't always greener on the other side.  It wasn't a fit and I just wasn't happy there.  Due to a bunch of events, the controller at the company I had left offered me an opportunity as a senior analyst doing accounting responsibilities.  After 8 months at this company, I accepted an offer to go back to my old company.

This leads me to today.  I've been back at my old company for a couple months and just question whether this career path is for me.  Granted, all the companies I've been at have had a ton of change (multiple managers, multiple acquisitions, multiple divestitures, software implementation, and accounting change with asc 606), from talking with others, accounting is just as painful at other companies.  

I'm thinking of a career change, but just don't really know where to start.  

Overall, I'm looking for something more stable.  I'm tired of walking into situations where my manager leaves after a month of me being there, leaving me to fend for myself.  I'm also tired of dealing with acquisitions or divestitures every 6 months.

I enjoy teaching and guiding people.  I had a high school intern I supervised for 3 years at the company I'm currently at.  However, I do not have a Masters degree.

After leaving a company after 8 months and only being back at a company 2 months, I don't want an immediate move.  I have a long stay at one company for over 4 years (which I went back to) and a stay in public over 2 years, so I'm not overly worried of being looked at as a hopper.  However, I want to start thinking of a different career path and the long-term steps needed.

Has anyone transitioned out of corporate accounting to a completely different career field?  What were your first steps and biggest challenges?  What career fields did you research and how did you go about researching them?

Would anyone recommend a different accounting job and potentially a more stable company before making this move?  The work is draining and I have not particularly enjoyed it.  I'm not sure that changes regardless of company, but stability may help.  

Any comments/help is appreciated.  My thoughts are everywhere, so please feel free to fire away with questions if I can clarify anything.

Thanks,

Confused accountant wondering if I'm in quarter life crisis."
akrt9k,7,2019-01-28,Career advice,lkupersht,supplychain,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/akrt9k/career_advice/,"Hello r/supplychain.... This is one of my first posts on reddit so bare with me please ☺ also, I apologize if this is somewhat of a long read  

I've been stalking this subreddid for a few weeks now, and was hoping some of you may be able to offer me some advice.

 I graduated with a degree in Supply Chain Management in Dec. 2017.  I was fortunate enough to land 2 purchasing internships with a major OEM while I was in school; both terms were extended until the end of the year, totaling 1 year experience. Unfortunately, when it came time to graduate there was no headcount so I did not get a full time offer. 

Immediately after graduation, I worked for about 5 months for a small local company doing accounting/Inventory control. This was a mutual agreement between a close family friend of mine and myself that I would come on and help them out for 3 months or so, until I found the job I really wanted so that's why it was so short. 

Currently, I am on a 6-contract with a major automotive supplier as a Jr. Buyer, which will be ending at the end of this week. My contract was due to end at the end of December but it got extended 4 weeks. However, now it's the same situation where there isn't money in the budget nor a position available for me to come on full time.

I've been interviewing a lot and trying to stay positive, but am starting to get a little anxious and discouraged. I have learned rather quickly that my lack of negotiation experience is a really big downfall. My roles in the past have mostly been supporting buyers prepare data for negotiations along with other various ""administrative"" roles. I've started looking into positions that are geared more towards data analysis but many of the roles I've seen offer a pay of $16-18/hr, which is quite a bit  less than what I make now, and what I made  even as an intern. I'm a bit older tha  some of the other ""fresh graduates"" and unfortunately that will not cover my current bills. 

So my question is, does anybody have any tips or advice for me? I am very eager to learn and confident in my ability to produce results. I try to make this known in my interviews, but I still feel like I am doing something wrong as I keep getting rejections. 

I would be happy to send my resume anyone who   would like to take a look at it and offer some advice there. 

I live in the metro Detroit area and am not looking to relocate at the time. 

Thank you!

To get a better overview of Arena &amp; Assault habits (and giving ideas to other players wondering whether they should intensify their efforts or opt for build/team tweaks), here are questions anyone can answer.

    **What is your current situation in Arena (usual tier(s), score/ranking range)?**  
    **How do you aim for your highest affordable score in Arena (units, merges/builds, deathless)?**  
    **What are your main weaknesses/threats &amp; improvements you have in mind for Arena?**  
    **What is your current situation in Assault (usual tier(s), score/ranking range)?**  
    **How do you aim for your highest affordable score in Assault (units, merges/builds, deathless)?**  
    **What are your main weaknesses/threats &amp; improvements you have in mind for Assault?**  

With this, we would have a depiction of various game level profiles, from high-tier players to more casual ones.

I'll start with the basics: I'm a full-time senior getting my bachelor's degree in accounting &amp; I feel like maybe I should change my major based on my internship experience:

1. I've been there for probably 10 months now and feel like I still never do anything right. I'll follow something done one way a year or two ago (like look at the structure of how financial papers are arranged) and it's wrong now. 

2. I'll be told what to to and then it turns out even if I follow x, y, and z, I'll still miss w. I ask questions for clarification but then am told to read the document and make my best judgement.

3. Was supposed to work around 20-24 hours a week, am averaging at about 33 or more.

4. Am told to do fifty things to do one day then it changes the next day. It just feels like I never get to accomplish anything or complete a task and it's difficult to operate this way. 

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the opportunity given to me but it just feels like I'm not succeeding in this role and work keeps piling up. It makes me wonder if I should even continue to pursue my degree because I just feel so horrible on the job. I should include that we had a two full time accountants that left the firm a few months ago and had not been replaced yet, so there's all of this work that I just feel like I'm struggling to get by. I don't know what to do. 

For anyone experienced out there, what would you do? Is this what it's like at a small firm? Please halp! :("

It would be an amazing opportunity for me to do something I really love and get more workplace experience.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the internship is full time with 10+ hour days. The work is very demanding, requiring you to be on your feet 95% of the day, and requires lots of bending, hauling, and other physical labor. It's obviously very tiring.  


I know I am capable of doing the work, but absolutely not for 45+ hours a week. After about 6 or 7 hours I start to get pretty tired, and by 8 hours the brain fog is pretty bad. I get overwhelmed by the physical sensations (sweating, muscle cramps, hurting feet, etc). I know some of this is normal, but being on the spectrum makes it much worse. I also sometimes get confused when people aren't clear with their instructions, and I clearly have a harder being organized and making decisions than the NT volunteers. However, I have been told I do good work.  


**Okay, so, the question: Have you guys ever asked for accommodations for an internship? How did it go?**

Chapter 6: Link Building &amp; Establishing Authority
-----------------------

### _Turn up the volume._You've created content that people are searching for, that answers their questions, and that search engines can understand, but those qualities alone don't mean it'll rank. To outrank the rest of the sites with those qualities, you have to establish authority. That can be accomplished by earning links from authoritative websites, building your brand, and nurturing an audience who will help amplify your content.

Google has [confirmed](https://searchengineland.com/now-know-googles-top-three-search-ranking-factors-245882) that links and quality content (which we covered back in Chapter 4) are two of the three most important ranking factors for SEO. Trustworthy sites tend to link to other trustworthy sites, and spammy sites tend to link to other spammy sites. But what is a link, exactly? How do you go about earning them from other websites? Let's start with the basics.

What are links?
---------------

Inbound links, also known as [backlinks](https://moz.com/learn/seo/backlinks) or [external links](https://moz.com/learn/seo/external-link), are HTML hyperlinks that point from one website to another. They're the currency of the Internet, as they act a lot like real-life reputation. If you went on vacation and asked three people (all completely unrelated to one another) what the best coffee shop in town was, and they all said, ""Cuppa Joe on Main Street,"" you would feel confident that Cuppa Joe is indeed the best coffee place in town. Links do that for search engines.

Since the late 1990s, search engines have treated links as votes for popularity and importance on the web.

[Internal links](https://moz.com/learn/seo/internal-link), or links that connect internal pages of the same domain, work very similarly for your website. A high amount of internal links pointing to a particular page on your site [will provide a signal to Google](https://moz.com/blog/should-seos-care-about-internal-links-whiteboard-friday) that the page is important, so long as it's done naturally and not in a spammy way.

The engines themselves have refined the way they view links, now using algorithms to evaluate sites and pages based on the links they find. But what's in those algorithms? How do the engines evaluate all those links? It all starts with the concept of E-A-T.

You are what you E-A-T
----------------------

Google's [Search Quality Rater Guidelines](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//insidesearch/howsearchworks/assets/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf) put a great deal of importance on the concept of E-A-T — an acronym for _expert_, _authoritative_, and _trustworthy_. Sites that don't display these characteristics tend to be seen as lower-quality in the eyes of the engines, while those that do are subsequently rewarded. E-A-T is becoming more and more important as search evolves and increases the importance of solving for user intent.

Creating a site that's considered expert, authoritative, and trustworthy should be your guiding light as you practice SEO. Not only will it simply result in a better site, but it's future-proof. After all, providing great value to searchers is what Google itself is trying to do.

### E-A-T and links to your site

The more popular and important a site is, the more weight the links from that site carry. A site like Wikipedia, for example, has thousands of diverse sites linking to it. This indicates it provides lots of expertise, has cultivated authority, and is trusted among those other sites.

To earn trust and authority with search engines, you'll need links from websites that display the qualities of E-A-T. These don't have to be Wikipedia-level sites, but they should provide searchers with credible, trustworthy content.

  - Tip: Moz has proprietary metrics to help you determine how authoritative a site is: [Domain Authority](https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority), [Page Authority](https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-authority), and [Spam Score](https://moz.com/help/link-explorer/link-building/spam-score). In general, you'll want links from sites with a higher Domain Authority than your sites.

Followed vs. nofollowed links
-----------------------------

Remember how links act as votes? The rel=nofollow attribute (pronounced as two words, ""no follow"") allows you to link to a resource while removing your ""vote"" for search engine purposes.

Just like it sounds, ""nofollow"" tells search engines not to follow the link. Some engines still follow them simply to discover new pages, but these links don't pass link equity (the ""votes of popularity"" we talked about above), so they can be useful in situations where a page is either linking to an untrustworthy source or was paid for or created by the owner of the destination page (making it an unnatural link).

Say, for example, you write a post about link building practices, and want to call out an example of poor, spammy link building. You could link to the offending site without signaling to Google that you trust it.

Standard links (ones that haven't had nofollow added) look like this:

```
[I love Moz](https://moz.com)
```
Nofollow link markup looks like this:

```
[I love Moz](https://moz.com)
```
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;**If follow links pass all the link equity, shouldn't that mean you want only follow links?**

Not necessarily. Think about all the legitimate places you can create links to your own website: a Facebook profile, a Yelp page, a Twitter account, etc. These are all natural places to add links to your website, but they shouldn't count as _votes for_your website. (Setting up a Twitter profile with a link to your site isn't a vote from Twitter that they like your site.)

It's natural for your site to have a balance between nofollowed and followed backlinks in its link profile (more on link profiles below). A nofollow link might not pass authority, but it could send valuable traffic to your site and even lead to future followed links.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  - Tip: Use the [MozBar](https://moz.com/products/pro/seo-toolbar)extension for Google Chrome to highlight links on any page to find out whether they're nofollow or follow without ever having to view the source code!

Your link profile
-----------------

Your link profile is an overall assessment of all the inbound links your site has earned: the total number of links, their quality (or spamminess), their diversity (is one site linking to you hundreds of times, or are hundreds of sites linking to you once?), and more. The state of your link profile helps search engines understand how your site relates to other sites on the Internet. There are various SEO tools that allow you to analyze your link profile and begin to understand its overall makeup.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;**How can I see which inbound links point to my website?**

Visit [Moz Link Explorer](https://moz.com/link-explorer) and type in your site's URL. You'll be able to see how many and which websites are linking back to you.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
### What are the qualities of a healthy link profile?

When people began to learn about the power of links, they began manipulating them for their benefit. They'd find ways to gain artificial links just to increase their search engine rankings. While these dangerous tactics can sometimes work, they are against Google's terms of service and can get a website deindexed (removal of web pages or entire domains from search results). You should always try to maintain a _healthy_link profile.

A healthy link profile is one that indicates to search engines that you're earning your links and authority fairly. Just like you shouldn't lie, cheat, or steal, you should strive to ensure your link profile is honest and earned via your hard work.

Links are earned or editorially placedEditorial links are links added naturally by sites and pages that _want to_link to your website.

The foundation of acquiring earned links is almost always through creating high-quality content that people genuinely wish to reference. This is where creating [10X content](https://moz.com/blog/why-good-unique-content-needs-to-die-whiteboard-friday) (a way of describing extremely high-quality content) is essential! If you can provide the best and most interesting resource on the web, people will naturally link to it.

Naturally earned links require no specific action from you, other than the creation of worthy content and the ability to create awareness about it.

  - Tip: Earned mentions are often unlinked! When websites are referring to your brand or a specific piece of content you've published, they will often mention it without linking to it. To find these earned mentions, use [Moz's Fresh Web Explorer](https://moz.com/researchtools/fwe/). You can then reach out to those publishers to see if they'll update those mentions with links.

Links are relevant and from topically similar websitesLinks from websites within a topic-specific community are generally better than links from websites that aren't relevant to your site. If your website sells dog houses, a link from the Society of Dog Breeders matters much more than one from the Roller Skating Association. Additionally, links from topically irrelevant sources can send confusing signals to search engines regarding what your page is about.

  - Tip: Linking domains don't have to match the topic of your page exactly, but they should be related. Avoid pursuing backlinks from sources that are completely off-topic; there are far better uses of your time.

Anchor text is descriptive and relevant, without being spammy[Anchor text](https://moz.com/learn/seo/anchor-text) helps tell Google what the topic of your page is about. If dozens of links point to a page with a variation of a word or phrase, the page has a higher likelihood of ranking well for those types of phrases. However, proceed with caution! Too many backlinks with the same anchor text could indicate to the search engines that you're trying to manipulate your site's ranking in search results.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Consider this. You ask ten separate friends at separate times how their day was going, and they each responded with the same phrase:

_""Great! I started my day by walking my dog, Peanut, and then had a picante beef Top Ramen for lunch.""_That's _strange_, and you'd be quite suspicious of your friends. The same goes for Google. Describing the content of the target page with the anchor text helps them understand what the page is about, but the same description over and over from multiple sources starts to look suspicious. Aim for relevance; avoid spam.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  - Tip: Use the ""Anchor Text"" report in [Moz's Link Explorer](https://moz.com/link-explorer)to see what anchor text other websites are using to link to your content.

Links send qualified traffic to your siteLink building should never be solely about search engine rankings. Esteemed SEO and link building thought leader [Eric Ward](https://www.ericward.com/) used to say that you should build your links as though Google might disappear tomorrow. In essence, you should focus on acquiring links that will bring qualified traffic to your website — another reason why it's important to acquire links from relevant websites whose audience would find value in your site, as well.

  - Tip: Use the ""Referral Traffic"" report in Google Analytics to evaluate websites that are currently sending you traffic. How can you continue to build relationships with similar types of websites?

### Link building don'ts &amp; things to avoid

Spammy link profiles are just that: full of links built in unnatural, sneaky, or otherwise low-quality ways. Practices like buying links or engaging in a link exchange might seem like the easy way out, but doing so is dangerous and could put all of your hard work at risk. [Google penalizes sites with spammy link profiles](https://moz.com/blog/rules-of-link-building), so don't give in to temptation.

A guiding principle for your link building efforts is to never try to manipulate a site's ranking in search results. _But isn't that the entire goal of SEO? To increase a site's ranking in search results?_And herein lies the confusion. Google wants you to _earn_links, not _build_them, but the line between the two is often blurry. To avoid penalties for unnatural links (known as ""link spam""), Google has made clear what should be avoided.

Purchased linksGoogle and Bing both seek to discount the influence of paid links in their organic search results. While a search engine can't know which links were earned vs. paid for from viewing the link itself, there are clues it uses to detect patterns that indicate foul play. Websites caught buying or selling followed links risk severe penalties that will severely drop their rankings. (By the way, exchanging goods or services for a link is also a form of payment and qualifies as buying links.)

Link exchanges / reciprocal linkingIf you've ever received a ""you link to me and I'll link you you"" email from someone you have no affiliation with, you've been targeted for a link exchange. Google's quality guidelines caution against ""excessive"" link exchange and similar partner programs conducted exclusively for the sake of cross-linking, so there is some indication that this type of exchange on a smaller scale might not trigger any link spam alarms.

_It is acceptable, and even valuable, to link to people you work with, partner with, or have some other affiliation with and have them link back to you._It's the exchange of links at mass scale with unaffiliated sites that can warrant penalties.

Low-quality directory linksThese used to be a popular source of manipulation. A large number of pay-for-placement web directories exist to serve this market and pass themselves off as legitimate, with varying degrees of success. These types of sites tend to look very similar, with large lists of websites and their descriptions (typically, the site's critical keyword is used as the anchor text to link back to the submittor's site).

There are [many more manipulative link building tactics](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en) that search engines have identified. In most cases, they have found algorithmic methods for reducing their impact. As new spam systems emerge, engineers will continue to fight them with targeted algorithms, human reviews, and the collection of spam reports from webmasters and SEOs. By and large, it isn't worth finding ways around them.

How to build high-quality backlinks
-----------------------------------

Link building comes in many shapes and sizes, but one thing is always true: _link campaigns should always match your unique goals._With that said, there are some popular methods that tend to work well for most campaigns. This is not an exhaustive list, so visit [Moz's blog posts on link building](https://moz.com/blog/category/link-building) for more detail on this topic.

### Find customer and partner links

If you have partners you work with regularly, or loyal customers that love your brand, there are ways to earn links from them with relative ease. You might send out partnership badges (graphic icons that signify mutual respect), or offer to write up testimonials of their products. Both of those offer things they can display on their website along with links back to you.

### Publish a blog

This content and link building strategy is so popular and valuable that it's one of the few recommended personally by the engineers at Google. Blogs have the unique ability to contribute fresh material on a consistent basis, generate conversations across the web, and earn listings and links from other blogs.

Careful, though — you should avoid low-quality guest posting just for the sake of link building. Google has advised against this and your energy is better spent elsewhere.

### Create unique resources

Creating unique, high quality resources is no easy task, but it's well worth the effort. High quality content that is promoted in the right ways can be widely shared. It can help to create pieces that have the following traits:

  - Elicits strong emotions (joy, sadness, etc.)
  - Something _new_, or at least communicated in a _new way_- Visually appealing
  - Addresses a timely need or interest
  - Location-specific (example: [the most searched-for halloween costumes by state](https://frightgeist.withgoogle.com/)).

Creating a resource like this is a great way to attract a lot of links with one page. You could also create a highly-specific resource — without as broad of an appeal — that targeted a handful of websites. You might see a higher rate of success, but that approach isn't as scalable.

Users who see this kind of unique content often want to share it with friends, and bloggers/tech-savvy webmasters who see it will often do so through links. These high quality, editorially earned votes are invaluable to building trust, authority, and rankings potential.

### Build resource pages

Resource pages are a great way to build links. However, to find them you'll want to know some [Advanced Google operators](https://moz.com/learn/seo/search-operators) to make discovering them a bit easier.

For example, if you were doing link building for a company that made pots and pans, you could search for: cooking intitle:""resources"" and see which pages might be good link targets.

This can also give you great ideas for content creation — just think about which types of resources you could create that these pages would all like to reference/link to.

### Get involved in your local community

For a local business (one that meets its customers in person), community outreach can result in some of the most valuable and influential links.

  - Engage in sponsorships and scholarships.
  - Host or participate in community events, seminars, workshops, and organizations.
  - Donate to worthy local causes and join local business associations.
  - Post jobs and offer internships.
  - Promote loyalty programs.
  - Run a local competition.
  - Develop real-world relationships with related local businesses to discover how you can team up to improve the health of your local economy.

All of these smart and authentic strategies provide good local link opportunities.

### Refurbish top content

You likely already know which of your site's content earns the most traffic, converts the most customers, or retains visitors for the longest amount of time.

Take that content and [refurbish it for other platforms](https://moz.com/blog/refurbishing-top-content-whiteboard-friday) (Slideshare, YouTube, Instagram, Quora, etc.) to expand your acquisition funnel beyond Google.

You can also dust off, update, and simply republish older content on the same platform. If you discover that a few trusted industry websites all linked to a popular resource that's gone stale, update it and let those industry websites know — you may just earn a good link.

You can also [do this with images](https://moz.com/blog/image-link-building). Reach out to websites that are using your images and not citing/linking back to you and ask if they'd mind including a link.

### Be newsworthy

Earning the attention of the press, bloggers, and news media is an effective, time-honored way to earn links. Sometimes this is as simple as giving something away for free, releasing a great new product, or stating something controversial. Since so much of SEO is about creating a digital representation of your brand in the real world, to succeed in SEO, you have to be a great brand.

### Be personal and genuine

The most common mistake new SEOs make when trying to build links is not taking the time to craft a custom, personal, and valuable initial outreach email. You know as well as anyone how annoying spammy emails can be, so make sure yours doesn't make people roll their eyes.

Your goal for an initial outreach email is simply to get a response. These tips can help:

  - Make it personal by mentioning something the person is working on, where they went to school, their dog, etc.
  - Provide value. Let them know about a broken link on their website or a page that isn't working on mobile.
  - Keep it short.
  - Ask one simple question (typically not for a link; you'll likely want to build a rapport first).

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;**_Pro Tip:_**

Earning links can be very resource-intensive, so you'll likely want to measure your success to prove the value of those efforts.

Metrics for link building should match up with the site's overall KPIs. These might be sales, email subscriptions, page views, etc. You should also evaluate Domain and/or Page Authority scores, the ranking of desired keywords, and the amount of traffic to your content — but we'll talk more about measuring the success of your SEO campaigns in Chapter 7.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Beyond links: How awareness, amplification, and sentiment impact authority
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of the methods you'd use to build links will also indirectly build your brand. In fact, you can view link building as a great way to increase awareness of your brand, the topics on which you're an authority, and the products or services you offer.

Once your target audience knows about you and you have valuable content to share, let your audience know about it! Sharing your content on social platforms will not only make your audience aware of your content, but it can also encourage them to amplify that awareness to their own networks, thereby extending your own reach.

Are social shares the same as links? No. But shares to the right people can result in links. Social shares can also promote an increase in traffic and new visitors to your website, which can grow brand awareness, and with a growth in brand awareness can come a growth in trust and links. The connection between social signals and rankings seems indirect, but even indirect correlations can be helpful for informing strategy.

### Trustworthiness goes a long way

For search engines, trust is largely determined by the quality and quantity of the links your domain has earned, but that's not to say that there aren't other factors at play that can influence your site's authority. Think about all the different ways you come to trust a brand:

  - _Awareness_(you know they exist)
  - _Helpfulness_(they provide answers to your questions)
  - _Integrity_(they do what they say they will)
  - _Quality_(their product or service provides value; possibly more than others you've tried)
  - _Continued value_(they continue to provide value even after you've gotten what you needed)
  - _Voice_(they communicate in unique, memorable ways)
  - _Sentiment_(others have good things to say about their experience with the brand)

That last point is what we're going to focus on here. Reviews of your brand, its products, or its services can make or break a business.

In your effort to establish authority from reviews, follow these review rules of thumb:

  - Never pay any individual or agency to create a fake positive review for your business or a fake negative review of a competitor.
  - Don't review your own business or the businesses of your competitors. Don't have your staff do so either.
  - Never offer incentives of any kind in exchange for reviews.
  - All reviews must be left directly by customers in their own accounts; never post reviews on behalf of a customer or employ an agency to do so.
  - Don't set up a review station/kiosk in your place of business; many reviews stemming from the same IP can be viewed as spam.
  - Read the guidelines of each review platform where you're hoping to earn reviews.

Be aware that review spam is a problem that's taken on global proportions, and that violation of governmental truth-in-advertising guidelines has led to legal prosecution and heavy fines. It's just too dangerous to be worth it. Playing by the rules and offering exceptional customer experiences is the winning combination for building both trust and authority over time.

Authority is built when brands are doing great things in the real-world, making customers happy, creating and sharing great content, and earning links from reputable sources.

In the next and final section, you'll learn how to measure the success of all your efforts, as well as tactics for iterating and improving upon them. Onward!

After realizing the huge commitment (4 years undergrad with competitive extracurriculars, gpa, and mcat. 4 years med school, 4 or 5 residency) i quickly realized that the juice is not worth the squeeze and that med school is not for me. I have been just going to my classes since i started college. No research or internships. My gpa is not good but it's not terrible either. 3.25 overall and 3.09 science gpa. Should be able to bring it up by the time I graduate because i grew up. But i have no idea how to find a job, please if you know any job positions that require a degree and internship work or some other requirements that i can get done before I graduate please tell me.

aktfwn,1,2019-01-28,Vice Review,AGrandQuiet,u_AGrandQuiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AGrandQuiet/comments/aktfwn/vice_review/,"*Vice* ends on a scene where we flash back to a focus group earlier seen determining that 'climate change' were a less credible threat than 'global warming'. In it a liberal and a conservative start getting into an argument over the film's credibility as a factual document. Off to the side, a young woman already painted as vapid, turns to the person next to her and comments that she can't wait to see the the next *Fast and Furious* joint.

Does Adam McKay really see his audience as either too politically blinkered or unengaged to appreciate his work? It's a rather sour note to exit on, the cynicism of an auteur so wholly believing himself to be a contemporary Cassandra. But equally, one kinda can extend him some sympathies in this regard; almost four years after his critically acclaimed breakdown of the corruption behind the 2008 financial crisis, nothing has changed. Economic inequality in the West has only worsened and our collective hard-on for capital seems to be leading us to a recreation of those same events.

When looking back, everything seems so much more simple. *The Big Short* took a visceral delight in explaining what exactly a CDO, for example, was — and how one acronym meant that just about everyone got fucked. It's a neat trick, his kinetic energy as a filmmaker turning an the lessons of an economics textbook into a gripping piece of pop-filmmaking. He was lucky to come across a textbook that was complicated and twisting and important enough for us to all pay attention, because the expanding scope of history does little to paint in the humans at its core.

One of the things that this movie stops to explain to us is the 'unitary executive theory'. A political belief motivating its lead that, when taken to its most extreme interpretation, invests the president with an arguably undue amount of power. It never spends half as much time encouraging us to consider why this is a belief he holds. Of course, the answer it wants you to arrive at is fairly obvious — the subtextual underscore of every single scene. Dick Cheney is a bad, power-hungry person.

Sure, given all collected evidence he certainly seems to be, but the film's elisions suggest something far more curious. Like, at the beginning we are introduced to a drunk, college dropout being dressed down by his wife for not living up to his potential. Cut to the man at a DC internship working under Donald Rumsfeld. What happened? I get that the point of interest is his political operating but shit, what did those six years bring? Later on there's an extended joke about how one cannot truly know what motivates people when one is not privy to their private discussions.

It barely reckons with the fact that its silence on the matter says just as much.

Christian Bale is fairly remarkable in the role. For a man who, it is suggested, rose to the top by being an outwardly bland and uncharismatic figure; he manages to make the small shrugs of them broad shoulders immensely compelling. There's an artificiality about the way he moves, strides shorter than they should be, a practised slouch as he settles in to convince an ally to board his latest scheme.

Yet the lack of specificity clearly hamstrings him too. While the ageing makeup and shot choices do their best to paint an unflattering portrait of his later years the characterisation remains unmoored. I couldn't tell you how this man changed with age. Unhelpful that, instead of surrounding him with characters McKay again primarily uses his actors' comedic personas to inform our reading. Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfelt is a wonderful joke — especially in a scene which features an uninterrupted half minute of his cackling — but it's not useful to us.

Bale, and an underserved Amy Adams, feel caught in the centre of this maelstrom of silliness. Outside of the clownish world of politics they find themselves inserted into, family is the only opportunity for their humanisation. Their struggle to balance allegiance to party with having an openly gay daughter, Dick's lifelong medical issues. Is it borne out of a weird sense of propriety maybe? For a film that so ruthlessly condemns the public life of its lead, it's very respectful of his private affairs. Which, guess what, kinda just makes them more compelling than everything else.

Even the procedural bits are a little lacklustre this time. Jesse Plemons, who I love, narrates. Eventually the film will explain his presence, but never his purpose. He exists almost as an excuse, the film wants to go on a surrealist bent where people discuss jerking off in the oval office? The narrator can tee up the scene. Want to shock the audience by incorporating archival footage of warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq? Sure, that too.

I think McKay probably really likes youtube video essays. I like them too, and it's great that he now has the budget and prestige to properly experiment with how to incorporate the benefits of the form into narrative filmmaking. This unfortunately isn't it. The film feels like it's at war with itself, torn between a character study and a straight up educational work. Yet the character study is bad, and the educational merit hamstrung by being constricted into a framework that does not readily suit it.

Thinking about it, I'd like to propose an alternate reading of the final scene. One which is not critical of the audience, but instead of the filmmaker. Is McKay in that moment admitting that he's failed? Made a film that is too easily accepted by uncritical audiences, too easily rejected by those that are, and too niche to appeal to the general public. Because that's kinda what he's done. When the woman running the focus group turns towards the two way mirror and shouts; 'Hey, can you please get in here?' Are they talking to the audience or the director?

It doesn't really matter. At the end of the day the mess is still on screen.

I finished college with an accounting degree. With no experience in accounting at all when I graduated (wasn't able to do internships) I had trouble finding a job as an accountant. All of the usual entry level, 3 years of experience needed kept coming up. I eventually settled for an accounts payable position in hopes to work my way up just to get experience. 3 years later I am still in accounts payable making shit money with no talks about being made into a staff accountant. When I started I was told that I would be considered for an accounting job at the company but on many occasions was shot down because we have plenty accountants (what was told to me). I made a choice recently that I want to leave my company. I think I should have left a long time ago but the comfort factor settled in and I would just keep making excuses to myself like ""If I stay this long I will eventually get the position"". I feel like I am going to have a tough time looking for a job as an accountant with 3 years experience of accounts payable. Any advice at all would help.

akuu3l,3,2019-01-28,"A Year of Job Searching, No Payoff",cmmarsh2,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/akuu3l/a_year_of_job_searching_no_payoff/,"A bit of a rant to start out, so please bear with me. I graduated in December 2017 with a degree in general biology, which I think was my first mistake. Don't get me wrong, I love my degree and I loved taking a ton of different biology courses, but I feel my degree is not focused enough to get me a start in any sort of biology-related career. I worked two part-time jobs throughout college, so I never got the chance to participate in any internships, I really didn't have time to volunteer, and I never got to work in anyone's lab (which was the biggest bummer for me as this was something I really wanted to do). Because of that, I have virtually no technical experience that can translate over to a career, and I didn't build any relationships with profs during college. 

About 6 months before I graduated, I started applying to a myriad of jobs. I have 5+ years of clinical healthcare experience, so I looked heavily at research coordinator positions, lab techs, and a couple of microbiologist positions. I really dislike working in healthcare from my past experiences though, so I also applied to some environmental science and conservation positions, as this was really where I saw myself in the future. Graduation came and went, and I hadn't heard back from any of my applications, so I ended up taking the first full-time job I could, which was working as a coordinator in a healthcare office. I still applied for jobs throughout my time in this position, still with no luck. In December, my company lost their contracts and in turn, I lost my job. So now I'm seriously on the hunt for a new job, but I really want to get into a career that 1. I like and 2. is somewhere I can stay for a while. 

I'm really looking for any advice on landing a position. Are there good websites specifically geared toward biology related jobs, or obscure job titles I should search for? Any specific agencies or groups that like to hire without much experience? Or, is  there a way I could spin my healthcare experiences to work for jobs in conservation (which I think is where I really want to be)? Any volunteer or post-bacc internship programs worth looking into to get more experience? I'm open to moving anywhere in the US too, but am currently located in Michigan. Thanks if you stuck with me!

TL;DR-graduated with biology degree, no job after a year. Looking for any advice on where to look for jobs/internships/volunteer opportunities for those with no previous biology experience.

I got internship offers for a few firms in the North-East and I've been very very excited.

I obviously want this to become a full-time offer after my internship, so what can I do to get it? I've been attending all of the recruiting events at my school and have done a lot of further networking with a few people in my practice (the ones who come out to recruiting events at least) and feel like I made a pretty good impression with many of the others at my office visit.

Other than attending these events, getting good grades, and keeping in touch with the recruiter, are there any other initiatives I can take to help me out after summer? I guess I'm asking for tips for the internship itself, networking at these events, and any other things I can do before my internship begins.

The thing is I'm in a dilemma. Not sure whether I'd be better at being an account manager or creative role.

I enjoy communicating with people and meeting new people. I'm pretty organized as well. Most of the opportunities that have been given to me are because of the way I present myself.

I love challenges, I tend to get bored if they're not present.

The thing is I'm also a person that is constantly on their feet with coming up with ideas. I ended up leveling up on my previous venture because I would constantly suggest new ideas to make them different. I started getting called into brainstorming sessions more and more and got my opinion heard(not an ad agency).

While in my last semester I took on more creative roles in my ad classes. Came up with actual ads and commercial ideas. However, my professor looked at my resume and stated I was an ideal account manager so to look for internships there.

I'm an advertising &amp; marketing communications major with a minor in new media art.

If anyone can help out with any advice, it'll be greatly appreciated. Especially when it comes to applying its pretty rough since there is always a creative and account management internship and I have to decide between one or the other. "
akw8eq,503,2019-01-28,She is not your private atm,Lark1987,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/akw8eq/she_is_not_your_private_atm/,"Oh joy upon joys have I got a story for you all about the ultimate entitled parents. Let me introduce the cast.

Me - about 24 years old at the time and a student pedagogi working her third internship for school. A pedagogi (pronounces peda the same why you would pedestrian) is a care service provider and usually works in daycares or in protected residences for mentally disabled children or adults.

Kat: my guidance counsel for the intern. She’s a nice lady as long as you don’t anger her. 

Sally - a mentally disabled woman of about 30. She’s very sweet and VERY trusting

Em - Sally’s entitled mom

Ed - Sally’s entitled father

A quick note, we use the currency of crowns in Denmark, but I’ve converted the money to dollars to give everyone a better idea of the prices. 

So at the time I was about a month into my internship at a protected residence when the holidays were coming up. Because I was interning as a full time employee I had been given the keys to the residences lockboxes where we kept the money for their everyday uses or trips. This boxes usually had about 5 to 6 grand in them and we kept pretty tight records over what was spent and how much due to an employee with sticky fingers taking money out of them. This was thankfully before I had gotten a key.

I was making my rounds in the different apartment that day when sally and her parents went up to me.

Sally; hey lark. I’m going to lunch  with mom and dad. 

Me: hey sally that sounds nice.

Em: yes so we need money.

I was a little taken back by how demanding she sounded but didn’t say anything. I didn’t know these people after all so I figured maybe they were in a hurry. I than remembers sally had been give the day before about 40 to use as she pleased. 

Me: ummm I think Sally’s already gotten so allowens yesterday. Right sally?

Ed: it’s not enough. She needs more.

Me: okay. How much do you-

Em: at least 2000. 3 would be better.

I was floored.

Me: 2000?! For lunch. That seems a bit much. Where are you going?

Em: none of your business. Just get the money.

Sally: we’re going to Jensen’s.

Ed: (he smacks her behind the head and angrily replies) sally. She doesn’t need to know.

At this point the whole thing smells fishy. Jensen’s is a restaurant that’s a little more expressive than Mac D, but no where near 2000 expensive.

Me: I’m not sure I can do that. That’s a lot of money.

Em: it’s fine. Kat already approved of it.

Again, this stroke me as odd since we tended to tell each other (colleges) if we had promised a sum of money out to the residents. Luckily Kay was working on the office so I figured I could just double check with her about this. So I told them to wait a minute while heading over to the office. Sure enough, Kat was there.

Me: hey Kat? Did you approve sally of withdroening 2000 from her box.

Kat: what? No. Why do you ask?

Me: her parents were-

I never go to finish before kat slammed her hands into the keyboard of her computer looking absolutely red with rage.

Kat: those god damn motherfucking scumbags.

Before I knew it, kat had stormed out of the office and all I hear her scream is “she is not your private atm!” Before kat returned fuming. 

When she calmed down I finally got the whole story. Ever since sally has gotten benefits for her disability, her parents have used her economically. If they went out to eat, they would order the cheapest meal for her and than the most expencive for themselves as well as buy stuff like makeup electronics and such for themselves with her money and claim they were gifts she gave them.

Their abuse of her disability was so bad, that we had on Sally’s file that she could only buy something for 5 dollars  for Xmas and birthday presents because one year she had gotten they several nice and pricey things for Xmas and all they gave her was a used roll on deodorant. How do we know it was used? Because her mom literally handed it to her, unwrapped, and said she now had a better one. And if they take her out to eat or enjoy something, they have to foot the bill and we’ll reimburse them after we have proof that they are Sally’s expenses (yes, they even tried to make us believe that sally had ordered a meal of something she hates several times) 

Un-fucking-believable.

And the reason why they had gone up to me about this money was because they had hoped I did t know about this clause regarding them and that I would hand over the money, no questions asked. 

The worst bit it, this was years ago and they are still doing this shit. When I got angry at them for trying to pull the same stunt a month later with me em told me this:

Em: well she gets all those benififts for her meds. She can spear the cash. 

Ed: it’s not like she needs them.

Never mind that her meds cost a lot. Clearly her meds aren’t as important as em need for a new Gucci bag

The Ministry of State Security is going full offensive against the United States Intelligence services, and has devised a sweeping plan to completely rid and deny the United States Foreign Intelligence services inside the People's Republic of China. After sweeping reforms given to the MSS over ten years, President Xi feels that are ready to challenge the CIA on Chinese soil and deny them every opportunity to gather intelligence. However it has to be done in a small way to be successful. We do not doubt the United States' abilities to land foreign operatives on Chinese soil, but we do not also doubt our own abilities to completely remove them- American Born Chinese, are not hard to differentiate from born and true mainlanders. For deniability purposes, it is safest to assume that the United States runs all of their intelligence operations in China out of the embassies, and that is where we will start.

The United States has one embassy in the People's Republic of China, and five consulates across China, specifically in:

* Beijing (Embassy)
* Chengdu
* Guangzhou
* Shanghai
* Shenyang
* Wuhan

The Ministry of State Security wants to know everything that happens inside these diplomatic institutions and everything that leaves these institutions. The Ministry of State Security will deploy in total 7 agents to these embassies/consulates. Two agents will go to the Beijing embassy due to its size and its importance, and one agent to every other consulate general. The Ministry of State Security will attempt to get all communications in these buildings tapped. Using ground service wires, the MSS will deploy a construction team to place a wire tap to relay to the MSS just outside of each of these buildings. The agents will all attempt to get translator jobs at the embassy or some resemblance of a job or internship at these facilities. Once these agents get inside, they will be ordered to lay low for a while and learn the routines and positions of all the important members inside these facilities. The MSS will begin tailing all of the representatives as they leave the buildings, and make notes of foreign nationals who leave or go into these embassies. The MSS will make a profile for all of the important individuals leaving these embassies or returning. Their job and task will be uncovered, to be used for later notice. MSS agents will create travel routines for the several different routes taken by individuals who work at the embassy, and where they reside. MSS agents operating inside these buildings will place wiretaps in every room inside the embassy to know what is happening even behind the closed and important doors. Agents will drop empty USB drives around the embassy in small numbers in hopes that US personnel will connect them to their work machines to identify whose it is, these USB sticks will be uploaded with worms to begin prodding through US diplomatic and intelligence documents and email them using the logged on emails to a series of one time use emails that the MSS will use to extract the information and take all intelligence for China's gain. Jammers will be placed along the outside of the consulates to require that US officials leave the The agents will be tasked with creating detailed maps of the inside of the embassies and labeling the primary function of every room. The most crucial task will be the following. MSS agents operating inside the embassies will be asked to copy and take photographs of all the intelligence inside the embassies, and most importantly find active lists of all United States intelligence operatives that are working inside China, including foreign placements, and local coerced individuals.

Once this list has been compiled, the MSS will identify who these individuals are, where they reside, where they come from, what their task is, and what is important to them. All documents regarding communication and intelligence activities acquired from these embassies will be given to the MSS for further use. Once the individuals have been identified and their location has been found the MSS will seek to pursue and eliminate all United States known intelligence assets in the People's Republic of China through kidnapping or assassination. Any individual kidnapped will be interrogated to the harshest and most mind bending limit for information. Any individual killed will be stripped of their phones and intelligence, and their body will be dumped into vats of acid at the MSS bases of operation. All intelligence gained will be taken to the MSS for  review and future knowledge. All individuals coming into China from the United States will have their passport, visa, and fingerprints uploaded to a database that is managed by the MSS, and will be logged for investigation into their activities in the People's Republic of China. Any United States person that is now entering the People's Republic of China, on the purchase of a local sim card will be given a special sim card that opens a back door to the MSS to monitor all contact and usage of the cellular device."
akwodi,5,2019-01-29,Is it ethical to ask why we're rejected from a position we applied to?,noiraseac,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/akwodi/is_it_ethical_to_ask_why_were_rejected_from_a/,"I applied for an internship in an IT company. They did a phone interview, and then they called me in for a face-to-face interview. I just got an email that says my application was denied and I didn't get the job. They didn't specify why I didn't get in. Is it ethical if I reply to their email asking for the reasons why I'm rejected? I really want to know why and maybe I can use that to improve myself in the future but I feel like it's not something you do if you get rejected?"
akwpfu,20,2019-01-29,Just looking for some guidance,milehighsurprise,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/akwpfu/just_looking_for_some_guidance/,"Lurker turned poster here, I’m looking for some guidance, I’m not really in the best headspace, so I’d appreciate those who wish to instigate, to kindly refrain....

I (40m)just discovered that my wife (39f)of 12 years (2 kids ages 9 and 7) cheated 2 months ago. Understandably, I ran the gamut of emotions- from shocked, to enraged, back down to sad, and so forth. I’m finally in a place where I can post this freely and interestingly enough, I’m not here for what you might expect...

Backstory-

I have had the epiphany that we all deserve to be happy, myself included. I was the hardworking, loving and loyal provider for along time. I know the propensity here is to assume that perhaps the marriage was deficient in some way, because it seems that is the norm perhaps, but we honestly had a good marriage. I’ve stayed in excellent shape, good enough looking, I earn mid six figures, my family has never wanted for anything, and for that matter, I have always been emotionally and sexually available to my wife. No emotional voids, a passionate and satisfied bedroom, and no resent. Stress of young kids? Sure- but I always do my part.. to She would be the first  person to tell you all this. 

So why did she cheat? Well I suppose after I peel back my top layer feelings of humiliation, anger, and disrespect, it really had nothing to do with me, as she claims. Despite my hurt, I’ve never questioned my value as a good man, and I don’t think she ever did either. She claims she was just being selfish, and concerned with her age (mid life crisis?) wanted to feel and prove that she was still young at heart, and desirable. 
One night, She went out with a couple of her girlfriends from her college days, and ended up drunk-banging a friend of a friend after leaving the bar. This man knew she was married, and perhaps worse, knew me. 
She came home the next morning sobbing in tears, and confessed everything. I was bewildered to say the least, because unlike so many stories I have seen here, I was far from a neglectful or unattractive husband. 
And much to my discredit, I have to say I lost my composure. I paid the other guy a visit the day she confessed, and got physical. His eye socket  was swollen  shut for a week, but considering the fact that I was about to drag him from the trailer hitch on my truck before my friend talked me down,  I’d say he got off easy with a beating for his mistake, and he knows it. Besides, as I mentioned, in my anger I wasn’t acting with all my sensibilities. I know my true problem doesn’t lie with him. 

I gave my wife a month of hell. I yelled, I cried, I ignored her for days on end, and more than once I started packing my bugout bag to bail out for a much needed vacation, although I never followed through.
She has been nothing short of remorseful, has cut any and all ties to that group of friends, openly leaves her phone out unlocked, got an STD test, and now reports to me as if I am her superior officer, completely unsolicited. It’s like she is following the SI script to the T- and I haven’t asked any of this from her. I read briefly on that forum, and frankly it was a place filled with too much anger and self pity for me. (I am entirely sympathetic to the pain of being betrayed, but I can’t imagine it’s healthy to stew in that pain and loathing for years)
She has a crippling sense of guilt and shame for her actions, and while perhaps a small part of me wants her to atone for having betrayed my so brutally, a much larger pet of me feels badly that the woman I love hurts so much too. It’s a total mindfuck. 
In my heart, I don’t see an unsatisfied, remorseless, or evil whore like so many people on the SI subreddit see. I see an otherwise happy and loving wife who faced the reality of approaching mid age- and tried to cling to her youth by doing something profoundly hurtful and devastating, for a quick thrill. She knows she messed up, and that haunts her. I know she loves me, and that I am the man she will spend the rest of her life trying to do right by. I have learned she is human, she is imperfect, but despite my initial reaction she is no monster. 

Which brings me to why I am here. I think part of the reason why I am able to start forgiving her is because I can understand the desire. If I could count the number of times the barista at Starbucks with the dark red lipstick has made my dick swell, I’d be rich. or the flirty 24 year old sales intern next door in high heels and manicured toes who eye fucks me when she thinks no one is looking...well you get the point. 

Point is I think it’s completely natural to be attracted to people besides your spouse, but out of love and respect for our spouses, we fight the urge to act on them. We go against our natural drives. So I’m not mad at my wife for feeling this way, I’m mad that she betrayed my trust to act on it. The problem I have is that I no longer feel bound to respect our monogamy. All those times I could have taken the cues from pretty women who were interested, but chose not to, feel like a waste. 

I have no intention of blowing up my marriage, my kids lives, and my home to divorce her. I do love her, I don’t hate her, even if I hate what she did. But I am deeply jealous that she got to act on her whims for cheap thrill and pleasure, whereas I always forewent my chances to do the same. The irony is that while I doubt she really looks back at her one night stand fondly, nor do I think she will ever do it again, I find myself absolutely craving it. 

We are going to stay married, I am going to try and forgive her betrayal, and get back to what we were, or as close as possible, but honestly? I have every intention of going out there and having some xrated fuck fun myself. 

Last Friday, at happy hour, I got to chatting with the sexy sales intern- and she gave me her number in case “I needed someone to teach me how drink bourbon” . Three months ago, I’d have    Just Taken the compliment of her flirting  and gone home to fuck my wife extra hard, with an inflated ego. Now, I doubt I’ll be happy if I don’t take the opportunity to fuck the intern....

But I struggle about whether I should just tell my wife that this is what I need, so as not to be on her level about the betrayal, or whether I should keep it my secret, to avoid hurting her. I won’t be able to recommit to our marriage until I have my fun, but I’m not sure what the best approach is here. Either way, my wife would forgive me, but I’m not here to hurt her, I’m certainly not out to punish her, but I am here to enjoy my time now. It’s my time to have fun.


To the seasoned folks here, what’s my best course of action? 

(I apologize for the length of this post btw, but I had to get it all out)"

I'm looking for people with similar kinks interest and limits, If you have any limits feel free to let me know as I will respect your limit as long as we both sync :)

I'm looking for people who are willing to handle multiple characters for the prompt.My previous prompts are open too. Make sure you read the post completely before reaching out to me. Thank you.

**PROMPT**
___

:Prompt 1:

In this prompt your lead character will be my uncle, the loving caring uncle. The one who is friendly yet the one who doesn't have a strike on his name. However that's how you showcase yourself to everyone within family until I came along. The first girl in family, all my cousins and siblings before me were boys. I was the first one in our family to be born as a girl. Things changed as I came into the group, I had to play with the boys, however everyone treated me with care and respect.
 But things changed as years passed, specially when I turned the age of __ (Your choice) my brothers and cousins started acting weird, as they'd leave me all of a sudden and sometimes they'd act annoyed or worse too caring. So did my uncles and grandpa. Where as my mom was buying me baggy clothes where as my uncles gifted me skirts and sundresses. And Today I'm going to celebrate my __ birthday, as almost everyone showed up to the family event. The day focus on your lead character breaking the ice, as my mom gets an urgent business call for the week she puts you in charge to take care of me and the rest of the family members, including my birthday party. 

You are gifted with her credit card with the freedom to use and purchase anything you may find suiting for the day and for my gift. And this is where you decide to make some changes, as you'll start with my birthday outfit, since mom is out of the picture you decide to buy me something she won't perhaps it's not too slutty yet. You'll be the one to buy the cakes and other gifts from dad, grandpa, brothers and cousins. Perhaps you'd even plan a game for me to play with the whole family with a penalty or punishment. Perhaps you even sabotaged the game to make me loose.

You may take things with different approach, as you can provide and corrupt each of the other family member with either a dose of Viagra spiked on their drinks to make them have the urge to be done with, and even giving each of them a pre-boxed gift, as I open it each will be humiliating from the other.

:Prompt 2:

In this scene you will be focusing and playing as my loving dad. I want you to be a normal dad without any dirty or perverted mindset yet. I want you to control the other characters who may corrupt your mind set. I'm looking for a slow burn in this one where you are indeed married and she is live and well. As you'll have me and perhaps a son too. This could take place in many forms, as we are in a good dad-daughter terms, I'm not bratty or someone who brags about anything. As things kicks off at the wrong time. 

You work for a fairly decent company, with a strict boss and co-workers. As one day your office planned to host a party, as it's the first party they are inviting you to go for. However there is a catch you are given to entry passes where you can either bring your wife,or your daughter along with your son. Unfortunately your wife , my mom got sick for a couple of days and you decided to bring me along with you and my brother. 

This is set a scene where you will have to get me a decent party wear to dress in where your son would wear something matching your style. But things aren't how I expected it to be, as we arrive at the entrance of the location, we'll be going through a series of scanners and metal detectors. As you'll notice onto the left it'll be a open search station for the guys but onto the right it'll be something similar for the girls too.

But just as you two pass through you'll be stopped by  the guards as they frisk your jackets and pockets, but as I pass through you'd notice two male guards stopping me from proceeding further as they slowly asks me to keep my hands raised or apart while groping me in public in ways to make your blood boil in anger. This would set a humiliating point for me as you may decide how the frisk goes for me. But nothing too extreme.

And once we are inside you'll be welcomed with love and respect by almost everyone, as they'd show the same care towards me and my brother. However you maybe given a gift by your boss before they engage in some sort of party games involving me as their main target, as you'd also notice that most of the other staffs came with their sons or along. leaving me as the only female other than the maids and waitresses.

:Prompt 3:

What could go wrong while you work as an Air Hostess? The fancy suit and the elegant look? The classic make-up with a fancy cabin crew? At-least that's what I thought when I started my intern ship as an Air Hostess trainee for a young age. But things went to ways I couldn't even imagine as my decent costume and salary was more than enough. But just as the flight took off, my supervisor who boarded the flight to evaluate my performance took me aside as he gave me a different outfit to wear for my duty. As he made me do things that revealed parts of me to other customers and even to my own flight crew.

It didn't stop there as I was called into the cabin along with the Air Marshall when one of their regular customer made a complaint about missing his expensive wrist watch, as I was forced to under go a frisk search infront of him. Or perhaps I was told to spoon feed the pilots as they were having their focus on me? 

But things took an unexpected turn when few of the passengers revealed to be some sort of bad people wanting to make use of me and force others to use me?


:Prompt 4:

The wardens daughter, Life was always joyful for me. As my dad being a officer and being in an active prison was something I was proud to brag about to my friends and family. And yes he was indeed a respectful man who took control of one of the strongest prison on earth. As he took care of all prisoners based on how evil and nice they were. He made sure that no one could escape these walls without him trying to stop them.

However me on the other hand, I was able to go through each and every entrances. Almost every guards knew my face as they knew who I was. It felt as if I was more trusted around these walls after you my dad. But one recent visit changed my life. As you were having a new prisoner being transported in, one of the baddest and brutal suspect. He looked evil, and stronger than you ever where. He wasn't alone, as his followers were already a part of your prison. Or maybe even one or two of your co-workers.

The sky was bright and the wind was cold but the day didn't feel that lively as I walked down the guarded hallways while you were on the other side of the prion helping everyone with transporting the new intake. As I strolled down the hallway one of the hallway door was left open in an unusual manner, which raised my curiosity to divert my stroll to that specific hallway with prison doors on one side. As I walk past each prisoner, could it be possible that I make a friend? or foe? Or perhaps someone snatches my teddy bear? Or do I see something I should see? I'm not looking for a straight up free-use or rape. I am looking for something slow burn, slow tease and manipulation. Corrupting my mind. Or even involving my own dad and his guards.

:Prompt 5:

In this prompt I will RP as a mom and daughter, With main focus towards the daughter. As we are driving on our road-trip down the highway with fields and open landscape on either side of the road. As the road was rather empty with another large truck driving next to us. Our car wasn't the best as it usually had trouble starting or even running the A/C as I almost laid on the rear passenger seat with my window down I didn't realize that I was being watched over by someone driving by, As I slowly opened my eyes in mid dream, I did see those predatory eyes glaring at me, or somewhere down on my body. I wasn't sure, was my skirt being raised by the wind? Or was it something else I couldn't never find out as I quickly dozed off seeing the truck speed faster leaving us alone for miles ahead.

And just as the sun started to settle,we drove out of a gas station filled with truckers and bikers but as we went past a quite long distance our car quickly began to make some sort of rumbling nose, before the engine started to smoke , My mom panicked as she pulled over the car as I  continued to sleep while hugging my teddy bear. That's when the familiar truck drove past and quickly pulled over. As a fairly old main, fat chubby and rather unattractive walked out with a  friendly smile to my mom as he offered his help. How could this lead to? Will he offer a drop off for the lost family? Will he take advantage of the daughter behind her moms back? 
I do have ideas for this prompt. such as watersport and stuff.

:Prompt 6:

Aren't priests supposed to guide you down the right path? Specially a young girl who slowly started to discover the changes happening around her? At-least that's what I was expecting when I kneel down within the confession booth, confessing everything I had in mind. but the way he advice me under gods name wasn't something I thought he would ask. I found myself being guided by my priest from modest young girl to not so modest. i found myself going back even more as he pealed each layer of my soul one after the other turning me into what I feared to be.

:Prompt 7:

The farmers daughter, In this scene I will be rping as a country girl living our in a beautiful house with dad and grandpa. As being out here there isn't many things to learn from, As the only group of friends i have are the ones I see rarely. As I spend most of my time walking down the fields, watering the plants, feeding the animals and such. However one day we had an uninvited guest. You could be someone who is lost, or you could be a thug tricking my dad to spare a bed for him to sleep for the night. I want your character to be the one that gets help from my dad and grandpa. But upon seeing me you decide to make excuses on the next day. As you slowly try your ways to corrupt me. 

How will you corrupt me? Will you walk around your room in your underwear? A fancy eye catching color? Will you pee while having the door unlocked or even open slightly? Or would you pee on the flowers I grew down by the stream? 

Would be you the tricky one who gives me gifts from cities? Both appropriate and inappropriate gifts?
You could even introduce me to clothes modern girls wear, inside out. Perhaps you'll even corrupt grandpa to finally let me be seen as any girl to satisfy men.


:Prompt 8:

I never knew my best friends dad was a sick pervert.I always saw you as a beloved dad a dad I wish I had but it all changed the day I was invited to go along with m my best friend. It could be a sleep over or a family vacation or even a road trip. With you me and your daughter or with any other male of you choice. This could go two ways, My initial choice would be that you having perverted thoughts towards me than your daughter. As you are the best decent father she could wish for. But towards me you'd be the sickest pervert I have ever seen. You'll be someone who spies on me, takes advantage to grope me, make me wear your own daughters clothes and even making me call you daddy. And most importantly using me to get out of trouble. Or it could be something down the lines of you trying to corrupt me with the help of your daughter.

:Prompt 9:

What happens when two best perverts meet? As you'll be playing roles of two friends, as to the outside world you are legally married gay couple. Who adopted and raised a young girl who is now finally __ years old. But what people didn't realize were that you two were crazy perverts, as you had other plans to do with me, your adopted daughter.

**:Prompt 10 : NEW**

It was carnival season as me and dad walked into a enclosed area with lights, cameras and a large stage. The event promised a large sum of offer to the winner as it was a quiz based game show. Pretty much like family feud however this was alot different than what I expected.

**:Prompt 11: NEW**

The unexpected trekking, I want this to be a theme based in group trekking. I could be the only girl with boys and guys within the group. it could revolve around the awkward vibe between the boys and guys around me. This could give you room to make each character unique and different. As well as my interaction with your different characters, Situations. Possibilities and many more.

**:Prompt 12:NEW**

Spider Gwen, I want this prompt to be something special around the lines of rule32?34? Ah forgot... anyhow. I want this to be a fictional setting where I'll focus on Spider Gwen, however I am not sure about the other hero's or Villians associated with said character But I am planning to set a slightly different setting for this story-line. This may have slightly unrealistic contents but I'd still prefer the base story to be somewhat believable like batman, batman is real.

**:Prompt 13: NEW**

**IT MOVIE THEME** This prompt is based on the IT movie, I'll be rping the girl named Gretta, the girl who becomes friends with the group of boys. I want this prompt to involve multiple guys, boys and even her own dad.


**I'll add new prompt here soon, Come back JACK! stay tuned**

akxcyl,10,2019-01-29,I’m digging myself into a hole of credit card debt that’s going to grow. Rent is also due in a few days and I only have $836 in savings when rent is $800. Any advice besides hold my breath and wait for the next paycheck?,mhmmidontknow,povertyfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/akxcyl/im_digging_myself_into_a_hole_of_credit_card_debt/,"For context, I have about $1300 in income and $1000+ in credit card debt, which brings me down to a net worth of about $297 (after budgeting the essentials).  

I know I got myself into this situation because when I transitioned into a new internship, I didn’t get paid for 4 weeks but I continued to spend as if I had a job. I also never paid my credit card balance full, accruing debt each month especially January punching me in the face by reaching $1K. 

My next paycheck comes this Friday, but as PT employee (I’m a college student) it’s only going to be about $300.  My school job will also pay me again on the 8th (about $256). 

From now until then, I’m going to get punched again with rent at $800 and a gym membership (charged to my credit card at $137). Not to mention that the rent withdrawal will charge me a $36 bank fee for having a balance less than $300. 

Do I continue to take the punches? Is there a resources that can help me get out of this situation that my dumbass put myself in???"
akxzfg,14,2019-01-29,(24F)(23M) Calling only once a week,krasotka1,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/akxzfg/24f23m_calling_only_once_a_week/,"Hello everybody,

Me and my boyfriend are in a LDR for 1.5 years now. We have a plan to close the distance in december this year. I don't know if its relevant, but he has ADHD.

The problem is that, since around half a year he just stopped initiating contact and just doesn't miss me at all all the time. I am 95% the one initiating the contact. Up until 3 weeks ago he was not working so, even if I was the one initiating, we were kinda talking almost daily (he wasn't really showing too much interest, just responding to things I said). If I brought it up, he said he is bad at it and he just kind of forgets about me while he does his stuff. It hurts but I kind of tried to accept it.

3 weeks ago he started his internship (I am also working the whole time). The issue now is that he just comes tired home and doesn't want to talk much or at all. Sometimes he just doesn't even come online for days and if I ask if he wants to talk or something he just answers in a half-assed yes/no. During these weeks we only talk on weekends (maybe once more during the week or so) but yet again, I am mostly the one participating in the conversation. He says he loves me though but it's hard to believe, it feels like he just tries to think so but actually doesn't care much for me other than a friend...

This hurts SO much since I want to chat with him every day but he doesn't care if we chat or not. I am thinking constantly of breaking up but I don't want to regret it (especially since I learnt a lot of his language already and it's only 10 month until I move to his country), he is a good person in real life...

Do you think this could be normal? Maybe I am overreacting... It feels like I am more of a friend than a girlfriend tbh"
akynz1,2,2019-01-29,Can’t stop the music? Watch me.,Lark1987,VoiceyHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceyHere/comments/akynz1/cant_stop_the_music_watch_me/,"I was living in a student apartment when I experienced the neighbor from hell. A quick explication of how my student apparent looked, it was to one room apartments with one bathrooms and kitchen but a shared entrance hall. In this hall was room for each of our on our respective sides to have out shoes and jacket and in the center dividing it was the circuit breaker for both our apartments. It was an old apartment complex so it wasn’t the switch board kind, but one that used corks. For the young readers, the corks were a one time use so if they went, you had to buy new ones.

I had been living there for two years without any problem until the higher ups decided to move a young girl in as my neighbor. She was what we call in Denmark “a troubled youth” which pretty much means she needed government help in finding a home because her had a record of being a problem tenant and her family didn’t want her home either.

Mind you I didn’t know that at the time.

Now the walls were pretty thick in this complex and in the start she was friendly. She asked if she could borrow my internet for a bit while she waited for her own to arrive and I let her because when I had moved there it took two months for it to arrive (I know. Unbelievable. Takes longer for a landline and it’s utter bs) and she accepted when I removed her computer from my Mac approved list when it arrived. She also got a puppy which was utterly adorable and I was fine with that since I love animals.

The problems however started to appear in the fourth month. She never cleaned up after her dog which annoyed me because it would poop in front of my window though I couldn’t prove it was just her dog. The other problem was she would invite her friends over and play really loud music all days of the week until 5 am. And I mean loud. Like, shaking my wall loud. At first I figured maybe I was being sensitive about it but when I started an internship where sometimes I had to get up really early (about 4 am. I had to catch a train at 6 or be an hour late) I finally had to say something.

I could accept late weekends because it wasn’t her problem if I had work, but the weekdays were ridiculous. 

I tried talking to her first, thinking if I explained that I could hear her three the walls, maybe she’d understand to turn the music down and not party so late. The first three times she gave me a half ass appology but nothing changed. In the end it was after I had had a grueling 9 hour shift afternoon shift that I finally had enough.

I had returned home late after some night passes for dyslexia and all I wanted was to eat a quick meal and sleep a few hours before I had to get up at 4 for another six hour shift. It was quiet for the most place right til the point when I was getting ready for bed when I hear my entitled neighbor (en) and her friend barrel into the hallway laughing. I instantly think “no not tonight” and open my door.

Me: hey en? Can I talk to you for a sec?

En: huh?

Me: listen I have an early shift tomorrow so can you keep it down tonight? I need the sleep.

En:  it’s not that bad.

Me: I can hear it though the walls. They are thick. It’s bad. Besides it’s a Wednesday night. Don’t you have school or something during the week. 

En friend:lol. School. 

It was then I learned she does nothing all day, everyday.

Me: ok. So you don’t but I do, so keep it down please.

She gave a “yeah yeah” like guesture and she and the gaggle of friend pile into her apartment and what do you know, music is blaring. I think to myself “okay lark. It’s only 8 pm. Not her problem you need to sleep early. At 11 if she doesn’t turn it down, you’ll tell her”

11 comes around,music is still playing loud and now they are scream singing to it.  I knocked on her door, told her it was 11 and the rules of the complex is no loud music past 11. I recorded a “whatever” and get ignored.

By now I’m ready to file a complaint with our landlord but I can’t do it til morning so I’m seething. When it finally becomes midnight I had had enough. I went out in my bathrooms and pounded on the door.

Me: (yelling) turn that shot down now. It’s the middle of the fucking night and people have shit to do tomorrow.

The door opens and it’s end friend. To describe him: he looks every bit the stereotype loser teenage boy who this he’s going to become famous on love island or big brother or whatever other reality program that collects that kind of people.

End friend: what do you want?

The music is still blurring behind him.

Me: it’s midnight.

En friend: so?

Me: people around here have stuff to do tomorrow. I have stuff to do tomorrow. You have to turn off the music. 

En friend: not our problem bitch so piss off.

Me: en, turn it off now.

En: (sitting on her bed, looks at my and deliberately turns the volume up high on her stereo) make us bitch. Can’t stop the music!

Her friend than slammed the door on me and I could here them laughing. By now I’m pissed and deciding whether or not to call the police but I wasn’t sure of the noise pollution laws are the same in Denmark as they are in the USA. (I grew up in California and I learned later that yes, the laws are the same) when I looked at the breaker box. Than it hits me.

Without waiting for it, I open it and first pulled the corks out of my box so if she figured it out Abe can’t take mine. There are four in all, one for main electrics like the fridge and stove and one for everything else. I pulled her main electric first so she wouldn’t notice before I banged on her door again.

Me: last chance. Turn it off now. (I think I hear a fuck you yelled back before I turned to the breaker again) right than. Lights out.

There’s an instant silence as I hear a “what the fuck!” From her apartment as I pocketed the corks and when to bed. My phone was charged so I knew it would wake me in time for work and no one else was affected because the circuit breaker was only connected to up. I then went to work the next day with the corks and only put them back in when I got home again.

I learned later as I filed the complaint that everyone else in the complex had complained about her for the last two months and he was surprised I hadn’t been the first. She got evicted from the apartment because she hadn’t informed them of her dog, but the higher ups moved her back in again in a different apartment, though this time she had a junkie for a neighbor who kept stealing her stuff for his fixes. She whined that it was unfair but by than we all just ignored her and said it was her own fault. She was a shitty neighbor and karmas a bitch. "

akyy98,2,2019-01-29,Is there an age limit on moving to Japan?,kosm1fent,movingtojapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/comments/akyy98/is_there_an_age_limit_on_moving_to_japan/,"I'll try to keep it short. I am a 29 year old second-year PhD student in physical chemistry and looking into the possibility of moving to Japan when I'm done. I have got a bachelor's in Chemistry, a master's in Chemical Education and ICT with a speciality in educational instrumentation and (some light) embedded system programming. I am currently specializing in physicochemical interfacial interractions, with (again) a focus on their educational capabilities, and also looking into the possibility of simultaneously going for a master's in Analytical Chemistry, which ought to make me more employable (lol).

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I should have been younger than I am right now. It took me 7 years to finish my BSc due to lack of motivation during the first three years. As a result, I missed a lot of traineeship opportunities (unfortunately they are hard to come by in my country, they are largely reserved for undergraduate students) and I currently have no formal training or work experience in my field.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to finish my PhD (I need at least two more years) while also grabbing any opportunity to impove my CV in terms of scientific journal articles, conference presentations, etc, as well as apply for relevant scholarships or educational exchange programs that come up (I have not done either yet for various reasons). When I finish, I plan to look for a job or further research opportunities (preferably in Japan) and if I cannot find one, as a last resort I could enroll into a Japanese language school (not super fond of the idea and the amount of money needed).

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: I could be 32+ years old by the time I actively look into moving in Japan. I know I am on the upper limit of the prefered age requirement for Japanese businesses, but I would love to read your honest opinions on how hard it would be for someone my age to find an entry-level or internship position in my (general) field. Is my current plan viable or should I abandon it?"
akzsf0,3,2019-01-29,When to see a therapist?,ther1pisthelp,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/akzsf0/when_to_see_a_therapist/,"Hi everyone! I’m debating whether or not my situation warrants therapy, or if this is something I can fix on my own because maybe it isn’t very severe of a problem.

On the outside I would say I’m pretty normal. Asian girl, 22, about to graduate college this year, have a job lined up, lots of good friends and boyfriend.

For a long time now (since high school) I’ve been dealing with anxiety. It isn’t severe enough where it prevents me from doing most things, and I would say the majority days I’m fine. But other days I’m not.

Some of the things I deal with:
- I definitely have imposter syndrome for my field, I am a girl studying computer science at a competitive university. I feel like I was able to get my internship (and later job) out of sheer luck. I often score below average on exams. I constantly fear that once I start my job they’ll think I’m dumb and fire me.
- The above fear has been compounded by a “friend” who told another friend he thinks I’m the dumbest person he can think of in our major. This was like a year ago but still affects my self-esteem.
- I am clingy, I think I have an anxious attachment style. If my boyfriend gets busy with something and can’t hang out with me, I get sad and think he’s falling out of love with me. I talk to him about this a lot and he reassures me but this happens over and over again constantly.
- I hate it when people don’t like me, I am definitely a people pleaser.
- I always think of worst possible scenarios, namely my loved ones dying. My grandparents who I was super close with (they lived next door) passed away relatively suddenly when I was in high school and I don’t think I’ve fully gotten over it still (I still cry when I think of them). I think about it how if my mom or dad died, how it would probably break me, especially since my grandparents’ deaths still make me so sad today.

There’s some other things but those are some of the main ones. Anyway, I’m not sure if I should see someone for this or not. My parents are very traditional Asian parents and think that the anxiety is all in my head and that I can fix it via faith (they’re super religious, I am moderately religious but struggling with my faith a bit recently). Even my boyfriend is against me going to therapy because he’s afraid it will “change” me and he feels like I should be able to just talk to him to figure out my problems.

Should I go? Or can this just be fixed if I read some self-help books or meditate or something instead?

Tl;dr Not sure if my issues are something that can be easy fixed or if I should see a professional? At what point should you see one? Thank you in advance!"

al0o5c,32,2019-01-29,Discussion: She's The Man (2006),benjimaninthecan,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/al0o5c/discussion_shes_the_man_2006/,"So I rewatched an old favourite movie of mine, She's The Man (I really liked Amanda Bynes growing up). I mentioned that I rewatched it when out with a few friends and a fellow trans-man told me he had watched it semi-recently and hated the way it made fun of trans people and the struggles we go through.


I was a bit confused by his take on it so I decided to rewatch it again, and I loved it. I actually found it really relatable as a transman. There were certain scenes that I found to be great and going to discuss them below.


So obviously Viola's reason to be seen as a man may not be the more typical reason some ftm people, but she does. When she's set on making the transition she watches/studies the mannerisms of men in public, and trying to mimic them. When first transitioning I really looked to my male friends, family and coworkers to make sure I was acting manly enough to pass.


As she enters the school in place of her twin brother, Sebastian, her friend makes sure her voice is deep enough to pass. As she is trying to find her room she is bombarded by all the things that are going on around in the male dorms. She stops amid this and says, ""I'm a dude. I'm a badass dude. I'm a badass, hunky dude"". It reminded me of all the little pep talks I have given to myself even to this day.


Once she makes it to her dorm she meets her roommates and a tampon accidentally falls out of her bag. Having your period while identifying as a man can be dysphoric and kinda shitty at times. For those who it does effect, explaining to cis male can be difficult at times (and I know I have lied in the past, making excuses as to why they are around).


There are a few small but funny moments I thought were gold. Trying out for soccer, during the drills she gets hit in the ""balls"" and has to put on an act. After the drills, its shower time and the fear is immediately seen on her face. After talking with the principal she bumps in a girl and makes offhanded comments about female fashion and tries to cover up how she would have known.


The movie progresses and the last three points stood out to me. Viola is having a tough time getting secluded shower time and her body odour is getting worse and she doesn't seem to fit in with any of the other guys. She's talking to her friend and says that shes made a huge mistake and just needs to give up. There have definitely been those days when it just feels too much and that transitioning is just a huge burden with no end.


As she has not told anyone but her close friends that she is secretly pretending to be her brother, her family calls on her to be around as her actual self. There's a bit of slapstick but she navigates a day of changing between being Viola and Sebastian and their obligations. I was stealth for a very long time as I had just started a nonpaid internship that I needed to have in order to pass my studies (I absolutely love my field and can be hard to get a foot in the door). Additionally, my immediate family either ""didn't understand"" or just ignored my attempts of transitioning. My friends and doctors were super supportive and I was able to be myself around them.


Being a movie with Channing Tatum, of course, there has to be a romantic side (not dunking on him though). Viola slowly starts to fall in love with Duke over the course of the movie and tries to tell him about who she really is. She never gets around to it and other shit happens and she gets outed. After ignoring communication she finally gets to see him and tells him that she tried to tell him but was just too afraid. I can only speak for myself but there have definitely been these moments and I absolutely have skipped opportune moments to tell someone and either regretted it or have lost a relationship because of it.


Though being an older movie there are some still cringe worthy moments (genitalia being the basis on someone's gender). I completely understand that it probably isn't everyone's cup of tea but I did enjoy it.


TLDR; All in all, I think She's The Man is a fairly decent movie for an older movie and reasons it probably didn't set out to be. 


Please feel free to have a discussion in regards to this movie!"
al0v84,4,2019-01-29,Participation of Arch Linux Organization in Google Summer of Code.,major9989,archlinux,https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/al0v84/participation_of_arch_linux_organization_in/,"I am a student, and I have been looking at Arch's participation in the GSoC for the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

I came across [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Google_Summer_of_Code) and wanted to know why the ideas were scrapped or why didn't Arch participate (in the past few years).

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that Arch is more of a community-driven organization, but I do feel that there would be some work which has to be done by some assigned individuals (like the works of a Trusted User). There might be some project or some cool idea which could be implemented as a part of the GSoC project.

&amp;#x200B;

The motivation behind this idea is:

1. GSoC is only available for students, and hence it could provide some sort of work XP or an exposure, like an internship. It could offer them something cool to learn, both about the community and the OS.
2. A lot of packages on the AUR need cleaning up. There are many orphaned or maintained but out-of-date packages. I guess that's what a TU (Trusted User) looks up to, but I guess that TUs can use some help.
3. The students can work on some cool projects aimed specifically for the community. Something like a bot to help maintain the AUR. Interactive applications for people on how to use Arch/AUR. A Reddit bot to maintain this community. Something related to Pacman. etc.
4. GSoC really pays well, and it could help some students who want some financial aid - That's because everyone expects some reward for his/her hard work.

I am eager for all the responses, and would be glad to emphasize more on it. Feel free to ask anything. \^&gt;\^

al1nv6,6,2019-01-29,I've Never Met a Bisexual Person that Didn't Cheat,LaTui1248,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/al1nv6/ive_never_met_a_bisexual_person_that_didnt_cheat/,"Disclaimer: I live in the Bible Belt, so the culture here could play a role in this behavior on a general scale.  My experiences have involved close friends in a couple different friend groups, all of which are very open and accepting of different lifestyles.  Since some of these experiences involve me, it's worth mentioning I'm a gay male.  Also, this is kind of a shit post...forgive me.  These events are chronological:

&amp;#x200B;

1 - The first time was in a ""committed"" relationship.  He split his time between the town I was in and Chicago, where his internship was.  7 months in and I find out he is also dating a girl in Chicago.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Best friend's (13 years) boyfriend of 7 years developed a crush on me.  Groped me at a party and told me he ""loved me"".  I told my friend.  She confronted her boyfriend and they went to counseling.  Ultimately they decided we couldn't be friends anymore because, ""it's like dangling candy just out of reach of a child.""

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Different friend group, one of my favorite couples ever (11 years) and one of the most chill groups I've ever been part of.  I was at their housewarming party chatting with one of their friend's who is a really fantastic person. She had just filed for divorce because she found out her husband had been cheating of her with other guys.  Ironically, she mentioned she would have been fine with him experimenting if he would have told her.

&amp;#x200B;

4 - Same friend group, same housewarming party.  It's worth mentioning this couple knew about event #2.  Additionally I had no idea the boyfriend was bi/curious before this event.  Leaving the housewarming party and the hosting couple's boyfriend stops me just outside the front door.  Asks me if I want to go to the side of the house for a blowjob.  I told him no and explained why.  Some weeks go by and I invite them to a brunch with some other friends.  Receive a message that ""we can no longer hang out.""

&amp;#x200B;

5 - My cousin's girlfriend of 14 years cheated on her with a guy.  Cousin forgave her and tried to repair the relationship over the next three years.  She was never able to recover trust and the relationship ended.

&amp;#x200B;

6 - My childhood best friend identifies as bisexual, but is not interested in dating or sex.  However, in college, he wanted to experience dating and sex to ""make sure he wasn't writing it off without reason.""  Our friend group found out about most of this after the fact.  This made me lose a lot of respect for him.  He decided to date a man and woman at the same time to experience both sides at once.  Both partners believed the other was in a one on one relationship with him.  According to the friend, ""it has to be as close to a real relationship as possible or it won't be the full experience.""

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously six experiences **do not** represent the behavior of an entire group. However, because of the actions of these individuals, I do not think I would be able to have a successful relationship with someone who identifies as bisexual.  Even if he was the most committed and communicative person, these past experiences have made it very difficult for me to implicitly trust a partner.  I think that distrust, unfounded as it may be, would ultimately become exhausting and win."

al21cb,10,2019-01-29,Greedy Youtuber brother.,thiccbarbie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/al21cb/greedy_youtuber_brother/,"So, my brother is a YouTuber who gets around 6k a month for making (to me) pretty low quality videos that only contain of him screaming at his computer because of course, loud = comedy. He is 21 and I am 19. We've never been on really good terms because id always be very distant towards him. But that is because he used to bully me a lot when we were younger. He'd call me fat, ugly and ordered me to go to school 10 minutes later because he did not want to walk with me to school. He never wanted to be seen with me like I'm some huge disgrace. We were 9 to 11 at that time. Then when we were in high school, he forbid me to greet him in the hall ways. So yeah... never really liked the guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I was looking for my hoodie, since it was nowhere to be seen I asked him if he'd seen it anywhere. His response was ""no, but you can take mine"". I thought, wow that's the first time he did something genuinely nice and selfless. I took the offer and I appreciated it.

Later that day I found the hoodie I was looking for in the laundry, I picked it out and looked at the state of it. There was some kind of black imprint on a big part of the hoodie. Knowing that I did not do this and nothing else could've logically caused that, I knew he did it. However, I thought oh well, I'll ask him about it when I see him. 

So today, after having a long and stressful day at my internship, I see him and confront him about it. I was not mad at all. I told him ""Hey you wore my hoodie huh"", to which he gave a bullshit excuse as to why he did it. But I told him that I didn't care, he can wear my hoodie, but if the huge stain doesn't come out then please take it to the dry cleaners or buy a replacement. Why I put emphasis on it is because it's a 90 euro hoodie, which for me is a huge splurge since I am a student and i'm saving up for a 3 month long stay abroad, also for my studies. 

Upon me showing him the stain that he created, he denies he did it. I told him that it's okay, you might've not noticed it, however it happened while you had it so please take responsibility for it. He did not want to take that responsibility. Here is when comes my mother into play. I love her to pieces, but she always likes to protect him for some reason. So instead of siding with me, she tries to blame the stain on anything but him. This did get me a little annoyed, since she ALWAYS does this. So we get into a petty argument. 

My brother then jumps in and says ""I don't have to pay for anything if I don't want to so you better start being nice for your sake"". I lost it here. See, my brother boasts over making 6k a month a lot. Which I am happy he does! Youtube is his thing, awesome. However, the guy who just bought 700 euro Balenciagas, can afford to lose 90 bucks, right? So I told him. To which his response was ""oh so you're jealous, you're jealous, you're jealous, you're jealous, you're broke, you're jealous because you're broke, you have no aspirations and you're broke so you're jealous"" while yelling. That whole you're jealous, broke and don't have any ambitions (I do by the way, a lot of them) kept going on for 5 minutes. 5 minutes of continuous yelling and me just staring at him while he completely puts me down and humiliates me. During that time I was trying to speak over his yelling but it didn't work. While he was yelling I was looking at my mother, waiting for her to tell her son that the way he speaks to me is wrong. she didn't. Which made me even more angry. 

So I got into an even bigger argument with my mom for letting him degrade me all he wants and then still making me out to be the bad guy. My mother REFUSED to put him in his place and directly went back to blaming me. 

I think it is painfully ironic that someone who earns 6k a month is too greedy to pay for something he destroyed. What is even worse is that like always, I am the bad guy in this situation and everybody is angry at me. 

I just wanted my hoodie man. 

So yeah, I might sound stupid because I am complaining about the most first world problem ever. But it genuinely hurts that my mother always picks the side of my actual bully. The bullying she allowed to happen. It feels like she loves my brother and couldn't care any less about me. I despise my brother, he is a terrible brother. So my message to you is, half of these nice looking youtubers you see online can be actual scumbags in real life. "

al25an,0,2019-01-29,Friend (25F) feels that I (25F) am overwhelmingly judgemental of the men she dates. 3 yr. friendship.,securitykey1420,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/al25an/friend_25f_feels_that_i_25f_am_overwhelmingly/,"Sally is one of my best friends (we've known each other for 3 years)- we have a number of friends in common, and I very much enjoy her company. She's extroverted, driven, and very charismatic. I think the world of her, and I'm trying to find a good line between being a good listener (just hearing how she's feeling without trying to fix) and giving genuine feedback when we talk about the men she's dating.

Last night, this tension came to a head for us. She works in investment banking, and it's a classic high stress ""boys' club"" environment. She works really hard in her position there, and I know she's invested in making that environment work for her in the short term. She mentioned, in passing, that she was chatting with a colleague (also her crush, they've slept together) in a different department about his intern, and she mentioned that his intern was wearing an inappropriately short skirt. He chatted back, ""that's why I hired her."" I had a very strong reaction to that conversation- I found it degrading and deeply inappropriate. A supervisor speaking that way about me would be my worst nightmare, and I shared that feeling with her. She told me that she didn't see that conversation the same way- from her point of view, they're close friends, and that's the kind of conversation their office environment fosters. She saw my very strong negative feedback as 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater,' or dismissing and judging a man who is otherwise kind, smart, and passionate, for an unfortunate remark. For me, talking about a woman subordinate that way is inexcusable and a dealbreaker. For what it's worth, I understand that I might not be an objective friend- I was briefly seeing, and also slept with this man before they worked together, and I get it- he's charming and handsome. I don't think that experience clouded my feedback (I don't have feelings for him now) but who knows.

In confronting me about my response to her colleague's comment, she mentioned other times I've passed judgment on the men she's dating. She's right- from my point of view, she's dated a few bad matches, and it's entirely possible that my feedback about them left her feeling patronized. First, there was an emotionally abusive older man, David, and after a yelling fight between them at my friend's birthday party (she was my +1, he happened to be at the same bar), I asked her to take a look at an emotional abuse checklist. She was walking on eggshells around David, he ridiculed things she admired about herself, forced her to apologize for reasonable behavior, and punished her (by ignoring her or mocking her) when he perceived that she had misbehaved. From her point of view, that was very heavy-handed of me, and I couldn't see the good in him. I can absolutely admit that I never looked for the good in him- the emotional abuse was all I saw. I actually never told her how much work I had to put into cleaning up after her, emotionally, at that party. Some of the other guests felt that she'd ruined that night, and I apologized for her and put a lot of energy into repairing my friendship with the host of that party- I never invited Sally back to an event with that friend, she wouldn't have been happy to see Sally. That's not something Sally asked me to do, so definitely not her responsibility, but that memory definitely plays into my feelings about David.

After that, there was Ian, who plays in her local softball league. She slept with Ian a few times, and then he got into a relationship with someone else. When Sally found out, she pursued him relentlessly, and eventually slept with him. He cheated on his partner with her. She's not responsible for his behavior or cheating. I did feel that her pursuit of him was unhealthy (when they woke up in bed together after he cheated, he asked her if she felt like she'd won. She said yes.) I told her that I found him skeezy and that I didn't like him.

Then there was her roommate, Steve. She slept with Steve, Steve fell in love with her, and she didn't reciprocate. They've continued to sleep together and fight not infrequently, though she tells me that she feels comfortable, smart, and respected when she spends time with him- all good things, and she deserves to feel that way about herself. Steve's in therapy, and it looks like he's increasingly able to separate their relationship from his emotional well-being. That said, I overheard him saying some unkind things about Sally to a third roommate at their house Christmas party, so I suspect he's not quite as comfortable with their tenuous friends-with-benefits situation as he claims. I repeated what he'd said to Sally when she wondered why their third roommate was being rude to her. Steve, at some point, also developed a flirtatious relationship with a fourth roommate (bear with me, big house) and they grew close to the exclusion of Sally. The fourth roommate has since moved out, and Steve tells Sally that she should 'forgive the fourth roommate for her betrayal (with him, to be clear) and move on.' I'm not a huge fan of Steve. He's less of an obvious jerk than Ian or David, but at a minimum, what they're doing is probably unhealthy.

She's dated a few great guys too, and ultimately didn't feel chemistry with them- that's life! As I'm thinking over her frustration with me for harsh criticism of these men, I think I'm missing a really important piece of feedback- she's the common denominator here. Aside from the abusive partner, she's contributing to the unhealthy dynamics in these scenarios, and she's an adult making her own decisions. I've never told her how frustrating I sometimes find her own behavior, just criticized the men. Realistically, it's often her behavior around them that upsets me more than the men themselves. How can I talk to her about this productively and keep the supportive, wonderful friendship we have when we're not talking about dating and sex?

tl;dr: Friend dates jerks, often has unhealthy relationship behavior of her own. I criticize the men, but rarely her, and she feels that I'm overly critical of the men she dates. I want to keep our friendship, but need to know how I can communicate about this healthily and productively."
al29dx,1,2019-01-29,Workload Temperature Check (and advice on managing it),CareerAdviceAnon,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/al29dx/workload_temperature_check_and_advice_on_managing/,"Wanted to touch base and get advice from more experienced marketers about my workload and advice on how to manage and grow in my current job as I develop my marketing career. Using a throwaway for safety.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some background:**

My marketing training and history was a bit niche as I was part of a very large marketing team ( I was on a community team that had around 10 people to manage global presence. We focused on the social channels via organic and paid media as well as supporting events via coverage and also ran influencer marketing for the company).

I've since moved on to a new role at a new company as ""marketing manager"". We have one solid product category that serves as the core revenue generation and as such everyone on my marketing team supports that and I'm a bit of a 1 man marketing team that covers the other half of our products.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Workload**

Looking at our production calendar this year I'll be responsible for the marketing of 56 products (avg of more than one a week). These fit within 3 main categories and each category have different high level motivations for buying. There are, imo, some overlapping personas but largely the reason for purchases are quite different. (That being said this company is a bit old school and i've never really had a discussion of persona with anyone here).  It's also worth mentioning that we operate as both b2b and b2c.

&amp;#x200B;

So when it comes to launches the types of things I'm expected to do for these are:

* web banners of various sizes
* b2b sales documents
* landing pages
* Emails
* solicit editorial
* write an annoucement
* create blog content
* social posts
* Create video content
* ship to and manage influencers/reviewers

On top of this I have a few other high priority items taking away my time:

* Managing social channels in general
* Creating promotional materials for events and for b2b business to use for in-store marketing ( kind of like channel marketing)
* Helping the event manager plan and execute events that relate to my side of the business ( this includes travel 4-5 times a year and being out up to a week each time)
* Meetings ( probably 4 hours of meetings a week).

On top of all of this all three of these categories are in a bit of a growth phase and are much less mature than the core business i.e. these products need time and attention that I just can't give to each of them without abandoning other things.

I do have an intern who has been helping a bit and the company is generally forgiving when some things get dropped/squeezed.

My main problem is I feel like I don't have enough time to do anything well because i'm left scrambling to just get a bare minimum together for everything and I""m worried it will impact my career going forward. I don't want to be here for 3 years and not have any solid wins and it's kind of wrecking havoc on my self-esteem ( i.e. has me doubting my abilities)

Is this type of workload typical in marketing? (I've only done this for two companies so far). If it is how do you manage the workload?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: I'm in my second marketing job and the workload feels insane ( 56 product launches next year for me alone to market). Is this normal? How to cope / any advice on what to focus on over the next year to make sure I can transition into my next role?"
al2low,3,2019-01-29,How long would it take you to put this behind you?,b000tanist,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/al2low/how_long_would_it_take_you_to_put_this_behind_you/,"Needing advice because I feel stuck. I found out in October my boyfriend of almost 6 years made out with someone at a party, exchanged numbers, then attempted to meet up with her the following day.

This occurred last January, and it wasn't until a girl I knew from high school who witnessed the whole thing told me; let's call her Rachel. Rachel messaged me saying it was her friend Sophia that my boyfriend made out with, that my boyfriend told them he could get them into a bar he worked at (they were underage), and tried to convince Sophia to go back with him to the apartment we shared (I was doing an internship across the country and wasn't there at the time).

The next day, the two set up a trap to see if he would fall for it: Sophia invited my boyfriend to meet her at a frat party, and he agreed. When he tried to get in, they denied him and pointed out he had a girlfriend and that Rachel knew me. Rachel didn't divulge any more details, but just said that she thought I should know.

In between January and October, my boyfriend never once mentioned anything about this, didn't act any differently, or show any sign that he had done something behind my back. It wasn't until I gave him an opportunity to confess that he did.  He blamed it on missing me while I was away, how drunk he was (the first day, not the day after), how he was poorly influenced by his friend who had recently broken up with his own girlfriend, how our own relationship was in a rough patch, etc. I don't think he actually slept with Sophia as Rachel didn't mention it, and my boyfriend said he remembered waking up alone in our bed. However, trying to meet up with her the following day while he was sober and could reflect on the night before is what I find absolutely unacceptable.

It's been very difficult for me to trust him again, and I'm starting to wonder if I've just fallen into unproductive pit of bitterness and resentment. He's apologized, taken responsibility, and tried to be a better boyfriend, but it just feels like damage control. Perhaps the fear that he will do it again after we have made bigger commitments to each other (marriage, kids) is preventing me from putting this in the past. Maybe it's because I've begun looking deeper into what he's done in the past, and holding that against him as well.

If it was your partner, would this mistake be a big deal to you? Am I being unreasonable by failing to forgive him by now? I really want to move past this and trust him again, and I think if I just had affirmation from others that I was being unfair to him, it would be easier to put it behind me. Anyways, thanks for reading and any insights you might have!"
al2m7d,303,2019-01-29,AITA For Getting 2 Women at my office fired?,Remote_Trust,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/al2m7d/aita_for_getting_2_women_at_my_office_fired/," 

I'm 22 and been a sales rep at a software company part time since about 2017, after I graduated in June I was brought on full time to be a Account Executive (salesman). Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.

This software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.

My first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.

I brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.

When he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.

AITA for this?"

The tl;dr is that I am, on the surface, an OK person... but everyone eventually does not like me after some sort of voodoo related bad luck. EVERYONE... If the background is too long, skip ahead to ""yesterday""

So I was supremely unlikeable for pretty much all of school. I try my hardest a lot of the time and I think people just don't relate to me. I can think of, specifically, events that took place all throughout my life that stand out as ""yea, see, everyone DOES hate you."" I don't know what it is about me but these things need to stop. The most recent one was yesterday.

Middle school: I ""dressed up"" to play an improv part in english class as part of an assignment (we had to have an accessory like a tie or hat or whatever) and the period before, I was focused on science lab and I knocked brown solution all over my shirt. My teacher even had to call poison control to make sure I didn't need to go be seen by a doctor. My english teacher said I needed to stop screwing around in class and it was all my fault and gave me a zero for not wearing the shirt and tie I previously had on. I cried for the rest of the day.

High school: I was talking to a few people near me about how I always wanted to be a cheerleader but my dad didn't let me. He personally didn't like the cheerleaders at his school and wanted me to pick a different sport. I am (still) sad that I missed out on the opportunity. The same day, a student with Downs Syndrome escaped their class room and everyone had to go on lock down while the rooms were searched. Someone asked what they looked like and I mentioned the typical signs of Downs Syndrome (slanted eyes, short). I was called into the principals office for threatening cheerleaders and calling ""r****** ugly."" They wanted to remove me from the class entirely but didn't because there was no class to transfer to. That class was one of the first time I thought I had friends.

High school job: Older-than-me long time employee is super hot (I'm a girl, so is she) and she would wear short shorts and tube tops, all skin tight. I was jealous. I one day found out she had kids and was also pregnant again and I exclaimed how great she looked, I'd never have guessed, how lucky she was to still dress like that and how I wish I could pull off those outfits. I was reported to the manager for these comments and told that it wasn't working out at that job. Not ""fired"", but no longer on the schedule.

Early 20's job: I am due for a promotion at a company I LOVE! It's a coffee shop. Customers and employees and lots of human contact. Very LGBT friendly city and shop. I'm tasked with training a new employee and he is asking me about other people in the shop. When I started, the manager said to me ""SO and So is super hot, he's actually a model. Don't bother trying though, because he's gay."" (hindsight, that was inappropriate for the manager to say to me). I am telling that story to the new guy and I am suddenly a gay basher. I did not get fired but the district manager had to speak to me. I lost my promotion that was weeks away and was literally the most hated employee at that store and turned into the scapegoat for a lot of things that would go wrong.

Ok, Yesterday: I have to be super vague because my career path is niche AF. I play a support/educational role for a very specific issue people have. Recently, I have had the same issue myself so I stoped working in that role and would attend meetings along side people who would have otherwise been my clients. Yesterday, I was called last minute to run the support group instead of just attend and I agreed. The director of the group called me to warn me that I recently gave a full ""treatment"" plan to a peer of mine who only took half of my advice and is now suffering because she didn't follow the entire plan. The gist of the conversation is that I was not careful with the information I gave out and can be liable in the future if that happens, putting entire support group's reputation at risk. This is medical adjacent so this is something doctors and nurses could hear about through the grapevine and start telling people not to attend our groups. So now I'm sick to my stomach and I feel like a real screw up... and I have to go run the group for the first time as a leader, not an attendee.

Anyways, I show up 30 minutes early (other leaders show up late on occasion, we're all busy) and I get the room all set up (usually attendees put out their own chairs when the leaders are late) and I'm just trying to present myself in the best way possible. I set up a table and an expensive scale that people use to track specific progress. (sorry, vague is necessary). The attendees trickle in and the room is 75% full and I realize I need to use the scale before I introduce myself so I run over and do so. The entire table collapses and crashes to the floor and everyone is staring at me... I now have to introduce myself as the professional. Not to mention, had someone else used the scale before me, it could have caused grave injury... like SERIOUS 911 ER injury. I am sick to my stomach and grateful that it was me. Horrified. I fortunately made a joke ""Now that I've tested the table, feel free to use the scale!"" No attendee made any comment otherwise. I just feel like I'm going to be on the outs with this entire group of professional support people after my FIRST TRY.

I just don't know what it is. It's like I'm seriously stupid. The whole ""fake it till you make it"" is backwards where it's ""Trick people that you've already made it and then fail catastrophically.""

I am currently attempting to change job positions within the same niche field that would give me legitimate licensure and I would be able to change insurance for consultations, so I need this group. I've also been promised an internship through them and I was elected to serve on the board of their non-profit. It's not like I'm some weird outsider... Like, I pushed my way in while using them as support people and proved myself as a support person... and now, I get a chance and it blows up in my face.

I think I have adult ADD. I also think I might have aspergers or ASD in some way. I just don't understand how my entire life has been dotted with epic failures and hugely embarrassing events. Everyone around me seems SO PUT TOGETHER and yea, maybe they go home and fight with their husband or they have depression or polish off an entire gallon of ice cream and that's ~their journey~ but they at least present themselves in a way where people don't literally hate them.

Even last week, I was with friends and one of them got a bad diagnosis for their back, and they are frustrated because they are athletic. I said something positive like ""hey, knowledge is power! Now you get to train with your back issues in mind and not feel frustrated when you are doing this that would hurt your back because you know about it!"" And he turns to me and was like ""well DUHHHH, thats what this sport is ALLL ABOUTTT"" and I'm just sitting there in my head like ""why did I even bother talking? I was trying to be supportive and I just feel stupid now.""

I really just feel like a dumb cow and I don't want to try anymore. That is all."

Here is what he sent me:So I’ve been on probation for a year now for two felony drug possession charges and two misdemeanor charges originating in Vermont. Since beginning probation I’ve stopped taking drugs and drastically limited my alcohol consumption. I also applied to get into a masters program, got in, and will be getting an MS in accounting this summer. I worked my ass off and landed an extremely competitive internship with one of the top big four firms. I explained all of this to my PO who really doesn’t even answer most of my calls. Since starting probation I have no violations.Fast forward to January 11, and I had to take a random screen in the middle of work at a sketchy location near Boston medical (methadone clinic). I walked in and you could already tell nobody there gives a shit about what’s going on around them. I signed in, met some random guy, he gave me a cup to pee in, and I asked if I needed to show my medical marijuana card or if I needed to sign anything (the court I go to usually makes you sign a form for the test) and he said no you’re good to go.Last night I got out of work at 9, home at 940 to a letter saying I violated my probation for alcohol, and have to go in Monday at 10am (it’s busy season and internship, can’t miss a day this is very crucial timing for me and I work 8am-8pm nearly every day) and also sign up for regular substance abuse counseling for something I didn’t do during I time I cannot afford to spare any. If I miss any days for something like this, I’m not going to get a job offer after this, and all of my work the past year and a half will have been for nothing. I have been doing everything in my absolute power to turn my life around and the court system is the only thing that keeps pulling me back. What do I do? It’s obviously my word against theirs which is seemingly meaningless, especially when I can’t even spare a day during this extremely crucial 10 week period (there are 6 more weeks left before the completion of the internship). I contacted a lawyer who said I’d be looking at a 5K bill for this. Please help

al37fx,36,2019-01-29,Just became a digital marketing intern at a nonprofit that's slowly failing on almost every social media platform. Looking for advice on how to grow Instagram.,auragoId,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/al37fx/just_became_a_digital_marketing_intern_at_a/,"Hi r/marketing! I was hoping to get some advice from a few of you that have been working in the field long and/or may have some experience in non-profits. 

I’m currently interning for a non-profit as a digital marketing intern. The non-profit focuses on international aid and relief. I’m mainly in charge of curating content that is relatable but informative in order to grow our Instagram and the engagement that we get on there. We currently have around 1500 followers but we only get around 30-40 likes per post. We’re based in California and most of our donors are private donors — and the rest of our funds come from the government, so we don’t have much interaction from donors and such on our social media platforms.

In the past two years or so, we’ve also faced a huge problem with decreased government funding due to administration changes. Additionally, a lot of our donors have dropped and moved their donations to support domestic aid instead of international aid. This has further decreased our social media engagement since many of our donors do not care to engage with us anymore. 

This is all to say that we are struggling to keep up with social media. Facebook has almost dropped completely and because Instagram is my responsibility, I want to provide at least several results by the end of my internship here but I’m having a hard time knowing where to start.

We have 0 funds for Instagram/Facebook ads to grow our social.  Right now, I’m posting every single day, once a day at 4am PST (this seems to be the time we get the most likes). I’m also attempting to curate a list of hashtags that perform well for us, but still, we only get around 40 likes per post. We’ve only grown from 1300 followers to 1500 followers in the span of ~2 years.

Is there any advice or general commentary that anyone could provide? "

al50xv,1,2019-01-29,Help acquiring last minute interview outfit for luxury brand in NYC,saghostie,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/al50xv/help_acquiring_last_minute_interview_outfit_for/," 

Hello all, I’m kind of crossing my fingers that this post is at least somewhat relevant enough to enough people on this subreddit to make it not annoying.

So, post is as my title states. I have an interview for a simple internship at a luxury fashion company based in NYC. I was offered the interview today and will be going in Thursday morning.

That leaves me with tomorrow to shop for an outfit. I honestly don’t have anything in my closet right now suited for the interview- not a blazer, not even a cardigan or white button up shirt.

I know there so many stores I could start at tomorrow, but as time is limited I want to make sure I’m efficient. I’m willing to spend up to around $200 depending on how many pieces of clothing (I really don’t even have a good pair of shoes, though I have low ankle boot stiletto that is burgundy I might want to incorporate).

I don’t wear pants at all - only skirts and dresses. I’m not sure I even need a “suit” so much as something that is suited for an interview but not like law school interview. I’ve been eyeing vest/skirt combos online for a bit but didn’t expect an interview so soon.

My personal style preference inclines towards creative professional but I’m definitely of the age where I love ASOS and ShopBop type brands; big fan of pinstripes and navy too. I would even be happy with a great dress.

I know I’m not being very helpful in my descriptions but I consider this album to be a big inspiration: [https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/6sbin5/creative\_professional\_inspo\_album/](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/6sbin5/creative_professional_inspo_album/)

Where would you go if you were in NY in my position?

Thank you!"
al592v,208,2019-01-29,Features and changes I'd like to see added in 2019,iDetroy,ClashRoyale,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/al592v/features_and_changes_id_like_to_see_added_in_2019/,"Here are some of the things I'd really like to see added to the game this year. Some of these probably have been mentioned many times before, but I still wanted to put everything in one post. Let me know what additions to the game would hype you up again :)  

**1. Friend List**

- Increase the amount of players you can add through your invite link (*Why is there a limit of ""only"" 200 players if you can add way more through Facebook anyway?*)
- Add a ""Favorite"" section above the ""Online"" section, in which you can manually add players yourself and will always be visible on top despite the player(s) being online or not
- Let us sort online friends by either A-Z **or** trophy count

Just a couple of QoL improvements which probably won't affect most players, but would be a welcomed feature for the higher ladder players who have a full friend list.

**2. Shop**

- Remove the feature to buy cards for gems, they just take away 1 spot anyway (*or did anybody hit the 60 Goblins for 30 gems deal yet?*)
- Since you've added that feature already to quests and card requests, let us shuffle the shop once a day using gems
- Slightly increase the chance of cards we are actively playing / requesting to appear in the shop
- Either at least halve the current price for a Legendary Chest or rework the chest to make it a draft chest as well as add 1 Legendary Token (*500 gems for 1 random Legendary is crazy*)
- If you don't want to get rid of the option to let the players buy something for gems, at least let it be a Token instead of 60 Goblins

**3. Battle Deck**

- Add a ""Shuffle"" feature which randomly creates a deck, and give us the option to include / exclude cards from appearing in there, as well as the option to set the amount of spells / win conditions etc. we'd like to get / [Example how it could look like](https://imgur.com/a/wL7vKpD)
- Option to set your ""favorite / main"" deck for ladder, if this deck is not chosen you will get a notification when trying to play ladder 
- More deck slots (*5 are already pretty good, but the more the better :P*)

**4. Training Camp**

- Option to create a deck the Trainer is going to play
- Option to ""take over"" the Trainer in order to play against yourself (for practicing kiting, testing interactions etc.)
- Option for unlimited Elixier &amp; no deck creation limit for yourself


**5. TV Royale**

- Distinguish between players in Legendary Arena and Top 200 players 
- Add another Tab for 12 win Grand-Challenge replays
- Add another Tab for Top 50 player replays with each weekly Tournament 
- Not sure to which extend this is possible, but a ""Replay Archive"" in which you can search for specific decks to learn would be extremely awesome
- Let players submit their own awesome Replays of very close / exciting / funny matches and give others the option to vote on these in order to crown the ""Replay of the Week"" (*also not sure how exactly this could be done, but I'm a big fan of things a community can do together*) 

**6. Quests**

- Reduce the quest points needed in order to get the Legendary Chest (*or completely remove it, as mentioned above it's a useless chest I doubt anybody is happy to have in his quest cycle*)
- Either remove these ""Combo-Quests"" like ""win 3 ladder games with Giant Skeleton and Valkyrie in your deck"" or allow us to do them in any game mode
- New Quests e.G. ""Get 15 Tower Hits with a Hog Rider in any game mode"" - ""Use 1 Trade Token"" etc. (*I'm not really creative, but the current quests are pretty dull and repetitive*)
- Add seasonal Community Quests e.G. ""Destroy 5 billion towers"" for 150-300 Quest Points - Would be kinda cool to see the daily progress and overall activity :) 


**7. Player Profile**

- Let us choose our own ""Favorite Card"" to display in our profile
- Transparent Favorite Card profile background would be amazing / [Example how it could look like](https://imgur.com/a/W1LhZ0Y) (*could look way better if it was done professionally of course :3*)
- When clicking on the Badges show the exact amount of Clan War / Classic &amp; Grand Challenge wins 
- Include the highest amount of wins a player got in a Global Tournament 
- More accurate Clan War stats, right now if somebody has for example 50 War Day wins you don't know if he won 50/50 or maybe 50/150 

**8. Clan &amp; Clan War improvements**

- Save the settings when searching for a clan - Whenever you set the settings to e.G. ""45-49 members + Country XY"" they will reset after you've joined and left 1 clan
- More ways for the Leader to check the activity of his members 
- Longer intern Clan summary box where rules and other stuff can be written down
- More Clan Emblems are long overdue :P
- More than 3 battles to play simultaneously on collection day (really bad in very active clans when everybody wants to play his game once collection day started) 
- More leagues within Legendary league (top clans barely need to try at all to get #1 within their group) 

**9. Trade Tokens** 

- Separate Trading Tab within the clan
- Allow trading between friends / select a certain clan member to trade with
- Maybe throw Common, Rare &amp; Epic Tokens together into 1, many people still lack the fitting tokens in order to trade 
- Like the option to select 4 cards to giveaway, give us the option to select multiple cards we want to receive

**10. Global Tournaments**

- I still don't see the point of having any other level standards than 9 
- Bring back the old Matchmaking until fixing the current one (last Tournament the highest placed players couldn't find a match for multiple hours)

Since some people have mentioned it, I also agree that people shouldn't be able to get up to like 150 wins and only play vs players 4k trophies below themselves, but the current system only matches you with players 2 wins higher or lower than yourself, resulting in extremely high waiting times for the top players which shouldn't be the case. That's why I said change it back **until** it got fixed.

- Please stick to the normal game mode, it's a tournament after all and things like ""Mini Collection"" are purely based on luck, or at least ensure to give people fair card choices. I've played versus people who got to play a 8/8 card 3M Meta deck and I had no single big spell to choose from



**11. Other stuff**

- Let players above 4.000 trophies select their own Arena they want to play in, it's a shame nobody above Challenger I gets to see the new Arena except for the Tournament 
- Permanent 2vs2 Grand &amp; Classic Challenge 
- More cards to request once reaching Legendary Arena 
- More fun Events &amp; Special Challenges 
- Allow us to get Star Power despite not having the card upgraded to 13 - Gaining Star Power takes ages and the costs are extremely high considering that 
- Remove^^Freeze^^^from^^^^the^^^^game


I bet there's tons of other stuff I forgot to mention, but that's some of the things I would like to see the most. There are endless possibilities on how to make this game so much better, and I'm really looking forward for what the next big update brings. Also huge thanks to Supercell for these weekly update posts, great to see communication now being focused on more :)

al5skz,7,2019-01-29,KPMG Wollongong,MiraIsBestOp,wollongong,https://www.reddit.com/r/wollongong/comments/al5skz/kpmg_wollongong/,"Hey all,

I’m a student in NZ hoping to get an internship (or a graduate job next year) in Australia. I’ve had my eyes on Sydney and Melbourne for a while, but I’ve figured that I’ll have a whole lot more people to compete with for the internships so I thought choosing a smaller city for this Big 4 internship might increase my chances (given they have the same amount of spots to offer...)

Although I’ve gotta ask, are there any people here who have experiences applying to KPMG Wollongong? Would also love to hear some tips if someone managed to get in, and if different office locations have different preferences for roles (e.g. Financial Risk, Audit)

Second, how’s the city in general? E.g housing, places of interest etc. I’d love to know more :) I’ve only got one choice to pick for the location I want to work in, so I’m kind of tied between Wollongong and Adelaide.

Cheers everyone!!"
al70s2,2,2019-01-29,I’ve done it again. Stupid google.,WhiteChocolatey,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/al70s2/ive_done_it_again_stupid_google/,"I wasn’t even thinking about the frickin’ health problems (any more than usual). I looked up what it felt like to have large tonsils, because my doctor’s intern has acknowledged I have large tonsils. I was thinking it would explain this weird feeling in my neck.

What turns up first, of course?

“Call your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms”
- Pain on one side of the throat (something I now am freaking out over. I clearly have some sort of sensation on my left side of my neck and throat)
-difficulty swallowing (Jesus Christ, this one I can never tell. I CAN swallow, food goes down, water goes down, but maybe it’s difficult? It feels difficult)
-fever
-enlarged or swollen lymph nodes in the neck (define large or swollen, ffs. Mine always seem to be... I think. Though my ENT has told me they don’t seem alarmingly large)
-white or yellow coating on the tonils (I’ve got white coating on my tongue... probably from not brushing today or yesterday sadly as I’m detoxing from a minor alcohol addiction and that’s been my sole focus, fuck everything else)

Anyone got any pointers? Now I have to schedule yet another doctors appointment before psychosis takes me. Hope one of you living in reality right now can talk me out of fearing death tonight or in the next week. God I need a drink.

al7xhp,2,2019-01-29,AITA for asking my fiancé to help out more around the house?,squirrels-on-parade,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/al7xhp/aita_for_asking_my_fiancé_to_help_out_more_around/,"Some background: my fiancé (24m) and I (26f) have been living together for about a month. Previously we both lived with our parents. I however, have lived on my own before, just moved back for financial reasons. My fiancé on the other hand has never lived alone. My fiancé’s parents used to rent the house we currently live in and after they moved out, my fiancé said he wanted to “live like a bachelor before I moved in” which is fine by me. He kept delaying my moving in for almost a month longer than anticipated, eventually citing that he “wanted to learn what it takes to run a house and realize all the things his mom did” for him so he didn’t take me for granted. 

Since moving in (and before really, when I’d stay on the weekends) I have shouldered the majority of the household work. Cooking, cleaning, laundry etc. I have a job, internship and grad school all going on at the same time meaning that most days I leave the house at 7 am and don’t get home until 6, 8, or even 11 pm. On the days I’m home early, I don’t mind having to do dishes or cook or take out trash but on the long days, that is the last thing I feel like doing when I get home. 

Now, I understand that my fiancé doesn’t feel like doing this stuff right when he gets home either, and I definitely do not think he should be waiting on me but when I get home at 11 pm and see a sink full of dishes, or an overflowing trash can I get frustrated knowing he had all night to clean up. 

I brought up the issue that I needed/wanted more help around the house and was met with a “well, you always do the dishes before I get the chance. I’d do them before I go to bed but I go to bed late and you already have them done.” Except there have been nights where I’ve decided not to do anything and there will still be dishes or trash piled up when I get up the following morning. 

Anything that I said next during he conversation was met with “well you just need to ask me to do it” and once I stated that I shouldn’t have to ask for help with these basic things, he curtly replied, “fine. I’ll help more.” I ended the conversation and walked away so a larger argument didn’t start. 

So, AITA for asking my fiancé to contribute more to keeping our house clean without having to prompt him to do it?

al7z42,2,2019-01-29,I feel like an absolute failure.,crigs2019,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/al7z42/i_feel_like_an_absolute_failure/,"I'm a senior in high school, and I've been struggling with depression since I was thirteen. Last semester was the worst period of my life so far, and I was isolated because of work and school (I spent all my time at work, internship, and doing schoolwork). I lost all motivation and ended up falling really behind, getting terrible grades, and I failed my math class. I've always been a high achiever and would push my mental health to the limit to succeed, but I'm burning out. My school is giving me options to regain credit, but I feel like I've let my parents down. I feel like my peers and friends think I'm stupid now. I'm accepted to a prestigious college but I feel like I shouldn't be because of this failure. My self-esteem is at an all time low. I'm supposed to graduate in three months, and I just feel like I can't make it that far. It's taking a toll on my mental AND physical health. I feel sick to my stomach all the time, and I gained so much weight because I eat when I'm stressed and I barely left the house to go to school, much less the gym. On Thursday (1/31) I'm allowed to retake my final exam from last semester, and I have to pass the final to pass the class. There's just so much pressure and it's crushing me. I can't disappoint my parents--I could potentially lose my scholarships or have my college acceptance rescinded when I worked so hard the last four years. It just makes me feel like the biggest fuck-up while I watch my friends skate through their last semester and have loads of fun before they graduate while I'm reaching (what feels like) close to rock-bottom. I wish there was some way to quit or to stop time or to take a step back, but time keeps moving forward, and I'm about to turn 18 and be thrust into adulthood amongst this mess I'm in."
al87m9,15,2019-01-29,Brett's Suicide: A Creepypasta,TheIrishOtaku,drunkenpeasants,https://www.reddit.com/r/drunkenpeasants/comments/al87m9/bretts_suicide_a_creepypasta/,"I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn't one.

I was a patron at Drunken Peasants Studios for a year in 2015 for my degree in shitposting. It wasn't paid of course, most patron spots aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most stoner teens at the time would go crazy over it.

Now, since I worked directly with the Peasants, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made episode 166 and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the episode 170 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several days.

Me and two other patrons were in the  skype call along with Ben and Scotty for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""Episode 170"" and gathered around the screen to watch part of it. Now, given that it isn't final yet the Peasants often put up a mock title card for some clips, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""How sex doesn't work"" instead of ""The Beast says size dosent matter'' when the Beast acts like a cringy incel. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""Brett's Suicide"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke.

One of the patrons did a small throat laugh at it. The Final Jesus theme plays as is normal. The video began with Brett introducing his various social media sites, attempting to breathe, hitting a few sour notes like normal with his ass. We hear his waterhead laughing outside and Brett stops, yelling at her to keep it down as he has a video to make that will destroy TJ and needs to concentrate. Waterhead says okay and goes to see her friend with Dorn. A shitty jumpcut envelops the screen and we see the start of Brett's real video. This is when things began to seem off.

While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (at this point sound is synced up with animation, so, yes, that's not common) but when he stops talking, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. Suddenly somehow we see the Peasants actually watching the video on screen. There is slight murmuring among them before they begin to boo him. Not normal trolling booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malice in it. Brett's in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the Peasants, with Egghead (on his patron spot) in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the hosts, we didn't question its appeal to stoners yet.

The shot goes to Brett sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his trailer window is of a night sky so it isn't very long after the video. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It's as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (flippers) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Brett's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.

Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I've had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced.

Ben paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn't have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road.

The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child's death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke.

The screen flipped back to Brett, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeared to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo.

Ben was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer's shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed.

About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Brett went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his flippers down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams.

Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames.

Ben was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. Ben proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the other patrons  gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink.

Ben told us to stop, he had to call in TJ to see this. TJ arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so Ben just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Brett was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said ""DO IT"" and we see in Brett's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.

TJ is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know what the heck was going on. Most people left the skype call at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I'm sorry I stayed.

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the skype call to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does.

There was an investigation due to the nature of the photos, but nothing came of it. No child seen was identified and no clues were gathered from the data involved nor physical clues in the photos. I never believed in unexplainable phenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can't prove anything about it beyond anecdotal evidence, I think twice about things."
al884g,4,2019-01-29,School configured MacBook - won't allow access to certain sites or any VPNs,aaronk2002,ComputerSecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerSecurity/comments/al884g/school_configured_macbook_wont_allow_access_to/,"I've got a school configured MacBook Air running High Sierra that I've gotta get working for normal use. At the moment, I do have admin access to it, but the problem is that it won't connect to certain websites, nor to any VPNs that I've tried using to circumvent school filters.

My guess is that the school is blocking all outbound connections to anything not on their whitelist, but I can't figure out how they're blocking it! I've checked all the proxy settings and network configuration and I don't see anything out of the ordinary there, so my best guess is the configuration profiles.

There are a number of configuration profiles on the computer, but I've already removed anything that I think could pertain to network access/blocking (I've removed the ""Restrictions"" one and the ""Proxy"" one.). I'm doing my best to remove as little as possible to avoid any suspicion. The profiles left are:

* Device Manager - this is my best guess as to how they're blocking outbound connections. The description doesn't state anything about filtering but it's the most likely candidate.
* Kext extensions - figure I'd better not mess with kexts
* Finder profile - all this appears to do is force our login window to autofill our school-issued username
* Login window profile - same as above
* Software update profile - I assume this is just to update school-issued apps
* District organization CA certificate - I don't think this is the filtering either. We have a district ""app catalog"" portal to download school-issued apps, so I'm pretty sure this is just for security/access control for the portal.

There's also a VPN called GlobalProtect that runs normally, but I've already figured out how to disable that. The one other thing that might be causing the problem is VMware Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub, which is running 24/7. I've honestly got no idea as to what this app can and can't do, and I haven't found a way to disable it yet.

All that said, does anyone have any idea as to what may be causing the inability to access websites and VPNs? I'd really appreciate any help, as I'm stumped!

P. S. Yes, I realize I'm a student trying to bypass school-issued restrictions, so I understand if you'd rather not help me because of that. I am aware of any possible penalties should I be caught and I'm willing to take responsibility for my actions. However, I would like to provide some explanation; I'm participating in a CS internship over the summer that requires me to have a laptop, and I don't have a personal laptop or the money to buy one, leaving me with my school-issued one. A number of sites that I often use, as well as software downloads and servers that I may need to access (like my home server, in case I have work on there), are blocked. As such, I really need to unlock my school laptop so that I can actually get work done during the course of my internship. Thanks for reading, and I really do appreciate any help/expertise any of you may be able to provide :)"
al8ktv,1,2019-01-29,I [19/M] fucked up so bad with my ex girlfriend [20/F] and I'm worried I scarred her for life,LordWilliamII,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/al8ktv/i_19m_fucked_up_so_bad_with_my_ex_girlfriend_20f/,"Hi, this is Will. So my ex is 20, and I am 19. We both go to the same college. We dated for a year and 3 months. She broke up with me on December 26th of 2018. She had multiple reasons for breaking up with me, she begged me to stop smoking pot, she begged me to buy her flowers and write her notes, and I didn't do any of that. In her past, her first boyfriend raped, sodomised, and beat her. He also stalked her when they broke up for a long time. She gave me reasons like ""We're just different people"", ""We can't love each other the way that we need"", ""I feel like I need time to get to know myself"", etc. I didn't realize of course that I wasn't being the best boyfriend towards the end of our relationship until it was over. 


When I was smoking, our sex life plummeted. At one point we didn't have sex for like a month and a week or something like that. Honestly we had a very strong and magical relationship all up until I started smoking pot all the time. Her family and friends loved me, and she wanted to marry me and grow old with me. She even came to go to school at the university we're at to be closer to me, and she also stayed with me for the summer and got an internship in our town so we could basically live together. The relationship didn't really start to take a bad turn until the last 4 months or so. Of course though, I didn't give her the space she needed. I completely quit smoking the day after the breakup. Over the month, she slowly deleted pics of us on social media (I think it took her around 3 weeks to do all of them), and she left one of them up, the one from our one year anniversary. I was doing the wrong thing and I kept trying to make sure she was doing okay by contacting her friends and her sister (her sister and I were very close to be fair) but she got mad at me about it a few times. I think I did the pleading/promising I can change thing for like the first week and a half of the breakup. After the first time she asked me to stop talking to her friends, I told her I was sorry and that it was wrong for me to do. 


Two days later, her sister, my ex, and her sister's boyfriend were going to a basketball game at our college and my ex texted me ""We're all going to the game tonight. Just thought I'd let you know."" and I was already there with a friend, so I just said ""Okay"" because I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. The following days she was liking everything I was retweeting on twitter and she never even did that when we were dating. I asked her after a few days of that if she wanted to watch a movie or get something to eat. She said she wanted to, and a few hours later she asked me to come to her desk at work (we work at the same place) and she told me her best friend was having some issues with an ex and she was coming into town tonight and she needed to support her, so we wouldn't be able to hang out tonight, but maybe tomorrow. I told her I understood. 

I got a text from her two nights later saying ""We're not getting back together."" I didn't respond. 24 hours later, she drunk dialed me but I was asleep. She apologized in the morning and told me she was at home safe in bed. I told her it was okay and I was glad she was safe. I went into no contact at this point for two weeks. I saw her at work one day and she and I talked briefly and then I gave her a hug and told her it was good to see her. The next morning, I called her and asked if she wanted to go get a cup of coffee with me, she said she wanted to. I told her I was free that Sunday, and then she asked if I wanted to do it that same day. We got coffee and caught up with each other for a little over an hour, and she told me all kinds of stuff. No mention of other guys or the breakup at all. It was nice. I walked her out to her car and gave her a hug and left. A few hours later I texted her and told her it was good to see her but I had something I needed to tell her. She asked me what it was and I told her I couldn't say it over the phone, and she asked me if I was pregnant. At this point we flirted back and forth for a bit, and then she told me I should talk to other girls, I told her I wanted the right person, not a bunch of girls, and she told me she wasn't my person. At this point I didn't say anything. I called her the next day and I asked her out to dinner. She basically hung up halfway through me asking and I was confused and sad. So I did probably the worst thing I could do. I called her ex boyfriend and found out she had actually been hanging out with him since I started smoking again. He told me he never did anything with her but she would come over and talk. He said she was still in love with him, but he didn't love her. He told me he was rooting for me and that the next time she tried to talk to him, he was gonna tell her to go back to me. (Honestly I'm feeling like a piece of shit boyfriend writing this but I'm really focusing on all of the negative things that happened towards the end and during the breakup) . I had also been talking to her sister's boyfriend that day about what had happened, and I think he told my ex's sister and then she confronted my ex about it. She texted me the next evening and told me to stop talking to him about her. I told her I understood. I did. 

The problem however though was that I asked a friend of hers if the friend was doing alright (my ex told me that this friend had been going through a breakup when we got coffee. I was drunk and at first the conversation was about her breakup and then it slowly transitioned into mine. The friend just told me to give her time and let her work out her feelings. My ex messaged me around the time I was talking to her friend about their breakup and she told me ""Don't talk to my friends anymore"" and I said ""What are you talking about"" and she called me insane and said the only reason I care about her well-being is because she told me they've been hanging out. I told her I care about everyone that I meet. She then told me to care about my friends and not hers. She also told me that us getting coffee ""was not like a first date"" which was something I told her sister's boyfriend. I basically sent her an apology text and told her that I haven't handled the breakup in the best way that I could and that I was sorry for not giving her space. I told her all I wanted for her the night I met her was for her to be the happiest she could ever be, and I told her she deserved that more than anyone I know. I told her I wished her the best, and to take care. Unfortunately a few hours later when I was talking to her friend about us, she said ""You're giving me my space but you're still talking to Shelby?"" and ""Will I've literally slept with someone else since we broke up. I'm doing fine. You need to stop talking to my friends."" and I said ""Do you feel happy now?"" and she told me she would be happy when I stopped stalking her and talking to her friends. I replied to that with ""You think I stalk you?"" and she said ""You won't leave me alone even though I tell you to. Yes will I do."" and I texted back ""Have fun"" which looking back on it was such an inconsiderate way to answer that and I feel horrible. 

She texted me the next morning (Today) and asked if I talked to her ex, and when. I told her and she said ""Do you realize how crazy that makes you sound"" and I told her it was a mistake and that I shouldn't have done it. She then proceeded to block me on everything except for snapchat and my phone. One of my friends told me that a few hours later she posted a pic of me on her spam account and it was me making a goofy face and the caption was ""when you have to tell your ex to stop talking to all of your friends because he's fucking crazy"" and around 7 tonight she came to my house and dropped off this bag with every note I had ever wrote her, every piece of jewelry I ever bought her, some blu-rays I bought her, and shirts that I bought for her. She said ""here's your shit"" and then told me that she wished she was dead to me and that she didn't exist in my life, she told me she didn't want me to care about her, that if I see her walking down the street to turn the other fucking way, she brought up that ex that I mentioned that stalked her and told me I was doing the same thing, that she had all of her friends block me on social media, and that I was bi-polar and crazy, and she was literally shaking and had tears in her eyes. She told me that she is so tired of begging me, begging me for space, begging me to touch her, begging me to stop smoking, begging me to be there with her, etc. She told me that if I talk to her friends or her anymore that she is going to start fucking with my life and see how I like it. I just stood there and told her I understood what I did wrong and I was sorry and I would give her the space she's asking for. I didn't cry or beg or anything but after she told me that it didn't count or didn't matter because she was forcing me to give her space at this point. She left then.

tl;dr I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world. I know that now there's nothing I can do but give her space and quit doing all of this crazy shit. This has been an awful breakup that I made so many mistakes in. I know that at this point I probably can't reconcile with her, but I honestly want to learn and change the things that are wrong with me so I don't hurt someone else like I did to my ex. I just thought she was indifferent and didn't care about me at all anymore and I really didn't realize how fucked up it was for me to do this."

al8pc7,1,2019-01-29,Realistic Reach Schools?,INblipsterTJ,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/al8pc7/realistic_reach_schools/,"Now that I've gotten one acceptance, it's given me the confidence and security to apply to some reach schools. I don't want to sell myself short and not apply to any, but there's so many choices and it's hard to determine what sort of reach schools are realistic for me? 

Stats:

3.8x, 15x (really low end), URM

softs: Not getting too specific, but compelling PS, substantial research experience, legal internship, rigorous UG coursework. 

I'd prefer to attend school on the east coast, not crazy about the south past Virginia, but willing to apply to some schools as far as Georgia. 

I don't have unlimited money but I can ""splurge"" a little on applying to some schools I don't have a big chance at. I'm interested in criminal and definitely want to pursue public interest in some capacity.

Any ideas on what reach schools I should look at?"
al8psh,1,2019-01-29,"I need help. My ex girlfriend was raped by her first boyfriend and stalked by him, I fell into stalking her after she dumped me and I'm afraid I've scarred her for life",LordWilliamII,rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/al8psh/i_need_help_my_ex_girlfriend_was_raped_by_her/,"Hi, this is Will. So my ex is 20, and I am 19. We both go to the same college. We dated for a year and 3 months. She broke up with me on December 26th of 2018. She had multiple reasons for breaking up with me, she begged me to stop smoking pot, she begged me to buy her flowers and write her notes, and I didn't do any of that. In her past, her first boyfriend raped, sodomised, and beat her. He also stalked her when they broke up for a long time. She gave me reasons like ""We're just different people"", ""We can't love each other the way that we need"", ""I feel like I need time to get to know myself"", etc. I didn't realize of course that I wasn't being the best boyfriend towards the end of our relationship until it was over. When I was smoking, our sex life plummeted. At one point we didn't have sex for like a month and a week or something like that. Honestly we had a very strong and magical relationship all up until I started smoking pot all the time. Her family and friends loved me, and she wanted to marry me and grow old with me. She even came to go to school at the university we're at to be closer to me, and she also stayed with me for the summer and got an internship in our town so we could basically live together. The relationship didn't really start to take a bad turn until the last 4 months or so. Of course though, I didn't give her the space she needed. I completely quit smoking the day after the breakup. Over the month, she slowly deleted pics of us on social media (I think it took her around 3 weeks to do all of them), and she left one of them up, the one from our one year anniversary. I was doing the wrong thing and I kept trying to make sure she was doing okay by contacting her friends and her sister (her sister and I were very close to be fair) but she got mad at me about it a few times. I think I did the pleading/promising I can change thing for like the first week and a half of the breakup. After the first time she asked me to stop talking to her friends, I told her I was sorry and that it was wrong for me to do. Two days later, her sister, my ex, and her sister's boyfriend were going to a basketball game at our college and my ex texted me ""We're all going to the game tonight. Just thought I'd let you know."" and I was already there with a friend, so I just said ""Okay"" because I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. The following days she was liking everything I was retweeting on twitter and she never even did that when we were dating. I asked her after a few days of that if she wanted to watch a movie or get something to eat. She said she wanted to, and a few hours later she asked me to come to her desk at work (we work at the same place) and she told me her best friend was having some issues with an ex and she was coming into town tonight and she needed to support her, so we wouldn't be able to hang out tonight, but maybe tomorrow. I told her I understood. I got a text from her two nights later saying ""We're not getting back together."" I didn't respond. 24 hours later, she drunk dialed me but I was asleep. She apologized in the morning and told me she was at home safe in bed. I told her it was okay and I was glad she was safe. I went into no contact at this point for two weeks. I saw her at work one day and she and I talked briefly and then I gave her a hug and told her it was good to see her. The next morning, I called her and asked if she wanted to go get a cup of coffee with me, she said she wanted to. I told her I was free that Sunday, and then she asked if I wanted to do it that same day. We got coffee and caught up with each other for a little over an hour, and she told me all kinds of stuff. No mention of other guys or the breakup at all. It was nice. I walked her out to her car and gave her a hug and left. A few hours later I texted her and told her it was good to see her but I had something I needed to tell her. She asked me what it was and I told her I couldn't say it over the phone, and she asked me if I was pregnant. At this point we flirted back and forth for a bit, and then she told me I should talk to other girls, I told her I wanted the right person, not a bunch of girls, and she told me she wasn't my person. At this point I didn't say anything. I called her the next day and I asked her out to dinner. She basically hung up halfway through me asking and I was confused and sad. So I did probably the worst thing I could do. I called her ex boyfriend and found out she had actually been hanging out with him since I started smoking again. He told me he never did anything with her but she would come over and talk. He said she was still in love with him, but he didn't love her. He told me he was rooting for me and that the next time she tried to talk to him, he was gonna tell her to go back to me. (Honestly I'm feeling like a piece of shit boyfriend writing this but I'm really focusing on all of the negative things that happened towards the end and during the breakup) . I had also been talking to her sister's boyfriend that day about what had happened, and I think he told my ex's sister and then she confronted my ex about it. She texted me the next evening and told me to stop talking to him about her. I told her I understood. I did. The problem however though was that I asked a friend of hers if the friend was doing alright (my ex told me that this friend had been going through a breakup when we got coffee. I was drunk and at first the conversation was about her breakup and then it slowly transitioned into mine. The friend just told me to give her time and let her work out her feelings. My ex messaged me around the time I was talking to her friend about their breakup and she told me ""Don't talk to my friends anymore"" and I said ""What are you talking about"" and she called me insane and said the only reason I care about her well-being is because she told me they've been hanging out. I told her I care about everyone that I meet. She then told me to care about my friends and not hers. She also told me that us getting coffee ""was not like a first date"" which was something I told her sister's boyfriend. I basically sent her an apology text and told her that I haven't handled the breakup in the best way that I could and that I was sorry for not giving her space. I told her all I wanted for her the night I met her was for her to be the happiest she could ever be, and I told her she deserved that more than anyone I know. I told her I wished her the best, and to take care. Unfortunately a few hours later when I was talking to her friend about us, she said ""You're giving me my space but you're still talking to Shelby?"" and ""Will I've literally slept with someone else since we broke up. I'm doing fine. You need to stop talking to my friends."" and I said ""Do you feel happy now?"" and she told me she would be happy when I stopped stalking her and talking to her friends. I replied to that with ""You think I stalk you?"" and she said ""You won't leave me alone even though I tell you to. Yes will I do."" and I texted back ""Have fun"" which looking back on it was such an inconsiderate way to answer that and I feel horrible. She texted me the next morning (Today) and asked if I talked to her ex, and when. I told her and she said ""Do you realize how crazy that makes you sound"" and I told her it was a mistake and that I shouldn't have done it. She then proceeded to block me on everything except for snapchat and my phone. One of my friends told me that a few hours later she posted a pic of me on her spam account and it was me making a goofy face and the caption was ""when you have to tell your ex to stop talking to all of your friends because he's fucking crazy"" and around 7 tonight she came to my house and dropped off this bag with every note I had ever wrote her, every piece of jewelry I ever bought her, some blu-rays I bought her, and shirts that I bought for her. She said ""here's your shit"" and then told me that she wished she was dead to me and that she didn't exist in my life, she told me she didn't want me to care about her, that if I see her walking down the street to turn the other fucking way, she brought up that ex that I mentioned that stalked her and told me I was doing the same thing, that she had all of her friends block me on social media, and that I was bi-polar and crazy, and she was literally shaking and had tears in her eyes. She told me that she is so tired of begging me, begging me for space, begging me to touch her, begging me to stop smoking, begging me to be there with her, etc. She told me that if I talk to her friends or her anymore that she is going to start fucking with my life and see how I like it. I just stood there and told her I understood what I did wrong and I was sorry and I would give her the space she's asking for. I didn't cry or beg or anything but after she told me that it didn't count or didn't matter because she was forcing me to give her space at this point. She left then.

I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world. I know that now there's nothing I can do but give her space and quit doing all of this crazy shit. This has been an awful breakup that I made so many mistakes in. I know that at this point I probably can't reconcile with her, but I honestly want to learn and change the things that are wrong with me so I don't hurt someone else like I did to my ex. I just thought she was indifferent and didn't care about me at all anymore and I really didn't realize how fucked up it was for me to do this. If you have any advice for me, please help"

So my ex is 20, and I am 19. We both go to the same college. We dated for a year and 3 months. She broke up with me on December 26th of 2018. She had multiple reasons for breaking up with me, she begged me to stop smoking pot, she begged me to buy her flowers and write her notes, and I didn't do any of that. Her first boyfriend stalked her when they broke up for a long time who abused her. She gave me reasons like ""We're just different people"", ""We can't love each other the way that we need"", ""I feel like I need time to get to know myself"", etc. I didn't realize of course that I wasn't being the best boyfriend towards the end of our relationship until it was over. When I was smoking, our sex life plummeted. At one point we didn't have sex for like a month and a week or something like that. Honestly we had a very strong and magical relationship all up until I started smoking pot all the time. Her family and friends loved me, and she wanted to marry me and grow old with me. She even came to go to school at the university we're at to be closer to me, and she also stayed with me for the summer and got an internship in our town so we could basically live together. The relationship didn't really start to take a bad turn until the last 4 months or so.

The same year I had done ecstasy I had applied with the local police department as a tech installer (keep in mind I had no idea I would be able to apply for this position or that it needed a thorough background check) and I was honest and upfront about my drug history and I got banned from applying again for 3 years. I'm going to finish my degree this fall 2019 with my bachelors in CRJ and I'm seriously regretting how bad I fucked up with doing ecstasy. I will be able to apply with the said police department this June as it will be three years now but from what I read everyday on here and on the protect and serve/911 job forums, I might as well consider a different career choice. I'm currently in an internship with the state parole and probation and I know they're stance on drugs is different and a bit more lax (one year) so I have a little more hope for that. If none of this works, I'm considering the military as on officer to give myself more time and distance away from my drug history. Just wanted to know your guys' opinions on how dumb I fucked up."

But now the writers have made him out to be a douche. Haha, now I finally get why people don't like Andy so much.

God bless this show. To be honest, I think the show is still funny without Michael. I really liked the latter half of season 8. The core actors and actresses of the Office were still killing it. They didn't really need much else. I also like the interns. They aren't taking up too much screen-time and provide an interesting dynamic to the group.

But I got an internship near to where they live so I'm staying at their house for 4 months.

 After christmas me any my brother and grandparents etc where told that after being together for 20+ years my parents are getting divorced. I silently blame my dad. He's always been a bit of an ass and he has been living the good life not needing to work or do chores for the last 9 years. 

I don't know when my parents decided to get divorced but yesterday my dad told me he is seeing someone. My parents friends don't even know that they are getting divorced and he's already seeing someone. He is still living under my mom's roof. His new gf is nice but god i hate my dad not for waiting until he at least lives under a fucking different roof. My mum doesn't know so it feels like my dad is cheating on her even if they are getting divorced and it's causing me to resent him. He's always been closer to my brother and me to my mom but now I feel further than ever before but I haven't told anyone how i feel. My mom is now on the other side of the world in pain after a surgery and my dad is sneaking around with a woman because no one knows that they are getting divorced. 

Tonight I'm supposed to go to diner with him and his gf. I can't stand the idea of being there talking to them. I want my parents to finalise the divorce so I don't need to hear people asking my dad how she is and when is she coming back etc. At that point i wouldn't mind him seeing someone but i just can't get over the fact that they still  live under the same roof and he's been seeing someone. Thank goodness he's moving out saturday and then I can stay at my mom's place and have some quiet time without him. "
alb95x,5,2019-01-30,Anyone else have negative experiences working for Lincoln-based startups?,Elixir-Mixer,lincoln,https://www.reddit.com/r/lincoln/comments/alb95x/anyone_else_have_negative_experiences_working_for/,"I am currently a senior marketing student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and will be graduating this May. Back in August, I embarked on a pretty extensive job search so I had some income to rely on during my last year here as well as gain experience in my field before graduating (and hopefully having a job secured before then). I accepted a position at a startup. At first, everything was great. My boss at the time told me and the other interns all about the company's goals, treated me to some free dinners, etc. But things slowly but surely got worse. I found out pretty quickly that the company was EXTREMELY disorganized. The boss was constantly implementing new rules that were good in theory but rarely worked out in practice. I was being assigned tasks that were not in my job description. Eventually, my boss fired me (over email, mind you) because I ""failed to meet their standards,"" standards that were never specified or made clear to me in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after my time at that startup, I accepted a position at another startup with a very generous hourly pay rate and an honorable company mission. But this startup job was even worse than the one I had worked in before. My manager's rules here were also constantly changing and very impractical. He would also contact me at very inconvenient times (i.e. evenings). Eventually, my boss here also fired me online (except this time on Slack). I say that working for this startup was worse than working for the last one because, at least in the first one, my boss was generally pleasant to talk to and she generally paid me on time. But no; not at this second startup. Here, my boss ALWAYS paid me late. I didn't receive my first paycheck until December and that paycheck was for the month of October and November (keep in mind we were supposed to be paid monthly, meaning he paid me a month late). He criticized me over Slack that I was failing to live up to expectations and in response I told him that I will be forced to take legal action against him if he didn't pay me the rest of the wages I was owed (for the month of December and January). He then went into a fit of rage over Slack, telling the administrative assistant to not mail me my check and that he would calculate all the ""damages"" I caused by failing to live up to expectations. He also said that UNL must be teaching students like me that we should worship corporations that are raping this country. He was like this for the entire four months I was employed at that startup; he would be all nice and friendly sometimes but most of the time he would be very critical and passive aggressive (one time he told me, ""I hired you because you have a great background, but if you can't something as simple as communication down, then I'm not sure what to say about that."")  


I could go on and on, but this is the main gist of my horrible experience working for two separate startups based here in Lincoln. So, my question to those who live in the Lincoln area: have you also had negative experiences such as mine working for a startup in the Lincoln area? If so, what were they? (I don't expect you to name the company, and I will not name the companies I described for privacy reasons. Just want to see if I'm not the only one who has experienced this.)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I worked for two separate startup companies in Lincoln where I had a variety of negative experiences. I'm inquiring as to whether anyone else in the Lincoln area has also worked for a startup and whether or not they have had bad experiences doing so, and, if so, what problems they experienced."

I met you for real this past weekend after finally having the courage to introduce myself. It seemed like we had a few similar interests and frankly I thought you were cute. I loved watching your face light up when I asked about your internship and how excited you are to help others. I wanted to get to know more. You gave me a slice of your pizza because I was stupid and didnt order food even though I was hungry. 

But I got ahead of myself and drunkenly asked if you were single. We've only met what, two days before that? Why did I think that was a good idea? You said you weren't looking for anything serious and the night ended in awkwardness. After that you stopped all communication with me. Won't answer my text, won't even look me in the eyes. I walked passed you at the airport and wanted to at least say goodbye. But I've taken the hint. 

I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. It was never my intention. I'll be able to see you in a few weeks. I hope maybe we can get passed this and be friends. If not, well then I'll just have to deal. "

The thing is though even after going out with her and spending a good portion of time with her I never made a move. I told one of my friends this and she was in disbelief that we had not kissed or anything after going out for 2 consecutive weekends and once during the week between them. 

This made me really reflect on why I hadn't tried and honestly it came down to that I thought I physically wasn't good enough for her and I couldn't imagine that she would want to be with someone who looked like me. We continued to hangout until it was time for me to head home for the holidays and for her to move to her new job. So I flew back, and well going home for the holidays pretty much equated to enjoying loads of amazing food and drinks with friends/family and I am okay with indulging when its vacation. 

When I returned home from my holidays I decided that I don't want this situation to happen again. I no longer want my size to literally and figuratively weigh me down.  I decided the next time I don't make a move on a girl won't be because of my self image, it will be because I have no clue if the date is going well or not!

So after I finished all of the Christmas chocolates, I started up myfitnesspal and  started tracking everything to the best of my abilities, packing lunch to the office everyday, and making smarted food choices.  I also got back to the gym (I changed up my work schedule to fit the gym in the mornings) and started couch to 10k.  This self reflection hasn't led to a new years resolution of loose a bunch of weight, it has led the resolution to live a healthier lifestyle.

Thanks for reading and for this community being so welcoming and motivational.

TLDR; spent lots of time with a girl I liked, never made a move because I thought ""she wouldn't want to kiss a guy with a big gut"". Now I have decided to live a much healthier lifestyle so that this doesn't happen again!"
aldlhp,9,2019-01-30,[REQUEST] Microsoft office 2016/2019,TwistedWizard420,RandomKindness,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/aldlhp/request_microsoft_office_20162019/,"Hello everyone, today I need help. I started college this week. After working for a few months last year, I was able to finally buy the ridiculously expensive laptop I needed according to the college. I specifically needed to get a laptop with 32gb of ram. The reason for that is because at some point I'll be setting up a ton of virtual machines. I'm studying server, network and hardware architecture this semester. Next semester we'll be learning about the software side of things. I need to be able to do assignments in office 2016 or 2019. They will be testing us on our knowledge about it. I know there are free alternatives,  like libre office, but I need to learn the layout and functions of word 2016 for the tests we'll have to wright on them. The test has a time limit and I'm scared if I continue using libre, I won't know where all the functions are in word. I also know that there are illegal ways to activate office, but the college I'm studying at made it very clear that they won't allow it at all. It also means I get instantly expelled if caught with illegal copys of software. The reason I can't afford it myself is because of the previously mentioned laptop I had to buy, and the college tuition. I'm saving money where I can, like living with my parents and getting rides from friends. I know there are places that sell office keys for cheaper, so I would really appreciate your help. Thanks for taking the time to read, have a great day. Sorry for any grammatical errors or language mistakes, I'm on mobile right now and english is my second language  
**UPDATE**  
So i few days ago I made a post asking for Office 2016/2019.  
I followed the advice I was given, and asked the college about the student office package. Sadly, the student Email I was provided with is only so I can use outlook(For their email and news). They said I have to buy office 365 myself, or use a college computer to do my tasks and assignments. I live far from the college so it still isn't really an option since I rely on friends for transport. I don't have the funds and can't get a job in the foreseeable future. I really hope someone out there can help me get a copy of the home version of office 2016/9. Thanks for reading 
TL;DR I still need to get a copy of office somehow, but don't have the money. I also can't get a job right now because of classes being from 8:00-16:00 Monday to Friday. Holiday times I will have to work as an unpaid intern to get the required 150 hours of work time experience to get my degree.  
Thanks for everyone giving advice.        
EDIT:  I ended up buying a license on ebay for 5 dollars, and its working so far. So thanks for the help from everyone"

ale1fu,8,2019-01-30,Advice for a sysadmin that wants to move into infosec?,throwaway03222018,SecurityCareerAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/ale1fu/advice_for_a_sysadmin_that_wants_to_move_into/,"Posted a similar question last summer in r/ITCareerQuestions.  I got some good advice, but didn't necessarily answer my question about transitioning to a new role (whether with current employer or new).

I am a systems administrator for a small company.  We have approximately 100 email users, 50 field workers that use tech devices (pc, ipad, etc) a small part of their days, and another 50 office-based staff that use PCs the entire day.  I only explain this because I don't want to mislead anyone about the details.  In total I support 200 users in anything from email on a smartphone, to high-powered workstations.  Additionally we have 5 main offices (all sister companies of each other) and 8-10 more short term sites with only an internet connection and a couple remote workers.

I have been working at this company for 15 years and really like it.  The people are great, and they appreciate me.  However, I am the only technical person, and I believe that limits my growth.  The other employees/management know I keep the infrastructure maintained, and functioning at a good level, and that's it.  Nobody knows how that compares to companies that have subpar sysadmins.  I haven't had a performance review in 4 years.  But I do talk to executives daily, and am aware of the needs and expectations they have for me.  

With the background out of the way, here's what I need advice on:  I'm in my 40's, and love technology.  I enjoy learning new things.  I don't see that ending, but I also don't want to be the ""IT guy"" that is called to fix the printer when I'm 60!  The issue with my company is that possibly we could add an intern or two, maybe an FTE to handle the help desk questions I field, but that still leaves me dealing with IT related technical stuff.  As much as I enjoy that, I have a desire to work more in the security field.  Privacy has become important to me.  Improving our cyber security posture is important to me.  I have great interest in this.

Obviously as a sysadmin I have to secure devices and networks for the company.  I perform a lot of information security tasks, and have for much of my career.  Even before working here, I worked for a several consultant companies servicing SMB in the same ways.  20 years ago I passed the A+, a couple years later a Win 2000 MCP cert.  Network+, ITIL Foundations, PMP, CISSP, and CISM.  My bachelors degree is in an unrelated field.

I don't manage subordinates.  I do manage vendors that handle various things that I am not as proficient with, don't have the time to do, or is better handled by someone who's time is less valuable ;)    

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have a recommendation as to what I should do?  Whether to try and create a position where I currently am, how to show the executives the need? Or to perhaps earn another cert that would show some skill in a particular area that I am lacking?  I know the sysadmin type certs are lower level, I just never needed them for my current job.  Once I decided that security is the path I want to follow, I went the CISSP route - as that is a requirement for many government contracting jobs.  Perhaps CEH or Security+ would show that my technical chops were up to par?  I likely have a little imposter syndrome that I don't have the technical skills for mid-level cyber careers, and not enough management experience to get a management position even though I have the CISSP/CISM certs.

More certs?  Try and create a position at the current company?  Or make the leap and attempt to get into security full-time?  Thanks for your time."
aleu62,5,2019-01-30,Advice/Help,amyj_beth,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/aleu62/advicehelp/,"I just want to ask you for some help about my situation. I will give you the details below. 

In the summer of 2017 I was an intern for ARDOT. I was outside all the time, and I loved it (besides my feet hurting from standing all the time). I learned a lot about the construction process, bridge design and process, and overlaying. 

I then went back to school for the semester, and in December of 2018 I had a job offer from MODOT (I am originally from Missouri and my parents still live there). Then in the spring of 2018 during the semester I went back to my internship with ARDOT.  I didn’t really do anything as an intern this time. 

In January of 2018 I had my second job offer from ARDOT (in Little Rock), and in February I had my third and fourth job offer with a Geotechnical Engineering company (in Springdale AR) and the other with a engineering firm based in Memphis TN but my job would be in the town of my college and where I had an internship at with ARDOT. 

After weighing my job offers, I decided to stay in the town of my college (that’s initially where I wanted to be). My dream from my junior and senior year of college I wanted to be a geotechnical engineer. I was really good friends with my geotechnical professor (he owns a company in Memphis but had no job openings for me), and he is really nice to me. He is part of why I wanted to be a geotechnical engineer. 

I turned down my dream job because it wasn’t where I wanted to be (plus I hate the Razorbacks). 

The last week of May in 2018 I started working with the engineering company in the college town where I wanted to be. 

From my job offer letter, it said that I would report to my boss in the mornings. FYI: this company in the college town only has the boss and another engineer and then me. 

I never reported to my boss because he was never there. I always got work from my coworker. My coworker has taught me everything. I just feel like my job offer was a lie. I never actually talked to my coworker before I started my first day. I saw him from my interview/meeting with my now called boss, but never actually talked to him. I feel like the job offer description lied. If the job offer description would have said I was to report directly to my coworker, then I am not sure if I would have picked this job. My first initial thought of my coworker was, “he’s weird.”  (And he is) 

It started off fine, and I learned a lot while I was in training. I took the FE in August, and I did not pass. Work slowed down in October and then my coworker just began to frustrate me. He would just talk all the time to me for no reason, hang out in my office and just stand there watching me do stuff, get in my personal space, move my own stuff on my desk to accommodate his needs for placing things down, sometimes he would look me up and down (I hate saying this). 

When work slowed down I was allowed to study for the FE again. I studied all the time at work, and then took the FE in December. I did not pass. 

It is now almost February 2019, and I do not know what to do. Some days I have just left the office crying because of my coworker. He just really frustrates me. My boss is never here (he usually stays at the Memphis office). So it’s just me and my coworker at the office in the college town. 

My PDP (personal development plan) has now come around, and I am not sure what to do. My boss told me that whenever I was finished filling it out, he would sit down with me and my coworker and go thru it. I would rather it not be with me and my coworker. I just want it me and my boss because I would like to discuss some things about my coworker with my boss. 

I am torn. I am not sure if I should lie on my PDP and say my job is fine and that I like it, or say my job is not fine because of my coworker. 

I work in the transportation department. The work is easy, and the work is fine. I just CANNOT stand my coworker. I am not sure what to do. "

My resume is very lacking in my opinion, the only work experience I have is retail. My school GPA is just below 3.0 (I should have this above a 3.0 by the time I graduate in spring 2020). 

My work experience is what worries me most. Due to my school schedule, I am having a hard time finding something that isn't retail. I initially thought about doing some actuarial internship this summer to help with my work experience, but due to lots of  procrastination I will not even have my first exam completed by summer. Hopefully I can have 2 exams passed by the time I graduate.

Not to mention, I have very limited knowledge of coding. I have some experience using Matlab and C++ but not much. 

Overall, just thinking about where I'm at, and how much I need to improve in such a short amount of time, I've been really stressed out thinking about this. How competitive are entry level positions? What kind of positions should I be looking for that would look good on a resume? What programming language should I start studying? What kind of advice in general should I be aware of?"

After a few emails back and forth, it looks like my options are:

1. Ask pwc to delay my start date (currently is Jan 20)
2. Renege my offer
3. Renege my offer, then go to the career fair
4. Don’t renege my offer, don’t go to the career fair, and look for jobs on my own.

Last summer, I interned in pwc’s SALT department and never worked more than 40 hours. Unfortunately, throughout the whole summer, the big4 pressure got to me and caused me to be depressed and on certain days, I was fantasying about suicide.

I am doing much better now mentally, but that whole internship experience has given me doubts that big4/public accounting is for me. I know the advantages that starting a career at a big4 firm will bring, but at this point, I need to start emphasizing the maintenance of my mental health.

Any advice in terms of finding a job elsewhere?

My career goal is to make 100k - 150k and would like to start my career where it best sets me up for a good career.

Should I be looking at industy, gov, or small public firms?

I’m pretty much ruling out top 100 public firms at this point.

Is it bad to leverage my pwc offer and try to get a starting salary that is higher than 60k?"

I would like to get an advice about what would you recommend in my situation.

Senior CIS Student graduating in either Summer or Fall. I just started a new entry level job related to my field, overall the work is easy.

I had no internships experience and after this semester, I had 4 classes left for graduation. All of these 4 classes are available in the summer. I had 3 options in my mind:

1) Get out of here in August, take all 4 classes left and graduate in the summer.

2) Take the summer off, get an internship and finish all classes in Fall.

3) Take part-time Summer, part-time Fall, but still work on the internship in the summer.

alinah,1,2019-01-30,AITA for being uncomfortable with my GF fixating on a past male colleague?,uwannabanana,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/alinah/aita_for_being_uncomfortable_with_my_gf_fixating/,"**tl;dr:** GF keeps mentioning former male co-worker. I told her it bothers me. AITA?

&amp;#x200B;

My GF was an intern at a big company. In her department it was only her and the other intern, let's call him Mark, working closely. When it comes to her career my GF is kind of a perfectionist and competitive. She was always worried about making a good impression on her bosses while she was there and hopefully being hired full time later on (Even though the company's policy is not to hire any interns immediately)

She started telling me how she felt like Mark was showing her up and mildly sabotaging her by kissing up to the bosses. For the next few month's she regularly referred to Mark as her most direct competitor. She would bring him up and make some sort of negative expression like shaking her head or sighing every time.

She would openly stalk him on twitter and google and say things like ""I can't believe he used to work at \_\_\_"" When she found his personal website she instantly decided that SHE needs to make a website also.

I was a bit uneasy with her bringing him up so much but bit my tongue because after all, they did work together 40 hours a week. I tried to be supportive and assure her that she should only compete with herself. 

From what I gather Mark is decent looking guy and most of the conflicts were in her head. They seemed to get along fine otherwise, but she always talked about how ""boring"" he is and how he didn't really make an effort to have conversations with her. She always criticized how he always wore button downs and khakis to work. She read me a text to her friend (who interned in the same office) Where she said ""Mark actually said bye to me today, but I don't care. He doesn't get these panties wet""  Um.. what?

After the internship ended they both ended up interning for the same company but in different buildings. Yesterday my GF tells me she got a chance to be in the main building:

&amp;#x200B;

HER: ""...So I went to the main building for \_\_\_\_\_\_. I looked for Mark but didn't see him haha""

ME:  ""Hmm months later you're still thinking about this guy, how am I supposed to feel?""

HER: ""Uhh what are you talking about?""

ME:  ""I just feel weird that you care this much about another guy. You haven't worked together in months. You keep bringing him up""

HER: ""Why are you being ridiculous? I talked to him once since when he congratulated me on linkedin""

ME:  ""I just feel uneasy that another guy can muster so much emotion in you. Do you like him?""

HER(defensively and blushing) : ""NO! no way""

&amp;#x200B;

She got mad at me but when I asked her how she would feel if I was fixated on a female co-worked she said: ""I guess I can understand"" but looked flustered until we moved on to another conversation."
aljq9z,3,2019-01-30,Dislike my job as a PCT in a hospital,classicelastic,prephysicianassistant,https://www.reddit.com/r/prephysicianassistant/comments/aljq9z/dislike_my_job_as_a_pct_in_a_hospital/,"I've been a patient care tech at a hospital for a little over a year now and I honestly really don't like it. 

Reasons why I don’t like it:
I get really anxious about a lot of aspects of my job.
I work PRN (24 hours a month) so I feel like every time I go into work I forget a lot of things such as what certain supplies are, the times we check sugars, how to work certain machines, etc. and nurses and other techs get frustrated with me (understandable).
I just don’t like being a PCT honestly. I don’t enjoy bathing people, I absolutely hate sitting (a few bad experiences with this) and the patient population isn’t what I like (mostly older people, 60-90 y/o).  

I know I have a reallllllly good gig working as a PCT in a hospital and I have gotten soooooo much experience out of it, but I'm really unhappy and wanting to do another job that's less stressful and with a wider range of patient population. I'm a full time student and taking my pre-requisites right now at a university (currently a Junior) and school is definitely my main focus. 

I’ll have an internship this fall that will take up 120 hours throughout the semester and another internship in Spring 2020 that will be 240 hours. I hope to find a PA who will let me shadow for one of these internships. So these internships will definitely take up a lot of my time. I honestly think my priority for my senior year will is to have fun and focus on academics/internships. I plan on taking a gap year before applying to PA school as well! This gives me more time to accumulate hours.

Should I just quit and find another job (there's been an opening as a PCT at a minute clinic which I’m assuming is way less stressful) or should I just suck it up and keep working? I have 750 hours accumulated so far. I know the minute clinic job isn't as good of experience, but I would be so much happier.

Another bigger concern I guess is that just because I don't enjoy being a PCT, does that mean the PA track isn't for me? I'd appreciate any insight into this as well, I've been doubting myself a little bit. 

Thanks in advance for any feedback!"
aljt6w,1,2019-01-30,"How to reply when someone says you are ""too skinny"" and doesn't let you eat healthy food?",frustrateddddd,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/aljt6w/how_to_reply_when_someone_says_you_are_too_skinny/,"This has been frustrating me for some time now. To keep it short-- I'm living with my bf's family for the next 4 months because we both have internships here (I'm from the other side of the country). Now, I'm naturally skinny and have always been, my parents were health nuts and I grew up eating extremely healthy food. I genuinely enjoy eating really healthy food and I get bad stomach aches when I eat something too greasy. And I'm not stick skinny at all, I'm in the healthy BMI range and I work out regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my bf has an older sister who's overweight, and an overbearing mother who likes to speak her mind. Those 2 have made it their GOAL to ensure that I don't eat healthy and have done some sneaky fucking things to make sure I don't. I don't know if it's because they are jealous or whatever, but I'm a people pleaser and have stayed extremely nice about it. They will bring up how I am ""too skinny"" and need to eat more EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. This involves his mother calling me at work and saying she's going to order me McDonald's for dinner because I am eating too healthy that I ""look like skin and bones"" or that I look ""sick"" , ""cold"" , and ""tired"". His mom speaks very poor english so most of the time I just agree to it out of respect, eat the food, and then feel like shit after.

&amp;#x200B;

His sister is on a super healthy meal prep diet and eats so little it scares me sometimes. She often skips dinner. But I have no problem with this, I even remind her not to eat unhealthy things because I know her fitness goals, and isn't that what friends are supposed to do?? And she'll talk about how she wants me to eat healthy too but then refuses to let me get my own portions of food, and deliberately loads on the carbs/fats onto my plate. We tried meal prepping together once and she insisted on making my meal prep and it looked so different from hers.

And when I try to get food myself she always INSISTS that I sit down and let her get it, and the whole family will be staring at me, so I have no choice AGAIN. Then she'll get upset if I don't finish the whole thing. Even my bf's dad (who never speaks) will ask them why do I have so much freaking food on my plate.

I have talked to my bf about this MULTIPLE times and he has gotten angry at his family over it and it has caused a lot of tension. So now I just keep it to myself, but no matter HOW MANY times I say ""no thank you"" or ""I want to eat healthy"" it never ends. His mom will keep arguing with me and talk over and over again about how I look sick!! It's literally the first thing she says when she walks through the door and sees me. Everytime I'm slightly cold she'll be like ""See?? You're cold because you don't eat enough!""

UGHHHHHHHHHH. I can't move out because I'm only 21 and his bf's family will REFUSE to let me stay anywhere else (they're really traditional). But damn, I'm so unhappy and it's nobody's fucking business what I eat except my own. I'm tired of feeling guilty by eating healthy foods and I'm tired of having my appearance critiqued constantly. I hate having to justify every healthy thing I eat. Is there ANY way to stop this??"
alksnj,4,2019-01-30,Jorge Masvidal,birdeater666,believeyoume,https://www.reddit.com/r/believeyoume/comments/alksnj/jorge_masvidal/,Just watched the press conference. Someone asked about Mike and Jorge said they will settle it at some point in or out of the cage. Jorge said something about Mike disrespecting him in front of his family. What’s the story behind that? Mike would rip his head off. I know he would never get back in the cage for that fight but I would love to see him shut this fucker up. Luis/Harrington or whichever interns on here get Masvidal to call into the podcast. 
alksr8,6,2019-01-30,Zoloft [NSFW],chorizopicante,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/alksr8/zoloft_nsfw/,"You guys, I’m so happy right now. 

2 years ago I went to the doctor for unbearable social anxiety before I had to start my internship in college, and was prescribed 50 mg of Zoloft. I felt great anxiety-wise, but had major sexual dysfunction and frequent brain zaps from the 2nd day on. I also convinced myself I couldn’t lose weight (though looking back, my dieting method was just half-assed). I quit cold turkey after 6 months, suffered for a couple weeks, then went in complete denial of my disorder. 

A week ago, I went into the doctor for a variety of symptoms, all having been caused by my anxiety. I was advised to try an SSRI again to clear things up.  I went on 25 mg of Zoloft and of course brain zaps and dysfunction again at first, but today my head felt great, very low anxiety and I actually was able to have a real orgasm! 

I know it’s only been a week, BUT I think I may have actually found a treatment that works. I am beyond ecstatic to be finally living a functional life. "

I really didn't. From the moment I saw you, all I could think about was how you were my dream boy. I knew I had to take the chance, I couldn't let an opportunity like this go to waste. 

I wish you knew that for me to make a move on any boy is so rare and it means so much to me. I wish you could understand that. I could tell you were a sweet boy, but hard to get to open up. I was afraid you were bored of me from the start, so I acted aloof. Way too aloof. I think that made you think I only wanted this to be a hookup and nothing more.

I never put myself out there because of how insecure and scared and mentally ill I was. You were my first date. You were sweet, easy to talk to. I wish I could tell you that I didn't eat for 4 days leading up to that date. I didn't know how to deal with how anxious I was. I almost canceled so many times. And when you sent me those rose emojis right before our date? I didn't how to react, so all I could do was ignore it. I was hooked on you immediately.

Granted, our date wasn't anything special. We went to see a cute movie, we laughed at the same scenes. Once that movie was over, you asked me if I wanted to go for drinks. I never wanted to be 21 at the time so bad (lmao), so I had to decline. And that was that. You texted me saying we should hang out again. I didn't know how much space to give you, so I gave you too much. I just waited for you to text me again the next week when you came back from your trip. And this time, you implied me coming over that night. I genuinely couldn't.

I don't know if I'm making excuses for you or not, but I think the way I treated you in the beginning &amp; rejecting you a couple of times made you think I wasn't as interested as I really was. You work hard, you were busy and so smart and it made me so attracted to you. So of course our schedules clashed. I asked if you wanted to hang out that week, but you had to go on a trip again. You weren't lying, I know. I knew I was asking at the wrong time too...you told me when you were leaving. I don't know why I did that. I was scared to see you again.

We never could get another date in. With school being over, you went back to your hometown and I went to mine. You asked me out again right as I got to my hometown. Our timing just sucks. I said we could just meet next semester, when we're both back on campus. That's when I realized you weren't coming back. When you said you were moving to another state...I thought you meant for the summer. For an internship. No you meant...for good. You weren't coming back. My heart broke that night. I never healed from the pain. Because I felt like I could never get what I want. All I wanted was you. All I wanted was to get to know you! Even become friends! At this point, I was falling in love with your online persona too (why did you have to add me on FB?), but I could tell you were a good person. Going through your own shit too. I tried to let you go after that. What was the point of holding on to someone who I'd never see again?

It was impossible. You were on my mind 24/7. I started my internship, you started yours. I decided that summer I was going to volunteer on the weekends in some city I had always wanted to visit. Then I realized that you actually decided to move there...but I couldn't contact you. By then it had been over a month since we talked. What was I supposed to say? ""Hey, I remember you telling me you moved to this place and I'm actually here volunteering. Wanna meet up?""

Cause that's exactly what I did. I spent the whole weekend there, thinking about you. But I didn't contact you. Not until the last day of my trip, where I had one of the best days of my life, making a new friend. Getting drunk (finally 21!) and deciding to get a tattoo I had always wanted. I was on a high, and my drunk ass decided to text you that. I knew what I was doing. But I was like ""Fuck it, I had such a good day. If he rejects me, I can let him go for good. He can't ruin my day for me"".

Turns out you were down to meet! Holy fuck. I couldn't believe I was going to see you again. I couldn't believe what I was doing. I didn't know what I was doing. I wasn't prepared to see you, but I did it anyway. We went to get something to eat, we talked the whole time. I wasn't proud of how I was acting then. I was obnoxious, being negative for no reason. I was nervous and scared and projecting it onto you. But it wasn't all bad, I think. You offered me support, you told me not to be so hard on myself. I don't know. You offered to pay, but I didn't want you to. Apparently that was a mistake? (According to my highly experienced friend). Whatever.

We went back to your place. I didn't know what to expect next. I figured we would watch a movie or something. I don't know. I'm naive like that. I guess I should've seen the signs...you giving me gum. You grazing my thigh as we sat on the couch and playing some show that I still wish I could remember what it was. You finally asked me, ""So...did you want to hook up?""

I was speechless. I couldn't believe you were attracted to me because I could never find the confidence in myself to think of me as pretty. Sure, you could've been bored too. So when you said that to me, I didn't know what to say. How was I supposed to say ""I mean sure, but I also hate my body and I don't want you to see it. I've never done this and I don't want to be bad. Also, is this a one time thing? I don't KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.""

So I said ""Uh...I don't know"". And you give me this look and I laugh and I get embarrassed and I look away. I look back at you and you pretend like you're glancing back at me too. I genuinely didn't know what to say! We laugh again and you say ""Don't feel pressured to, I was just wondering..."" and not knowing what I was saying, still kind of drunk but sobering up at that moment because of your question, I go ""I mean...I think you'll know if I don't want to do anything..."" 

Bitch, what does that even mean? You just repeat what I said. I still couldn't really look at you, but when I finally made eye contact, that's when you kissed me.

I didn't know what was going on, God I'm such a fucking loser. For a couple of seconds I was stunned. My first kiss...he was kissing me? I decided to go along with it. It felt good. We made out for a while, you told me to get on top of you. But holy fuck, was I insecure. And I know you can read every emotion on my face. We eventually went to your room. We made out some more, I could feel how hard you were. You tried to lead the way, but I think I kept stopping you.

We stopped eventually, probably cause you sensed this was going nowhere. I said sorry, feeling so bad. He said to not be stressed, and he asked me if most guys pressure me to have sex. I didn't really respond...but you just said they can just jerk off. Don't worry about it. But I was so embarrassed at the fact that you could tell I was stressed. Fuuuuuck.

I'm so. So so so so so so. So embarrassed at how I reacted. I was shocked, not acting like myself. I just laid there. Had I felt comfortable with myself, knew where we stood...I would've made it more fun? I felt so bad that you expected something and I couldn't give it to you. You were nice about it though. I was just ashamed of myself.

We cuddled for a while, you laying on top of me while I played with your hair. I was genuinely so happy being there. I could've done that forever. I started to move around and you read that as me wanting to move positions. You move and tell me to lay on you. And my fucking dumbass ignores you!! Because of my STUPID insecurities!! I think at this point you wanted to laugh at me. Like...is she good? Is she stupid? I GUESS I AM.

I don't know how the next part happened, I really don't. I guess my hand just led its way down to your dick. I don't know where I got this confidence all of a sudden. You asked me if I was sure...Next thing you know, I'm giving my first BJ. I said to myself fuck it? There's a boy right here...you're inexperienced...now's your chance?

I guess I was decent. I know I made some mistakes. It was so hot though...your moans, the way you finished, the way you started touching me. You startled me when you touched me though, and I flinched. I'm sorry. After that, I really really really. Didn't know how to act. You said in a joking manner ""I've had better"", and woooooow did that hurt. Then you said ""Just kidding, it was good"". I just !!!! I wanted to know what was going through your head. We laid there for a while, talking a bit. You told me about your plans for the rest of the summer...of course, busy. And then you hinted that you were going to bed soon. You said I could stay the night...but something about it made me think you only said that to be nice. I left. You texted me saying you had fun, and that it was too bad I couldn't stay for longer. 

I went back, still stunned at what had happened. I honestly believed I would never talk to you again, and then this happens? And the worst part was I was going back to volunteer the following week. Of course I wanted to see you again, bitch I am in love with you lmao. But I didn't know where you stood. My friends encouraged me to text you, even as much as I didn't want to because I was afraid of rejection. I was in so much pain, liking you so much and honestly...you not liking me the same amount.

At this point, I knew I was putting you on a pedestal. I knew I should've been casually dating, not putting so much weight on one guy...but I couldn't even think about any other guys except you. I only wanted you. 

I texted you, but your mom and siblings were coming that weekend. Fuck! Whatever, it was fine. The funny thing is, your mom and I had the same flight there. I was so scared of running into you at the airport. I bolted out of there. At least I knew you weren't lying. After that weekend, I figured I wouldn't see you. I knew I had to go back in two weeks, but I didn't want to contact you yet AGAIN. 

But this time you texted me, apologizing for not being able to see me that weekend. I was surprised you texted me, and of course I take days to respond. Being all aloof again. I said it was no worries, and I decided ""Fuck it, I'll let him know I'm coming again"". Just my fucking luck, his dad was coming that weekend! But then he said he was getting a tattoo, and that maybe after that we could hang. We left it at that. The weekend comes, and I wait for you to text me something. I was so excited, thinking you invited me to go with you to get your tattoo. I saw you posted a picture with your dad on FB, so I felt good again that you weren't lying to me. But then you never texted me. You never said anything after that. And that was that.

I've never experienced heartbreak before you came along. I've never been so sad in my life. Did you forget? Did you not care? I knew I didn't matter to you as much as you mattered to me. I knew I made some mistakes. I knew I wasn't perfect. I wanted to apologize, but I also didn't want to be this overbearing girl that made you feel bad. I just wanted to start over with you. I wish I wasn't so insecure with you. I wish you didn't move away. It would've made it easier to see you, to see if you really liked me or not. I guess it's obvious you don't. Or I guess you didn't feel the need to continue anything as we lived in different states anyway. I know you think of sex as this casual thing, which was fine. But I wish we could've been friends? On speaking terms? Something? I wanted to open up to you so bad. I wanted you to open up to me too.

I know you've been back a couple of times now. Mutual friends. But you never contacted me. And I know I should let go. But there's a part of me that hopes we run into each other. Maybe you've forgotten about me. Maybe you'll feel bad. I don't think you hate me...but I think my insecurities probably got to you. I feel so pathetic. I feel so stupid for acting that way. I wish I never did the things that I did with you. Because I was so depressed. I know I can't put this on you. This is on me. This is on me for thinking you're some perfect boy, when I know you have your flaws too. But I still like you. 

It's been 6 months and I still think about you every day. You've moved quite a number of times now. I'm not stupid, you're a good looking guy and I'm sure you've had your number of hookups since we last saw each other. But that hurts me like no other. I guess I should've never fallen for a guy who everyone loves, who's popular and has experienced life. But I really really really think...we could've been something. If anything, friends. I know when I can get along with someone. I know that first times aren't always special. They can be awkward. But I wish you had known that we had a lot in common, that we could've been something good.

You've settled down in one city now, a city that I've been considering to live after I graduate. Like I said, we are so much more alike than you think! And all I can think about is running into you. Reconnecting. But it's too late now. It's honestly too late. I can't text you anymore, I look desperate. But I know you're lonely. I know you're looking for someone. And I can't seem to let you go, or see you be with another girl. Please don't be with another girl. All I'll do is compare myself to her, and think about what we could've been.

All I want is you. I still only want you. I haven't been able to move on. I know it's my problem. But I wish...oh how I wish we could've been something. I'm still not ready to let go, I know we all move on at our own pace. I'm hoping I won't have to let you go. Who knows...I guess I'm delusional.

You are still my dream boy. And you always will be."
allhae,163,2019-01-30,Thank you r/marketing!!!,carbsonlyplz,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/allhae/thank_you_rmarketing/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I discovered this sub last year and being someone who desired to have a long term career in marketing, this place was like a gold mine to me (and still is). At the time, I already had a couple internships but it didn't really expose me to the marketing world since being an intern, i handled more of the admin duties.

&amp;#x200B;

However, after finding this sub, i was exposed to just how big the marketing world is and i then knew how badly i wanted to work doing PPC. Because i didn't have that much experience, i was constantly on this sub looking for new, creative ways to apply the google courses that this sub recommended and i vividly remember reading one comment talking about non-profits being eligible for Google Grants and being able to receive up to $10,000 in ad dollars. this was an amazing way to apply everything i learned through google academy because i would then hit up local non-profits and tell them about this opportunity and most of them didn't even know such a thing existed!! they would then bring me on-board and help their marketing team set up their ads and even though i only knew the principles, having that experience helped me immensely because i had to tack on problems head-on and i was also able to put it on my resume!

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward to this month, i decided that it was time to find real work and so i decided to apply to an ad tech company for that i had known of before but NEVER dreamed of being able to work for. surprisingly, I got an interview and the rest is history :) having the experience of setting up ads and using analytics was a key selling point of mine and it has helped me in ways that i didn't know was possible.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically all of this is to say i am very thankful for this sub and all of the contributors on here! even though there may be bad advice sometimes, i've found that most of the comments on here are positive and from people who genuinely who want to help each other. if you are an aspiring marketing professional and don't know where to start... learn from me and have faith that it is possible and do something about it! we live in an age where all the resources we need are accessible online so take advantage of that and don't be afraid to ask for help on here as i'm sure many of us (i included) are willing to help !"
alli5j,7,2019-01-30,So Much Pain,Comfortable_Magician,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/alli5j/so_much_pain/,"I (F29) found out a little over three weeks ago that my husband (M29) has been cheating on me. We've been together for almost eight years and been married for two and half years.

The truth is that we always fought a lot pretty much from the beginning of our relationship. We were both stubborn and would argue a lot over stupid things. After a while, I would try to walk away during arguments and he would not let me go. Then I would hit him to try to get free. It was wrong of me to become physically violent. I became abusive, both emotionally and physically. I think a lot of it had to do with watching my parents fight constantly growing up and seeing them say horrible things to each other as well as my father being violent towards my mother. It was horrible of me. I always thought that I couldn't possibly have hurt him that much because I was a girl, but I knew deep down that I was in the wrong. I apologized and tried to restrain myself, but he also couldn't let me leave the room to cool down during arguments. Then about a year after we started dating, we got engaged, and I started law school. 

My law school was about four to five hours away by car, and he would come see me every weekend for a year. Sometimes I went to see him, but it was mostly him who came to see me. He loved me so much and was there for me during the hard times. I also loved him with all my being. Everyone thought we were crazy and too obsessed with each other, but we were so sure we met our soulmates from the day we met. 

I transferred to a different law school after my first year and he got into a PhD program at the same school. We finally moved in together after doing long distance for a year. That's also when things got worse. We were both under so much stress from school, and we were not good to each other. I saw the worst of him and he saw the worst side of me. I know this paints a toxic relationship, but it wasn't all bad. We still loved each other and had amazing times despite all the bad times. I was always the one trying to break up with him, and he would try to hold onto me. We also had sex much less. He felt like I was constantly rejecting him, and I was, because I resented him for being so angry and mean all the time, and he felt hurt. We did long distance again because I had a summer internship out of town and then another internship away in the fall semester. Then I graduated and left town. I tried to get a job in the same town to stay with him, but I didn't get anything. We went back to doing long distance again. 

After about a year he left his PhD program because he felt like it wasn't his calling after his third year. He worked in software after that for about two years, and we got married soon after he left his program. This past summer, he started to break down because he felt like his job was not satisfying. Our relationship had its problems in the past, but it really deteriorated this past summer with his constant breakdowns. He also started to become violent and abusive. I even had to call the police once because I ran away to another room to try to get away from him, and he broke the door down. I convinced him to seek counseling and to go back to school. We were back to doing long distance again.

This time I felt relieved. I didn't want to be in a relationship with him anymore. I wanted us to just leave and I didn't care if he cheated on me. However, even though I was doing okay without him, it was hard to be without him. He was my best friend, my constant companion for almost a decade. 

I started to have visions of him cheating on me. I felt like I was going insane. In my head, I could see him having sex with another girl, and I could almost hear her moan. I would scream and cry during these visions. When I would tell him about them, he would say that he wasn't cheating. Of course, he was lying.

We went back and forth on whether we should stay together. Sometimes he would try to end things with me and other times, I would try to end things with him. We stayed together somehow and he came home for winter break. He used my computer and left his email open. I saw a draft of an email and realized that it was a love letter to another woman.

I confronted him and found out that he had cheated on me with countless women this past semester. He had sex with at least four, multiple times, and he said he was infatuated with one of them. 

I decided to take him back but he kept going back to talking to those women. I saw a picture of the one he said he was infatuated with, and I felt disgusted. She was nowhere near as attractive as me. She was a 23-year-old divorcee with a baby. I asked him to block her number and to delete her contact information from his phone. He initially refused and then later did in front of me. I don't know if he still talks to her. 

He promised me he would go on leave and come back home to be with me. Since he got back to school, he changed his mind. He says he still wants to be with me. I can't do long distance anymore. I don't trust him. He feels like he can't leave school and go back to his terrible career because he hated software. He feels like he finally got to the right place to pursue a rewarding career, but he is losing me. He doesn't want to lose either one. He wants to have his cake and eat it too. He's still cheating on me. He said he didn't do anything physical and got angry with me for not understanding that he wanted to hang out with other women as friends. We both know that it's wrong. He refuses to stop but begs me to stay. He said he wants to stay with me. That's such BS, right? 

I know that I have to get out. I know that I have to leave his ass. I wanted to work things out with him because my hands weren't clean either, but this is out of control. He loves the attention he gets from other women. It doesn't matter that they're not attractive. He just loves it. He hasn't gotten attention like that from me for years, and he feels extremely insecure because his dissertation is not going well. He feels like a failure at 29. 

I'm supposed to go on a long trip for three weeks next week. He was supposed to come with me, but I don't think I'll take him with me anymore. 

I still get visions of him cheating on me. It kills me. It's such torture. It hurts even more because my intuition is always right. 

I want to be free and move on, but it kills me at the same time to leave him. The visions also kill me.

Please help me.

allz1g,3,2019-01-30,"(AU) 21 y.o. medical student aspiring to make into 6 figures, how should I secure my finances early for a comfortable life and not fuck it all up?",TroglodyteHomonculus,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/allz1g/au_21_yo_medical_student_aspiring_to_make_into_6/,"A bit of background first for this very hypothetical future. I’m currently 21 years old in my 3rd year of medical school in South Australia (so my dollar amounts are in AUD not USD). I have two part-time jobs paying in total about $1,000 a month, nothing terribly special, but I still live at home with great family support so it’s just some side money. My family is happy for me to live with them/under their financing until I have finished medical school. As of yesterday, I opened an account with a bank offering the best savings interest rate (bonus interest account, min $200/month required) of 2.87% here in Australia. I’ve initially saved ~$3,000 there at the time of posting, and at current I am aiming to deposit at least $500 per month. I pay for my phone bill and other entertainment stuff (about $100 a month) and car costs (about $1.5-2k a year). No board/rent or costs of living. I think it wouldn’t be far from true to say I have had and continue to have a very good shot in life. I do not want to let it go to waste. I like to think my story is fresh, early, and promising enough that it can still be easily moulded into anything, and might be a bit of fun for you guys to play with. So now to my future aspirations.

I won’t lie, I’m at least somewhat materialistic. I’m not a big spender, but I want to live very comfortably with at least a few luxuries before I am middle aged or ideally by the time I start a family (which is a while off yet, as is all of this). My dream end-goal for a while has been to be financially comfortable with a main home near a city hospital (I am not after any multi-million dollar house, just a nice small home) and a small waterfront home (perhaps on a lake or river rurally, nothing near a city) where I have a boat for holidays away. The main underpinning goal is to be able to achieve this and then by the time I retire, have a substantial net worth which would set up my potential children for some time, or at least to begin their adult lives strong.

I went into the medical field because I have wanted to ever since I was a small child. Never really aspired for anything else and have since had experience in the medical field which I have enjoyed. I am only now really realising how much money I could be making, and it’s a little daunting (also exciting now that it could be possible for my dreams to be reality). Medical school in Australia has 2 years of pre-clinical stuff and then in the 3rd year and beyond, you enter real hospitals to learn. My grades in medical school for the first 2 years have been fairly good, but I got really slack at the end of last year (burnout, continually adjusting to university etc). This upcoming 3rd year will be a real test, and I am aware of the competition for surgical training, but I am determined and fiercely competitive. My field of interest is primarily cardiology and at the time of posting, my career goal is to become a cardiothoracic surgeon. To my understanding, cardiothoracic surgeons these days are becoming less and less referred as cardiologists begin to expand their training, so I will keep that in mind. As it stands in any case, I have spoken to a surgeon I am close with as well others and have consulted the internet and it seems the average income for an experienced cardiothoracic surgeon is $200k and above, and the surgeons I have spoken with say there is often significant room for negotiation, depending on private vs public and whereabouts you are etc. 

I will be 25 when I begin working as an intern and 26 when I am a fully accredited junior doctor. I am still fuzzy on the details, but I can’t just immediately begin training as a surgeon until I have worked for some time. Optimistically assuming I start speciality training at 30, at the very best I will be 36 when I am an accredited cardiothoracic surgeon making very likely much under the $200k I stated earlier.

My question therefore is to you guys, is this a realistic and achievable financial goal (assuming I can achieve these career goals)? If so, what should be some ballpark milestones I need to reach (ie at 25, 30, 35, 40 etc)? Certain amounts/percentages of money stashed/invested in certain places etc. I will finish medical school with $60-80k interest-free in debt, then costs of speciality training which I am not entirely sure the cost of. I know there are a lot of variables yet to be discovered (like housing prices, living costs, etc), but I really am just looking for guesstimates at this stage (am I just woefully dreaming etc). One thing that my education has really let me down on is finance, so this is a very new field to me. Mathematics is a breeze, but the actual nitty gritty of finance I have no fucking clue about as it was never taught in school and the research I have done so far has just been a headache of trying to know where to start. Are there any sources/books/articles people would recommend for an absolute novice?

Some additional info that may help. I am mildly risk averse and have dabbled in the stock market with very small amounts just to get a feel (fairly unsuccessful so far, but the education is valuable). If I make the 6 figure values I wrote about above, I will be in the highest tax bracket of 45% here in Australia (oof).

almtxr,3,2019-01-31,My dad is threatening to leave my mom over me and my brothers use of weed.,RainMain,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/almtxr/my_dad_is_threatening_to_leave_my_mom_over_me_and/,"My dad, an immigrant, has always believed in American values. Nothing wrong with it, it’s what he does. In fact his beliefs are so strong that he managed to open and keep a business running for almost 20 years now. It has grown and grown. I could be spoiled but I choose not to be. I just ask for my tuition to be paid, which relative to my brothers tuition, is 11x cheaper. He is the family’s breadwinner. I have basic retail skills. 

Because he’s so successful he can make threats to leave us in order to conform to his standards. That means no excess drinking, no going out late at night, you can’t be homosexual, and you can’t smoke weed. You know, or else. Nobody can change his beliefs. It’s who he is.

He caught my brother smoking weed and broke down. Calling it addictive. My brother is fat so it doesn’t help the situation because “it makes you eat and eat.” I used to smoke weed but my mother hid it from my dad knowing he would threaten to leave us if he found out I did. I stopped because I didn’t want to risk it. It’s just weed. I don’t really need it.

Everything that has led up to this point they have all come to me because they trust me and see me as “grown up.” 

They all vent to me. My brother thinks my parents hate him and with the constant threat of cutting his tuition, he’s convinced he has to be perfect for them. He argues and talks back a lot. My mom argues too, but she has been the housekeeper for all our lives. My dad works and comes home. He spends 60ish hours per week working. He thinks my mom didn’t raise us well.

Yesterday was the breaking point where I finally spoke up about how I feel. That weed isn’t affecting either of us.  It’s just weed. 

My mom hasn’t worked in ages and my brother is a fucking spoiled brat. He thinks because his internship will hire him he doesn’t need to worry about anything. He also thinks he can afford shit but who’s paying for his stuff? Dad is. I barely take out my credit card out of my wallet. 

I have a year and a semester left of school until I graduate. He told my mom he plans, eventually, to give me $30,000 for tuition and books. I’m assuming if things don’t get better by this summer he’s gone. I only need 1/3rd of that. I don’t know about my brother. My mom has $50k in her savings and she can make it last for 2 years or more. She’s a pro at budgeting.

I even asked my brother to not smoke weed the night he was caught and just stop smoking, because my dad made complained about the smell and feeling drowsy. It’s just weed. It’s not your life, but guess what? He didn’t listen and was caught. My brother is convinced it cures his anxiety. But he doesn’t have anxiety, weed is his life and it’s fucking depressing. It’s all he ever thinks about and what his friends are all about. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m working in industry that’s tough to break in. I’m working for free right now. I want to eventually support my mom like my dad did. I want my brother to leave our lives and quit making it hell. If my dad leaves he’s less of a man in my eyes. He’s never been challenged before and this is what he does when he is.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not worried about my future, I’m worried about my family. I don’t want to lose them.

alnd6d,3,2019-01-31,I’m finished college in four months and I feel like I won’t make it as an adult,whoreyinthehouse,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/alnd6d/im_finished_college_in_four_months_and_i_feel/,"Let’s start with some background. 

When I was younger I was heavily depressed due to the environment I was living in. I lived in a very abusing household with my mother, and attempted suicide multiple times. I was failing high school and figured I had nothing going for me anyway, so why even try for a adulthood? 
Fast forward to grade 12 and I was still living with my mother, who was now married to an equally crazy man. 

One evening I invited my long term boyfriend over on one of the many nights they left me alone, and soon after they found out. 
Long story short I was kicked out. 

Soon after I ended up moving in full time with my father. Suddenly life was looking better. My grades were improving, I started applying for college, I became NC with my mom and I felt more free than I ever have. 

But then, as soon as I finished high-school my dad and step mother changed. 
They became strict and angry and honestly started to scare the hell out of me. 

They drilled a fear of failing into my head, warning me that I would ruin my life if I failed college. 

With the trauma I still held in me, I became very withdrawn, soon becoming heavily depressed again. And then came the big blow. I failed my first year of college. 

Due to my fear of letting my parents down, I decided giving up was better that letting myself down with real failure. 

The course was a base course, only a one year certificate program, and my parents wanted me to branch out to something more specific. 
I kept my failure quiet and didn’t tell my father until it was forced out of me after days of questioning. He was angrier than I’ve ever seen him in my life. 

Fast forward another two years and I am finishing a degree I love. In four months I will getting an internship and graduating, a place I never thought I would get to. 

But as I became older, my dad became more and more adamant that despite my 4.0 GPA, and the recommendations of my teachers, that I was still going to end up a failure.

And now we are at the present. 

I have applied and gotten an interview at a very prestigious and hard to get into company. I worked my ass off to get this opportunity and I am terrified of the interview, and so forth the fear of failure is constantly at the front of my mind. And the idea of just giving up seems so perfect. Trying my hardest to overcome my feelings I decided to ask my dad for advice on what to do in my interview. 

Biggest mistake of my life. Cue a forty minute rant about stupid millennials and how I should just be googling my idiotic questions instead of wasting his time. He made me feel small and stupid and more of a failure than I have felt in months, completely reverting me back to where I was two years ago. All the while my step mom sat quietly in the corner. 

So now it’s three a.m. and I am in my bed, unable to sleep due to anxiety. 

Isn’t this the point in life where you should be able to come to your parents for guidance? 
What happens when I get my first house and a pipe breaks and I have no one to ask for help?
Or if I have children and I want to know if something is normal?

I have no one to go to without the fear of being belittled for asking a simple question. 
I feel so angry that I was brought into this world with the parents I have. I feel like giving up all over again and I feel like dying more than I have felt like in years. 

All I want is guidance and love from SOMEONE. Is that too much to ask for?

I feel like on my own I will fail, that I can’t be a successful adult as the person I am, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t see a point in going further than this if I am just going to fail anyway.

alo2c3,14,2019-01-31,Solov'ev equilibrium,gundros,fusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/fusion/comments/alo2c3/solovev_equilibrium/,"Greeting,

I'm a studen on physics and Nuclear Fusion. Right now  i am doing an internship and i need the Magnetic flux equation for a Tokamak.

There is this equation, named after the one who derived it (i think) : The Soloviev equilibrium. You can find this equation in two forms with two different set of parameters.

The first one is the one in Solov'ev's paper: &lt;&lt;The Theory of Hydromagnetic stability of toroidal plasma configurations&gt;&gt; published o February 1968 by L. S. Solov'ev.

This formula uses 4 parameters that he calls c0, a, b and I0, in order to find the magnetic flux.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/77xo1q2leqd21.png

R is the radius of the Tokamak, r the radial coordinate viewed from the poloidal cross section (can be interpreted as x), z the height and Psi the magnetic flux.

&amp;#x200B;

The second equation is the normalized version of the first one but with other parameters. Unfortunately i haven't being able to find a document were they show how to demonstrate it and the link between both formulas.

The parameters here are Epsilon the elongation, Tau the triangularity and sigma the value for coordinates at the height extremities (i think). And here Psi bar is the normalized magnetic flux with the largest closed surface.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vahhkq4pfqd21.png

https://i.redd.it/4xlo32oqfqd21.png

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my questions. How can i demonstrate this second formula, How find the link between both formula, And/Or i just need to de-normalize that second equation but how?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks on advance\^\^"

Just took 3 months off to explore going from having no formal freediving experience to SSI instructor. To give you my background, I am athletic and became a divemaster through an internship last high season. 

I have been able to get down to 10 meters on a breath hold with no sinus or ear equalization issues (during scuba season last year), but now that I'm doing my SSI level 1, I can't get past 4 meters. From what I've gathered through this course so far, I've been using VTO during my entire dive career. I've learned how to do Valsalva yesterday and can easily equalize my right ear. 

However, it's my left ethmoid sinus and middle ear that I believe to be the culprits. I'm not congested, not sick, don't have allergies, and am not eating any foods that would irritate my sinuses or create mucus. Does anyone on here have tips? Does anyone on here know if this is a limiting factor that makes others quit freediving? I'm worried that I may not be able to reach this goal that I've set for myself. Thanks for reading!"

Neil Anderson CCNA Udemy

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently pursuing an Information Technology degree in a University. I have no prior work experience (only took up a short internship as required by the curriculum). The curriculum is very broad, there are a lot of possible routes for a student to focus on (eg. web development, IoT, database administration, networking, etc.). Networking got me interested so I have decided to pursue for a certification. The CCNA courses taught was a hit or miss, it depends on the instructor really. After finishing the 4 CCNA courses students are given an exam discount and I immediately scheduled for the ICND. I borrowed Lammle's book in the university library and bought Anderson's discounted video course.

&amp;#x200B;

About the exam. The experience was pretty good although nerve wrecking since I was bombarded with simlets and testlets for the first 15 questions. I was given extra 30 minutes for the exam (non-native speaker in a non-english speaking country); finished it with an hour left. 

You will know your result right after you're done, read the questions thoroughly. Get a good sleep and meal before taking the exam. I got the real foundation through self-studying, lurking in this sub and asking questions in the discord channel.

&amp;#x200B;

Onwards to ICND2!

alpnf5,1386,2019-01-31,"""My highschool dropout daugter needs a job now!""",GermanDoggo88,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/alpnf5/my_highschool_dropout_daugter_needs_a_job_now/,"I've been a bit on this sub reddit and remembered a good story about an entitled mother (EM) and her highschool dropout daughter (ED)  who was just as entitled as her mother.

A little info I live in Belgium and have an internship at an    
interim office, if you don't know what that is it's basically an office that specializes in finding jobs for other people. It's a really fun and rewarding job but it has it's down sides. 

If you drop out of highschool in Belgium it's really really hard to find a job since almost no company wants to hire you only fast food places, retail stores and    
production companies.

Now let's get to the story.

&amp;#x200B;

This all happened in the month January which is a very busy month for us and we had a lot of people and companies to call, I was working on a list of people who were quitting/fired meaning I had to call them and ask the reason for them leaving the company when this lady and her daughter walked in. I greeted them with a smile and asked what I can do for them.

EM: ""My daughter is looking for a job.""

Me: ""Ok ma'am do you have an appointment?""

EM: ""No.""

Me: ""Sorry but you will have to wait a little bit none of my colleagues are available at the moment, I'm almost done with my task and then I'll help you right away.""

EM: ""Can't you help us now? I'm sure your task can wait a bit longer.""

Me: ""Sorry ma'am you don't have an appointment with us and that means you don't have priority and my task is very important and needs to be completed asap.""

EM: ""Fine.""

She was obviously not happy with my response but she sat down and gave my a glare, I just sat down and continued my work.

&amp;#x200B;

After maybe 10 to 15 min I was done with my task and invited her to sit at my desk. She quickly came over and sat down and I could see by the way how she walked that she was very pissed, her daughter took a seat next to her and I started with filling in the standard information: name, age, address, etc. After that I started with more specific questions.

Me: ""What kind of job are you looking for?""

ED: ""I want to work as a kindergarten teacher.""

Me: ""Hmm that's a bit difficult to find I don't think we have any at the moment but we do have some applications for a daycare, would you be interested for that?""

ED: ""Sure.""

Me: ""Great, before you can apply for that I need a copy of your second grade diploma so I can add it to your profile otherwise you won't be able to apply for this job.""

ED: ""Oh I don't have a second grade diploma.""

Me: ""I'm sorry you can't apply for this job then, may I suggest you apply for a job in retail or fast food? We have a lot of those at the moment.""

At this point EM is at her boiling point, she puffs up and starts to go on a rant.

EM: ""My daughter is not going to work at a dirty fast food joint! She is way to smart and pretty for that! She wants to work at a daycare!""

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am but your daughter needs a secondary diploma for that. If she doesn't have one I'm not allowed to give her that job.""

EM: ""She's smart enough for that job so she doesn't need a diploma just give it to her!""

Me: ""I can't give the job to her ma'am, she needs a secondary diploma by law if I give her that job it can cost me my internship and can give the company legal trouble and I can't afford to do that.""

She pulls up her nose and gives my a glare of pure disgust.

ED: ""of course it had to be an intern 'helping' us, you don't know anything can we see someone who actually works here?""

Me: ""All my colleagues are currently busy so I can't disturb them.""

ED: ""No you are lying they are probably in the breakroom go get them!""

At this point I'm getting sick and tired of this lady being an all around idiot I calmly get out of my seat and point to the door.

ME: ""Ma'am could you please leave, you are being very hostile towards me.""

ED: ""No how dare you even speak to me like that I'm not leaving until you get someone who knows what they are doing or my daughter gets a job in a daycare.""

Me: ""For the last time ma'am I'm not giving her a job in a daycare is she doesn't have a diploma, if I knew one of the employees in a daycare doesn't have a diploma I wouldn't send my kid there, now I'm asking you one more time to leave or I will call security.""

Me mentioning security scared her so she gathered her things and started walking for the door but not before giving me a death glare.

ED: ""I'm going to make sure that you lose this internship MARK MY WORDS!!""

&amp;#x200B;

I later heard that they went to a different office where the girl applied for a job in a fast food joint.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you liked this story I have plenty more about my time at the internship but not all of them are suited for r/entitledparents

But i am quite constraint by our network security into using only http POST/GET and cUrl, so i cant connect the clients to our wannabe-server-PC directly or host sites from there.

The whole transfer will be used maximum 100 times per day and the string that has to be transferred is max. 40 character long and doesn't need to be stored if the wannabe-server receives it instantly.

alqccl,3,2019-01-31,F4M - Showering with my Intern,Gullible_Individual,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/alqccl/f4m_showering_with_my_intern/,"Since becoming a junior executive my work/life balance has become ever more challenging. With the long office hours, regular travelling and an on-duty phone I’m never truly switched off. All my past hobbies, friends and relationships, even sexual ones, have become a forgotten footnote of my personal history.

Time management has become a finely tuned art form. Instead of shopping for groceries they are delivered to my door at a scheduled time; instead of cleaning my own home, I’ve hired a maid; and instead of post office gym sessions I get my exercise cycling to and from work. This last sacrifice comes with a bonus at work shower, lest I stink out my meetings with clients.

Today my hectic schedule is no different with a client meeting at 8am. Yet before I’ve even reached the office, my entire schedule is blown like the rear tire of my $2,000 road bike. After a quick repair at the side of the road I manage to get work at 7:50. I slide my bike into the stand without securing the chain and quickly make my way to the staff showers.

To my dismay each of the private stalls are fully in use. I pace back and forwards for a few seconds waiting for one of the culprits to hurry out the shower. The clock on the locker room wall tells me its 7 minutes to the hour. This meeting was with our most important and least understanding client.

With the bold decisiveness which had elevated me to my lofty position I poked my head into the nearest of the stalls. A slender, young and firm derriere stared back at me. I traced the slightly fluffy cheeks upward, over a very slim waist and broad wide shoulders before recognizing the short hazelnut hair of the young office intern. Unwavering I dropped the hanging towel from around by person and stepped into the shower behind the young man.

His torso swivelled in surprise as I stepped close behind him in the shower. My hand against his boyish waist prevented him from fully turning. Instead he could only swivel his neck to see my face over his shoulder. Nothing more, nothing less.

“I’m running late for a very important meeting” I whispered in his ear. “I won’t be more than a few moments. You just keep facing towards the wall and I’ll be out before you know it.”

The aghast nod of assent was enough of an approval for me and I edged him closer to the wall so I could drench myself in the warm stream. Quickly I soaked my skin, washing the sweat and roadside dirt from my skin with the young man’s own shower gel.

Throughout my companion was deathly silent and frozen stiff. I whispered a thousand soft apologies into his ear to make him feel at ease. In an attempt to share the facet we were perilously close.

Continually his firm little buttocks pressed against my groin and my soft soapy breasts squished against his swimmers back. There was no doubt he could feel the sharp excitement within my nipples.

The longer I stayed the longer I considered the young man. His body was so young, so fresh. I was little past 30 myself yet I’d never been with someone so young, at least not since I was so myself. He was a perfect young specimen and I was curious just how experienced this man-boy was.

Time was getting away from me however and I sadly must go. A devilish idea came into my head just before retreating.

I slid my arm around the minuscule, yet iron waist of the youth and whispered one last time in his ear.

“Shall we say, 7:30 tomorrow?”

I asked before I licked the lobe of his ear and nibbled gently between my front teeth. I then stretched for his shower gel once more, pressing firmly against him as i did so, and then placed the bottle in his hand.

“Enjoy the rest of your shower! Take all the time you need.”

________________________________________

Hi all,

Please take the time to respond with a continuation of the prompt. First to finish is not an admirable quality for us girls. To help you along below are some ideas of how you could continue:

•	Write about you and your background. i.e. company and/or sexual.

•	Write this prompt so far from your perspective.

•	Write about the rest of your shower thinking of me.

•	Write about the remainder of the day in the office.

•	Write about the anticipation for tomorrow.

None of the above need to be followed and creativity is encouraged. Just trying to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

Hope to hear from you soon! xoxo

Can anyone help me with some advice or websites where you could find available internships in this field?

She was everything. She was there at the lowest point in my life, she supported me through uni, through my first internship, and my first job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made one of the biggest mistakes, yet I don't regret it. Communication has always been hard between us. Problems kept stacking up and no one was able to share anything. I could see it wouldn't work in long-term. It was the hardest decision, even harder because just a few months ago, I promised I would not let her go and I couldn't keep my words.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I deal with this? Should I try and talk to her? I broke it off in a moment of heat simply because she was avoiding all kinds of communication and social media. If I was able to talk, things could be different so I hope it can be different now if I talk to her.  Should I wait? Or should I move on? To be honest, I don't feel like we have ""closure"", and I hate that feeling, but at the same time I can't continue knowing one day, it would be too late to break up and that's a big risk."
alr3in,25,2019-01-31,How can I move from my patron-facing role to technical services?,dollfaise,librarians,https://www.reddit.com/r/librarians/comments/alr3in/how_can_i_move_from_my_patronfacing_role_to/,"I currently work in adult services but I'd love to work with technology more. I'm just not sure how to gain some of the skills I'm seeing in job postings like this: 

&gt;implementing / supporting integrated library automation systems and technical services experience, including original cataloging of materials, experience managing an integrated library system, preferably Aleph and/or Alma; experience implementing emerging technologies; experience with the ILLiad (Interlibrary Loan) system, EZ Proxy remote authentication software, and course management software 

There are other pieces in these descriptions that I already know or could teach myself on my own time but the things listed above are so library-specific that I don't know how to gain that kind of experience.

I know HTML and CSS, I'm learning Javascript, and I used to know Java decently well but I'm rusty. I've toyed with PHP and Python and I used Libguides a bit during my internship at an academic library. I know those languages might not help in this case, I'm just trying to demonstrate that I'm not assuming I'll like something I've had 0 interaction with. =) I also took a cataloging class in which I did original cataloging and while it kicked my ass, I *loved* it; I'd just need to go back over everything which I'd be happy to do.

I do tech support at my library but I'd be so thrilled if I could add to my skillset and eventually move into less of a patron-facing role. But how should I go about learning to ""implement/support integrated library automation systems"" when my current role doesn't give me any room to grow in any direction let alone a more technical one? I'm willing to do the hard work, I'm just not sure if I have any options outside of (expensive) college classes.

**TL;DR** I enjoy working with technology and am repeatedly drawn to job postings for technical services. While I'm not a total newb, I know I'm missing skills, particularly library-related skills like ""implementing/supporting integrated library automation systems"". I'm not sure if I have any options for picking these abilities up outside of more college courses."
alr5yg,9,2019-01-31,Advice on finding HR analytics internship,TastyEntertainment,IOPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/alr5yg/advice_on_finding_hr_analytics_internship/,"Hello all,

I am in my first year of a masters program, and I am hoping to find an internship in the data analytics area. Can anybody offer any insight into where to look and how to approach applications? I plan to have this chat with the career counseling department at my school, but a lot of you have the jobs I want, so I figured I’d tap into your knowledge as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue one is that I don’t know where to look. My university has sent out a few part time opportunities that look like they may offer data projects, but none are centered around HR analytics. For instance one posting says: “Interns are placed in specific departments… and will work on a range of projects and tasks including, but not limited to: conducting research, attending meetings, managing incoming inquiries, data analysis, drafting briefings, staffing events, outreach and special projects.” Also I’ve searched Indeed and Glassdoor for “HR analytics intern” or “people analytics intern.” Am I missing some obvious searches? Do broad internships like the one I listed seem like the best way to go?

&amp;#x200B;

Issue two is I am not sure which of my skills are transferable to such a role. I used to be an algebra teacher, so my quant skills are strong, as is my ability to make sense out of numbers to a lay audience. I do a lot of work with Excel, managing and tracking data. I do basic analysis, such as simple regression. I have some visualization skills (Power BI and the veeeeeeeery beginnings of R). Over the past few years, this has been my favorite part of my job, which is why I want to give HR analytics a try. Other than that, my experience is in education, and my skills are generally people focused. What from this will stand out to an employer? Are there any online classes that I should take to move the needle?

&amp;#x200B;

Third issue is that I don’t know the field well. What are the buzzwords I should be using in a cover letter? What industries are going to offer the greatest opportunities for growth? What sorts of projects and responsibilities should I make sure I have access to? 

&amp;#x200B;

Based out of New York City if that helps stir up any ideas.

Thank you for reading and thanks in advance for any help. I have a lot of love for this this community, which has given me great guidance already."
alrqse,4,2019-01-31,Co-op and internship opportunities for Computer Science,solo_jennie,miamioh,https://www.reddit.com/r/miamioh/comments/alrqse/coop_and_internship_opportunities_for_computer/,I am currently a freshman in the CS program and I would love to have a lot of working experience in the field before graduation. Can anyone comment on the internship and co-op opportunities for CS majors here? Do you struggle to find one at all? Will the school's location and ranking of the program affect my internship-seeking experience? Should I stay at Miami and look for opportunities on my own or transfer to a school with a prominent co-op program? I am thinking of transferring to UC because of their amazing Co-op program but I heard that their CS department has gone downhill recently.  I would really appreciate any tips or insights from CS majors on this forum.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I am in school still so our relationship is long distance. I met a girl during an internship over the winter and turns out we went to the same school. The first weekend of the semester my girlfriend wanted to visit so I said okay! My new friend, Stacy was having a party and ask if I wanted to come. I said maybe, my girlfriend is in town and i'm not to sure what our plans our. At that point Stacy said bring her too!

We went to the party and Stacy ""iced"" me upon my arrival because I'd never been ""iced"" but she did so by putting a drink in her dress, on her back so when I hugged her I felt it and drank my Smirnoff Ice like tradition. My girlfriend swears Stacy was flirting with me, I am pretty good a picking up on that stuff and felt no sexual tension between us.

Stacy has a boyfriend (who was also at the party!) and has been with him for a year and I have been with my girlfriend for 4 years.

That was the only time i had ever seen Stacy outside of the internship and I never hung out with her after work during the internship.

My girlfriend said she was bothered by her and the Smirnoff ice trick made her uncomfortable. She has an issue with me not seeing how Stacy was flirting with me. My girlfriend has asked me to stop seeing and talking to Stacy. I don't think I should have stop seeing this new friend....can I get some advice?

tl;dr 

Girlfriend asked me to stopping hanging out with a new friend"
als301,5,2019-01-31,A Bunch of Questions,lord_f4r,nyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/als301/a_bunch_of_questions/,"A bit of background: I was admitted to CAS for Economics and Mathematics and will be starting this fall. I've studied math, econ, business, and english in my junior and senior years (AS and A levels actually).

I was going through the majors at CAS and saw that there is a Computer Science and Economics joint major. I've also read that you can take courses (minors?) from other schools in NYU. So I had some questions:

1. As someone who has minimal knowledge about CS and not having studied sciences since sophomore year, is it viable to actually go for this CS and Econ joint major?
2. I've been super into games for a while now, and the Game Design minor seems pretty interesting. Would it make sense to take along with the CS and Econ joint major?
3. How well does the Sport Management course at the School of Professional Studies tie in with econ? Can I even take it along with my majors at CAS?
4. What can you do during the summer and winter breaks at NYU? My parents don't live in the US so I'll be in NYC for much of the year. Internships? Minors? Research?

Alright that's it for now. I'm SUPER all over the place but I just want to keep my options open and benefit from all that NYU offers. Add in any extra information you may have. Thanks in advance!"
alsdej,1,2019-01-31,My Aunt Triggered My PTSD by reintroducing me to my Nmother,formermoose,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/alsdej/my_aunt_triggered_my_ptsd_by_reintroducing_me_to/,"I went to my hometown a couple of weeks ago to visit my aunt. She lives a couple of blocks away from my family. I hadn't seen or spoken to any family members in months at that point. This wasn't the first time I'd stayed at her apartment, and apart from her attempts at persuading me to forgive my parents, she was mostly respectful of my decision to not see my family. She didn't ambush any meetings with them so I felt that I could at least trust her to respect my boundaries. I have explained to her multiple times that I LITERALLY HAVE A CONDITION THAT MAY TRIGGER DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY if I reestablish contact with my family, and that I would be very upset if she violated my one and only boundary. She promised she wouldn't do anything like that. So this time, she went ahead and violated that boundary. When I was about to leave to go back home, she brought my mom at the last minute before I even knew what was going on or could protest. It was super awkward and I had no idea how to handle it. Anyway, it's been a few weeks since that moment, and now every day I'm oscillating between crazy manic highs and super depressive lows and feeling extremely hopeless and suicidal. I'm trying to fill up my schedule and keep myself busy to distract myself, but it's just making my anxiety worse. I was doing really well emotionally up until this point. The last couple of months I worked really hard to manage my emotions and figure out how not to spiral into a deep hole of depression, and now I'm taking really hard classes, trying to run a small business,  get an internship, AND deal with this emotional turmoil all at the same time. Last time I spoke with her she called me and told me that I should unblock my parents because some of my mail ended up at my parents' house and I needed to unblock them on my phone if I wanted to get the scoop on what's in the mail. Fuck her and fuck them."

Al momento sto sondando il terreno per trovare lavoro in ambito ICT dato che sto per terminare la laurea magistrale in informatica.  
In particolare mi interesserebbe trovare lavoro come data analyst o un internship come data scientist (in quanto è la mia specializzazione).  
Ho iniziato ad inviare CV da poco, al momento utilizzo linkedin/ indeed/ adecco e monster ed una volta terminate con queste 4 cerco direttamente sui siti delle aziende che possono interessarmi (già che ci sono maledico taleo e career5.successfactors che mi obbligano ogni volta a fare una nuova iscrizione per ogni azienda), non sono molto interessato alla consulenza che terrei quindi come ultima spiaggia.  
Chiedo quindi se avete qualche consiglio su piattaforme e/o aziende di recruiting da utilizzare per trovare lavoro, magari anche specializzate per lavoratori in ambito ICT.  


P.s. dato che non devo frequentare questi ultimi esami avevo intenzione di cercare anche qualcosina all'estero."

I think there are multiple reasons for Schuabs douchebaggery.

1. He used to be all in on the pod because it was all he had going at the time. 

2. I think Bryan has to told Schaub he wants to step away (soonish) and just act and do comedy. Causing some resentment from Brendan. Also, the reason for start of the king and the sting.

3. Brendan feels he is equal to the counterparts that he surrounds himself with (Rogan, Delia, Theo, Callen), due to having 3 podcasts, 2 TV shows, doing some interviewing for showtime.

4. having the built in audience for his comedy shows from the podcast.

AND finally, the thing I feel has had the most impact,

5.  Filming a cawlmedy speshull. 

It seems like he regurgitates the same stuff that the other comedians have said about comedy, and sets, and filming, and being scared.. but it just doesnt sound authentic coming from him.  Hes been a dickhead to Chin, possibly ran off the other intern producers with awkward, forward remarks. 

I was never against him parlaying his position in life into a comedy career. but I feel like he thinks hes reached the end of the shortcut already and he still needs at least 5-8 years. 

Discuss. "

In the middle of the first week, I realized that one  of the only things keeping me engaged on rounds was the sense of humor  of the Pulm-Crit attendings and remembered some of my favorite [/r/medicalschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool) posts are memorable quotes, so I decided to record down some of my favorites:

* In  regard to an intern suggesting a lumbar puncture in a patient with an  intracerebral hemorrhage and increased ICP. “It’s like having your  finger blocking a garden hose. Move it and (exploding sound).”
* About  a patient with an acetaminophen overdose that was an overflow to the  cardiac ICU. “Wow, they’re going to hate that up there. This couldn’t be  further from the heart...and they complain about taking care of the  heart.”
* “Want  to see a lady I gave post-thoracentesis pulmonary edema? Why am I even  asking, of course you want to do. Who doesn’t like to see the mighty  fall?”
* After  evaluating a patient initially thought to have a grim prognosis. “The  family sure told you didn’t they? Fucker is going to bounce back from  death’s door.”
* “The sum of intelligence and common sense is a constant across all people. Start to gain one and you begin to lose the other.”
* Resident  looking into a patient room where a hemodialysis machine is whirring  away with blood flowing through the tubing, “Is he getting the  hemodialysis now or later today?”
* Talking  about a patient whose family refused to withdraw care for their parent  who had little to no hope of recovery. “If I start doing this to my  family members, would one of you hit me over the head with a fucking  bat?”
* About fentanyl lollipops. “It’s two for the price of one. It’s a lollipop and sweet, sweet narcs.”
* “You know the two things patients want most in the world: a diet order and Xanax”
* “Compassionate extubation. It’s the nomenclature. It makes us feel better about ourselves.”
* Attending to the night resident who received no calls or admissions overnight. “Did you put yourself on DVT prophylaxis?”
* In  regard to using isoproterenol to decreased the QTc. “All it does is  increase the heart rate, which iatrogenically decreases the QTc. You  could slap him in the face a few times and have a similar effect.”
* To  a family asking for a futile treatment. “I’ve explained why that won't  work to you seven times so far this week, but let’s do it for time  number eight.”
* “God  is only giving you physiology, not control over the pathology. It’s a  protective mechanism for the human race. Can you imagine what would  happen to the environment if we lived to be 1000 years?”
* In  the midst of a pimping session. Resident (contemplative), “I think  you’re right.” Attending, “Of course I’m right, why do you think I’m  quizzing you?”
* Attending:  “Only the first two drinks count. After that, you can give me the worst  $10 bottle of vodka and I won’t care...I won’t even know what I’m  drinking.”
* To  the nurse of a dying patient, “All of this talk on rounds is just  teaching. There’s nothing productive for us to do in there except  compassionate extubation.”
* “She’s  dying. What we’re doing with medications is like holding a roll of  gauze in front of a semi truck and praying it will stop it.”
* “She has multiple sacral stage IV decubitus ulcers. If we discharge her to an ECF, she’ll have poopoo in the booboo.”
* About a patient with horrendous breath. “You could probably use steel wool on his teeth and be fine.”
* “This poor lady has decubs the size of dinner plates.”
* To  the nurse of a comatose patient with ischemic digits whose family  refused to withdraw care. “How do you feel about taking off the  dressings when they come in and shining a light on her fingers? It would  be something more tangible than saying she has multiple strokes, CHF,  sepsis, and an AKI.”
* About  a patient who kept dropping her hemoglobin. “Palliative care has black  towels so you can’t see the blood. I think this lady needs the black  towels”
* About a patient with Wernicke’s Encephalopathy. “He doesn’t have a stroke. He has brain...itis?”
* “If you go to Toledo, you’ll get to see roaches running up and down the walls.”
* “Wasn’t this in a Tarantino movie?”
* “Thank  goodness for palliative care. Those are people capable of the emotional  support that I am not. I am not a touchy feely person at all.”
* Resident, “This patient is a shit show.” Attending, “Oh my favorite! I’m in the mood for a challenge today.”
* On  a patient with end stage cancer. “In my opinion, it’s malpractice on  the part of the oncologist to have this patient admitted as a full  code.”
* “We saved her life...or prolonged her death due to advanced dementia. I suppose it depends on your outlook on life.”
* On  a persistently vegetative patient. Resident, “The family seems to think  she’s going to walk out of here.” Attending, “I think that would  require a brain transplant.”
* “Manny  Rivers pulled a MAP of 65 out of the air. I think that’s too high for  anyone, so I’m pulling a MAP of 60 out of the air for my patients.”
* On early goal-directed therapy for sepsis. “Turns out you can harm people by giving them too much fluid”
* Resident,  “Is there any family?” Attending, “There are two adult children. I saw  them on the first day...they smelled strongly of marijuana.”
* Regarding  a patient with metastatic cancer. “I don’t see anything we can  intervene on. His lungs are almost more cancer than lung. My  recommendation for his dyspnea would be morphine.”
* About  the Surviving Sepsis guidelines. “Turns out, if you give our patient  population, who tend to be morbidly obese, the amount of fluid in the  guidelines, they come out of it looking like balloons.”
* Anesthesia paged overhead for intubation on a floor patient. “Oh good, it sounds like we have a new customer.”
* On  Jehovah’s Witnesses and transfusions. “I always understood it that they  thought the soul was in the blood. So if you get a transfusion, it’s  mixing the souls...like making a soul margarita.”
* When  talking about downgrading a patient and transferring to the floor. “Oh  no, don’t send her to that attending. I’d rather let her die here in  peace than have her suffer through him.”"

Asking for my girlfriend.

She is doing an internship for 6 months in Hamburg currently and is renting a room with a family.

Now she wanted to legally register her address there ([Anmeldung des Hauptwohnsitzes]^^1 ). For that she needs the confirmation of the Landlord (Wohnungsgeberbestätigung).

But here's the problem. Her Landlord doesn't wanna sign that paper. He says he has to pay additional taxes if my girlfriend is registered on that address with his family.

So my question would be:

1. Is it really true that the landlord has to pay additional taxes just because of the registration? I'm suspecting that that's not the case, but that he would need to pay taxes anyway for renting out the room but chose not to do that and tries to keep a low profile. She does have proper contract though.
2. What's the worst case if my girlfriend does not register? I read something about fines up to 1000€. That's the worst case or might there be other consequences?
