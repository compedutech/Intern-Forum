5rc7w6,4,2017-01-31,Crescent Insignia ~ Internment Camps ~ Ghettoes,Svengali_Redux,bestofthefray,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofthefray/comments/5rc7w6/crescent_insignia_internment_camps_ghettoes/,"Banning 7 countries and 90 million people wasn't enough, Trump needs to ban more Muslim countries if America is to be truly safe.

And while he's at it he should also consider ...

1. Making Muslims wear a bright yellow crescent to identify themselves

2. Creating Internment Camps in each city to intern Muslims

3. Cordoning off little enclaves around mosques and build Mexican walls around them

4. Requiring the ghettoized Muslims to build and pay for their walls plus upkeep of ghettoes

5. Making wearing of abayas and hijabs a capital offense

6. Targeting madrasahs as breeding grounds for budding terrorists

7. Banning use of Arabic, Pashto, Urdu, or any language spoken by Muslims

9. Training Muslim collaborators to keep Muslim upstarts in line

10. Deporting any Muslim (even if US citizens) if she / he criticizes Trump presidency


These simple measures would be a very fine way of ensuring Muslims understand the Trumpster means business. Funding a political manage a trios comprising Marine Le Pen, Tzipi Livni, and Theresa May might be a most welcome distraction for the Trumpster mobsters ... for even the Bannons of the world deserve a bit of fun and games between the pogroms and the purges. Why not?"
5rcxd4,4,2017-01-31,How do I get out?,hippiejezus,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/5rcxd4/how_do_i_get_out/,"Living with my gfwBPD until our lease is up in August. We moved across the country together to get to a better living situation.  I had just graduated from school, she grew up in the same college town. Gradually as I was with her in FL, I saw outbursts come out. I ignored them or worse, nurtured her and encouraged the behavior. She has a long history of abuse from her father and ex's, most recently an abusive ex 6 months before she met me. Originally she considered that she had schizophrenia, from her grandmother having it, then it changed to bipolar, then an official diagnosis of borderline. Even now with the official diagnosis she says her disorder may change later down the road. 

Before we moved I somewhat knew what I had gotten myself into, but was just so eager to move for an internship I felt like ""we'll deal with it better when we get there"". There are much more mental health resources here in CO, which she is now utilizing, slowly, but the process leading up to this has just been rocky. 

Over the holidays, with my family here, I had to call an ambulance for her mental health because I was just fucking tired of being yelled at for not understanding why I'm being yelled at. 

A month after we moved, we went to a carnival like event with rides and lots of beer. She ended up drunk, then violently dissociating, pushing me off of her like I was a creepy stranger trying to grope her. To make it worse, the cops noticed her and tried to help me calm her down. They tried to restrain her and she ended up yanking away and pushing a cop away from her. Easily could have gone to jail that night, still amazing to me that she didn't. After the cops let her go with me, she pushed me off her again. She stayed at the car while I went to get my sister. When we got back, my gf was gone. Freaking out, i called the cops, missing persons, everyone. She ended up hitchhiking about 8 miles back home, in a city she barely knew.

I have a mental &amp; physical dependency on pot, she does as well but much more heavily dependent, as well as much more impulsive with frequent alcohol use and junk food, and I feel as though being with her is just making my pot habit worse. Before I knew her I had at least some judgment and willpower to not smoke. Now all I want to be is stoned to at least not mind being shut out, argued with, yelled at, then kissed, cuddled, and given a blowjob.  

When it comes to talking about these dissociations, violent outbursts towards herself (punching herself in the legs mainly), and breakdowns, I can hardly get any word of logic or good steps to take in before she bites back with victimization of herself. She says when she has outbursts she just can't control herself from screaming the most hurtful things to me, ignoring my concerns, and anyone just has to deal with them when she's like that. This often leads to another outburst and self harm. ""I'm such a piece of shit! Such a piece of fucking shit"" is always what I hear. 

It's doing a number on me to just not be able to express myself. I'm such an extrovert and i feel so trapped and tied down. No conversation can ever be about my troubles. She says I need to get my own therapy which I don't completely doubt (had a very mild recurring depression for a few years), but I feel like what I need more is a partner whom I can speak to unfiltered and have listen to me thoroughly. 

I've been on this sub all day and thank you fucking all of you for having it here. Everything I've read here as led me to say and affirm what I've already felt for months, that I need to leave. But when it comes down to it, how can I realistically get out of this relationship right now? The lease is for another 5 months. Do I just break it off officially now and live with an ex for 5 months? Done it before, not fun.

I'm just so tired. I'm literally physically exhausted from just TALKING and THINKING. "

5rd1w4,4,2017-01-31,Questions about the ACO Job Hiring Process,[deleted],animalcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/animalcontrol/comments/5rd1w4/questions_about_the_aco_job_hiring_process/,"Please forgive me, this post might be a long one.

I've recently applied to three different ACO positions in Southern California. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that they all work under their cities' respective police departments (not SPCAs) so my questions may be geared towards those ACOs that fall under police departments.

I applied to two different positions with Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. and San Diego County Sheriff's Dept. back in 2014. I got disqualified by both counties, mainly because I honestly stated my marijuana use about six months prior on the background check. These positions that I applied for weren't ACO, but for corrections.

In around October 2015, I got drunk and may have tried cocaine (Very stupid, I know). I haven't used any drugs since then.

My questions are:

1) Will the hiring process for ACOs be as strict about drug use as the hiring process for sworn police officers (in regards to the background check and polygraph)?

2) If it is, will there ever be a chance of me being DQ'ed for years to come?

I'm asking these questions because I know what it's like being denied a job like this because of dumb, young mistakes in life. I also know that the application processes for these types of jobs take a long time, so I'd like to know what can DQ me early on so I don't waste my time for now.

I've dreamed of working with animals in some capacity and I feel like being an ACO can be something that fits my kind of work. Not to toot my own horn, but I feel that I'm well-qualified for the job as well. I was in the military as a police officer and dealt with impounding animals and wildlife-related calls often, I assisted with the military k-9 program at my last duty station by providing husbandry and training to the military working dogs, I've been going to school and have 42 credits toward my Veterinary Technology Associate's, and I have +150 hours of Veterinary Technician internship experience in veterinary general practice clinics and emergency hospitals. 

I don't want my mistakes to define me and I would really appreciate the help on this."

I need to put forth my best effort to get experience but I know based on my own observations and judgement , that I will not be getting exactly what I need to move up. That all being said. 

How can I get solid exp. with vmware? Here are some ways I have come up with . 

1) Buy servers, storage devices (Servers should be UCS servers by cisco, backup can be anything cheap (netapp,brocade, etc ) 

1a. Use this lab to get the VCAP DCA &amp; DCD , maybe VCP NV &amp; VCAP NV , 

1b. Use the UCS servers to learn about the UCS systems and VMWARE integrates into it


2) Build a nested lab in vmware workstation ( I have 32 GB of ram and 8 cores (AMD) 

3) continue asking my boss for access (which is a very bad idea because they give out incentives when you don't ask 

4) shadow someone during the day time by hunting for a internship position somewhere close by. 


Do you guys have any tips? I really know pairing UCS cert with VMWARE will be extremely good as well as adding a microsoft server engineer cert. 

Please let me know what you guys think , this would all be greatly appreciated. Thanks. "

I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

────────

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 2.

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid. This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."
5rg04m,10,2017-02-01,After almost 8 months I am official a college graduate!,FiercelyFuzzy206,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/5rg04m/after_almost_8_months_i_am_official_a_college/,"Not that I graduated in only 8 months no, it was a 4 year degree. However, a part of my college is you MUST have an internship (or a 3rd project) to graduate. Senior year I got my internship...kinda. I didn't get it until 2nd semester so I was really cutting it close. Oh, I was also ONE(!) credit short from graduation. I signed up or a community college course worth 1 credit and used that. The class ended LITERALLY DAYS before graduation so it cut it VERY close.


Then my internship guy. It took him about 3 weeks to arrange a meeting to see if he even wanted to accept me. He finally did, not leaving much time left for work (we have to be graded on what we complete for them by both the company and our advisor).


Well, let's just say things didn't go very well. I interned at a very well known place. They are very popular in their field, but it's honestly run by mostly volunteers. 

I told the guy what I had plans to do for him, he told me what he wanted and we agreed on a rather reasonable and easy plan.


Fastfoward to me actually working on this. He calls me up asking to meet him at X. I drive to X (It's only like 30 minutes away). I informed him I had work later that day so I can't stay too long due to the 30 minute drive back. Well I arrive at X...and I spend an HOUR looking for him. Turns out he wasn't at X but Y. I checked email/text and the website and none of these things indicate that he would be at Y (I checked the calendar which posts where they are...).


So I finally get there, kinda ticked but whatever, mistakes happen, right? So, we're talking more, he's introducing me to people. Telling me what he is planning and that he'll get me some pictures to work with.

Well. This is where the real fun begins. I spent over a month of emailing him trying to get information and....well...anything. 

I finally get an email with SOME information and some emails of people he wants me to conduct interviews with. He gives me 6 emails. If any of you have worked with the public...you know that people aren't too interested in doing things like this without an incentive. And SIX? I'm lucky if 2 reply!

Anywho...I get those reviews all typed up...and he doesn't provide me with any social media or way to post said interviews. So now what....I email him and he spends over 2 weeks trying to get me admin on Facebook....(still never got that figured out).


So I keep emailing him asking what's up and he doesn't respond. About a week goes by and I send another email. He sends one sentence reply

""You were suppose to be here this week.""



So....the guy who doesn't communicate anything expected me to be somewhere....without telling me....oh, also I work. I can't be there at anytime.


I finally met with my advisor (who I should have been CCing into this after the second week of no responses) and provide him all the work I did, all the work I had done (but didn't give this guy because he doesn't deserve my work if he isn't even going to talk to me about it) and all my recorded attemps at conversation.


My advisor said he talked to him and found out that we had kind of different understandings of what was expected. This guy wanted me to send every weekend watching and posting about it....which is not only not possible due to my work schedule...but we also never even talked about this once (found out later this is what anther intern did for him from my college).

My professor sees all the stuff I have (including my attempts to talk to him)


He says that he thinks I have enough done to pass he just wants me to put it together in a way to present it.


Finally (last month) I was presented with my grade B+ (eh, whatever) and I am now officially a college graduate! (though I've been telling people I graduated before this because I had ALL the work and courses done.....sooooo)

What in the world do I do?,MagesticSSS,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5rg8uw/ive_20m_started_to_like_my_roommates_20m/,"Hello everyone, this is going to be an odd one, so be forewarned. I’m here because I recently **started liking a crush I had since high school again**, and it’s driving me nuts. We met in grade 11 and I’ve liked her ever since - for reference, I’m currently in my third of university, so that’s 5 years now. After meeting, we really hit it off so I thought things were going well, but then I learned she had a boyfriend and decided it best to step off since I had no chance.


Problem is, the **feelings never really went away**, it was more of a suppression than anything. For the duration of high school, I just stopped talking to her, so it wasn’t a problem. However, after my first year of university, I switched institutions because I was going through a lot of issues with depression. The uni I switched to had most of my close friends in it, but both her and her boyfriend also go here. As of now, **I currently live with both of them** (well with the boyfriend, but she is always here since we’re all high school friends).


Both her and her boyfriend are easily in my top 10 closest friends. However, because of my feeling for her, I’ve been **starting to resent the bf**. In the last 2 weeks or so, I’ve gotten leaps and bounds closer with most of my friends. This is because I finally opened up about the struggles I’ve been facing these last few years (depression, anxiety, dropping classes, etc.), and this has led to them doing the same to me. While it’s deepened my friendships, it also resulting in me learning that **she has no intention of staying together with her boyfriend** past this upcoming summer.


In essence, I learned that she feels her boyfriend is selfish and extremely childish, and that she is getting sick of dealing with it. To me it seems that they are only together now because they are in a routine from dating so long, and so that she can continue being with the rest of her friends at my house (we’re a very tight knit bunch). I could go into further detail, but it doesn’t really matter, since I realize that **I’m probably just using this as a way to rationalize my thoughts**. I’d like to say I’m fine with losing him as a friend if it means I would get to date this girl, but in reality, I know it **would probably cause my other friends to resent me** as well due to the betrayal of the bro code (I feel like an idiot typing that, but you get the point).


I just feel as though we would make a really good match for each other since we have so much in common (personalities, career aspirations, divorced parents leading to a different way of thinking, etc.), but at the same time I highly **doubt the feeling is mutual** - mostly because she probably hasn’t even given it a second thought due to being in a relationship. Also, **in no way do I want to try and tank their relationship**, since I grew up with a dad who cheated on my mom so I’m extremely against infidelity of any sort (it’s why this is so hard for me since my feeling are contradictory to my beliefs).

Now, despite all of that, **for the last week or so I haven’t stopped thinking about her**. After our most recent deep conversation where I helped her clear up some inner doubts, I even had a dream in which we were dating (creepy and cringey, I know - just being honest so I can get good advice). When we discussed her relationship, she said that even though nothing was wrong (no arguments and such), that everything wasn’t right either (their relationship is extremely superficial since the bf doesn’t respond well to communication and is immature).  It’s gotten to the point now that **I’m seriously considering finding a way to go through the 36 questions that lead to love with her…**

At the end of the day, I **just want to know if I have a chance** or not so I can move on. Even if they break up, she is on an internship next year while I’ll be studying, so we probably won’t have that much time together in person. **So, what do I do?** Just go through with the questions thing and see where it goes? Casually mention I used to like her but that I’m over it now to judge the reaction? Speak to a mutual friend that knows a bit about my crush and see what he says? Try to just tough it out? Please be brutally honest about whether or not I’m being creepy/selfish/whatever, because **I need to get over this hurdle**. Thank you so much for reading this, and for any advice you may be able to give me.  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Starting to like the girl dating one of my best friends again. Want to see if I have a chance, but I know I probably don't and that it will cause my other friends to think worse of me. Do I try to address the situation in person or through a friend, or do I just leave it be?"
5rgcd7,1,2017-02-01,Clarification about Taxes,riskymint,perktv,https://www.reddit.com/r/perktv/comments/5rgcd7/clarification_about_taxes/,"So I read through the [#RealTalk about Perk Taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/perktv/comments/3u0yki/a_realtalk_about_perk_taxes/) and [#RealTalk about Perk Taxes 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/perktv/comments/440uw7/realtalk_2_about_perk_taxes/) guides written by /u/InternetUser007 to refresh my memory about how filing taxes works, but I'm still a bit confused.

Side note: If you haven't checked out the guides and need help understanding how taxes are supposed to work with perk, highly recommend reading the guides.

From what I understand so far, I need to take the income amount on my 1099-MISC and file it on Line #21 of my 1040. Where do state taxes and federal taxes come into play? I've seen people discussing it lately, but I don't know how to make sense of it in regards to filing out my taxes.

I'm also slightly confused on how filing taxes works when you're claimed as a dependent. For further context, I'm a full-time grad school student who relies on my parents for financial aid and I also live in their home when I'm away from the school and not involved in an internship. Assuming that they have claimed me as a dependent, does that mean I don't need to file taxes at all if my total Perk earnings are less than $1050? (My 1099-MISC quotes that I earned $975)."

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut. Or having it uploaded somewhere. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy. Been wanting a nice BWC lately

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere, I do love race play❤️, and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Lashana"
5rh16o,1,2017-02-01,I'm [24/f] resenting my boyfriend [24/m] for resenting me due to me moving 3 hours away for a job offer out of college.,cottoncandydrms,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5rh16o/im_24f_resenting_my_boyfriend_24m_for_resenting/,"Background: I changed majors more than I could count-so often that I didn't really have time for meaningful interns. So a few months before graduation in 2015, I accepted the first job offer given to me about 3 hours away from my college town. So excited to make anything over $10/hr- I took it, (offer was in the ball park 60k), I was hesitant to wait for other job offers due to my lack of experience- I jumped the gun. It was a nice offer, in a major city- only 2.5 hours away from my parents and 3 hours away from him- I thought it was perfect...WRONG. We've been dating since 2012 BTW.

Other than this, we're pretty good, but he's been holding over the fact that I moved to this new city- let's just call it CITY B for a job thus creating the strains in our relationships. I just feel like I'm being blamed for starting my career. He also took a hiatus in school and quite frankly I wasn't sure WHEN he was going to finish. He still has one year left, and the conversation of him finding a job came up. BF told me ""If you think I'm moving to where you are- in city B, you're dead wrong."" He basically told me that he resents me for taking the job offer and breaking us apart. We see each other every 2 or 3 weeks on the weekends, and he can only come to me since he still lives with his mom at home while going to school in CITY A. Plus, his mom is a southern baptist who isn't too keen on the opposite sex spending the night at her house. I can't afford to get a hotel every time I want to visit him in city A- so we just opted out on my place, in CITY B. 

Recently, I told him that I was going to be looking for a new job, probably still in CITY B, since I just signed a lease with my new roommate. It's a major metropolitan city, endless of opportunities. He picked yet another fight with me asking me why I'm not looking anywhere near him. However, no matter how hard I try to explain why I took my job that I have now, he won't hear me out and calls me selfish. This is probably the lowest I've felt in my life.

This is what he said Verbatim: ""Ohhh, so NOWWW you can look for a job in the current city you're in and near YOUR friends, but didn't want to look here in city A when you were graduating huh? I see where your priorities are, you don't mind being far away from me do you?"" 

Well, first of all, he still has a whole year left, secondly there just aren't many job opportunities in our home state- its a small southern state. I want to work in a corporate environment, if I go back I'd have to work in a manufacturing setting, not something I want. He'll be getting an engineering degree and can get a job virtually anywhere- yet he doesn't want to compromise with me on picking a city we could both enjoy, solely because he feels like I was selfish for moving away in the first place- almost like doing it to spite me. He said ""well when I graduate, we can continue the long  distance thing, but you're going to have to visit me in CITY A now, just like how did with you these past 1.5 years. I'm not going to visit YOU at all- you're coming to me, just so you can know how I felt, driving 3 hours all the time just to see you. You created this gap, now you fix it."" 

I'm just at lost...I feel defeated. He can't seem to want to understand why I took this job- I mean you're 23 years old no experience, someone offered you a job for 60k in a city not too far from home- you'd take it too right? Am I being selfish NOT wanting to move back to city A? I understand he doesn't want to move to CITY B, but I'm willing to compromise... pick somewhere else that we both could enjoy. It's not like I moved across the country... it's easily a weekend trip. Is it normal that I resent him for resenting me? "

Some of my viewpoints aren't, either.

I have an Uncle Steve who lives in San Diego, in a pretty swanky condo, and is a former executive of the airport who now professes at a local university. He's leaving for Spain (can't remember when) so I reckon someone has to take care of his condo in the meantime. If my wheels of the job search keep spinning without going anywhere, I find San Diego all the more alluring, also for more reasons than just career prospects.

#INQUIRIES:

1. I major in Automation Engineering at my local junior / community college (can't go to other types of colleges, for cost reasons.) Are there any companies in your area that will hire students for apprenticeships / internships in anything pertaining to automation engineering, while they study those subjects?

2. I currently have Kansas state health insurance (UnitedHealth KanCare.) How easy is it to switch to California's, and how well does CA's state health insurance cover services as opposed to Kansas's?

3. I need dental &amp; orthodontic work; braces (invisible or traditional metal) cost ~$5,500 in my region. How much will orthodontics cost in TJ? Also, a root canal would cost $1k in my area, and an implant would cost $3k. How much are those in TJ? As well, costs to whiten teeth?

4. What area community colleges offer German, Norwegian, Hebrew &amp; Korean language classes? (Because Germany, Norway, Israel or Korea are my top four choices in terms of where to move permanently someday. I'm 1/2 Korean, 1/4 Jewish. Germany and Norway won't charge tuition to foreign students.) What are the tuition and fees like at those local junior colleges?

5. My secondary aspirations are in parody songwriting. As you'd see on /r/plans, I have over 120 songs in the running. Now I need a recording studio. Do the junior colleges lend the use of their recording studios to their students for free? Any other free-use recording studios elsewhere in the area? Also, any local record labels that will pick up aspiring song artists? (No, I won't consider a 2-hour drive NW to be ""close enough."")

6. I also must learn to make music videos for these parodies. What area junior colleges also offer courses pertaining to them? (Video editing, digital cinematography, etc.?)

7. If my Uncle's condo association finds out that I'm living with him, will they charge him / me extra fees for adding a resident?

8. If I'm not to share the condo with him, what is the Section 8 situation like in the SD area? (I'd prefer to live within 20 minutes of Tijuana, so that should give you my preferred radius.)

9. I feel that a local region's job culture only fits for certain personality types. Have you known anyone who had problems with employment elsewhere, followed by a better career in the SD area? Therefore, will anyone incompatible with the Kansan job culture find better compatibility with San Diego's?

10. I dreamed of working for a video game company in high school, starting as a tester, and moving on up from there. What video game studios are in the area, and what are their starting wages / salaries?

11. If I'm to live in my own apartment, what neighborhoods must I not consider (due to crime, etc.?)

12. My car's property tax was ~$81 / year in Kansas. How much is it expected to cost in SD? (2002 Chrysler PT Cruiser, Limited trim)

13. Are there any ""Kansan's habits"" that I must lose when I move to SD? Which ones, and how come? Likewise, any ""San Diegan's habits"" that I need to gain?

14. What does the area have in terms of Vocational Rehab in a local DCF office? How effective are SD's Voc. Rehab services as opposed to my area's?

15. How serious is the potential earthquake threat? (On the flip-side, earthquakes are happening more often in my neck of the woods due to fracking in nearby OK.)

I sure hope a move to SD will seriously upgrade my life; get me out of a rut at long last."

I'm new to web dev and intern at my university. Primarily we use the ASP.NET framework and visual C#. I found a book called ""Hacking the Code"" by Mark M. Burnett, published by Syngress. The book was published in 2004, though; making it outdated.

She claims they're just friends but she always makes an extra effort to be there for him whenever he needs or just be around him when hanging out with a group. They recently had a rift about money, she owed him some and told him when she could pay him back but all she was met with was rudeness - he resorted to name calling and would always bring up the fact that 'shed owed him' even though he never explicitly mentioned that he needed the money sooner (had he done this, she would have made it work) and I got to listen to a litany of grievances about how 'hes never acted like this before', 'why would he do this to me' along with excuses for him such as 'we're such good friends though i dont want to break it off for something silly' and 'he doesnt handle confrontation well'. IDGAF how he handles things, he handled this terribly and shes just the sitting punching bag, he has an obvious appetite for power and held this thing over her head until she paid him back. 

i keep telling her shes better than this and shouldnt be treated like that, especially when you made it clear about the situation. however now i find theyre back to being best buds and i dont want to see her fall down the slippery slope again (last time it ended in a lot of heartache over the loss of a 'good friend' aka 'some charismatic jerk'). How can i help her see that this isn't good and that she doesnt have to be the one to 'fix him'? the sad thing is shes a lovely and caring person and will go out of her way to help ANYONE at ANYTIME and I feel like this guy is just abusing that and doesnt appreciate her good nature but she just doesnt see it. 

also at some point a few months ago she admitted that she may have feelings for him but claim they are now gone, from the way shes behaving i dont think thats the case, or maybe that has something to do with it. I've told her that shes better and she KNOWS he's a shitty person but still 'values the friendship' enough to not end things. For reference they've known each other for 7months, met during an internship.

#Class/Abilities  
  
Every role falls into 1 of 4 Classes  
  


#Attacker  
**These players can cause the death of another player.**  
&gt;Some are limited to how many times they can kill. Some have consequences if they kill the wrong role. Some only kill certain roles. Some kill other players that target or attack a selected player.
  


#DataMiner  
**These players collect data about another player during the night phase.**  
&gt;Information can include things like the players role, faction, or class. It can also include information such as who targeted that player. Some are handicapped with what information they receive, such as receiving lies about the player instead of truth.
  


#Influencer  
**These players influence how other's night abilities resolve.**  
&gt;This includes preventing a player from using their ability, forcing them to target themselves, forcing them to target someone else, or preventing a select player from being targeted by anyone else. Some of these actions are passive (IE don't require the player to target anyone).
  


#Support  
**All other roles are classified as Support.**  
&gt;Some of these players will receive select information at the start of the game, or throughout the game. Some might have special abilities regarding voting or gossip. Some might need to select targets to utilize their powers.
  
  
#NOTES  
  
**Gossip**    
Players are allowed to send 1 gossip per phase, with a max of 5 gossip through the whole game, to another player. These will be submitted through a form, and sent anonymously via the Hosts.  
  
**Interns**    
Many of the roles have INTERNS (they are 'SUPPORT' class roles). These are similar to the Apprentice roles in traditional Werewolf games, where you take over your Boss's abilities if they die (or are converted). Interns get an additional perk where they are informed who their Boss targeted each phase. Intern will convert to the Class of their Boss when they take over the job, but interns will retain their original Role name.  
  
**Pairbonded**  
There are multiple sets of 'pairbonded' characters. If either person in the pairbond set dies, then the other one dies. Being converted into a Librarian will break the bond, resulting in no deaths if either dies. Pairbond sets start the game knowing the identity of their partner.   
  
**Codes**  
  
We've provided an easy code reference for additional details of the roles.  
  


|LETTER|MEANING|    
|:-:|:-|    
|Pairbonded||    
|Boss/Intern||

#ROLE CLARIFICATIONS    
  
**Details and Clarifications for Roles and Abilities will go HERE**  

* Not ALL librarians get to convert a player per phase, only the librarian Tammy 2 sends out to perform the conversions! (the rest of the librarians vote for who they want to convert each phase)

* Roles will be revealed upon death, unless another character's action prevents this from happening

* The total # of lynch votes will be revealed

* You can submit your action(s) as many times as you want, but we're only counting your last submission

* You can only send 1 gossip per phase (to a max of 5 for the whole game, unless otherwise stated in your character bio), so if you wish to retract a gossip, submit a blank gossip form and we'll take that instead

* All roles have a place in the Order of Operations found below, but the order of operations for characters with the SAME type of action is a secret (sorry, you have to figure some things out for yourself!)
  
***  
  
#ORDER OF OPERATIONS    
  
Since the phases will be combined Day and Night actions, here is a summary of how things will resolve...  
  


###DAY ACTIONS  
  
* KNIGHTING  
* TARGETING  
* GOSSIP  
* LYNCHING  
  
  
###NIGHT ACTIONS  
  
* ON ALERT  
* TARGET CHANGES  
 * (role blocks, hidden, confusion, redirect)  
* ACTION FAILURES  
 * (Dazzles, 50% Failures, Precision Failures)  
* DATAMINING  
* DEFENDING  
* ATTACKS  
* HEAL  
* FIRE ACTIONS  
 * (Douse, Undouse, Ignite)  
* SILENCING  
* CONVERT  
* TRIGGERED DEATHS  
* CLEAN UP  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
#**VOTING**  
  
For all Voting Ties, they will be broken randomly. If the target is immune, then nothing happens. If Conversion and Raccoon attack targets have already been lynched then the next top voted player will be targeted.

Please respond,wikitiki350,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/5rkcqt/just_cried_like_a_bitch_and_feeling_unstable/,"This doesn't have to do with FA directly, but for whatever reason after pouring my guts out on this sub countless times over the years I feel like you guys are the only ones I can really talk to, so I'm asking anyone who might care to give my venting a response so I'm not just screaming all of my fears into the void.

I barely know what to say, I just feel so worthless. I'm a CS major at a top school and I'm just starting the 2nd semester of my Junior Year. I'm constantly surrounded by and reminded of the success of my peers. People getting high profile internships at top companies, going off to work amazing jobs after graduating, etc. 

Meanwhile, I've never accomplished anything with my life. I applied to countless companies last year, got nothing, and spent the summer fighting depression and teaching myself new languages. I applied so several internships last semester, but so far I've only got one rejection and have heard nothing from the rest.

If I fail at getting an internship for the summer, I'm pretty fucked as far as career prospects go, so I can't help but feel my life hinges on what happens over the next few months. I often wish I was dead so I wouldn't have to deal with the constant fear and anxiety clawing at my soul. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm lost, scared, and falling apart."

Chapter-by-Chapter, Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

1.	First Love

a.	Camilla is 16-years-old and she is resolved to spend her summer by her family’s pool – mostly because her older brother (of 7 years), Ty, is spending his summer by their pool with his exceptionally attractive best friend, Declan. Declan is 22-years-old and going to school to get a degree in business so that he can take over his family’s brewery. Camilla likes Declan because despite his bad relationship with his father, he still tries to make his family work. 

b.	Cam is in the kitchen when Declan comes in to get a drink. Cam pulls herself onto the countertop and sits with her legs draped over the edge. She offers to make Declan a mixed drink. Cam lightly flirts with Declan, as she always has for the past 4 years since she has become interested in boys. Surprisingly, Declan flirts back and lightly touches Cam’s hand. Cam covertly hides that she is in an emotional and physical frenzy at Declan’s hand brushing her own. As Declan is leaning in, Cam thinks he is going to kiss her, stops with his face only inches from her own and grabs a bottle of water that was behind her. Cam laughs softly, Declan brushes her face with his hand and returns to the pool. Cam knows she is smitten with Declan. 

c.	Camilla is on the phone with her friend, Rachelle, gushing about Declan. Camilla is describing how handsome Declan is and how attentive he is with Camilla’s hobbies. Rachelle encourages Camilla to get Declan alone and kiss him to get his attention. 

2.	Bad News 

a.	A few days later, Camilla, Ty, and Declan are out by the pool soaking up the sun and talking about college. Camilla wants to become a journalist, Ty suggests she should become a chef, but Declan believes that Camilla’s work as a journalist could change people’s lives. Declan compliments the work Cam did on the exposé that saved over 100 dogs at a local kill shelter. Camilla blushes at the compliment and Declan’s sincerity. The boys decide they want to play darts in the basement to get some relief from the California heat.

b.	While they are playing darts, Declan gets a phone call. He sounds rigid on the phone, which is polarizing from his typical, upbeat personality. After he gets off the phone, he sits down in silence for a few minutes, staring at the ground. When Camilla approaches Declan, she notices that his beautiful gray and green eyes are filling with tears. She asks him what happened and he responds flatly that his mother was in a car accident and died. 

3.	Big Change 

a.	A week later, Camilla is sitting in the Gazebo in her backyard when Declan shows up. Declan asks where everyone is and Camilla replies that everyone left to go to dinner to celebrate Ty getting a paid internship at a local law firm (the family is excited because the law firm typically only takes post-graduates for the paid internship position).  Declan tells her that he is there to say by to Ty and her family because he has decided to leave California. He confesses that his mother’s passing is too much for him to deal with, as his relationship with his father is nothing but strained. Cam tells Declan that there are too many reasons for him to stay. She lists finishing college – to which he replies that he can transfer all of his credits to any number of sister schools around the country. Cam replies that he should stay for “this” and she grabs his face and kisses him. At first he is unresponsive, but then he returns the kiss with passion and wraps his arms around Cam. As Cam grabs his shirt and begins to pull it over his head, he stops and backs away. He tells Cam that they cannot do this because she is his best friend’s baby sister and asks her to let her brother know that he will be in touch. He walks away and Cam is devastated by the rejection. 

4.	Seven Years Later

a.	Camilla is ripping up a picture of her and a guy and watching the pieces float into the trash before letting the lid snap shut. It has been seven years since that night and Cam recognizes that she still looks for Declan in every man she dates. Her last boyfriend had the same hair color as Declan and was almost the same height, but he paled in comparison to Declan’s dreamy gray and green eyes. But his eyes weren’t the reason things didn’t work out – it was his attitude about life. He always wanted to do incredible things, but simply didn’t have the motivation. Unfortunately, she broke things off right before her brother’s wedding, so she would have to call one of her friends to escort her. Mal, her camera guy’s attractive brother, agrees to take her to her brother’s wedding. 

b.	Camilla arrives at Ty’s wedding reception, and is cooing to Mal about how lovely the ceremony was. Mal has a few too many drinks and tells Cam that he brought a surprise for her – but that he left it in his dress jacket at the coat check-in. Cam goes with him to retrieve it, but Mal just stops cold once they are inside the coat-check room and grabs Cam’s face and kisses her. She pulls away as she pushes Mal off of her. He drunkenly confesses that he has always wanted to have sex in closet and puts one hand on Cam’s breast while the other hand reaches up her dress to start pulling at her underwear. She tries desperately to push him off of her but she is pinned in a corner. Out of nowhere, she sees a muscular arm covered with tattoos rush between her and Mal – grasping Mal by the shirt and shoving him against the wall behind him. She hears a familiar voice say “I just don’t think she’s that into you, friend.” Mal scrambles away and the stranger turns back to look at Camilla. The familiar grey and green eyes sparkled back at her as Declan asked if she was okay. 

5.	The Drift

a.	Camilla is stunned to see that Declan is at Ty’s wedding. He confesses that they have lightly kept in touch over the years, and that Ty’s wedding coordinated with Declan’s plans to move back home. He tells Camilla that he is coming home to take over his family’s brewery. Camilla notes that Declan standing before her is much different than the Declan she remembers. He is now twice the size he was before – in muscle alone, has two full sleeves of tattoos on his arms, and some that she can see protruding from his collar on his neck, and is also sporting a thick beard. He is much more rugged, but Camilla thinks is more handsome than ever. Declan says that he will see Camilla around and that she should let him know if she has any more trouble with Mal. 

b.	Camilla is downtown, shopping for a new dress that she plans to wear on her hypothetical first date with Declan. Camilla calls her brother and asks about Declan. Ty confirms that they have drifted apart over the years. Silently, Camilla celebrates that she and Declan can be together finally. As she is getting off the phone with Ty, she spots Declan heading her way – but he is holding hands with her best friend from high school, Rachelle. 

6.	Strange Truth

a.	Cam is sitting in her kitchen when Declan arrives (via motorcycle) at her front door. Cam is speechless but Declan breaks the silence by confessing that he is only with Rachelle because he can’t be with Camilla. Camilla tells Declan that she isn’t a child anymore – to which he responds that he knows, he has been following her journalism career and thinks she has been doing an amazing job for people in the community. Cam also argues that Declan and Ty aren’t best friends anymore, but Declan reveals that Ty asked Declan to not be with Camilla when they were all younger. Declan asks Cam if they can talk outside so that her parents wouldn’t hear them talking. 

b.	Out in the Gazebo, he tells her that Ty claims there is a secret that would destroy both families if it was found out – and them being together would flush the secret to the surface. Declan hypothesizes that money has changed hands illegally between the families – as Camilla’s father is a stock broker and Declan’s mother may have had insider tips about product launches that were going to increase different companies stock prices. If that is the case, Declan doesn’t want his mother’s name tarnished after her death. Camilla claims she understands, but still looks defeated. Declan sweetly kisses her on the hand and insists that they should still be friends. As he walks away, he stops at the bench where she first kissed him 7 years ago. He turns around, grabs Camilla by the face and begins kissing her passionately (somewhat roughly).

7.	Rejecting Acceptance 

a.	As Camilla and Declan are kissing passionately, the moment intensifies. Camilla is scrambling to undo Declan’s belt buckle while Declan is pulling Camilla’s shirt off. Declan wraps his arms around Camilla’s waist and pulls himself to her chest, gently nibbling at the portions of Camilla’s breasts that are exposed above her bra as she giggles with delight. Declan stops suddenly, and reminds Cam that they can’t do this. Camilla watches Declan walk away, and wonders if his hypothesis out their family’s dark secret is true. 

b.	Camilla decides to get lunch at her favorite café downtown. She spots Declan having lunch with Rachelle. Camilla is hurt by this, but when she catches Declan’s gaze, she beckons him to the coatroom with a nod. Declan excuses himself and follows Camilla into the coatroom, where she locks the door. Declan tells Camilla that they can’t be together for their own protection. Camilla doesn’t say a word, she only slips her ring finger into a belt loop on his jeans and pulls him close to her. He compliments her on how beautiful she is and how much he enjoyed the intellectual qualities of her most recent exposé about children in group homes suffering sub-standard living conditions. He tells Camilla that she is truly irresistible. Camilla looks down as her face flushes with embarrassment. Declan pulls her face up to his and begins kissing her, he wraps his arms around her waist and presses his body into hers, pinning her against the wall. He picks Camilla up and sits her on the check-in table, where she wraps her legs tightly around him. They grind against one another while they are kissing, and when Camilla lets out a soft moan. 

8.	Tearing Apart 

a.	Declan seems jolted by Camilla’s moan and pulls away. He tells Camilla that he needs to get back to Rachelle. He tells Camilla that she is too much of a temptation and that they cannot see each other or communicate anymore. He asks that if they see one another in public that they should simply pretend that the other doesn’t exist. Camilla breaks into tears and leaves the coatroom. 

b.	Camilla is eating Cookie Dough ice cream right from the pint, in an unflattering (big and fluffy) robe, bags under her eyes from crying, when she hears Declan’s motorcycle pull up. She opens the door when he knocks, but as soon as he begins talking, she tells him to saves his breath and slams the door in his face. 

c.	A few hours later, Camilla is in her room on the 3rd floor when she hears a knock on her balcony door. Outside, she sees Declan standing on the balcony, covered in leaves and twigs from climbing the tree just outside her window. She opens the balcony door and starts to say “I told you” but Declan cuts her off with a profession of his love. 

9.	That Summer

a.	Declan confesses that he fell in love with Camilla that summer he left 7 years ago, and has only been falling more and more in love with her since he left. He has followed her journalism career, even while she was in college. Camilla gestures for Declan to step into her room, but still hasn’t spoken a word. 

b.	Declan explains that when he saw her cry, he know that he simply could not deny his feelings for Camilla any longer. He even thinks she is beautiful in the big, fluffy robe. Camilla lets out of soft chuckle and removes the unflattering robe to reveal a short, silky slip. Declan wraps his arms around her waist as he presses his face into hers for a deeply passionate kiss. Camilla backs herself onto the bed as she removes Declan’s shirt, revealing more tattoos. She decidedly undoes his belt buckle, button, and zipper, letting his jeans fall to the floor. Declan removes Camilla’s slip and romantically kisses her head to toe before pulling off her underwear to make love. 

10.	No Answer

a.	As Declan and Camilla are cuddling post-coitus and recovering, the pair agree to keep their affair a secret until he can find out why Ty thinks that they can’t be together. 

b.	A few days go by and Camilla sitting by the pool, thinking fondly of her previous night with Declan in the hot tub. She wonders if they will become bored of each other once they run out of new places to hook-up, noting that they have already exhausted her bedroom, his bedroom, the pool, the hot tub, her kitchen… 

c.	Several hours go by and Declan doesn’t respond – which isn’t like him. He typically responds right away. She playfully suggests that they could be risky and try some public places – maybe finish what they started in the coatroom at her favorite café. 

d.	Several more hours go buy and Camilla is starting to worry. She calls – but after a ring and a half – it goes to voicemail. 

11.	Not the Answer 

a.	Camilla is worried something is wrong and shows up at Declan’s office – only to find Rachelle sitting on his desk with her legs wrapped around Declan while they are flirting and kissing. Camilla catches Declan’s eyes and he doesn’t act surprised or shocked to see Camilla catching him with Rachelle, he locks eyes and kisses Rachelle passionately. Camilla looks away, stifles her tears, and leaves heartbroken. 

b.	Camilla is wrapped up in a blanket, sitting outside in her Gazebo. Declan walks up and sits next to her and lets out a big sigh. 

12.	Honestly Selfish

a.	Declan and Camilla sit in silence. Declan opens his mouth to speak and Camilla cuts him off saying that she can’t do this anymore. He replies that the relationship needed to end anyway. He apologizes for being so crude at the office in delivering his answer to the question of whether they could be together. He confesses that he would never be able to be monogamous with her, and that he will only ever cheat on her. He remarks that it wouldn’t be worth blowing up the family secrets as he is only going to mess up their relationship with his infidelity. Camilla doesn’t say a word, gets up and leaves. 

b.	Camilla is trying to process everything Declan has said to her, but the sound of his motorcycle signaling his leaving causes her to be overcome with sobbing. 

13.	Self-Induced Devastation

a.	Two weeks have passed and Camilla is still devastated over Declan ending their relationship. Camilla replays various moments they shared in her head and decides that there is no way that Declan would have trouble being monogamous. She decides to confront Declan for closure. 

b.	When Camilla arrives at Declan’s home, she lets herself in, as she had in the past. His apartment is an absolute mess with trash and dirty dishes everywhere. She finds Declan sitting on his couch, with an half-empty bottle of cheap vodka, bags under his eyes from crying. 

14.	The Truth, This Time 

a.	Declan confesses that this is what he does every day when he comes home after working. He gets as much of it out as he can before Rachelle comes over – who thinks she is comforting him because everything with his work reminds him of his mom. Camilla attempts to comfort him with an embrace, but he pushes her away and yells that it’s her fault. Camilla tells him that she doesn’t understand and decides he needs to take a bath to get clean and sober up a bit before they can talk. 

b.	Declan is in the tub and Camilla is washing his hair. Declan is being kind to Camilla and overwhelming her with compliments. Camilla resists naughty thoughts as Declan is naked in the tub – she tells herself that she needs to focus on getting the truth. Camilla asks Declan why he broke up with her. He exclaims that she is his sister. She corrects him saying that she is like a little sister, but they had already been through all that and moved on. Declan says no, and looks away from Camilla. He tells her that he got Ty drunk and tricked him into revealing the family secret. Camilla’s dad and Declan’s mom had an affair that ended in the conception of Declan – making him Camilla’s half-brother. Declan’s current dad agreed to adopt Declan if his mother ended the affair – which she did. Both Camilla and Declan are silent. Camilla fetches Declan a robe and helps him out of the tub, without a word. She helps Declan back to the couch, and breaks the silence by leaving. 

15.	The Other Side 

a.	Camilla decides to immediately go to her father to demand the truth. She is convinced that there is no way that Declan is her half-brother. She is convinced that she is getting a phony story, half told by two drunken idiots. 

b.	Camilla arrives home, and finds her father in his study. She asks point-blank if Declan is her half-brother. Her father hesitates for several moments and responds with a yes. He tells her the story of how he fell for Declan’s mother and was devastated when they had to end their relationship. Camilla’s mother had Ty 8 months after Declan was born – and once the boys were 5 and 6, Camilla’s father arranged for Declan and Ty to have playdates, so that he could see Declan and his mother. Eventually Declan’s adoptive father put a stop to it, but Declan and Ty had already become friends in school and couldn’t be stopped from becoming best friends. Camilla’s father entrusted this secret to Ty when he became a teenager, as he could no longer share the burden alone. Camilla confesses to her father that she has fallen in love with her half-brother not knowing that he was an illegitimate child of a secret affair and storms out of the study. 

c.	Camilla contemplates her life in her bedroom. She doesn’t know what to think, who to trust, and what she needs to do next. She still cares about Declan, and understands that he is likely going through a lot – not only learning that his lover is his half-sister, but also that his dad really isn’t his dad and that his best friend is actually his half-brother. But she isn’t sure that she can be around him – not being able to sort out how she feels herself. Her thoughts are interrupted by her father appearing at her door. He steps in and tells her that there is something else she needs to know. He is holding a piece of paper folded in half, which he hands to her.  She opens it to find that it is her birth certificate – on it, there is an amendment that assigns adoption to her mom and dad. 

16.	Sweeping Relief 

a.	Camilla looks to her father and expresses a look of confusion. Her father explains that he and her mother were trying for several years to have another child after Ty, because they wanted to have a girl. After having no success, they decided to adopt Camilla from a family in Texas. While the news of finding out she is adopted if off-putting, Camilla is relieved to find out that she hasn’t been lusting after her half-brother for over a decade. Camilla hugs her father and leaves to go to Declan’s. 

b.	Camilla arrives at Declan’s and Rachelle is there – and confused by Camilla entering Declan’s home without knocking. She is also frustrated because she was sure that she locked the door behind her. Declan quickly fabricates and explanation that Camilla is working on an 8-month brew to give her brother as a surprise for his 1-year wedding anniversary. He forgot that Camilla was coming over today to brainstorm the concoction. He makes a joke that Camilla is like a little sister to him, to which Camilla narrows her eyes at him, but decides to play along anyway. She starts talking about matching different flavors for complex brew with depth and Rachelle gets bored and excuses herself to the kitchen for a glass of wine. 

c.	Camilla waits until Rachelle is out of earshot and shows him her birth certificate. Declan is elated at the news that they aren’t actually blood related. Declan leaves the room immediately and tells Rachelle that he has work that he needs to do and helps her gather her things to leave. As she is leaving, he tells her that their relationship isn’t going to work out – she tries to argue, but he apologizes, saying that he really needs to work on this brew. Before the door can even finish closing, Declan turns to Camilla and wraps his arms around her waist. He kisses Camilla passionately.

I started trying junior year of college, before then I was just meeting requirements in an ambiguous major. Then I went all in, got on the board of clubs, relatively prestigious internship, university research, good gpa, got department awards etc.

The during that time I had a good life but I always felt off. I was depressed for periods in college and high school, went to counseling in college a few times. Anyway during college I abused and experimented with a good amount of drugs from weed, to LSD, MDMA, coke etc. and had some mild alcoholism (don't we all in college). I was and still am a little bit of high functioning drug user. As much as I tried to appear to have it all together, like I wanted to do well, like i enjoyed impressing people I dont care about and chasing prestige while secretly taking every opportunity to escape.

In college I got the grades etc but I didn't really enjoy any of it aside from not being sober after I took care of my respondibilities. I  really didn't care that much and I often risked it...I did debates high, tests high, had a coke as a study aid phase for a few midterm/final seasons because why not, did psychedelics on a school nights, and addy/vynvase for when shit needed to get done . For how much I've gotten away with and done I shouldn't be in the position I'm in and I feel like its all luck. I feel like deep down I kind of wanted to fuck it up, growing up I never really cared for any of this shit anyway. 

I got a ""prestigious"" consulting job after college and make good money for 22 yr old now but Im not sure how much more I can take 9 months in. Ive been the most depressed I've ever been and my drug use has been pretty tame compared to the past couple years. For a few months I was drinking like alcoholic, I've slowed down now instead I smoke weed every morning and evening now. I work a lot of hours, I am under a lot of stress, am in a new city alone, and I cant seem to keep up with my peers. On top of that my family is pretty broken right now, parents split after 30yr marriage, brother is two states away and never comes to California while my parents are a wreck. I really can't cope without being under the influence of something like I've been accustomed to. I feel like I should have been the burnout I've been hiding from others all along but some how I am still going."

I know she enjoys reading but rarely allows herself the time to just relax and read leisurely as she is almost always busy doing something around the house. She did mention that she wants to find a new book to get into.. Cue you guys..

I know that she has read and enjoyed The Help, Water for Elephants, and The Great Gatsby. She also watches a lot of movies, usually light-hearted comedies like The Intern or Silver Linings Playbook to name a few. 

I was thinking of getting her something popular like Gone Girl or even Girl on the train. To be honest neither of these books are my preferred genre so I haven't read either. I am hoping you lovely people could help me decide if either of these are good options or if there are any other books I should consider as well. Thanks!

Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut. Or having it uploaded somewhere. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy. Been wanting a nice BWC lately

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere, I do love race play❤️, and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

5rmygo,68,2017-02-02,My bitchy boss wanted to blow me [mF] [oral],isthatedwardtowers,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/5rmygo/my_bitchy_boss_wanted_to_blow_me_mf_oral/,"The summer after I graduated from college, I got a job as a paralegal, and it was at that law firm that I met Rachel. She was my boss, and if I was lowest on the totem pole, she was somewhere in the middle…along with doing her own job, it was her responsibility to make sure the paralegals were doing theirs.

I won’t lie; I absolutely hated her. In my entire life I’ve never known a more uptight, bitchy woman. Rachel was in her late twenties, maybe early thirties, a brunette in black stockings and gray dresses, with her hair bobbed short, and she never seemed to smile. On her desk, her papers and pens were always lined up perfectly flush with the edges. And no matter what I did, it was never good enough.
 
I should say, by the way, that I really needed this job; I was lucky to have it and could barely afford to live in the city as it was. So I was doing my absolute best. 

I remember my second week, she assigned me a case to review and present to our team…a big one, too. I worked all fucking week on it, skipped lunch and everything. The day before my presentation, I was sifting through case details when she came up to my desk. “Listen,” she said, “there’s more to this than I thought. You need to incorporate extra files for tomorrow.” She set down a thick stack of papers on my desk.

It looked awful, but she was my boss and I wasn’t going to make trouble. “Okay,” I said. I took the extra work home and worked until two in the morning, made sure it was perfect. Then the next day I gave my presentation in front of everyone, and when I was finished, Rachel got up and stood up next to me. “Everyone,” she said, “Sorry the case didn’t get fully analyzed.”

I couldn’t believe it, just stared at her in amazement. But she didn’t even look at me.

“I’ll make sure the department”—looking at me—“stays up to par. Trust me,” she said, to the whole fucking room. My face was burning red. And then she called me in for a performance review the next day and gave me a ten-minute spiel about everything that was wrong with my work. “You need to treat this job with respect,” she said, jamming her finger into the pages. I wanted to kill her.

That was how it always was with Rachel. If I used blue pen instead of black to mark something, she’d make me redo it. “Fix it,” she’d say. “We can get more paralegals, you know.” If I took one extra minute for my lunch break, she’d call me in the next day and ask if I was planning on reimbursing the company.

She made my life miserable, but as the job wore on, I realized that she held herself to as demanding a standard as me, and in a weird way, I kind of felt bad for her. Rachel would work through lunch every single day…not most days, every single day. On Fridays, our firm would have wine in the breakroom and everyone would hang out, but not Rachel; she’d stay at her desk and work. And if she did come, she’d stand around awkwardly, staring at the floor, hovering around the edges of conversations. I couldn’t help noticing that she had no wedding ring.

Everyone complained about her, too. Once at lunch I saw her overhear people talking about what a bitch she was…not just people but powerful men, senior members of the firm. “Frigid,” they said. “Good worker, bad personality. That’s a girl you’d work with and nothing else.” I looked to see her reaction, but her face didn’t change at all. She just looked down at the floor again.
 
I even kind of respected her. Bitch though she was, Rachel was one of the only women in the firm, and she worked harder than anyone else, by far. And the work she did was great; even as a paralegal, I could see it. People hated her, but they respected the work she did. The guys that laughed at her said she would probably make partner before forty, too.

I started to fantasize about her. That’s how it started. One day it was warm out and instead of black stockings and a blouse, Rachel wore a blue dress. I had never noticed her soft, tan legs before, the curves in her calves and the firmness of her thighs. I couldn’t stop looking. I had never thought of her as a sexual person. I looked her up and down during the daily meeting over and over, her full breasts and golden legs, the tiny tattoo of a butterfly on her thigh. She seemed like she didn’t know she could be sexy, or that she had a sexy side.

I stared at her so long that she saw me. I looked away, quickly, but when I looked back, she was still watching me. I figured I was fucked. 

And I was sort of right, because she gave me a ton of extra work that day. So I worked late, and as usual, she did too, so me and her were the last ones in the office. As I was finishing up my work, she walked up to my desk. “You,” she said. “I need to see you. Come to the supply room.”

Can’t you see me right here?, I wanted to say. But she was the boss. “Sure, Rachel. Let me just finish this.”

“Finish it later. Right now.”

The supply room was full of boxes and old papers. I followed her in there, wondering what she wanted. “Yeah?”

“Don’t say anything,” she said. Her eyes were brown and she was really quite pretty, though her face was still drawn up and unsmiling. Without looking into my eyes, she dropped to her knees, her legs together, unzipped my pants, and pulled out my cock. She started stroking it, making me hard, cupping her fingers around the base. Then she took me in her mouth, running her tongue along my shaft. 

She was so warm and wet. Rachel sucked me like she was imitating a girl in a porno; she bobbed her head up and down, hard, taking my whole cock in her throat. I ran my fingers through her hair as she sucked me, her eyes closed and demure, her lips wrapped around my dick. She’d suck on my balls, too, and jerk the shaft off while she did. Her tongue felt so good flicking along the surface of my sack. She licked the precum off the tip, and when I put my hand in her hair, she gave a little moan. So I pressed down, instinctively, forcing my cock deeper into her mouth, and she moaned harder.

I was so turned on and she was sucking me so hard that I exploded…thick bursts of cum, three or four maybe, through my balls and into her mouth. She swallowed it all. And as I went flaccid, she kept sucking me, getting every drop, lapping at my balls and kissing the shaft of my softening cock.

Finally, she stood up. Her lipstick was smeared and her hair, normally perfect, was messed up. I didn’t know what to say. And she must not have either, because she just turned around and walked out of the closet and went home.

I didn’t know what to think. I decided to just do my job like normal. But the next morning, she called me over to her desk. “Hi, Rachel,” I said. 

She didn’t even look up, just handed me a five. “Go to the café down the street and get me a bun. And don’t waste time…be back before noon or I’m taking it off your lunch break.”

“…all right,” I said, bewildered. But there was a long line at the café, and it took a little while. So I got back a little after noon, and when I brought the bun to her desk, I found her already eating another one. 

She looked up. “Oh,” she said, “you were late, so I just got one from the fridge. I have a few in there.” 

“Well,” I said, “can I have this one?”

“No,” she said. “Throw it away.”

I was confused. “Come on, Rachel, I’m hungry.”

“Throw it away now,” she said. “I’ll give you a written demerit.”

So I threw it her trash bin and went back to my desk, hungry and fuming. After work, though, she came up to me and and beckoned me to the closet.

I was so excited I almost ran there. This time, she leaned up, standing on her tiptoes to whisper in my ear.

“Please yourself with me, okay? Use me.” Her voice sounded younger, girlish and pleading. She got onto her knees, still in her gray blouse, and looked up at me.

I was rock hard in my pants and took her head in my hands. “Unzip my pants,” I said, and she did, pulling down my boxers, taking out my hard dick.

I guided my shaft into her mouth and she began bobbing up and down on me, and I thrust in and out. Her tongue was so warm and wet. After licking the base, she sucked on each of my balls, running her hand up and down my cock. I began pumping my hips back and forth, grunting, sliding myself into her. Her eyes were closed, and her lips were wrapped around the base of my cock. Her hands were on my hips, and I held the back of her head. Finally it was so good that I couldn’t resist any more and I came, hard, three or four spurts into her, and she sucked it down, taking all of me. As my cock drooped, she took my sack in her mouth and gently sucked on it.

She stood up and I took her face in my hands. I would have kissed her but her eyes were closed, her face turned away. So I let her go and again, she left.

That was the arrangement we fell into. The bitchier she was to me during the day, the harder I’d be on her in the closet. It was such a turn-on seeing her confidently giving presentations or assigning work, knowing she’d be on her knees for me soon, pleasing me as hard as she could.

We continued like that all summer, and I was pretty sad when my internship ended and it was time for me to leave. I did have a nice moment with Rachel on my way out, though. It was the interns’ last day, so everyone was hanging out after work at the bar by our firm to celebrate. Rachel, as usual, stood by herself.

Near us were a few more company bigwigs, and I heard them talking shit about her, unaware of how close she was. “She needs a good dicking,” one said. “I mean, Christ, lighten up. Can barely stand to say hi to her in the morning.” Rachel stared at her phone, her face reddening with embarrassment.

In that moment I felt a great affection for her. Since it was my last day anyway, I couldn’t resist breaking in. “Maybe,” I said, “but she does more and better work than both of you. She’ll be running the place someday. And she deserves to.”

They bitched me out pretty bad, and, unsurprisingly, I didn’t get hired back. But right then, seeing Rachel smile was worth it."
5rmyl0,2,2017-02-02,Finding a job in Martinique?,a-b-i,Martinique,https://www.reddit.com/r/Martinique/comments/5rmyl0/finding_a_job_in_martinique/,"Hey! Was wondering if anyone would be able to give me an idea of how to go about this. I'll give some backround information first.

Im a French and Spanish student from London, currently in my 2nd year which means next academic year will be spent studying/working abroad! From August - Dec 2017 my place in Universidad de Montevideo for the Spanish half of my year abroad has been confirmed, and now I need to sort out the French half, which would be Jan - May 2018. 

I want to find a job (ideally paid but if I come accross any great unpaid opportunities I could probably make it work) because I don't want to be studying all year and would value some experience. I also am so desperate to go to Martinique or Guadeloupe rather than Canada or mainland France for a few reasons: 1. France feels too close for me, and I've visited a lot cities there already. 2. Part of my year abroad assessment is an essay project, which I want to do on something related to the négritude movement (and what better place to do that than Césaire's homeland?) 3. Island life is calling!

My problem so far has been that I don't know what the best way is to go about finding something that would be worthwhile doing. My uni has a few conditions:

 1. The job you will be doing should be worthwhile and of benefit to you in the future.
 2. Your employer must be reputable and trustworthy.
 3. You should be using the language you are studying constantly and in a way that challenges you.
 4. You should be working reasonable hours and not be overworked.
 5. Your placement will have to be risk-assessed to ensure that the workplace you are entering is safe.
 6. The minimum length for work placements is 4 months.

A job/internship in media, advertising, PR, journalism, or anything along those lines would be ideal, but I am pretty much open to anything at this point. Im a native English speaker and Spanish should be more or less fluent by the end of my time in Uruguay so would even be open to doing some translation work. I have sent a French version of my CV to a few different places I've come accross on the internet like art galleries, theatres and an advertising agency, but it's difficult as formal work placements or internships don't seem to be a thing and I haven't had any luck.

People from Martinique - do you think it will be possible to find a job or internship that my university would approve? And how would you suggest getting in contact with people and going about it? Unfortunately no one I know has any contacts there so I can't make the most of that either.

Thanks in advance!"

I graduated 4 years ago with an AAS in Web Design &amp; Development, and took an unrelated job right away because I had to pay for student loans. I'm still at that job 4  years later and I'm realizing I quickly need to jump ship.

I want to find an internship as a web designer but they all require applicants to be students. So, I'm trying to get into an entry level job but fear I'm not good enough/don't know enough yet.

I have used some web design knowledge at work by using the company's CMS, adding in CSS, creating graphics, etc. Have also brushed up on JavaScript, jQuery and started to learn Sass a couple months ago. Started a couple basic projects on codepen. 

Honestly I am feeling really out of practice and incredibly intimidated. Should I just send them my codepen account and hope for the best?

Thanks to anyone who reads this, appreciate any advice.

edit: spelling

Nice, thanks for the downvote, it's really encouraging!"
5ro22n,3,2017-02-02,My [20F] boyfriend [22M] has incredibly low self esteem and jealousy issues that are starting to wear on me.,throw_away1603,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ro22n/my_20f_boyfriend_22m_has_incredibly_low_self/,"I'd prefer if no one hear simply tells me to break up. I know that's an option but it's one I'd rather not take right now. We've been together almost a year and I KNOW my boyfriend is a confident, smart, independent person.

Boyfriend and I have a great relationship aside from what's mentioned above. We get along well, spend tons of time together, do embarrassing cute stuff and talk about our fears about our lives after we both soon graduate.

But occasionally I'll snapchat a male friend (just friends, I swear I wouldn't lie to you reddit, but he's been cheated on before) or wear something risque or want to go home for the weekend to see my parents on my own, and he gets angry and sad. And he tries not to show me this because he knows it upsets me, but I can always tell when he's in a bad mood. If I'm talking to someone else I know he assumes I have feelings for them, and since we've begun dating I know his body image has gotten worse despite the fact that I tell him how sexy he is and try to build him up. 

He claims he can't sleep without me, and when he went for an internship last summer he was constantly sleep-deprived and depressed, which he claims was because it was so hard to be away from me. He thinks it's perfectly healthy to want to be together 24/7 and that to be ok with being away from each other means I don't care enough. I know he's not like this because the first six months we were together he wasn't like this at all. I feel like he needs to see a therapist because his mood and self esteem are so low now despite what I do to help. I try to tell him that we both need to find our self worth in ourselves, not in each other, but he thinks the fact that I would be okay eventually if we didn't stay together is a slight, but it's just me being a functioning human being.

I know it's in part because he graduates in May so he doesn't have to try in school anymore so he's bored and apathetic, but I can't take the mood swings any longer. Any advice for how to help him and help myself?

5ro86p,1,2017-02-02,Is it possible?,mrmzzz,jobadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobadvice/comments/5ro86p/is_it_possible/,"I am a third year college student who is currently looking for a summer internship. I am a finance major with a supply chain management minor. Here is my issue, the summer after my freshman year of college I did a babysitting/nannying job for some friends of my parents. Nothing wrong with that because it was early, but the next summer comes around and the father that hired me previously said if I were to do the same job again that he would get me an internship with his company (fossil fuels wholesaling) for the next year. He is a VP of marketing and sales for one of the segments of the company so it was fairly believable that he could make it happen, so I took the job again. A month or so ago I met with him and his boss and they both emailed me saying they really enjoyed their time with me and that they would try and find something for me. However, it's been awhile since I've heard anything from either of them, and I'm starting to feel like it won't happen. So now I am stuck with no business experience on my resume except for a few years of retail sales while in high school, and now when I apply for jobs I won't even be considered. I'm just not quite sure what I could/can do at this point. It's very frustrating because I know I could benefit whatever company took a chance on me, but I won't get a chance it seems because of my ""lack of experience"", and stupidity for trusting someone when they promised me and internship.

5robeb,2,2017-02-02,My life has a completely stalled and gone downhill,Down-but-not-out-0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5robeb/my_life_has_a_completely_stalled_and_gone_downhill/,"Hi, Reddit

This is going to be a very long post, so thank you for taking your time. My life is not going well at all. For context, I'm 24 year old man. I need some advice from people who have been in similar shoes, are dealing with the same issue, and etc. Now before I get into details I would like to say that I’m not in any danger, I am just in a lot of pain from things not going well. My goal is to just see what everyone has to say and maybe use it to improve my situation. Before I jump into the current situation, I’d like to give you some insight to my life before this (I’m changing up several details to hide my identity, but someone who knows me will could figure it out if they know me long enough.)

I moved to the United States with my mother in the late 90’s. We moved here because of my dad was abusive towards my mother and she wanted to give me “The American Dream”.  She raised me mostly by herself and the help of my grandparents. I never really connected with my father and do not intend to. I had a hard time adjusting to life here. My mother was always busy working awful jobs just to provide for us. These jobs made it difficult for her to spend time with me.  Those two factors made me a loner and are the starting point of me being a loner and somewhat sad person.
In elementary school I’d have trouble in school. I learned English relatively quickly. I constantly got into trouble for fighting and skipped school by having my overworked mom call me in sick. I never cared about my grades at this point and was placed with the extra help crowd.  My behavior and lashing out made me a pretty big target for bullied. I was sometime bullied by large crowds, chanting things that would floor a man. Also during this time. I became an overweight to obese child. In the country I lived I was a very thin child because of my small appetite. Food was not a problem in the old country.
In middle school I actually started trying in school and developed my current reputation of being smart. Grades wise I wasn’t top of the class or anything, but for technology information and other things I was king. My social status improved slightly and I got out of fighting for the most part. However, I made a mistake that gives me will give me occasional nightmares to this day. As a young preteen, I discovered that girls are interesting. After building up my decided to ask out a girl whom I almost never talked to. As you may guess, she said no. A no was bad enough, but word spread throughout school and I was a laughing stock. Asking out that girl was the beginning of a nonexistent romantic life. I also played football which helped me lose some weight.

Before the start of my freshman year in high school, I moved to a new a city after the school year.  There were no kids in my neighborhood and I spent most of the summer playing videogames and stuffing my mouth with junk food trying to make the pain go away. I probably gained 50 pounds or more that summer. I played half a season of football before quitting as well. During that year both my grandparents who raised me died. Due to all these things, I nearly dropped out of high school and I’m shocked I only had to repeat half a math class by the time I graduated.  I just had my mom and my dog at this point.  After that year I moved back to the area I lived in before. At this point I was extremely depressed and even fatter.  I ended up doing better academically but socially I was a disaster. I missed almost if not all of the social milestones of high school male. Back then I thought life was over, but I haven’t lost any sleep over it recently.

I went on to a four-year school where I did not know anyone.  That leap of faith was easily one of the best choices I has ever made. I had a great time and earned a business degree in technology. I was still depressed, but things were much better.  I also started caring about my body and shed over 100 pounds and built some muscle. I never dated anyone but I got the fear of dying a virgin of my chest. I met a few girls for whom I really liked, but there was no spark. I fell head over heels for one particular girl, she ended up liking my roommate. Before I found that out, we all hung out quite a bit and basically put on a clown show for everyone as I tried to win her. This ended up sending me in an extreme depression and burned many bridges. I then decided to mainly focus on school and my career because I figured if I establish one pillar of my life, I can use the momentum to build the other one. I made a couple lifelong friends along the way. After an internship and a pretty good academic career, I graduated.

Several months later….
I’ve hit rock bottom. My job search is a disaster. I used to go on tons of interviews and hear from recruiters often. Now I don’t get any opportunities at all. I’ve used up the part of my network that actually gives a damn. My career was the one thing I had faith in, and I’m failing to launch. Everyone tells me to just get a terrible job for now, I tried it but I burned out and cannot do things I hate for a long time. Everyone also keeps telling that I’ll land on my feet, which is starting to drive me mad because I know they mean well but I’ve heard it a million times. I at least need some kind of a positive distraction to keep me from becoming even more depressed if I’m doing things I hate. In the past I have told myself to “lower my shoulder and just keep moving forward” but, that only works for a small time frame. Most of my life I’ve been miserable, doing one more thing I hate just feels like it will literally kill me. I keep filing out applications as I have no choice, but every time I do it’s just a matter of time before I break down.  The stress from this has already landed me in the E.R. once, for a stress related condition (released a couple hours later after getting it take care of, it hasn’t returned). 

I’ve become a dead weight on my mother’s back. There is no other way to put it, but if angels are real she is one. She has sacrificed everything and will continue to do so until her dying day. She needed a break more than ten years ago, and I haven’t been able to deliver it.  I always tell her about the stuff I wrote on here today, but she doesn’t know how to help and it breaks her heart. I’ve begun to hide this from here, because I don’t believe that misery needs company.  The financial aspect is beginning to take a toll on her as well.

I’m still single and too depressed by current situation, which is feeding my fear of dying alone. I have a self-image problem that I try to work on by working out, dressing better, and trying to put my best foot forward on a daily basis. I understand everyone is different but when I look at my friends or people in my shoes, alarms start going off. I’m not saying I need to be married, but more than.  I received a text from the particular girl I mentioned earlier, she wanted to apologize for what she did. I accepted her apology but that text awakened some of my feelings for her. Well, I don’t know if it’s my feelings for her or the fact that she represented the end of my loneliness in my mind for such a long time.

I’ve been off for so long my hobbies are no longer appealing. My list of hobbies is pretty long, and with a more balanced lifestyle some would have to be cut. I still like to do them but I just feel like I have no energy. I feel like nothing in general gives me joy. It really feels like my favorite foods don’t taste the same, the sun doesn’t shine as bright, etc.…

My friendships are beginning to deteriorate.  I don’t expect all friendships to endure, but it feels like many of my friendships are fading.  Some of my friendships are being ruined by the fact that I’m more easily agitated or just careless because I’m worn down. Other friendships were not meant to stand the test of time or I simply had to pull the plug on them because they became toxic.
It just feels like everywhere I look I’m losing and everything is going to shit. I used to listen to the old saying that you need to get up one more time than you have fallen. Each time I fall it keeps taking me more time to get up, and the time spent down is really starting to add up. I could keep writing for hours but I feel like I’m ranting. I would love to hear any advice or go into more specifics. Basically just looking for a helping hand or a wall to bounce things off of.

I would really appreciate it",myupvoteacc,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/5rojfg/coming_out_of_a_hard_time_and_wanting_to_do_some/,"So I'm a Junior, and I'm just trying to turn a critical eye towards myself, because I'm climbing out of a difficult period of my life, and looking to the future. That requires some self-assessment to make sure I'm headed towards my goals. I could use your help to basically evaluate myself and get a checklist going of what I need to accomplish to get into med school.

I think a gap year or two are in order, but I'm going to have to force my parents to understand that. If I can avoid them, that's awesome too.

**Year in school** - Junior, Economics major

**Country/state of residence** - USA/FL

**Cumulative GPA** - Currently 3.56

**Science GPA** - Currently 3.49 (B+ engineering calc from dual enrollment 7 years ago, A- Chem 1, A Chem 2, A Calc 2, B Bio 1, B+ Bio 2, C Orgo 1, W then C+ Orgo 2, A Microbio, A Astronomy, A Genetics, B Physics 1, B- in Biochem, 3 semesters of A's for research classified as ""Biomedical Science"" which is what is helping my sGPA not tank - hopefully they don't confront me over this being my GPA's life jacket). Also have another W for a very stupid reason - ended up getting into a programming course, signed up for the wrong one, started failing within a matter of two weeks and dropped it. sGPA is on the way up now that I'm mentally in a better place. Got a 100 on first Physics 2 exam, and am also killing it in my upper-div epidemiology class.

**MCAT Scores** - Haven't taken, planning on going very leisurely and taking my time so I can smash it

**Research** – Was in a paid competitive research program at my university, culminated in a poster presentation, but not very impactful. I'm actually going to have to do research on WHAT I was doing myself because my PI was very intransigent and I was pretty much just running transfections over and over for a few different projects for him. Completed research program that was about a year long, and then quit the lab.  About to begin Radiation Oncology research in an excellent lab, will continue for the next year and a half. Sorta will be running my own project.

**Volunteering (clinical)** – Volunteer at student-run free clinic, 4 hrs/week, have totaled 200 hours thus far, will be doubled by graduation time. High level of patient interaction, presentation to physicians and medical students, full 9 yards.

**Physician shadowing** – So I've done this in the past, but very casually, for a short period of time, low-impact, and didn't keep track of it. So I'm going to go with 0 hours. Need to do it legitly from here on out

**Non-clinical volunteering** - None

**Extracurricular activities** - I would say fairly strong. Started off as a writer, then editor, and now managing editor of an on-campus publication focused on field of medicine. Will be editor-in-chief next year. Undersecretary of Health Affairs in Student Government - Write monthly newsletter to student body with intent of improving awareness of campus medical services and general wellness. Implemented program in greek community to establish health liasons in each house that were trained by us to be aware of all healthcare facilities and services on campus so as to be able to help their members in need. We are also going to be completing a massive dissertation to obtain a $65 million grant from the state for Student Health on campus, with which we hope to build a new healthcare center. Also a seated and voting member on the Health Advisory Board in which a select few student leaders sit with heads of health departments to vote on policy proposals, audits, reviews, budget allocations all dedicated to the student health care clinics and services. Part of the QI subcommittee focused on improving access to mental health services for students. For the clinic that I volunteer in, I've taken a very active role in Quality Improvement projects, one being a 73% reduction in patient wait times. Continuing to do QI projects. Obtained 6-sigma green belt as a result of interest in QI. Interned in the dept. of Treasury at a big international bank, made $27,000 for the bank through high-volume currency exchange. For fun I kinda just hang out with friends, but I'm active in our outdoors club and go on cheap and awesome trips every few weekends.

**Employment history** - None, looking to intern somewhere this summer though (related to healthcare reform/health policy - where my interest lies), tired of taking classes in summers

**Please include time span and weekly commitment for volunteering/research/shadowing/extracurriculars.** - So this is bad, but this this is a time for honesty and self-reflection - I've realized that most of my obligations actually require little of my time. The QI projects I do in my free time and I do them with a friend who does the quantitative heavy-lifting. The magazine sorta runs itself with the structure that I've put in place. Clinical volunteering is only 4 hours a week. The health advisory board meets once a month. As undersecretary, I have to meet once a week with the secretary of health affairs, but otherwise I have to go to multiple meetings a week with directors of organizations, but the meetings are usually only an hour long.

**Immediate family members in medicine? (y/n)** - No

**Other relevant information** - I'm coming out of brutal depression (genetic basis - dad, uncle, all male cousins on antidepressants - psychiatrist has identified poor serotonin regulation being obvious all the way back to 8th grade) that set in second half of freshman year and has continued until just this past semester. I was stupid not to get help earlier, stupid not to take a leave of absence, but I kind of just let myself get dragged away by it, got poor grades, and ended up trying to commit suicide over thanksgiving break. I'm getting professional help, and I feel excellent now. I was addicted to pot for about a year too, and I've kicked that. My academics are looking bright, and this may be my first 4.0 semester ever. I feel invigorated, feel capable of moving forward in life again, feel like I am in control, that I'm worth something and that I may realize my desire to enter the field of medicine.

**My conditions** - Would like to go to medical school as soon as possible, aiming for the best schools possible (obviously). Would prefer MD over DO (obviously).

**Racial background** - ORM, brown

**Letters of Recommendation** - I've thought about this, and I'm not sure I can ask anyone for them at this point in time. Another thing to work on.

So yeah. That's my story so far. Of course I'm aware of things I've listed myself such as the lack of shadowing and non-clinical volunteering, LOR's. But overall, can you guys take a fine-toothed comb to me and let me know what I look like overall? What sort of things should I do? With the assumption that my academic performance will be far better from here on out, will an SMP or Post-bacc be necessary to show that I'm capable of handling the rigors of medical school? Should I pick up some more extra-curriculars to show that I have other interests besides medicine? Get even more clinical hours? Should I aim for a scribing position to add to work experience, more clinical experience, dedication to medicine?

**Right now, I kind of just have a sense of dread that I'm not going to make it to medical school where I stand right now. This feeling is useless to me, and I would like to redirect it into productivity and forward movement. Having an itemized list of what to hit hard is what I'm looking for, and I'd appreciate your help.**

Critique the fuck out of me, I'll be very grateful."
5romiz,36,2017-02-02,Reddit please help. Boyfriend (m/25) new female friend is making me (f/24) anxious. Am I paranoid or should I say something?,kimbosaurus,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5romiz/reddit_please_help_boyfriend_m25_new_female/,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 18 months. He moved away from an internship after a few months of being together, but we worked it as an LDR. I spent a lot of time with him and he depended on me as he struggled to make any real friends during that year. He begged me to move over. Before Christmas, I was offered a permanent job in his country, but did not take it as I freaked out my anxiety got bad and it wasn't right for me at the time (family members were getting ill). 

In that time, we didn't see each other for two months. He started a PhD and is now going to be away for 4 years. Because I wasn't about he made friends in his office. My mum is now better and I have moved over and am studying a course here, living with him and soon to start some temp work. 

However, his supervisors other student and him have become incredibly close. They text a lot. I have been on two nights out with them both and felt really unwanted. He kept following her to the bar and I just felt like he looked at her like he liked her. We all went back to hers for post drinks and he was sat on the sofa with her laughing away playing some staring/ clapping game and he's not afraid to sit there with his arm around her in front of me. I was sat at the table on my own feeling really hurt. My grandma had died a few days before and I really needed a hug from my bf but he seemed more interested in this new girl. I stared shaking (pre panic attack) but said it was shivering. We went to bed in her spare room and he hugged me to sleep. 

Anyway he's going out tomorrow with her and others. I asked if I could join later and he said no as he wanted a strictly work friend night. He is texting her daily now. I have seen the messages (bad, I know) and there's nothing dirty. But he is extremely friendly and interested in her. Lots of :) and he offered to take her medicine today as she was ill. She asked if she was going to see him tomorrow morning as it was her first day without seeing  him in ten days, with a sad face. 

I feel really hurt. And really confused about what to do. I asked him a few weeks ago (before the nights out when I saw them together) if he was hiding anything as he seems protective of his phone, new pin code etc, so  he showed me their messages and said my trust issues were ridiculous. It wasn't that i was expecting to see dirty messages. It was just the volume of them. 

He still tells me he loves me. And I fee were in a good place. Things have changed since his new found independence and I feel pretty worried about her as she clearly fancies him. I don't know what to say because it is making me down and anxious, but I don't want him to think I don't trust him or don't want him having friends, because I am genuinely so happy he finally feels settled. 

Any advice would be great because I feel like he's going to notice I'm sad and I won't be able to keep these thoughts to myself and may end up pushing him away. 

Edit: also worth noting. He does have a lot of female friends from our original friendship group, it's me another guy and three girls. He is quite handsy with them and I'm fine with it as I know them all really well and they supported mine and his relationship from the start. But this new girl is getting the wrong idea I think. My ex cheated on me so I'm afraid of history repeating itself as I have given up my home circle to be here with him and we can make each other so happy. 

TLDR: Boyfriend of 18 months, LDR, now I've moved in, his new female friend at work he sees everyday texts him every day and they seemed pretty flirty on nights out when I was there. I don't want to say anything to push him away or make him think I don't trust him, but it's affecting my anxiety. Not sure if this is a normal friendship and I am paranoid or if something to be concerned about or to bring up. Thank you.

5rpkj1,1,2017-02-02,[M(as A)4F(as A)] A collection of prompts for your enjoyment,freddiemercurious,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5rpkj1/mas_a4fas_a_a_collection_of_prompts_for_your/,"Hello there! I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 2.

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid. This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."
5rq9mc,2,2017-02-02,"Taking a job so I can travel or a job that will be better for my ""future?""",comeback_kid14,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/5rq9mc/taking_a_job_so_i_can_travel_or_a_job_that_will/,"I didn't know where to post this, but here it goes. So I got back from a 3 month backpacking trip in Southeast Asia 2 months ago.  Before that I was living in NYC (just finished college), but sold everything and moved back home before my trip. I left New York for many reasons, mainly for the reason it's so expensive and that I would never be able to travel--which is my passion--so I basically had to sacrifice it for a better quality of life. Travel is my meaning in life and I'm willing to make sacrifices to do it. 

I'm back home now with two job offers. My intention is to save up so I can take another trip, hopefully in the fall.  The problem is one job is working retail (on commission) and its seasonal so it might end in May/June, and the other is part time helping out at a small (run by two people) marketing agency.  I'm torn between which to choose.  My parents want me to obviously go for the marketing position as it's what I went to school for, but after multiple internships, I realize I don't really like marketing and office environments. With the retail job I'll be able to make and save a lot of money and will be able to travel months at a time. My ultimate goal is to be a freelance writer, which I'm getting into now, so no matter which job I take I'll be doing that on the side with the intention of eventually doing it full time (hopefully). 

I just want to see what everyone thinks.  Should I take a risk with my future and go with the retail job, but have the freedom to travel like I want? Or should I suck it up and go the safe route and do the secure job that will ""build my resume?"" I've always believed that everyone should do what they love and that you should work to live, not live to work, but now I'm having doubts that I'm not investing in my future and years down the road I'll regret it. I left New York so I could have the freedom and means to travel, which makes me think why did I ever leave if I'm just going to go back into a job that I could've done there that wasn't bringing me fulfillment?

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut. Or having it uploaded somewhere. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy. Been wanting a nice BWC lately

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere, I do love race play❤️, and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Lashana"
5rqt5z,1,2017-02-02,"XPS 9360 with Linux Distros (Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Manjaro KDE)",andrewcsq,Dell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/5rqt5z/xps_9360_with_linux_distros_kubuntu_kde_neon/,"Now that I've got a stable install of Manjaro KDE setup (after spending the whole week tinkering with my 9360), I thought I'd share my experiences, especially since there are some significant differences between Linux on the 9350 and 9360. Hopefully this will help someone out there thinking about installing linux on their 9360.

TL;DR, stuff I wish I knew:

1) Use Kernel 4.9 if you're using Manjaro (as rightly pointed out, for Office-type tasks in Ubuntu-based distros there may not be any issues)

2) /boot/efi should be a FAT32 formatted partition

THE HARDWARE:
XPS 9360 / i5 / 8gb ram / 256gb ssd / Win10 OS (that is, not the DE version)

THE WEAKEST LINK (myself, and some background):
Before this Monday, I had never done a single linux install before in my life. My first time using installation media was when I got my 9360 in Dec 16 and did a clean install of windows. My first time doing any sort of proper coding (some GUI-based thing for robotics when I was a kid doesn't count) was also in Dec. I write R scripts to automate data cleaning as part of my internship which involves a lot of applied econometrics (pretty poor ones, by my estimation).
My (very minimal) familiarity with programming and willingness to use the command line meant I went straight to installation by terminal rather than GUI package manager from the outset of my attempt to get Linux working.

THE PAINFUL LESSONS:
PART I: Kernel related issues
1) Kabylake works best with Kernal 4.8+ (using 4.9). On Kubuntu and KDE Neon (henceforth collectievly 'ubuntu-based', since they are both built on Ubuntu, specifically 16.04LTS at the time of writing), this is a simple matter of upgrading the Kernel post install.

2) On Manjaro, this is a much hairier problem. The current stable release won't boot properly (something about plymouth boot error IIRC), so you'll need to grab the 17.x Beta unstable branch. If, like me, you're into the rolling release model for update integration and not for bleeding edge software (with the accompanying bleeding, mostly of one's self and sanity), then you'll need to switch over to the stable branch of Manjaro post-install.

PART II: Distro specific issues
3) I found the ubuntu-based distros as a whole far more confusing to set up compared to Manjaro (with the latter's access to AUR through yaourt), especially since the officially Ubuntu repo often contains outdated versions (eg. R is 3.2.x (!!) from late 2015 while the rest of the world has moved on to 3.3.x from late 2016), and the whole PPAs thing is not only confusing, but a security risk as well.

4) Bluetooth mice are tricky on both the Ubuntu-based distros I tried. Google for it, it's a well-known problem and there's a comprehensive (albeit long-winded) solution to 'Bluetooth smart mice not working on Ubuntu' (I used a post about the MX Anywhere 2, but it worked fine for my M720 from Logitech).
5) KDE Neon's implementation of the KDE is superior to that of Kubuntu (plank-themer works, settings come easier, KDE is more up-to-date). Given the negligible difference in installation difficultty (KDE Neon comes with less 'bloat', or more 'hassle' if you see it that way), I wish I had skipped straight to using KDE Neon.

5) I wish Manjaro's installer had told me that my /boot/efif partition needed to be FAT32, I wasted 3 hours pulling my hair out over the installer's refusal to install GRUB. The installer tells me I need a /boot/efi, tells me to mark it as esp, but doesn't raise a red flag that I haven't formatted it as FAT32! It was only by inference from the 'Restore GRUB' page on Manjaro Wiki that I realized my mistake.

Overall thoughts:
I like Manjaro. It seems (from the couple of days that I've been using it) to be quite stable while being quite up-to-date. My thoughts as a new and green Linux user is that the perceived stabilty benefits of a LTS release VS rolling release exists only if you treat your Linux OS as a 'Windows alternative', ie. set and forget.

My motivation for installing Linux (I keep my W10 as a dual boot option) was for its easier integration into high-performance computing (eg. OpenBlas on R), which I'm rapidly discovering is a necessary skillset for my vocation (econometrics). For this, I need up-to-date software (not bleeding edge, but not 1-year-outdated-possibly-2 versions). My impression is that once you start updating one part of a LTS, you introduce instability and compatibility issues with the rest of the system (eg, R Studio needing libgstreamer0.10 rather than accepting v1.0), at which point the integration of bug fixes that comes with a stable branch rolling release distro ends up being more stable.

Also, KDE is pretty great. Looked up some YouTube videos and decided it's the way for me. Haven't tried any other DE (no Unity please no) and don't intend to.

Whew that wound up being way longer than I thought it would be. Feel free to AMA! (but if it's a how-to related question do Google first)"
5rquv2,2,2017-02-02,I need help!,GotThatDanK,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/5rquv2/i_need_help/,"I posted in the INFP thread a few months back, so I'm going to just copy and paste what I wrote and then elaborate a bit more. 

So I've had a good friend of mine come over to talk with my brother. Evidently from the discussion, my friend has come to the conclusion that my brother is an unhealthy INFP who is stuck in the ""Fi-Si"" loop. I don't know much about MBTI and all of the functions that come with it but I'll give some background information on my brother. He is 30 years old, unemployed, living at home still, and extremely depressed. Right out of school, he had an office job, but that quickly fell through because of the criticism from our father (I know that sounds weird/vague, but it's irrelevant at this point). After that, he's worked a few basic jobs at grocery stores and such, but nothing else really. He's attempted to be a police officer, salesman, insurance claims adjuster, etc, but he really doesn't fit with any of those. For about the last two and a half years, he's spent his time traveling/volunteering through this work-away program but I honestly believe he's been just trying to buy himself some time with finding a job/career. I truly do my best to help him, but I really feel like we're getting no where. Every time we meet, I try to console him and see where he's currently at in life, but he always eventually speaks about his past and other irrelevant things that really don't matter at all anymore. This is super frustrating for me because it's hard to tell him that the past is the past and you can't focus on things that you can't change. Oh, I think another huge key point is that his relationship with our parents is shit. My father knows there's a problem, but the miscommunication between them is so far apart, they just haven't seen eye to eye in years...or EVER for that matter. My brother essentially puts most of the blame on our father for his current circumstances. It also frustrates me that my brother pretty much lives in luxury; he's not paying rent, my mother always brings him food/cooks for him/gives him money, my father just bought him a new car, and he is still so ungrateful through it all. I'm lost at this point and as his younger brother, I really just want him to succeed. I don't want to say he's hopeless but I'm starting to think so. Someone please shed some light on what I could do. Thank you for reading.

So I've received several responses after I made that post but my brother is still reluctant/skeptical (like everything in his mind) to an idea of a ""life coach"" but I genuinely believe that's his only hope. I'm in my last semester of college, just started the semester, have an internship, manage my family bar, have to juggle everything else like making money, having a social life, etc., but I'm really just too busy to drop everything and help him myself. My best friend and I had a talk today and he guaranteed me that if I were to find an ENFP life coach, that would push him over this hump that I've been struggling to get over with him. What do you guys think? If anyone out there is open to this or knows someone who may be interested, please message me. If not, I'm welcoming any advice! It's super frustrating for me because I want him to succeed... I really do but it's so hard for me get it through his head that he's not entitled to anything simply because of the ""hardships"" he's been through. Life doesn't work that way. My friend says that he just needs someone who truly will empathize but also has the capabilities to pretty much hold his hand and get him on the right path. In my mind, that sounds like a super-hero. It's ironic because I actually have a lot of friends who are ""life coaches"" but are in their twenties...some my age and some YOUNGER🤔🙄 so they're obviously not considered for outreach. Time's not slowing down, so I need to get him on track ASAP. Thank you once again for reading. "

Unfortunately for me, that's about to change.

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. My shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood floor.

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn""

I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a new group of interns was arriving later that day.

____________________________________________________

You're going to put my in my place. Make me your bottom bitch. 

Who you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous standards I construct for the annual review, my secretary, tired of being thrown the most menial tasks, a young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me.

Or maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be a representative from a competitor who seduces me into giving you control, or a reporter who turns up dirt on the company and uses it to blackmail me. Or anything else that comes to mind! Feel free to combine or modify any of my ideas as well.

My ultimate fate is up to you - will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut - spreading my legs to help you close business deals. Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings and verbally abused. 

Bondage, foot worship, and petplay are all things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do. Futa is okay.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!"

How do I get through this?",CrossfireInvader,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5rs6pb/i_cant_get_the_care_i_need_without_outing_myself/,"To begin, I'm 22 years old, AMAB, and I've been struggling with the idea of being MTF for over a year and a half (specifically since summer of 2015). At first, I thought I might just be interested in crossdressing as I'd never really entertained the idea of being anything other than male, but as I allowed my thoughts to wander, the idea that there might be something more to this rang louder and louder in my mind. 

After struggling with the urge to crossdress for a month or two, I confided in some friends of mine while visited them out of state. They were incredibly open-minded and supportive. I felt relieved that they saw it as no big deal, yet I beat myself up for not telling my girlfriend of several years first. I was too terrified of her reaction to approach her and needed a practice round. As much for my sake as for hers, I promised my friends that I would come out to my girlfriend when I got home.

Months passed, and I still hadn't said anything. Finally, one of my friends sent my girlfriend a message to the effect of ""CrossfireInvader has something important that he needs to tell you,"" and thus I stumbled through the long-dreaded conversation. She was actually relieved to hear the truth, as her mind had instantly jumped to some very dark conclusions. The next morning, however, she performed a complete reversal in attitude and started begging me not to do it. The thought of seeing me as a female, even in the most temporary of ways, was just too much for her. This continued for a month or two until I finally agreed to put it all away for the sake of our relationship.

As I'm sure many of you know, things never work that way. The feeling came back quickly and more intensely than ever before. I checked out some of the trans-related subs here on Reddit, and my first reaction was quiet jealousy. The implications were obvious, and I started attending my university's LGBT support group. My girlfriend knew that I attended the group (plenty of straight and cis people do), but I kept my feelings quiet.

The new year came and went, and my confusion turned to depression. I felt trapped, desperately in need of answers but without any idea as to where I might get them. Sometimes I felt so confident that I was trans, but sometimes I simply couldn't fathom the idea. I still hadn't told my girlfriend anything. Eventually, my depression became so severe that it impeded my ability to function in daily life. My mother came to visit me at my apartment one afternoon, and I broke down sobbing in her arms begging her to promise me that she would always love me. Being the helicopter parent that she is, she dug around on Facebook to find that I was a member of the LGBT support group's Facebook group and confronted me. Being a conservative Christian raised in the rural Bible belt, she was not particularly thrilled with all of this. Eventually, I agreed to see a counselor (though not the religious counseling she pushed me towards).

It felt nice to get some of my feelings out, but I'm not sure how ready I was to actually put a label on anything. That feeling was odd, really, considering that I went to my university's LGBT prom in a dress and makeup and LOVED every second of it. While my mother knew why I was in counseling, I told my girlfriend that I was simply going to address my depression and anxiety (which was true but certainly not the complete picture).

And then... it stopped. Sort of.

Upon graduating in the spring, I took an internship in another state. I'd wanted to leave my hometown and break into that particular industry for quite some time, and this internship handed me those opportunities on a silver platter. I had a great job, a great apartment, a great neighborhood, plenty of money, and a bright future. My trans feelings moved to the back burner for a while, though they certainly didn't disappear. At times, I'd wonder how much better I'd feel sitting in a meeting in a dress instead of slacks and a collared shirt or working at my desk in something cute and girly without a care in the world. But for the most part, I was happy. It was certainly the best period of my life in recent memory.

So of course it ended. I was unable to get a full-time job at the company and moved back home so I'd have a place to stay while I looked for work. This was August of 2016. It's now February of 2017, and I've made almost no progress.

Over the last six months, I've grown weary and hopeless. My weight and BMI have officially crossed the threshold into ""overweight."" And recently my trans thoughts have returned with a vengeance.

Now my girlfriend (who STILL thinks I left this all behind in October of 2015) just got a full-time job. She wants to move in together and really get our life started. At the same time, she's angry with me because I've basically moped through the process. I should be happy for her, but this means that I have to do something. I have to either act on my feelings or put them to bed for good.

I don't know what to do. I obviously need to see a counselor again, but if I do that, I'm afraid that my parents will immediately know why. I can't face them again. I can't handle the angry phone calls and the assertions that ""you're making a huge mistake."" And I can't break my girlfriend's heart like this. I feel awful for ruining this happy moment, but I'll feel worse if I essentially force her to break up with me. And beyond all that, can I be happy? It seems that my trans feelings are strongest when I'm most unsure of myself. Are they simply an outcropping of my self-doubt?

I can't handle this anymore. I'm done torturing myself just so I can go on torturing other people. I've never felt more worthless or undeserving of the air I suck. I'm just so tired of living. I've already started formulating plans to kill myself, but I don't have a timeline in mind and I'd probably be too scared to follow through. Still, death sounds better than this awful life I've let myself slip into. What am I supposed to do?

**TL;DR: Low-key came out to my girlfriend and parents in the past, and they reacted horribly. I need to figure out my feelings with a counselor but can't figure out how to do that without tipping my hand.**

5rs7q8,106,2017-02-03,"""I Had to Get Cancer to Become a More Empathetic Doctor""",princetonwu,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/5rs7q8/i_had_to_get_cancer_to_become_a_more_empathetic/,"**Ann Intern Med. 2016;165(7):525-526**

--- 

Listen to the patient—they are telling you the diagnosis. I first heard these words, apocryphally attributed to Sir William Osler, from the white-haired senior physician at Harvard who greeted us on our first day of medical school in 1956. For the last 50-plus years, I have taught this as a guiding precept to medical students and residents. “Listen, you learn from what patients tell you, both spoken and unspoken.” I still teach that to the fellows at Temple Medical School and the medical students at Drexel. I am 80 and a retired infectious diseases physician. I've always thought of myself as a caring, compassionate, and warm doctor. I thought I knew what patients were feeling, but it has taken being a physician with a life-threatening illness to understand what it is really like to be a patient.


Two and a half years ago, my new primary care doctor told me, “You have a 7-centimeter mass in the left kidney.” My wife and I had just returned from a vacation in Spain. I had microscopic hematuria, but I had put off the ultrasound until we got back. I had not expected these results. “I am a physician—I should be immune to this.” Denial is a common defense mechanism when shocking news like this hits a patient. There was little doubt in my mind that the 7-centimeter mass was cancer.


Self-recrimination and anger at my previous doctors arose. There'd been 5 to 10 red blood cells in my urine for at least 5 years—why no ultrasound before now? Was it too easy to believe, as did my doctors and I, that the red blood cells came from my enlarged prostate? Over time, the anger at all of my doctors who ignored (or wrote off) this abnormal test result dissipated as I realized I was equally complicit (as a knowledgeable physician) in not wanting to pursue further testing. Lesson One: Wishful thinking is not reality.


The first phase was diagnosis. Things moved quickly; I scheduled an appointment with the head of urology. He was middle-aged—I felt old. He was calm and reassuring. “Kidney cancers are slow-growing tumors,” he explained. The urologist scheduled an MRI and said, “You know, this is not an oh-my-God moment.” I thought then of how often as a physician I had minimized my patients' fears with such facile reassurances.


The MRI showed spread to the ipsilateral adrenal gland. The second phase was treatment for cure. Surgery followed quickly to remove my kidney and adrenal gland. After about 6 months, I began to feel better and had my first follow-up MRI and chest radiograph. Both were clear. My wife and I were elated and started making plans to travel until the radiologist looked more carefully and saw a small shadow on the MRI just above the diaphragm. A subsequent CT scan dashed our optimism when the urologist called to tell us, without preamble, “You have 15 metastases in both lungs.” Lesson Two: Telling a patient the truth is important, but there are ways to soften the blow of bad news without minimizing it. However, in my experience, there is no way to tell it without inflicting some pain on the patient.


I soon met my role model for a caring and competent clinician. The head of solid tumor oncology was thoughtful, reassuring, and kind to my wife and me. He looked us both in the eye, listened to us carefully, and answered our questions. The kindness that he did not hesitate to show was welcome and makes all the difference to a patient. He told us that five chemotherapeutic agents were available to me; 5 years ago there was only one, which was very toxic. He said, “I favor Votrient: It has been effective and has fewer side effects.” I appreciated his stating his clear preference for a therapeutic agent rather than cataloging them and asking me to decide. Like most patients, I knew very little about this area and could not have made an informed choice among all the therapeutic options. I was grateful to have a plan for treatment and to move forward. I also appreciated the importance and impact of clear and effective communication in a warm dialogue.
We now entered the phase of treatment without potential for cure. It was not easy. I had diarrhea and vomiting for 5 days, lost 10 pounds, and soiled myself. I felt ashamed and humiliated and scared of what was happening. Because I couldn't reach the doctor, I called the oncology nurse who told me to stop the chemotherapy, rehydrate, and go on the BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, and tea) diet. “It will get better,” she said.


“What about my taste? Everything is metallic.”


“Maybe it will reverse, but that is less likely.”


Now I understand what my patients who took antibiotics and got taste perversion were complaining about. It had been all too easy for me to say, “But this drug is saving your life,” with the unspoken, “Stop whining.” Lesson Three: Side effects are only minor if they are not happening to you. As a physician, don't minimize patients' discomfort.


When nothing is working and you feel miserable, desperation sets in and you will try anything for relief. I used to grow impatient with patients who wanted me to do something else when I was doing all I knew possible. But so much else was possible, even if unproven. I began to understand the lure of alternative and holistic medicine. My subsequent experiences with acupuncture and herbal medicine have taught me their value. They also offer hope, a quality that patients need to cling to if they are to survive. Lesson Four: Don't dismiss alternative therapies just because you don't know much about them. Even if some of the benefit is placebo effect, the patient is happy that something is working.


I now see that the medical system is layered to shield the doctor from direct contact with the patient (except at appointment time). I had considered myself accessible to patients; I returned telephone calls as soon as I could, but they weren't my highest priority. Triage demanded that life-threatening infections be handled first.


A patient's burning anxiety over a “less severe issue” could wait. I am now a patient, and I have learned to rely on the oncology nurses; however, it is still galling that I cannot easily reach the doctor when I am scared or anxious or just want to hear his voice. If I, as a fellow physician, can't easily get through the secretaries and nurses whom we, as doctors, have interposed, what happens to most patients who can't “work the system”? They are left with their anxieties.


“Scan anxiety” is real. For the week preceding the scan, my wife and I traded our anxieties even as we tried to mask them. I was in constant fear of new lesions or that old ones would have enlarged, that this would be the beginning of the end. We don't get the results until the day after the scan. Until the oncologist says, “The scan is unchanged,” I am in full fight-or-flight mode, and I barely sleep. What were my patients' feelings, lacking medical knowledge and perspective? I have come to respect and understand scan anxiety now in a way I did not previously. It is a dread that is common to all patients with cancer who are followed with scans. I am not sure there is any way to minimize it.


I once told one of my many physicians, “I hate being a patient—it is a loss of control for me.” The paternalism that I grew up with in medicine in the 80s and early 90s has ostensibly diminished, but partnership with the patient is never totally realistic when one partner (the patient) lacks information, expertise, and experience. Even as an experienced physician, I know I need to rely on the oncologist's skill to make an intelligent decision. I have learned how anxious this inequality in our relationship makes me feel; it has taught me to empathize more with all patients. Despite my tremendous advantages of knowledge and experience compared with most patients, I still find myself overwhelmed at times. My oncologist's ability to deal with my issues in communications that are clear, tactful, considerate, helpful, and realistic in a free and warm dialogue helps immensely but doesn't completely mitigate the sense of giving up the control I once had as a physician.


I am a better doctor and human being as a result of enduring this illness—I just wish there had been an easier way to get to that place.

She cut all ties with his family and hates them.",Ilovebut,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5rtkq9/should_i_25f_tell_this_girl_2324f_im_working_on_a/,"**EDIT: So sorry for the misunderstanding, but someone here pointed out that Mary is not Jim's step-sister but HALF-SISTER. As in, they have the same dad and different mothers. And they never lived together, they got introduced by their dad when Jim was 16 I guess?**

Okay so my husband, Jim, was born out of wedlock and so was his step-sister (we'll call her Mary). None of us (me and husband) were really aware of the current situation between his father and Mary's mother, but from what we know it's very hostile and the hostility comes mostly from Mary's mom's side. On the other hand, we are not blaming her, since Jim's dad wasn't always a nice man he is now, so who knows, probably she has her reasons.

I've never met Mary, because she only sort of tried to reunite with the family before I even knew my husband. After a while (still before WE met), for an unknown reason her mother started to be more and more negative about the whole thing and Mary followed, despite (according to my husband) being positive at first.

Me and Jim have been married for a year. It was a small, city hall wedding (not sure if that's the name though - not a native english speaker; what I mean is that it wasn't religious and in a church) and we barely invited anyone, only went for dinner and drinks with a couple of friends and parents after. Mary was informed of it on fb because Jim couldn't reach her on her phone (and started suspecting she changed the number) and she never replied and later blocked him.

So, I am currently working on my major and working on a few projects as a part of work placement (internship? again, sorry for my english).  I'm a designer, broadly speaking, and one of the projects is more like a public event and needs funding. So my work consists also of contacting various companies and asking to participate.

One of them gave me a positive feedback and even wanted to get involved on a people-level, so now I have a group of people roughly my age working ""under me"" (my age, but lower when it comes to work-hierarchy and degree, in this particular case I'm their direct superior). I particularly started getting along with this one girl on the first day, but then I checked up her info and I am pretty sure she's the Mary. Same surname, same name, similar face, even personality. No wonder we clicked - she's really similar to my husband and he's my best friend.

This is work environment and we should keep it professional.  On the other hand, it's been a few days, she's being more and more friendly towards me and I feel like a villain. 

She got along with Jim like a charm at first and yet she stopped answering her phone and never replied on fb after her mother started withdrawing, so I guess her loyalty to her mother goes beyond what's reasonable.

So, long story short, I am afraid of the drama. I am afraid she'll start treating me like air. I am afraid she'll ask to be reassigned and the company will start looking at me funny. On the other hand, we have roughly 2 months of working non-stop via mail and at least occasionally seeing each other, so can I really keep this a secret that long? And if she finds out later how angry she'll be with me then, knowing I deliberately kept this from her? My husband says he has no idea what I should do. He'd like her to know, but as far as he knows her, she may make the most dramatic exit the company has seen. 

So, should I tell her? Should I keep this a secret? Should I inform my boss about it in case drama happens? Please help.

**tl;dr for ~2 months I am going to work with my husband's step sister who cut all ties with his family. I realized who she is, but she has no way of knowing who I am. I wonder if, knowing what drama queen she can be and how much she hates everyone involved with husband's family, I should tell her and endanger the project we're working on (as well as my job itself).**"
5rueyt,15,2017-02-03,My spiel on why I hate Chemical Engineering,nrfowler,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/5rueyt/my_spiel_on_why_i_hate_chemical_engineering/,"I graduated cum laude in Chemical Engineering in 2012. No internships, but at least with a good GPA, you'd think I would do okay. Ended up taking a job in Healthcare IT. I got a few interviews related to Chem. Eng. but they were disappointing. I did not receive any correspondence from employers out of the blue - everything was from applying online.

I also started to notice (and I should have noticed this before) that there aren't that many chemical engineering jobs out there, in fact way, way less. It would seem that even the big chemical companies only have one or two chemical engineer positions open at any given time (and often not even entry level). I even looked up the BLS stats on Chem. Engineers before and after going to college, and before going to college (2007) it was one of the best majors. After and during college, it was one of the worst. It had gone from positive to negative growth.

In contrast, after working one year in IT, I went back to school and declared a Comp Sci BS major. Just after declaring that major and taking a semester of classes, I started receiving emails asking me to have interviews for internships or jobs.

If you look on Indeed, etc., you will notice that Computer jobs are about ten times as prevalent as Chemical Engineering jobs. There are also more Comp Sci graduates, but not enough to make up the difference.

Also, consider that as a Developer, you are able to refresh your knowledge completely for free and can build your own software at home. As a chemical engineer, you can literally only gain experience by having internships or work experience.

I would also note that Chemical Engineering is a very specific curriculum that has limited application outside of chemical process engineering. For example, you won't be able to easily become a chemist or chemical technician after graduating, because those require specific analytical chemistry skills that aren't part of ChemE necessarily. Your junior and senior years involve classes that are pretty specific to chemical process engineering: distillation columns, plant design, heat exchangers, etc. So despite what some people say, ChemE is not that well-rounded.

Reading some of your posts here, I would say that some of you really should have been CS majors. CS/CprE is the only major that if you do well academically, you automatically get offered jobs/internships. (Maybe there are other engineering jobs that allow that, but ChemE is not one)

As a final note, I would say that if you are a ChemE looking for a job, be willing to become a chemical technician or to take a job that seems below you so that maybe you can work your way up. And if you are considering going into it, be aware how difficult it is to get an internship. I got the impression that some of the people getting internships had family connections. That being said, if you truly are a gifted networker, you may do well. It requires a high level of business acumen. Chemical Engineering is just not the major for people who are intellectually gifted and want to climb the ladder through academic achievement alone. Think of ChemE as a ""fast tracked"" business degree.

I've looked at Pier 1 and BNSF's websites, but they seem to be looking for more senior engineers at the moment.

From my internships, schoolwork, and personal projects I've gotten fantastic experience in creating production iOS and Android apps, designing responsive websites with HTML5/CSS/JavaScript, and doing backend work in Java and Python. I've also done work in C and C++.

5rv50b,8,2017-02-03,Schimbare,unimberbpetrini,Romania,https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/5rv50b/schimbare/,"preambul: sunt un esec academic, un amarat care nu a reusit sa definitiveze un master in Olanda. m-am intors cu coada intre picioare in tara, printr-o bafta imensa m-am angajat si, concomitent, m-am inscris la un master la Poli (pertinent ulterior).

acum ca am stabilit scena, doresc intai sa spun ca sunt mandru de solidaritatea si mobilizarea de care am dat dovada in ultimele saptamani. intotdeauna am trait cu impresia ca suntem letargici, nepasatori si miserupisti in atitudine - la capitolul simt civic, si eu sunt vinovat (miercuri a fost prima seara in care am iesit in strada). ma bucura imens ca am reusit sa dovedim contrariul. totusi, fiind in sesiune, m-a pascut un gand. studentii au reprezentat (si reprezinta) o mare parte a persoanelor care au fost la protest. din cate am observat eu (pe parcursul licentei si acum) este ca trisatul este intrinsec aproape tuturor studentilor din Romania. uneori nici nu se porneste de la premisa depunerii de efort pentru un examen (oricat de abject ar fi el), ci automat apelezi la aceasta solutie.

intrebarea mea este: exista conceptual vreo diferenta intre a copia si a fura? nu incerc sa dezbat sau sa infirm ramificatiile OUG-ului ce urmeaza sa intre in vigoare. ordonanta denota exact ce parere are partidul guvernant despre poporul roman si flegma pe care ne-o arunca intre ochi. ceea ce incerc eu sa argumentez este ca trebuie o schimbare si la nivel individual, nu doar macro. inteleg ca se bazeaza pe ceva incomparabil analogia mea: efect cuantificabil (furt fatis) vs incuantificabil (nu stii implicatiile de viitor  doar pentru ca a copiat unu' la examen).

zi de zi, ma confrunt cu nesimtiri care, desi in marea schema a lucrurilor sunt nesemnificative, mi se pare ca denota foarte mult despre noi ca popor - comportamentul in mijlocul de transport in comun, atitudinea in trafic, modul in care se vorbeste cu un strain sau cu casierita de la magazin etc.

doar eu sunt important. nimeni altcineva. atata timp cat obtin ce-mi doresc, nu-mi pasa pe cine deranjez, libertatea mea exista chiar daca o ingradesc pe a altuia.

nu. nu asa. pana la urma, toti trebuie sa convetiuim in acelasi oras/tara. de ce sa fie sentimentul pregnant unul de nepasare si invrajbire la adresa celui de langa tine? incearca o miscare de recul, poate vezi barna din ochi, constientizeaza ca nu esti singur pe lume. eu asta incerc sa fac (chiar daca este prin lucruri marunte). 

scopul diatribei (si a aberatiei) este ca daca manifestatiile vor avea un deznodamant fericit (la asta si sper), trebuie continuat si perseverat in procesul de schimbare - si extern, si intern. de sus in jos, de jos in sus. si comportamentul furnicii conteaza.

ne vedem diseara in piata victoriei."
5rvk18,1,2017-02-03,Palette VL question,InternMan,techtheatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/techtheatre/comments/5rvk18/palette_vl_question/,"So I'm a tech intern at my college's theater and I have been tasked with creating a solution to trigger sound and projection cues from the lighting console. We have a Pandora's Box media server which works with ArtNet so no problems there. We are running QLab for sound cues and I have made a simple dmx keyboard emulator to send transport hotkeys(go, pause, resume, etc.) to the laptop, again no real problems.

The problem: The building runs shownet and our palette vl only has one Ethernet port. We have some N21 nodes and we can put the 2nd dmx out on to the strand network, but that is kinda kludgey and limits me to 1 universe. We don't really need more than 1 universe, and I could use another node to put the remaining dmx channels from universe A on to the strand network, but I still would rather use Ethernet ports. I know I can get DMX to ArtNet converter but this is a college so our budget for things not production related is really small.

My question: Has anyone used a usb network card to get a 2nd Ethernet port? The palette runs Windows XP embedded and that does have driver support for usb network cards. The big unknown is whether the Palette application can see and transmit over 2 Ethernet ports with 2 different protocols. If anyone has done something like this, or has heard about the batshit crazy TD down the road doing something like this, any help/guidance would be appreciated."
5rvkkw,11,2017-02-03,"Be careful with Distribber, y'all",princessluna3000,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/5rvkkw/be_careful_with_distribber_yall/,"I rarely if ever talk about work on here since I tend to post some NSFW material and/or posts; however, I figured I'd say this. I work for a production studios in Texas and we have collaborated with a few other studios nationally and in China. Our projects have been shown in festivals and theatres. Nonetheless, we had an intern who did an indie, micro budget documentary with us. We offered her full time stay with us since she was able to pull it off, and quite well compared to the other interns. We wanted to distribute the documentary; although we didn't want to show it at festivals or theatres, we still wanted to get it out there. So we did some research into self distribution and came across some sites, both credible and incredible ones. We found Distribber and they were by far the cheapest but we also knew that they didn't really have partnership with Netflix, Hulu, and a few others they claimed to partner with. Here's a list of those who partner with Netflix in the US and Canada [List](https://npv.netflix.com/us-canada) . If you're still unsure, you can easily call their investors/relations department. 

As you can see Distribber isn't on the list. However, many people managed to get their movies on Amazon VOD/Prime (which is actually very easy to do on one's own but they charge 400$+ for that service). So we decided to purchase their Netflix package for 985$. We were told we would be told the outcome within 45 days. 45 days came and went, and we haven't heard anything, not even updates of what was going on, who was looking at the movie, etc, so we contacted them asking for our funds back(it's unsure if we're going to file fraud with our bank just yet).

If you do research on this company, there's hardly anything about them anywhere. And you can even see a list of movies/shows they distributed via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dmovies-tv&amp;field-keywords=distribber+) so if you go through them, you'll probably only going to get on Amazon. There's no feedback, or reviews of anyone getting on any other platform. Although there are two reviews of two movies getting on ITunes such as Surviving Family and Snack the Documentary. 

We gave them a go because we wanted something cheap, yet we knew the risk we were taking by the research we done onto prior. We also wanted to be for sure. Well we are now, and if we decide to self distribute again, we will not be going through them. Nonetheless, be careful with them.  

EDIT: I got a message from someone who sent me a link to a forum that talks about Distribber failing to refund money until customers demand, and even Distribber being sued; I noticed this is also around the same time IndieGogo let them go. Here's the [Link](http://www.indietalk.com/showthread.php?t=51775) to that forum. 

EDIT: I'm going to go ahead and keep updating this just in case others are reading and wondering about Distribber. The company's bank won't be able to do the dispute because it's past 60 days, and so our lawyers will be pushing through now.

EDIT: Here's a list of [Itunes](https://itunespartner.apple.com/en/movies/partnersearch) aggregator partnerships; Distribber is not on the list nor is there parent company, Go Digital. While Hulu has [partnerships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu#Content_partners_2) with notable production studios and distributors. 

EDIT: Distribber told us we are in queque to receive our refund shortly. I'll keep you updated to see how long they take to refund our funds. 

EDIT: The company got their funds back. If you're going to use them, take heed. Of course, you got some people coming out of the wood works saying how great Distribber is. But we *never* go through them again. take care, and be careful. =D"

""Excuse me.""

Jackie looked up from her terminal to see a tall, hooded skeleton waiting patiently by the front desk a few feet away. The skeleton waved. 

""Could you tell me how to get to the ER from here?""

""Is this some kind of joke?"" Jackie asked. 

""...No. What?""

""You can't wear that in here. You'll scare the patients.""

""Ma'am, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Do you mind-""

""Take off the costume or I'll call security!""

""Whoa. Hey."" The skeleton held up his hands. ""This isn't a costume. It's my uniform.""

""Oh, your *uniform*."" The nurse rolled her eyes. ""So you're the Grim Reaper, then.""

""One of them, yes. Which way to the ER?""

Jackie stood, and turned away from the skeleton to reach for a small walkie-talkie on the corner of the desk. But by the time she turned back, the Grim Reaper was gone.
***
Dan sighed to himself as he wandered the hallways, the butt of his scythe dragging on the floor. *Why are the nurses always the rude ones?* he thought. *I thought nurses were supposed to be nice.*

He peeked into a doorway. ""Excuse me-""

""AAAAAAAAHHHHHH OH GOD I'M NOT READY TO DIE!""

Dan jerked his head back and slammed the door. *I'm gonna be stuck here forever.*

Then Dan heard footsteps at the far end of the hallway. He turned to see a rather portly hospital security guard waddling towards him.

""Hey, you in the hood. Stay where you are."" The man coughed heavily as he approached.

""Oh, thank goodness."" Dan stayed where he was, but set aside his scythe and took a large scroll out from under his robes. ""Maybe you can help me. I'm looking for the Emergency Room. I have two reapings scheduled and I'm already ten minutes late for the first one.""

""Uh-huh."" The guard appraised Dan from where he stood, glancing up and down at his uniform. He was quite a bit shorter than Dan, and yet still managed to take up a little too much of the Grim Reaper's personal space. He also smelled of cigarette smoke. He beckoned with two fingers, and turned around. ""Come with me, please.""

""Thank you so much."" Dan picked up his scythe. ""You don't have to walk me all the way there; I'm sure you're busy.""

The guard said nothing.

""Could we... could we walk a little faster?""

""No.""

Dan was tempted to stay silent and brooding. The guard obviously didn't want to talk to him, and his slow pace told Dan that he didn't particularly care for the Grim Reaper's time, either. But lately Dan had been trying to work on his image. Most other reapers wouldn't have bothered, but he wanted people to see that he could be more than a dark, foreboding presence in the corner of the room. He liked 80s pop music. He hated paperwork. He had interests outside of his job, and cared about making a good impression.

Dan read the guard's nametag. ""So, Kyle...""

""Don't talk to me.""

Dan fell silent.

They walked back through hallways Dan had already crossed, for what seemed like ages. Eventually they returned to the desk where Dan had met the very rude nurse. He glanced furtively at the woman's back, praying with all his might he didn't attract her attention. To his horror, however, Kyle walked right up behind her and tapped the bell on the reception desk.

""Miss, is this the guy?""

""Oh, thank you!"" She clapped her hands and stared daggers at Dan, who promptly slapped his hand over his eyes. ""Where did you find him?""

""He was snooping around the cardiology wing. I caught him scaring some patient half to death.""

""I WAS NOT-"" Dan inhaled deeply through his nose and gathered himself. ""If you had just told me where the ER was in the first place-""

""Alright, buddy, you get one warning."" Kyle coughed and pointed to the exit. ""Let's go, before I have to call the police.""

""Call them for what?""

""For *causing a disturbance,*"" Kyle growled. ""Move it.""

""No!""

""You better do what he says,"" Jackie said, smirking. ""You can get arrested if you don't.""

""That is literally impossible. Look, I'm a very busy guy-""

""Alright, you asked for it."" Kyle took a pair of handcuffs from his belt. ""Turn around, please.""

""I will not turn around!"" Dan yelled. ""I have other things to do today! I need to pick up two very sick individuals, who are probably *scared out of their minds* because their spirits have exited their bodies and I can't help them move on!"" Dan pointed accusingly at the nurse. ""You of all people should know how important Grim Reapers are in hospitals!""

At that moment, the doors on the other end of the hallway opened, and in came seven doctors wheeling a gurney and a crash cart. Dan, in his tremendous irritation, did not even stop to recognize that they were escorting a patient. He whipped around to face them, and slammed his scythe violently on the floor.

*""WHERE CAN I FIND THE EMERGENCY ROOM?""*

All seven of the hospital workers promptly fainted.

Dan stared at them. They didn't move. He turned back to see that Jackie and Kyle were both visibly shaken.

""Um... I didn't mean to do that.""

Jackie and Kyle said nothing.

""...They aren't dead, if that's what you're thinking.""

Jackie opened her mouth and let out a wail.

""Aw, cripes, no. Don't."" Jackie wailed harder. ""I'm sorry, I'm just very frustrated today.""

Kyle took a step back. ""I think you had better leave.""

""I still need to get to the ER though.""

Kyle pointed behind him. ""Take the elevator. Second floor, take two lefts.""

""Thank you,"" Dan sighed. ""I am so sorry about this.""

Just then, the woman on the gurney screamed. The sound, intermingled with Jackie's sobbing, sent a chill down Dan's spinal column.

""Help me! My baby is coming!""

Kyle quickly walked over to the gurney, shuffling around the unconscious medical practitioners. ""Hold on,"" he said to Dan. ""Help me move her.""

""Uh...""

""Where are your contractions at, hun?"" Kyle asked the woman.

""I... I don't AUGH!"" the woman screamed again.

""Okay then."" Kyle dug through the crash cart and pulled out a box of gloves. ""Here,"" he said to Dan. ""Put these on.""

""I really should be going.""

""*Put them on.*"" Kyle waved the box impatiently. Dan took it, and together they wheeled the woman to a free room, him complaining all the while.

""I mean, we really should be leaving this to the professionals.""

Kyle pointed at the ground outside the door. ""Those *are* the professionals.""

""What about her?"" Dan asked. Jackie was still crying.

""What, her? She's an intern. It's only her second week.""

""She'd still know more than I do!""

""She's a wreck! You made her cry!""

""I said I was sorry!""  

""Well, that leaves only us two to do the job!""

""This is not my job! This is the exact opposite of my job!"" Dan threw his hands in the air. ""I can't do this! I'm sorry! I'm leaving!""

The woman roared, and without warning, a fierce hand grabbed the collar of Dan's robe and drew him to her face. With the fury of a thousand women scorned, she screamed, ""HELP ME DELIVER THIS BABY OR I WILL KILL YOU MYSELF!""
***
Two hours later, Dan walked into the Emergency Room, bedraggled and weary. His black robe was stained with birthing fluids, and torn at the sleeve where the woman had clutched at it during a particularly fitful push. It would need to be burned.

""You two."" He pointed at the disembodied souls, one young man and one old, standing shell-shocked at the side of the door. ""With me.""

The older man obliged, standing up to follow Dan as he headed for the door. The younger man did not.

""Am I dead?""

Dan turned a miserable eye to him, even as he continued to walk out of the hospital for what he hoped was the last time. ""Trust me,"" he said, ""I'm sure it is vastly preferable to being born.""

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut. Or having it uploaded somewhere. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy. Been wanting a nice BWC lately

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere, I do love race play❤️, and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Lashana"
5rw30h,3,2017-02-03,"I [20/f] feel like I'm ""growing out of"" my immature BF [20/m] but I am still in love with him.",Kit_Kat_27,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5rw30h/i_20f_feel_like_im_growing_out_of_my_immature_bf/,"I just want to preface this by saying that this is my first ever Reddit post so I apologize if I suck at it and for how lengthy this is. I would also like to say that I am trying to be as least biased as possible in this story. I don't want to make my boyfriend sound like a bad person because he's not, and I've made mistakes too. Everyone has their flaws. So here it is, any advice would be much appreciated. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over 2 years. I am his first and only girlfriend he's ever had, but I've dated before him. We began dating in the fall of our senior year of high school, at the same time I was slowly coming off of several months of mental illness. Being with him essentially brought life back to me - he helped me recover without even knowing it. The next few months were just absolutely amazing, it was like a 4 month honeymoon stage. Everything in life seemed so perfect. Eventually we decided to stay together in college and do an LDR. 

One year into the relationship, we are still madly in love and working through long distance. This is when our fighting starts to pick up. At home it was almost nonexistent, maybe a few small disagreements. As he pledges a fraternity, I start to notice certain bad habits emerging that I hadn't before. Going to sleep at 5 am, waking up at 4 pm. Skipping class, not caring about school, only caring about partying. And when we fought, he would say the meanest, most hurtful comments that were just meant to break me. Obviously I understand pledging a fraternity is incredibly difficult but it was really frustrating for me to be in this position. I helped him through all of it - helped him work out how to get his grades back up, immense emotional support, etc. Again, I don't want to be biased so I will say I was very irritable toward him, and I made it very clear I hated the fraternity and his behavior, to the point where he would constantly confront me saying I had no right to be hating on the fraternity. I do realize I probably made pledging much harder for him, as I was giving him emotional support on the surface, but deep down having a hatred for the frat. I honestly feel like I should have broken it off then. I was miserable every single day and I let the relationship and his immature actions control how I felt day to day. But I stuck it out. 

In summer 2016, his bad habits are still there - I'd have to wake him up at 3 pm after I had just worked from 5am-2pm. No hobbies - just sleeping, drinking, smoking weed, playing video games. Incredibly hurtful and mean when we fight. However, after I confronted him once again (as I had countless times before) about how his behavior was making me feel, he changed everything he was doing - and our relationship became amazing. He was getting up early, working at a job I got for him, and just overall trying harder. It worked serious wonders for us being able to be together. We laughed, had great sex, went on awesome trips to his beach house. I felt our emotional connection strengthen. I also felt like I was coming to separate myself from him and have my own life. I got a new job, interned at a great place, went to the gym almost every day, and just felt so much happier in general.

It was over winter break that these habits slowly started to come back, and began to seriously start irritating me. Before it was bearable but after 2 years you would expect something to change. It was so frustrating to be working my ass off at my internship while he slept all day. I felt afraid to approach him with problems because of the mean personal attacks and his constant need to defend himself. The worst occasion for me was when I drove all the way up to his school (a 4 hour drive) to be there for just ONE DAY, against my parents wishes, arriving at 10 AM to realize he was still asleep and then waiting an hour and a half for him to wake up and let me into his dorm, only to have him being angry at me for ""showing up so early"" (although we had previously discussed the arrival time). I felt like I was moving forward in life, growing as a person and pursuing my passions while he was fine with the thought of just coasting through life. This left me utterly torn apart and confused, as I had thought the summertime was amazing and that he was finally growing up. 

So that brings me to where I am today. Very recently I met a guy through at the gym and we ended up exchanging Snapchats. Of course he started snapping me and it was friendly and all, totally harmless and just normal conversation. But then we started have serious conversations - he's into fitness and nutrition which is my biggest passion - and I got to know him better. I began to really really admire how goal driven and motivated and hard working he is. I was in awe of the fact that he has a job, goes to school, had passions and motivation and was working to better himself at the same time. This has since led to me getting a major crush on the gym guy. And  then I started to think about my current boyfriend and I just feel like he isn't like that at all...he's stuck as a teenage guy just playing video games and not caring about bigger and better things. Liking the idea of being successful but never working for it. Almost like he's procrastinating success if that makes sense?

I know it's not fair to compare people like that, and I feel so so guilty for liking this gym guy and talking to him, but it's difficult because I'm wondering if my boyfriend will ever actually grow up and become mature, and stop half assing things his whole life. I have helped him get a job through my dads business, tried to help him fix his sleeping schedule, supported him emotionally throughout his hard times, and yet he's still okay with just coasting through life. And to be honest I feel like he's fine doing the bare minimum for our relationship - showing up late to pick me up, canceling plans, being flaky, treating me like a friend he has sex with. The most effort I've seen him put into things is when he's digging himself out of holes he's made (for example, working his ass of to get off of academic probation). I honestly don't know what to do because I've had the idea of breaking up with him for a while but I've never had an emotional connection with anyone like this before. When things are good, they are amazing and we click so well. He is the most funny, handsome, kind (when we're not fighting), smart and genuine person I know. And because he helped me through such a hard time in my life makes me know that this breakup will be so hard. I thought for a while I would marry him. But all the other negatives - the mean streak, the laziness, the lack of motivation - is starting to make me feel like I'm held back. I'm just really lost. 

TL;DR started talking to another guy who is motivated and driven, which is the opposite of my bf, and it's making me question if I'm putting time and effort into a relationship with someone who is holding me back. "

I'm a 19 (20 in a few months) year old Network Administrator Intern here in Texas. I enjoy video games, PC Building, basically anything to do with IT, working out occasionally, cars, and weeb-stuff. I'd like to find some new friends to play games with, as most of my current friends only play League and it's not really my cup of tea. I have a large game library, but I enjoy playing things such as Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, Rainbow 6, and Tabletop Simulator. 

I'm also always open for trying out new games too! I hope to make some meaningful connections here, and even connect outside of video games if the situation warrants. I'll always lend a listening ear to anyone who needs it, because if it were me, I'd want one.

5rwgvz,1,2017-02-03,"Me [24/F] and my long-distance BF [22/M] broke up over my job location a month ago... and he's already dating someone else, who is essentially my twin.",LonelyInLA15,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5rwgvz/me_24f_and_my_longdistance_bf_22m_broke_up_over/,"I'm writing this post primarily to A) make myself feel a little better and B) get a little bit of advice on how to approach this situation henceforth.

My ex-boyfriend and I dated for about 2 and a half years. Ninety-nine percent of the time, things were really fantastic. We really understood each other, laughed constantly, shared the same passions and hopes for the future. It felt (and still feels) like we were made for each other. The other 1 percent of the time, things were tough. Because we're both so passionate, we would fight, whether it be about our future together or just politics. It was always with love, and we always made up.

A year and a half into our relationship, I moved away to Los Angeles to pursue my dream in post-production after getting a big internship opportunity. After the internship, I got a big job on a big movie. With that job came a lot of stress and anxiety. On top of that, we were long-distance. He hated hearing about my problems at work, and sincerely thought my move was a waste of time because the job was so tough. I had a hard time talking about the good parts of my job… because all of the good parts are confidential. That one percent slowly turned into four… five percent. I started feeling really unhappy- like I wasn’t being valued. He would criticize everything I would say and do, I think mostly because he didn’t understand.

It’s worth noting that this guy is still in college. I’ve been an adult and on my own since I was eighteen.

Around Christmas, two days before I was set to visit him, we broke up. It was “mutual”. We both said we were unhappy, and that this decision was for the best for the both of us. The next day, I begged him that we reconsider. I didn’t rebook my flight. I wanted to see him and make it work. But he rejected me.

Two weeks later, we talked on the phone. I told him I would give up my career, give up my money, everything to make it work. He said he had to think about it.

Yesterday (this is one month after the break up), I found out that he was seeing someone new at our college. She’s a sophomore (he’s a senior) who works in the place we met working, is in my same sorority, played all of the same sports I did, and is from where I’m from… Needless to say, I’m heartbroken.

I guess I just don’t even know where to go from here. I laid my heart out two weeks ago, offering him everything. He has ignored every message and every call. He didn’t have respect enough to tell me what was really going on. He hasn’t told me if he was cheating on me with her all along. And to top it all off, she feels like a clone… I’m lost. I need some reassurance, maybe some guidance?"

I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to post it, but here it goes!

I am currently a student in college studying Math and Economics, and over the past 3-4 months, I've become more and more interested in the idea of working in Real Estate Development. I have a basic understanding of some things I should do to ""sample"" the real estate industry as well as prepare for a career in that field. But I'd extremely interested in hearing your perspective on ways to prepare.

If you guys would be willing to answer a few questions for me, that would be FANTASTIC! Also any other advice that I might've missed would be super helpful too!


**Questions:**

**1.)** Thoughts on MRED(Initially out of school vs 5 years into career vs not going at all)

**2.)**Things I could start doing now that will help me down the road

**3.)**Program/Software I should learn that the industry uses

**4.)**General Career Path

**5.)**Types of internships that are helpful

**6.)** etc.

Thank you in advanced, you folks rock!"
5rx7sv,4,2017-02-03,Jennifer,smokinglessons,SmokingFetishStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmokingFetishStories/comments/5rx7sv/jennifer/,"Jennifer was a beautiful, blonde-haired, blue eyed woman of only
thirty-three.  She had always had an interest in the news, even as a child.
After graduating from High School, she was accepted to attend one of the most
prestigious journalism schools in the country.  The news made her ecstatic.

Jennifer worked as hard as she could to make a name for herself in the
broadcasting world.  Even in college, she stayed away from anyone who could
possibly make her reputation as a ""straight shooter"" tarnish, even
slightly.

Very quickly, she was able to attain an internship with one of the local
network affiliates.  This internship wasn't glamorous, but it led to bigger
and brighter things for the starry eyed co-ed.  Within months, Jennifer was
offered her first on camera appearance.

Nervous but undaunted, Jennifer reported the story with accuracy, fairness,
and charm.  The producers of the affiliate were quite pleased by her
performance.  They offered her more camera time, which she gladly accepted.

Four years after entering college, Jennifer graduated.  The afternoon of her
graduation, she was offered a contract with the network affiliate she'd been
interning with.  This came as no surprise to anyone, because Jennifer was
""that good"".

Jennifer quickly earned the respect of her coworkers, because no matter how
awful the story seemed, Jennifer relayed the facts to the audience with the
same accuracy, fairness, and charm as her first.

Two years after signing her contract, the news producer came to Jennifer with
a story she couldn't pass up.

It seemed the local politicians were trying to pass a law that would ban
smoking in all restaurants, bars, and similar places.

""I'll do the story, Jerry,"" Jennifer said.  ""But you've got to know
something up front.""

""What is it, Jen?"" asked Jerry.

""I've never smoked before in my life, and to be honest with you, I really
can't stand smoking,"" Jennifer started.  ""I'll do my best to be
objective, but I really do hate it.""

Jerry laughed as he took a pack of Marlboros out of his pocket.  Much to
Jennifer's dismay, it was obvious that he was on his way outside to smoke.

""That's fine,"" he said.  ""I know you'll do whatever it takes to be as
unbiased as you always are.  And who knows?  I heard there might be an anchor
position opening up soon.  I'd love to see you get it, but I've got to be
able to prove to the suits that you're worthy of the job.""

With that, he walked away.  What did he mean by `whatever it takes'?
Jennifer hoped he didn't expect her to smoke, in the hopes of being
objective.

That night, Jennifer went home and prepared her research into the pending
legislation.  It seemed that this story would be easy for her, because she
could completely sympathize with the ""plight of the non-smoker"", as she
jokingly called it.

Three days later, Jennifer was at one of the local eateries, going through
her final preparations for her interviews.

Her first interview was a woman named Mary.  Mary was about fifteen years
older than Jennifer, and Jennifer noticed how she looked ""like a smoker"".
Any judgements Jennifer had were, as always, kept to herself.

The first interview went relatively routinely.  Jennifer asked Mary the
questions she'd prepared, and Mary was more than willing to answer openly.

After the interview, Jennifer found her next subject, a man about her own age
who was puffing enthusiastically on a cigar.

She began to interview him, but soon realized that the smell of his cigar was
too much for her to handle.  She politely eased her way out of the interview,
and moved on to her next subject.

Her third interviewee was a girl who Jennifer estimated was only a few years
younger than herself.  She was an attractive girl, with long, curly, blonde
hair, a very nice figure, and not a blemish on her skin.  Although Jennifer
was completely content with dating men, she had to admit silently to herself
that this woman was beautiful.  It was hard to believe that she was ""one of
them"".

Jennifer walked up to the young woman, and smiled.

""Can I help you?"" the woman asked.

""Actually, yes,"" Jennifer began.  ""My name is Jennifer-""

""I know who you are,"" the woman smiled.  ""Care to sit down?""

Jennifer accepted the invitation and sat across the table from the young
smoker.

""Doing another story on smoking?"" asked the woman.

""I've never-"" began Jennifer.

""No, I know you haven't,"" said the girl.  ""But your colleagues have.
They always claim to be so objective, but it never fails.  They send some
anti-smoker to cover us, and the truth always gets distorted.""

Jennifer didn't know what to say.  She was the anti-smoker that was being
referred to.

""Just because I've never smoked, doesn't mean I can't be objective,"" she
objected.

""Sure it does,"" said the woman, taking a puff on her Marlboro Light 100.
""Just like I could never do a story on journalism, because I've never been
a journalist.""

The analogy made frightening sense to Jennifer.

""My name is Courtney,"" said the blonde.  ""Nice to meet you.""

""Nice to meet you, also,"" Jennifer said.

""When is your story due?"" asked Courtney.

""The producer wants it for a piece this weekend,"" Jennifer replied.  ""But
I'm having a harder time getting information than I anticipated.  It seems
no one wants to be completely open about their smoking.""

""Do you think you could get an extension?"" asked Courtney, exhaling a cloud
over Jennifer's head.

""Probably, why?"" Jennifer asked.

""Well I'd be willing to give you all the information that you want, but it
would involve you spending a lot of time with me.  Then you'll have an
objective story, free of any half-truths,"" Courtney explained.

Jennifer didn't know what to say.  She didn't know this girl from Adam, and
she didn't know what she was getting herself into.  She wanted the anchor
seat, though, and like Jerry said, she'd have to do ""whatever it takes"" to
get it.

""I don't know if I can get an extension or not,"" Jennifer explained.

""Well, how badly do you want your story?"" Courtney inquired, stubbing her
cigarette out putting money on the table for her cup of coffee.  

As Courtney gathered her belongings, Jennifer realized that time was of the
essence.  Was this something she wanted to do?  She didn't know the answer,
but she knew that she didn't have time to argue with herself, either.

Jennifer took her cell phone out of her pocketbook and dialed Jerry's inside
line.  Courtney just listened as Jennifer talked to her producer.

""Jerry, it's Jen,"" she started.  ""I need an deadline extension on the
smoking story.  I've got someone who is willing to give me all of the
information that I need, but it's going to take some time.  How long can you
give me?""

Courtney smiled.  Everything was going as she'd hoped.

Jennifer got off the phone and looked at Courtney.

""How long do you need?""  Jennifer asked.

""Well, you'll have to spend at least a week with me before you can even do
the story,"" Courtney said.

""Okay, and then?"" asked Jennifer.

""Then the rest is up to you,"" Courtney replied.

""How so?"" Jennifer asked.

""You'll see,"" the blonde replied mysteriously.  ""Meet me back here at
seven tonight?""

""Sure,"" Jennifer said, though she wasn't sure why.

""Great,"" Courtney said, standing up from the table.  ""And you won't need
your camera, so you might as well give him the night off.""

""Alright,"" Jennifer said.  ""I'll see you here at seven then.""

""You bet!""  said Courtney as she walked out of the restaurant.  Jennifer
got back into the station's car, and returned to her office.  She worked on
some of the other stories she had on her list, but her mind kept returning to
""the smoking story"" as she was now calling it.

Eventually, seven o'clock came.  Jennifer got into her own car, and turned
the key.  She drove out of the parking lot at the studio, and headed for the
restaurant she was supposed to meet Courtney at.

Within fifteen minutes, she was there.  Courtney was no where to be found.

""Excuse me,"" the hostess said.  ""You're Jennifer Rose, aren't you?""

Familiar with some of the hassles of being on television, Jennifer smiled
politely and said, ""Yes, I am.""

""First, let me say that you're great,"" the young hostess said. 

""Thank you,"" Jennifer said politely, scanning the room for Courtney.

""I was asked to give you this,"" said the hostess, handing Jennifer a
package with a note attached to the top of it.

""Jennifer-Got tied up at work.  Meet me at my house, which is located at 419
Congress Street.  Don't open this package until I get there. -Court""

Normally, such suspicious packages would have made Jennifer uncomfortable.
Even though she was ""only"" on a local affiliate, many of the reporters had
received more than their share of mail that was a little over the edge.

Jennifer wondered how well she could trust this woman, who was, essentially,
a stranger.  The woman was very well dressed, and she didn't ""look like a
psycho"".  She rationalized her next decision with an affirmation.

""I'm going to do whatever it takes to get that anchor's seat,"" she said
silently.

Jennifer got back in the car, and put the brown mysterious brown cardboard
box on the passenger seat.  She studied it for a few minutes, tempted to open
it, hating the fact that she'd always been such an honest person.  If she
was given directions, she followed them to the letter, regardless of her own
personal feelings.  She used to joke with her friends that she was in the
military in a past life.  

She took her eyes from the box and started the car.  She drove downtown and
got on Congress Street.  After just a few miles, she found number 419.  It
was a very nice house - which calmed Jennifer's anxious nerves.  She
didn't see Courtney standing on the porch, but she saw the distinct orange
glow of a cigarette.  

""That must be her,"" Jennifer said, grabbing the package from the passenger
seat.

""Hi,"" Courtney said as Jennifer walked up the sidewalk.

""Hi,"" said Jennifer with a smile.

""I see you found me okay,"" Courtney laughed.

""Yeah, no problems at all,"" replied Jennifer.

""You ready to start?"" asked Courtney.

Jennifer wasn't sure what she was agreeing to, but her streak of integrity
went into overdrive.

""Absolutely,"" she said.

""Excellent,"" said Courtney.  ""Can I get you a drink?""

""Sure,"" said Jennifer graciously.

""I just made a pitcher of margaritas, want one?"" Courtney offered.

""Sure,"" said Jennifer.  She was never a big drinker, but she did enjoy a
drink from time to time, and margaritas were towards the top of the list of
drinks Jennifer liked.

Courtney returned a minute later, and handed Jennifer a large glass of the
frozen citrus beverage.

""How exactly is this helping me with my story?"" Jennifer asked, half-way
through her drink.

Courtney laughed.

""Well, you're doing a story about smoking, and how the new legislation
which would ban smoking in public places is going to affect both smokers and
non-smokers, right?""  she asked.

Jennifer swallowed her drink.

""Exactly,"" she replied.

""Well, have some more of your drink, and it will all begin to make sense,""
Courtney instructed.

Jennifer was beginning to not only feel a bit confused, but a bit buzzed as
well.  The margarita wasn't overly strong, but it had been a while since
Jennifer had eaten, so she was drinking on an empty stomach.  It had been
even longer since she'd consumed alcohol.

After finishing her margarita over some idle chatter, Courtney announced it
was time to begin.

""Okay,"" said Jennifer, feeling the effects of the alcohol.

""But first, another drink,"" Courtney laughed, getting up from her seat and
heading for the kitchen.

Jennifer wasn't sure if she wanted another drink, but she was enjoying
Courtney's company and hospitality, so she didn't decline.  Plus, it was
Friday, so she might as well unwind a bit.

Courtney returned with another glass full of the green slush and handed it to
Jennifer.

""So tell me,"" Courtney began.  ""You've never even tried smoking, right?""

Jennifer was amazed at how Courtney seemed to know her so well, despite the
fact that they'd just met that afternoon.

""How'd you know?"" asked Jennifer.

""You just seem like the type who has been too afraid to try it, that's
all,"" Courtney replied, sipping her drink.

Jennifer was slightly offended by her new friend's assumption.  She looked
at Courtney, who was placing a Marlboro Light 100 between her lips.

""It's not that I'm-"" Jennifer began.

""Of course it's not,"" Courtney interrupted patronizingly.  ""No one ever
admits to being afraid of trying smoking.  They all just complain about the
smell without ever understanding the pros of the habit.""

""I never complained,"" Jennifer defended.

""No, I'm sorry,"" said Courtney.  ""I didn't mean you.  I haven't heard
you complaining about my smoking yet.  But let me ask you this - how do you
plan to do portray an honest assessment of how this legislation will affect
smokers if you've never been one yourself?""

""That's what my interviews are for,"" Jennifer replied confidently.

Courtney laughed.  

""If you were to interview a surgeon, would you be able to explain accurately
how to take out someone's spleen?""  she quipped.

""Well no, I guess-"" started Jennifer, before being interrupted once more.

""I've been both a non-smoker, and I've been a smoker,"" Courtney began.
""I know what it's like to be on both sides of the fence, and both sides
have their advantages.  But I know that I never understood why people smoked
until I tried it myself.""

Jennifer seized the moment to begin interviewing Courtney.

""When was that?"" she asked.

""First of all, let me just say this,"" Courtney began.  ""I see that you're
changing the subject because you're uncomfortable.  I'm not going to try to
convince you to smoke, Jennifer, so don't worry about that.  I just don't
think you can be impartial without trying it, that's all.  How you do your
job is no business of mine.""

Jennifer felt relieved.  She was getting the impression that Courtney was
going to try to pressure her into smoking, and that was not something she
wanted to do.

""With that said, I'll answer your question,"" Courtney continued.  ""I'm
twenty-four now, and I've been smoking since I was twenty-two years old.""

""So you started relatively later in life, since the average starting age is
only nineteen,"" Jennifer stated.

""Yeah, I guess you could say I started late,"" Courtney admitted.  ""But
since the time I started smoking, I have to admit that my life has been
incredibly great, and I've been happier than I've ever been in my life!""

Jennifer took another sip of her margarita.

""How so?"" she asked.

""Well, for one thing, I've been able to get rid of any stress that comes
up, no matter how bad it seems,"" Courtney replied.  ""Also, I've met some
of the most amazing people when I go outside to smoke.  It's like a special
club, only for people who are brave enough to face the consequences in
exchange for something that brings us incredible pleasure.""

Jennifer was no chugging the remainder of her margarita.  The alcohol in her
system removed any inhibitions that she had.  She still didn't want to
smoke, but she found herself wondering what it was like.  She didn't
understand why Courtney would completely ignore decades of research proving
how harmful smoking is.

""So you're not worried about the health effects smoking has on you?""
Jennifer asked her friend, who was now stubbing out the butt of her fully
smoked cigarette.

""It's not so much that I don't worry about them,"" Courtney said.  ""It's
more like I've weighed the pros and cons of smoking versus the pros and cons
of not smoking.""

""And what did you conclude?"" Jennifer asked.

""Well,"" said Courtney.  ""I decided that by not smoking, I would be missing
out on a world that I never knew even existed.  I would miss out on the
people, the camaraderie, and most of all, I would miss out on the pleasure
that smoking brings to me.""

Jennifer was surprised by Courtney's dedication.

""And if you smoked you would get all of those things?"" she asked.

""Oh my God, yes!"" Courtney enthusiastically replied.  ""I would miss out on
those things and so much more!""

""Like what?"" Jennifer asked, genuinely curious.

""Well, for one thing, since I started smoking, I've lost over fifty
pounds!""  Courtney said proudly.  ""I never would have done that if it
weren't for cigarettes.""

""Really?"" asked Jennifer.

""Yes, really,"" agreed Courtney.  ""I mean, haven't you ever wanted to do
something, and not known how to accomplish your goal?""

Jennifer thought.  She was no different than any other woman.  She was always
trying to lose the occasional pound, but like many, was unable to drop below
a certain weight.  

Far from fat, Jennifer stood nearly five feet, nine inches tall.  Her height
came hand in hand with a myriad of other figures though, including the one
hundred-fifty pound weight.  She'd always hoped she would be able to get
down to a leaner one hundred-thirty pounds.

""Of course, but-"" Jennifer began.

""No buts,"" said Courtney.  ""I smoke.  I'm happy that I smoke.  I'm happy
that I've found something that brings me the satisfaction and pleasure that
I deserve in my life.  And most of all, I've noticed how guys react when
they see me smoking.  There's nothing like it.""

For the first time in her thirty-three years, Jennifer contemplated asking
Courtney if she could have one of her cigarettes, just to see what it's
like.  

""God,"" Jennifer began.  ""I must be drunk.""

Courtney laughed.

""Why do you say that?"" she asked.

""Well, I hope you don't take advantage of this,"" Jennifer began.  ""But
I'm almost tempted to try a cigarette."""

Last summer I had a fairly prestigious government position, but do not want to stay down that path.

I have a decision I need to make for this 2L summer - I finally got a SA offer, but it is in my secondary market. I could definitely be happy at this firm, and the pay is good. It is also not too far from where I grew up.

My other option is that I have just received a callback at a major international company with lots of IP (think Apple, Microsoft, IBM, etc.). It seems like this is a great opportunity, and even if it didn't turn into a long-term thing (it isn't in my top preferred region either), it could look pretty on a resume and help me get into my top choice market (but obviously nothing is guaranteed). 

Third option is that I have an opportunity to summer associate at a large international firm in a foreign office - however this internship comes with the stipulation that it is significantly less likely to end in a full time offer (it is part of a university partnership). However it would still look good on a resume, and it is an excuse to live in Germany for the summer. Then I would fly up to do the PLIP again as a 3L (and my grades are a bit higher now than they were last year when I applied) and have some cool experiences to talk about.

Thoughts?

5ry9fu,18,2017-02-03,Rewatching Season 5,3raserE,buffy,https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/5ry9fu/rewatching_season_5/,"Wow. 

This will be long, even for me.

**Strengths**

Virtually everything. Consistency, character, theme, plot, villain, standalones, emotion, intelligence, humor.

One hugely impressive thing (among many) is that every episode is relevant. Every arc episode and every standalone, comedic and dramatic. Every single hour of Season 5 builds on the season themes, foreshadows the future, or somehow connects to the overarching story. It manages to do that without feeling tedious or overserialized (*contra* Angel S4), which is seriously impressive.

**Weaknesses**

Almost nothing. The Knights of Byzantium could’ve been better plotted, I guess? And I’ve already done [my fair share](https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/5q13qw/worst_buffy_character/dcw7lk4/) of [Riley bashing](https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/5q90g3/the_unsung_hero_of_this_show/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=buffy), so I’ll [leave it up to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/5q13qw/worst_buffy_character/dcwcz98/) to stalk my comment history and see my many complaints. 

To be perfectly honest, the most hit-or-miss writer this season for me was Jane Espenson, which is a shame given how important a part of the show she was. She wrote some great episodes (The Replacement, I Was Made to Love You, co-wrote Checkpoint), but swung and missed on Triangle, and delivered one (Intervention) that I feel very conflicted over. Even at her best, in the good episodes and the bad, I feel like she had a serious tendency to sacrifice character for the joke, and that undermines the humor for me. (Looking ahead to her writing credits on S6 and S7, I’m very much looking forward to her future episodes, though.) 

The fact that these very minor issues are all the complaints I can make should speak to the incredible season of TV that this is. 

**Plot Discussion/Thematic Notes**

-Quick Note: Doug Petrie was a revelation. No Place Like Home, Fool for Love, Checkpoint, The Weight of the World. 

-If you want to look at the major metaphor of the season, it’s all about the division of self. Dawn represents the human part of Buffy and Glory represents the Slayer part. There are plenty of clues and echoes of this throughout the season, some of which I’ll note later. 

-Glory’s division of self (Ben is Glory?) is a reflection of the theme at its most extreme. Human and superhuman aren’t just poorly integrated--they’re completely separate, and they hate each other. This is a shadow of Buffy’s relationship with Dawn/her own internal personality. Like Cordelia and Faith in the first three seasons, this is a “shadow self” to reflect Buffy’s road not taken. 

-The problem our heroine faces is the challenge of integrating her human and Slayer halves. She needs to understand and accept both sides of her, reaching adulthood without losing her inner child, her last remnant of innocence, her capacity for love. She’s growing increasingly afraid that the Slayer half is consuming the human, turning her to stone. (Simultaneously, Glory is out to kill Dawn.) The metaphorical reason why she’s so intent on saving Dawn at all costs in The Gift is because Dawn represents her innocence. Buffy doesn’t want to live in a world where she has to give that up for good in order to survive. That’s what makes the end of The Gift perfect. She opted out of the false choice. She found the third way. She saved Dawn and the world, and she understood. And for the first time since Prophecy Girl, she found peace. 

-This would all be moot if the season weren’t so good. One of the most impressive things for me is that Season 5 works as a metaphor, but it also functions perfectly on a textual level alone. It strips Buffy of the people she loves--first Riley, then Joyce, and finally threatens to take Dawn too. The events of the Season isolate her more and more, pushing her ever closer to the edge and stripping her of her defenses. We haven’t seen her pushed so far since Season 2. But that, taking away her weapons, her family, and her hope, led to what I would argue is her best season of the entire show.

-The end of the season is perfect. What I mean is that the pieces were placed so carefully that it couldn’t have been written any other way. She wasn’t cold. She was full of love. She loved with all her soul, so brightly that it blinded. Love brought her to her gift. She loved so much that she gave herself to the world. Her epiphany is about more than what it means to be the Slayer.

It’s about what it means to be human.

-I see a parallel between Willow’s sexuality and her power. For the first season and a half or so she was hopelessly crushing on Xander, who didn’t return her affections. At the same time, she had no knowledge of or affinity for magic. In late Season 2 and in Season 3, Oz draws her out of her shell and she begins to develop her magical abilities, with many stumbles and relatively little power. Once she comes out and finds Tara, her powers grow exponentially to the point where she becomes the strongest member of the team. Just an observation.

**The Big Bad**

Glory is the best villain since Angelus. As I see it, a villain needs to do four things in order to be a great antagonist. 

1. Has to be interesting. Needs a personality, a sense of humor, or something to differentiate it. Glory has personality in spades. Most Buffyverse Big Bads do (not Adam). 

2. Has to be a real threat. There needs to be a feeling that the villain is legitimately dangerous and may actually win a victory. That victory may not be ending the world (because that never feels like it’ll happen) but it has to be something. For the Master, it was the fear that he’d kill Buffy. For Angelus, it was psychological. For Glory, it was the fear that she’d take Dawn away and/or turn Buffy to stone. Adam didn’t have this, and neither did the Mayor. Glory did.

3. Has to have a personal connection to the protagonist (connected to #2). The one villain who’s had this (and thus the best villain so far) was Angelus. On her own, Glory doesn’t have this. But her pursuit of Dawn adds this to the story. Glory’s trying to take away what Buffy treasures most, making the story personal.

4. Needs to draw something out of the protagonist, pushing them beyond their comfort zone (so to speak) and revealing who they are underneath. Every villain (including Adam) has done this to a degree, but I believe that Glory has been the most successful since Angelus in this regard. 

There are probably more things that I’m leaving out, but this is a rough sketch of what an antagonist should be. Glory went 4/4. And personally, I *love* Glory.


**Overall**

Buffy’s fifth season is more consistent than the third, as emotional as or moreso than the second, and better than the first and fourth in every conceivable way. I’m reserving judgment on the sixth and seventh, both of which I love, until I’ve seen them again, but I think that this will end up being the most complete, most intelligent, best season of the show. It was stunning.

**Episode-by-Episode Verdict**

**Buffy vs. Dracula:** One of several highly underrated episodes that does a fine job of establishing the season themes--about how you deal with your own darker impulses without becoming them. Dracula gets some (fair) criticism for hamming it up, but the questions he raises about the nature of the Slayer are intriguing. The thrust of the episode and the whole season, I think, is that Buffy fears that she’s darker than anything she slays. That she’s turning to stone, and she can’t stop it.

**Real Me:** Foreshadows the season finale, in which a blond woman takes Dawn from home, ties her up, and complains to her before trying to kill her. In addition to her role as little sister, I think Dawn is meant to represent Buffy’s human half/inner childhood. What we learn in Real Me supports that--Dawn keeps a diary like Buffy used to, loves Willow and Xander, finds Buffy’s training boring, likes Tara, and isn’t so sure about Anya--all echoes of Buffy. There’s also Dawn’s complaint that no one cares what she’s really like, just like Buffy’s human side goes underappreciated. It’s also a very funny episode. And I love Tara being a mom.

**The Replacement:** The Replacement neatly sums up the season’s metaphor--the division of self and the need to reintegrate. In the season arc, it applies to Buffy. Her human half (Dawn) and remorseless killer, Slayer concentrate half (Glory) act out a tug of war over her identity. Add to the subtext a big growth moment for Xander, real pathos, and some great humor, and this ends up a very strong episode. The fact that I put The Replacement in the bottom half of the season isn’t a strike against it and speaks to just how great this season is.

**Out of My Mind:** I’m not a fan, but even as one of the weakest episodes of the season Out of My Mind is still good enough. Riley and Spike both go a bit girl-crazy, the seeds of Riley’s departure are sown. It introduces Spike’s obsession, intern Ben, and Joyce’s illness all at once.

**No Place Like Home:** A criminally underrated episode. There’s the only villain since Angelus to be introduced with such a bang, for one thing. Add to that outstanding character work, a magnificently tense atmosphere, the perfectly-handled Dawn reveal, and a standout performance from SMG. It’s purely a setup episode, but NPLH is one of the best setup episodes I’ve ever seen. 

**Family:** The final scene of Family is among my favorite moments of the entire show.

**Fool for Love:** God. Damn.

**Shadow:** This is typically remembered for the CGI cobra and, sadly, not for the heartbreaking and outstanding interactions between Joyce, Dawn, Buffy, and Riley in the hospital. Also, just saying, you might complain about the quality of the CGI. But that quality of CGI, for that long, on that budget is pretty damn impressive. And the rest of the episode is excellent.

**Listening to Fear:** Another episode that gets its best moments from the storyline of Joyce’s illness. The Queller itself isn’t my favorite demon design, but I do like all the POV shots. If they used more of those and showed the Queller less, it might be one of the scarier episodes of the show.

**Into the Woods:** This is 90% very good. Buffy rightly calls out Riley for his emotional manipulation and it all points to being a great episode and a fitting sendoff for a character who had become increasingly unlikeable. But then...they really botched the landing. Even if Buffy had been partially to blame for the relationship’s slow collapse (something I very much disagree with), cheating on her with vampire hookers, threatening her with an ultimatum, convincing her that it’s her fault, and refusing to talk to her about his insecurities until this point is more than enough to break up with him. It’s my view that it wouldn’t have mattered if Buffy had caught up with him and convinced him to stay. Once you hold an ultimatum over your partner’s head like that, there’s no going back. 

**Triangle:** I’ll be upfront in saying that I don’t like this episode. There’s a significant bit of foreshadowing, however, besides the troll hammer. Xander (Buffy’s metaphorical heart) is forced to make an impossible choice, à la Buffy in The Gift, and he refuses. 

**Checkpoint:** Utterly kickass. And really funny. Checkpoint was co-written by Doug Petrie and Jane Espenson, and their contrasting styles balance out perfectly.

**Blood Ties:** The fact that this is nowhere near Buffy’s worst birthday says a lot. The Ben-is-Glory reveal adds to the “division of self” theme. The split between Ben and Glory is a more extreme version of Buffy’s own division between human and Slayer. Also, there’s an effective adoption metaphor worth noting.

**Crush:** Crush wins extra points for paraphrasing my favorite line from Othello, one of Shakespeare’s great plays. 

&gt;We can love quite well, if not wisely.

I adore Drusilla. Alas, this is her last appearance in the Buffyverse, chronologically. In a callback to BvD, Buffy’s still worried about the darkness inside her, in this instance perhaps because she’s worried that it reflects Spike’s own. 

**I Was Made to Love You:** I enjoy the April-bot, although I can understand those who don’t. Aside from that, though, this has a perfect balance of comedic and serious. It’s a big moment for Buffy when she finally understands that it’s OK for her to be single. I love the character work, I think the humor is great, and I was really surprised at how good IWMtLY ended up being. 

**The Body:** I believe The Body may be the greatest episode of television ever made. I’m not going to review or critique it, because I don’t think I can. And I know I don’t need to justify this episode’s high ranking to Buffy fans. 

**Forever:** The Body casts a long shadow and Forever often gets forgotten. But it’s a great episode in its own right. This is the first instance in the show of Spike being altruistic (bringing flowers without a card for Joyce, then helping Dawn and not wanting Buffy to know). 

**Intervention:** I need to clarify something. I really, really like Intervention. Specifically every scene with Buffy--worrying that she’s turning to stone, seeking out the Spirit Guide, and visiting Spike as the Buffybot especially. Also, the interrogation of Spike may just be his most badass moment in the show. The thing that holds it back is the Buffybot. It’s not that I dislike it. I just think that the Scoobies break character for the sake of the joke when they don’t recognize it as a robot, and that frustrates me. Much of the episode is great, but large parts of it feel out of place. I feel like if the focus was more on Buffy’s search for answers and less on Spike’s super-creepy sex romp, this could’ve been a top-3 episode of the season. (I really wish I could’ve seen a Doug Petrie version.)

So when I called it “Most Disappointing,” that’s not saying it’s bad, just that it could’ve been so much more with very little alteration.

**Tough Love:** A few notes. (1) The topic of Willow and Tara’s argument oscillates between use of magic and being a lesbian, calling back to the metaphor used in Season 4. (2) Tara’s incredibly brave. (3) There’s another use of the Ben/Glory division of self metaphor. Ben gets increasingly resentful of his inhuman half when he gets fired for not showing up for two weeks. Simultaneously, Dawn (aka Buffy’s human half) resents Buffy for showing “tough love.” It’s also important that I mention that my discussion of the metaphor is only one level for reading the season. The story works seamlessly both as text and subtext, and by no means is it necessary to read metaphor into it. 

**Spiral:** This is probably most people’s candidate for “Most Disappointing.” I thought it was fine, personally. I’m not a huge fan of the Knights of Byzantium and I do think this episode could’ve been better, but at the same time I enjoyed it a lot.

**The Weight of the World:** Since I’ve heard this mentioned before and I strongly disagree, I don’t think Buffy has a death wish. In TWOTW, she’s dealing with a sense of guilt and a wish to abdicate responsibility. That’s not the same thing. It’s important because viewing Buffy’s sacrifice in The Gift as suicide or fulfilling a death wish demeans it. Just my two cents. I also think Glory is fantastic, at her self-involved, sassy, mildly insane hell-god best. 

Quick observation: In TWOTW Glory screams “Get out get out GET OUT!” at her minions. Dawn screamed the same thing in Blood Ties. I see this as an explicit connection between them as the metaphorical halves of Buffy.

**The Gift:** This is the best episode of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer.* This is the pinnacle of everything the show’s been building to since the pilot. This is utterly magnificent. For a crude metric of how great I find this episode, I’ve been keeping a record of the great moments of the show. Things like “I’m sixteen years old,” “Lie to me,” and so on. Moments, lines or scenes that gave me chills or had a profound emotional impact. Season 3 had six of them, a perfectly respectable total. The Gift had eight.

5ryf7x,1,2017-02-03,Quick question about replacing a phone.,digitallightweight,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5ryf7x/quick_question_about_replacing_a_phone/,"So yesterday I dropped my iPhone 5 on some unforgiving tile and absolutely obliterated the display. After an appropriate grieving period I stared to try and grapple with the problem of the best way to go about replacing the phone. The way I see it I have three options: repair the existing phone, purchase a new phone or purchase a used phone.

I got got the phone for free second hand from a dear friend which was fantastic however unfortunately it had sustained some water damage while in their possession so any repairs done to the phone would need to be done by me or a third party. The cost of a new display from amazon is about $40 and will take at least a week to arrive. This is a very cost effective decision which is important seeing as how I am currently in school and have no current source of income. It also has the draw back of me going without a phone for a week and exposing myself to the sometimes dubious quality of parts supplied in the secondary market.

Option number two has me purchasing a phone from the local Craigslist equivalent which is the mid point in price between the other two options. I would likely purchase a iPhone 5s which seem to be selling for between $150 and $180. This is again a fine option, obviously cheaper than buying new but introducing some uncertainty about how well the hardware has been cared for and wither or not the device is stolen. The iPhone 5 generation are undoubtedly fine phones aside from the battery issues that some consumers reported. For the past year my recently deceased phone handled everything that I needed it to (texting,calling and occasional internet browsing) admirably but with the release of iOS 10 it seems like the phone is beginning to become obsolete. My plan was to take some of the money from my summer internship and put it towards whatever the 10th anniversary phone turns out to be. Obviously I no longer have my 5 to bridge me over.

Option number three is it purchase a new phone. Investing in an iPhone 7 does not make sense for me at all financially so if I were to get a new phone it would most likely be a SE (I have small hands so the 4 inch form factor appeals to me too). The SE looks like a good phone and it has the A9 chip so it would be a definite upgrade but at $580 or $710 with apple care am I really getting that much life span out of the phone?

So /r/apple, What would you do if you were in my situation? New phone? New parts and an old phone? Or, go get a second hand phone? Thanks for taking the time to read and give me suggestions. You all know a lot about apple products and I really appreciate any insight you might have into my situation."

“Attention, Parks department! Gather ‘round. I have big, big news! Meeting in the boardroom in 5 seconds.”


At this, the others shuffled into the boardroom. Tom Haverford slumped into his seat beside Donna Meagle, both of whom were sporting matching embroidered ‘Treat Yo' Self’ smoking jackets. Andy Dwyer sped into the room giggling, with April riding piggyback. Director Ron Swanson reluctantly sat opposite Leslie at the head of the table. Jerry Gergich took his seat beside Leslie, who was just about to warn him of the melted chocolate donut she had accidentally left on his seat.


She chose not to inform Jerry of the donut.


“Alright, we got everybody? Ann? Where’s Ann? Ann?! Where are you?!


“I’m here! I’m here,” Her best friend, Ann, took the last seat. “Wait… why do I need to be here? I don’t work here.”


“Ann, please, just close your gorgeous ethnic pie hole and listen.” Leslie took a deep, calming breath.


“OK, everybody, here’s the deal. As we know, Pawnee is going through some tough times, due to our recent budget cuts and our recent payout for the Julia Roberts lawsuit.”


“Yeah, who thought it was a good idea to make our town motto ‘Pawnee: Home of Julia Roberts’?” Tom glared around the table in disgust. “If anything, it should’ve been something baller, like ‘Pawnee: Home of Big Sean.’”


“Who is that, and what distinguishes him from Little Sean?” Ron asked in slight interest.


Leslie slapped down her stack of paper. “Focus, people! The town is haemorrhaging money, and if we don’t come up with something great, Pawnee will be bought… by Eagleton.”


At this, there was a sudden stillness in the room. Shit just got real. Nobody in Pawnee wanted the Eagletonians to take over Pawnee.


“Here’s what I propose,” Leslie waved towards the stack of papers before her. “I have Mayor Gunderson’s approval to reinstate the Pawnee Harvest Festival. I think we should throw another one to draw in thousands of visitors and hopefully save this town.”


“I agree,” said Ron firmly. “I would rather have my bitch of an ex-wife, Tammy, know my address than see Pawnee taken over by Eagleton.”


“Wait, which Tammy?” asked Donna.


Ron stared at her for a moment. “Both.”


“Speaking of,” continued Leslie, “I’m afraid the Pawnee Library is out in full force again, Ron. They’re trying to convert our citizens to the Good Book and stay indoors at the library.”


Ron leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. “Then I must take her down myself. Alone, if necessary.”


At that moment, city manager Chris Traeger arrived, along with accountant Ben Wyatt.


“Leslie Knope! Mayor Gunderson has just told me about your plan to put on another Harvest Festival.” Chris threw in a cheerful thumbs-up.


“Yes,” replied Leslie, quickly glancing at Ben before looking back towards Chris. “Do you think it’s a good idea?”


“I don’t think it’s a good idea.”


“Oh,” said Leslie, who looked a bit stunned at his pronouncement.


“I think it’s a great idea!” he continued, beaming his Chris Traeger trademark smile.


“Oh! Well, that was… confusing...” Leslie trailed off.


Chris, who hadn’t heard her, continued. “I think it’s literally the greatest idea I have ever heard. This will revitalize the town, boost our economy and best of all, give the Parks department the recognition you deserve!”


“Things are tight at the moment,” Ben cut in. “You’ll have to operate on a shoestring budget.”


“That’s OK,” replied Leslie firmly. “We can work with that. As long as no major incidents occur in Pawnee between now and Harvest Festival, we can have everything up and running in 3 weeks.”


“No one’s gonna want to come here,” April said, sitting on Andy’s lap. “It smells. And there are raccoons. And also, I hate everyone, so I’ll rip their guts out if they come here.”


Andy giggled. “She’s joking, Leslie. Isn't she cute like that?"" Ben stared in doubt.


“April, I told you, the raccoon problem is under control,” Leslie started to pull out empty binders and label dividers. “They have their part of the town, and we have ours. Now come on, everyone, we have a Town Forum to attend!”


Everyone else groaned.


“No!” whined Tom. “Donna and I are gearing up for-”


“Treat ‘Yo Self 2017!” the two of them sang in unison.


“OK, fine. Jerry, you can come with me. And Ben. And Ann. Beautiful, sweet Ann.”


“But I’m… on my lunch break-” mumbled Ann.


“Don’t care. You’re the greatest nurse in the world, you can work when you want,” said Leslie flatly. “To the Community Centre!”


~


With the Parks &amp; Rec department set to work on getting Harvest Festival ready, the town was soon abuzz with excitement. Talk was flying around. Word on the street was that the famous Lil’ Sebastian would be making an appearance. Rumours spread of a Unity Concert featuring Donna’s cousin, the one and only Ginuwine.


But with all this talk, nobody was paying attention to what was happening at the local Sweetums Candy factory. Thanks to Bobby Newport’s lack of effort, his father’s company was in crisis mode. The factory had just had a runoff of toxic chemicals that was spilling into the nearby creek. The sickly-sweet smell and purple hue attracted the attention of nearby residents -- the Raccoons. They dipped their paws into the creek and tasted the toxic water. Within minutes, it happened. They mutated, morphed and grew into ferocious, predatory raccoons. The local possum, Fairway Frank, grew to be the biggest and most fearsome of the animals. With a screech, he ordered his newly formed raccoon army to seek out the villains of Pawnee.


For too long, Frank had been hunted by the citizens of Pawnee. Now, it was his time to wreak havoc and take his revenge on the town that had caused him so much trouble. Now, he would lead the raccoons and form an uprising that would send the town crumbling to the ground. There would be no Harvest Festival, no Unity Concert, no Lil’ Sebastian and no treating of oneself.


All he had to do was assemble some of Pawnee’s most vilified town members. Together, these humans and his raccoons would start a fire that would wipe Pawnee off the map once and for all.  

The first step: wipe out the Parks department!

#BREAKING NEWS!  

4:07 am: There has been news of a death in town -- a notable member, /u/kemistreekat, was found dead outside her home.  This notable member of the community was fondly known as **Bobby Newport**, whose father owned the local Sweetums Factory.  KemKat was next in line to inherit the business, but now the community is in an uproar over who is to take over from here.  KemKat was found at 4:00 am this morning by neighbours who were taking out their trash.  Although CSIs place the time of death around 12 am, so far, no medical examination has been completed, and police have no suspects at this time.  

*

4:51 am:  There has been news of yet ANOTHER death in town -- /u/bubbasaurus, a new arrival to town, was found dead in her rented motel room.  Also known as **Jennifer Barkley**, BubbaS was known to be Kemkat's legal advisor and was frequently seen following her around town to ensure that no harm came to her employer.  BubbaS was found at 4:41 am this morning by police, who had gone straight to her motel room to inform her of KemKat's demise.  CSIs also place her death around 12 am, and as a result police are now considering these two cases to be suspicious deaths.  Police still have no suspects at this time.

*

7:00 am: The library has just announced that they are hosting a Book Exchange!  If you're interested in this event, check out the Pawnee Public Library, located in front of Ramsett Park.

*

8:10 am: A confidential source in the Park Rangers' office has confirmed at least one sighting of a large beast roaming the streets of Pawnee.  In addition, several tracks found in Ramsett Park would have been suggestive of a raccoon, if it weren't for the size!  This reporter will head next to Animal Control for more information on this front.  In the meantime, the government is advising all citizens to be on alert of large animals in the area, and to never travel alone.

I already posted this on a different sub-reddit that got a few replies, and someone suggested that it would be helpful if I posted here and get your opinion a few things:


I am currently a student in college double majoring in Mathematics and Economics, and over the past 3-4 months, I've become more and more interested in the idea of working in Real Estate Development. I have a basic understanding of some things I should do to ""sample"" the real estate industry as well as prepare for a career in that field. But I'd extremely interested in hearing your perspective on what a student should be thinking about with the idea of a commercial real estate development career in mind(the end goal hopefully being working at a development firm).


If you guys would be willing to answer a few questions for me, that would be FANTASTIC! Also any other advice that I might've missed would be super helpful too!


**Questions:**

1.) Thoughts on MRED(Initially out of school vs 5 years into career vs not going at all)

2.)Things I could start doing now that will help me down the road

3.)Program/Software I should learn that the industry uses(Argus and Excel the only ones?)

4.)General Career Path

5.)Types of internships that are helpful

6.) etc.

Thank you for your help, you folks rock!"
5ryvxv,2,2017-02-03,Where do I even begin [Questions/Quitting Weed/Rant],leavethedream,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/5ryvxv/where_do_i_even_begin_questionsquitting_weedrant/,"Hey guys. So I'm 26, male, and an INFJ. I've known I'm an INFJ for a while I did a test 6 years ago and had my family do tests asking me questions as they're also into Briggs Myers personality thing. So much on my mind this is gonna be a giant ramble, sorry.

So first let me say my family (mom/dad) are very supportive and are the ones who told me I'm INFJ and confirmed it with tests. They're great and without them I don't know where I'd be. Growing up I knew I was different but isn't everyone? I just felt like I was a lot older more mature than my peers when looking at the big picture, but I'm still an immature guy in general and on the micro level. I made plenty of dumb stupid mistakes, and still do today. That's life though. I feel like that isn't specific to any one personality type. I definitely get anxious a lot of the time but it doesn't seem so bad. Once I'm doing something or into something it all goes away usually. 

One question I have is, why is everyone so negative around here about being INFJ? Like oh no one understands me, or oh I'm so depressed/anxious, or yeah I hate this society. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely a little depressed and super anxious about something everyday. And yeah our society is one big lie. But I really don't feel like that's specific to one personality type. My family understands me, I have 3/4 close friends for 10+ years and they understand me well enough but not everything. I had a huge group of friends and could generally make friends and maintain them pretty easily. Sure it was a chore but that's friendship. 

When I was 20 I started smoking a lot of weed, smoking cigarettes, drinking way too much coffee, drinking more, binge gaming (Dota lets gooo), and started to fail college. I was mega stressed about it and after I failed out after 1.5 years, I was really tired during community college. Turned out I developed hashimotos disease (autoimmune disorder). I'm still taking a synthetic thyroid medication for it. It seems to be working for now. I really think I gave myself this autoimmune disease and can maybe reverse it despite western medicine saying otherwise. However western medicine is controlled by profit and are more interested in treating conditions than healing them. Anyway So I started working retail out of college, and then an internship, and that turned into salary + benefits as an app/web developer for a small company servicing big pharma (lel, money w/e).

So that was all well and good and I was generally pretty damn happy every single day and just weed anxious but really barely anxious at all. Around early Sept at 26 I started to get really anxious everytime I smoked. I started to think what am I really doing with my life? I'm just working, going home, smoking weed, getting high, playing games, eat, sleep, repeat. Day in, day out. Eventually I would just get really anxious every. single. time. So I quit and moved back home with my family out of my apartment. Still working at the same place. 

The first month of quitting weed was panic attacks, pretty hardcore anxiety, and rage/depression. This is normal though after smoking 1-2 grams everyday for 7ish years. Over at r/leaves this is common (PAWS). It got better and around month 4 I was pretty happy. My anxiety is definitely higher overall (or so I perceive) but it's really low compared to smoking weed. Pretty easily manageable.  Some other positive changes I made were:
starting gym (powerlifting and cardio), quit ALL processed foods (almost paleo diet less the potatoes), quit coffee, and nofap (not binge masturbating to weird sh!t). I reckon my dopamine receptors will become more sensitive. They have so far I can enjoy just reading a book now or just listening to music. I no longer need 6 bowls, electronic music blasting, and 5 hours of dota to feel enjoyable doing something. I cut my cigarettes down to 6-10 a day instead of 20. Side note: cigarettes actually help hashimotos disease a lot, which is ass backwards I know but they do. My endo confirmed it That's going to be VERY difficult to quit.  

Uhhh sh!t where I was going with this...

Right so I just recently started to really think about my life from many angles and I've dulled my emotions so hard with weed (and heightened my senses so everything was really awesome when just walking on the streets or w/e) and I realize that being an INFJ is kinda tough. My mind is always thinking, songs are constantly playing in my head, I'm over analyzing past shameful moments, and I guess my mind isn't really ever quiet. Also it's tough just knowing things about people or situations but not having the energy to explain them. Why even bother no one would really listen anyway or it would come off as rude. 

Anyway I searched weed on this sub and I see a lot of users smoke. I'm an addict I  know and weed wasn't really helping me. Anything that gives you free happy emotions has to pay its price on a higher realm. Please don't take this the wrong way, if you smoke that's fine, who am I to say anything. I smoked 1-2 grams a day for 7 years! Weed taught me a lot of wonderful things, like how to not give a sh!t. It's a straight up addiction, there is physical withdraw despite people saying oh it's a medicine. Cough syrup is a medicine too, if you have to take it everyday maybe your throat or lungs are fukd. Your body produces it's own cannabanoids and when you quit there's a week long period where you body has to adjust and ramp up its endocannabanoid production. Cannabanoids control mood, body temperature, and appetite. So when you stop people can't sleep, can't eat, and are temperamental. That's textbook physical dependency.  

RIGHT SO, despite all of this I've made a lot of progress in my life (which I'm only realizing now as I write this or on r/leaves) and I'm definitely just kinda apathetic sometimes. Like just now after work I was just laying in bed feeling bleh. Then I went to the gym and did cardio and now I feel pretty alert and just fine, good. I feel like that's life though. People are a little depressed sometimes, anxiety drives us to problem solve in our lives. I've seen people actually depressed on r/leaves after quitting and just wallowing in their self pity. I'm actually making strides. Why is everyone here so pity party? It's as if they portray their INFJ as a weakness. 'Oh next life I'll be ENTP' or w/e. Or 'omg I'm SOOOO anxious'. I don't mean to belittle anyone but why is that the recurring theme here. I come here to read and relate and instead just get anxious and kinda depressed reading this sub. What's up with that? I haven't felt this depressed about myself until I read this subreddit for the past week, last time I felt like that was month 2 of quitting weed. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice and if anyone can relate. I really don't mean to belittle anyone just please share your experience. Everyone even if they're INFJ is a little different, if weed works for you, or if you happen to be really depressed. I get that, it sucks. I'm sorry. I never knew what true depression was until I quit weed and the first month was pure everlasting agony. I guess I just feel mildly depressed and a little anxious. But I really think if I keep going the way I am I can maybe just maybe make it. Get back to the feeling of greatness I had at 18/19 before I ruined myself. Nowadays I'm sometimes really pumped, sometimes a little apathetic but genereally more stable than I ever have been since I was 18.  And again that's completely separate from an INFJ type. I've seen kids that aren't INFJ go through the same thing I'm going through. Hell you can read r/leaves and my story isn't that unique. I kinda realize I hate my job now and want to find a better coding gig. So I will strive for that. I just get the impression from this sub that I'm broken somehow. I always knew I was a little different but I took that as a strength. Sure it's tough and maybe what I feel is normal really isn't. But does that really matter? I like me despite all the turmoil I put myself through. For now I'm looking at the personalityhacker INFX unveiled program. I had some childhood trauma for sure (nothing TOO major though) and maybe I can get past that. Also I think I should start mindful meditation. I guess I'd just like to hear stories from successful INFJs. If you have any questions for me about your personal journey quitting weed or overcoming depression feel free to ask. I'll be more than happy to answer with what little experience I have."

If I know the quality of the movie it is listed next to it. I verify the codes before sending to make sure they are still valid. If they don't redeem on VUDU I will send you notice or a link of where to redeem.

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut. Or having it uploaded somewhere. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy. Been wanting a nice BWC lately

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere, I do love race play❤️, and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Lashana"

I'm thinking about applying for the IAESTE internship next year but I'd like to clarify some things regarding entry requirements. I thought you might be able to help.


1. If there's no committee / representation at my university but there is at another one in the same city, am I still allowed to apply?
2. Also, in terms of the internships offers, does the study level *Middle* apply to students who have already completed at least 4 semesters or also the ones who will reach that point at the beginning of the programme?

Thanks! :)

5s129g,7,2017-02-04,Do you think it would be acceptable to forego an internship in exchange for studying for TOPIK level 4?,PlainclothesmanBaley,Korean,https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/5s129g/do_you_think_it_would_be_acceptable_to_forego_an/,"Apologies if this is not relevant to the sub, but discussion of TOPIK qualifications can't really go many other places.

Basically I'm a Computer Science undergraduate in my final year.  Next year I'll be doing a Masters.  I did an internship last year and the standard approach now would be for me to do another one this year.  Having said that, I think if I had the summer off to study Korean I could get my TOPIK level 4 in October and really break the back of the language so I can finally start working my way through news articles and the like.  I don't need the money from the internship.

I want to take the summer off to study, but I also don't want to majorly harm my career prospects.  I'm kind of hoping that employers will look at a Korean language qualification as an indication that the summer was not wasted, but I don't know if they would do that or not.

Does anyone have any thoughts?"

2. Why did you become an IPL?

3. What's your background? What was your college major?

4. How did you enter the field? Internships? Clerkships?

I am from Asia(high school senior), and have applied to SJSU, among other schools.

My scores:
SAT : 1390/1600
TOEFL: 114/120
11th grade marks: 95% marks(not to be confused with percentile. I scored an overall of 95% in all my subjects)

Got a bunch of co curriculars but the application portal doesnt have any section where I can submit em:
Office bearer in school, leadership, was ranked top 100 in the nation in an economics aptitude test, MOOC certification(JavaScript framework), built a bunch of apps, run a small $5k trading operation, created a bunch of websites, ran a tech blog etc.

I have applied as a CS major and would like current international undergrad students/ CS major students to help me out with the probability of me getting admitted.

In addition to this, I'd like to know a bit more about SJSU.

Note that I applied to SJSU mainly due to the strong CS course as well as the location, which I believe will give me the right exposure.

Will studying in the heart of silicon valley as a CS major(at SJSU) help me? How was your experience.

2. What are my chances of getting admitted?

3. If you are an international undergrad, what were your scores(you can PM me to maintain anonymity), how has your experience been so far and what advice do you have for prospective students.

4. What are the internship opportunities like? Do you get to learn a lot?

5. What about the conferences, meetups,  events, hackathons? How active is the community and how engaging is the overall scene?

Also never had sex. I started dating this girl, M [19F], that I met at a party on the first week of freshman year. We started dating before day 1 of class and have been together since. 


We have had a lot of amazing times together. She is the only girl I've had sex with, and definitely the most caring person I know. She's very intelligent, kind, and generally fun to be around. Best of all our communication thus far has been great, as far as emotions and thoughts go. However, she has some serious issues with depression and anxiety. Her mom was an alcoholic/emotionally abusive (her dad on the other hand is a saint, absolutely a great person) and her mom affected her in the long run. To make matters worse, she had an extended internship last summer (8 month of long distance...) and her mom died. (EDIT: I need to add here that she was depressed long before this. We have spent a *lot* of time talking about this, comforting her, letting her vent. I have tried very hard to be a supportive boyfriend and make sacrifices. We also have talked openly about everything I've written in this post. But I still can't decide what to do. Anyways...)  It has gotten to the point now that M and I can only good 4-6 days before she gets extremely upset over something minor, has a mental breakdown, and interprets that as there being something wrong with our relationship. This very frequently gets in the way of me having fun with my friends. She is active in my friend group and enjoys being with us, and them with her, but most nights that we all drink together, she will find something tiny to get upset over and make me leave with her to comfort her while she sobs and questions her existence and our relationship. 


It has gotten to the point now where she would rather stay in most nights. She wants me to stay with her, but she also knows I will resent her if she keeps me from spending time with my friends. However, when she says she's  okay with it if I go out, she ends up resenting that I'm out having fun and she's stuck at home. Cue cycle of mental breakdown, calling me to come back and comfort her, etc...


I just don't know what to do. We have been together for well over 2 years now, and I want to know what it's like to be single at college. On the other hand, we communicate very well with each other, and I love having someone to cuddle with, to text good morning and good night, make meals with, kiss and hold hands, and most importantly she supports me and shows me that she loves me. She is an amazing person despite her faults. But it's been hard. Out of about 30 months together, 12 have been long distance (between 4 and 8 hours apart), and this summer I'm about to have my own extended intership... another 8 months of long distance where she will be at school and I'll be away. On top of that, she graduates a year before me. Another huge set of long distance. 



I can't handle knowing we have so much more long distance on top of what we have already endured. Her depression and anxiety takes a huge toll on my emotions, and her childhood problems are already resurfacing. This kinda matters to me, maybe not any of you, but her genes are awful. She has mild Crohn's disease, she is predisposed to ovarian cysts/cancer, and her mother was an alcoholic. 


What the fuck do I do?




TL/DR: I love my girlfriend. She's very caring and smart. We've been together for 2 and a half years, and started the first week of college, but a lot of it is long distance and we have a lot more long distance ahead of us. We only have 4 to 5 ""good"" days a week. Otherwise her depression clouds her and she interprets that as relationship issues. We have had a lot of fights lately. I want to know what it's like to be single at college, but I don't want to give up the cuddling, the caring/acceptance, someone just to stop by and say they love me... but so many fights. So many fun nights ruined by her overreacting to me saying hi to another girl. What do I do.


EDIT 2: I'll be honest. My friend group is a fraternity. Please don't judge. All my brother love her too, she's a good friend of the house and M and I were together before I joined. I live in the house. This might add some dimensions to how often I'm around other people and my other time obligations. "
5s206s,1,2017-02-04,[M(as A)4F(as A)] A prompt collection to soothe your soul and gain your interest,freddiemercurious,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5s206s/mas_a4fas_a_a_prompt_collection_to_soothe_your/,"Hello there! I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

────────

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 2.

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid. This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."
5s26k7,11,2017-02-04,"Rant on Filipino women from a ""Filipino"" woman",cyanideunicorn,hapas,https://www.reddit.com/r/hapas/comments/5s26k7/rant_on_filipino_women_from_a_filipino_woman/,"This is going to sound pretty racist but I have to get it off my chest because it's been bugging me for too long now.

I've been lurking in this thread for who knows how long and I've encountered lots of stories of how Filipinos are easy, golddiggers, self hating, and I have to say that unfortunately, I can't say that it's not exactly untrue.

My racial background is mixed, as both parents are Eurasian. Dad is from another Asian country, but I hold a Philippine citizenship thanks to my mom. They live in said country because of dad's job, which pays well, but I live in the Philippines with relatives.

I'm currently getting my student visa to go to a third country to get my masters degree, which is also where my fiancé is a citizen. We met at work when he was on an internship and we have been going strong for years, but since I couldn't get a visa to go to that country as a visitor (they think I'll stay there illegally despite my connections to the Philippines, thank you very much, my fellow Filipinos who are illegal immigrants over there), I haven't been able to visit, so he comes over instead when he can. 

His mom is from HK, has never met me, but she already doesn't like me, despite what her son tells her. The only reason is the fact that I identify myself as a Filipino. She told him that back in her country, they're prostitutes, they're gold diggers, they're mail order brides, the like, and she thinks I'm one of them and only after her son's money (he's not rich, but he does earn more than I do). My fiancé defended me, but I told him to drop it because, well, the Filipinos in HK are mainly what she mentioned, besides maids, but she didn't really care about them because they didn't cause trouble. I guess I'll have to impress my future mother-in-law when I get there.

I hate how his mother was right to some extent. I hate that there's just too many of us Filipinos in her country giving us a bad name, that even if we're not one of them, we're lumped into the same category. I hate how it's difficult to change their mindset because we aren't exactly going to stop being prostitutes or mail order brides in the near future, aren't we?

My mom's family is doing well, but we have been victimised by fellow Filipinos in the past. Mom's grandfather, a Spanish man, was killed by his second wife, a Filipino woman he married years after he finally got over the death of his first wife, mom's Filipino grandmother. Turns out this new wife was a gold digging bitch, stole all his hard earned money, killed him, left my grandfather and his siblings orphans, with nothing to their name. I don't know what happened to her but I don't care anymore, except I hope she died a horrible death. The grandfather and siblings turned out okay despite what happened. 

I also have an uncle from mom's side, also a widower, who immigrated to a European country years ago with his wife and became citizens of that country. He just got out of a relationship with a lady who, according to everyone except for him, was only in it for his money (successful businessman) so she could leave the Philippines. Like bloody fucking hell, thank goodness he got out of that one, he could have ended up like our ancestor. 

I really, really want the Philippines to change for the better, but living here for how many years, I can't see that happening anytime soon. My dad's home country is supposedly less developed than the Philippines, but at least their attitudes are on the right track. The women there usually marry locals because they go for principles and religion, not how white one person looks. They may have crushes on Hollywood actors and actresses, and gush over the half white celebrities in that country, but they just leave it at admiration and don't latch themselves to the closest white guy. I question their taste in makeup, but they don't hide their ethnicities with layers of contour and bleached hair, which I see here every single day. They don't actively sit around malls and bars waiting for a white guy who can fall in love with them, or at least become a sperm donor so they can have their own ""halfie"" kids. They don't get foreign language classes so they can be sold as mail order brides and end up being killed by their foreign husbands. To be completely honest, I'm fed up with being a Filipino, because as much as I want to see this country improve, I know my efforts would be useless. The best I can probably do is impress my fiancé's mother. 

I'm sorry for the long rant, and if the admins decide that this is too much or too racist, please don't hesitate to take it down.

We will not get laid / females either way so why bother crying about it all day. How about focusing on one goal and pursuing it instead ? 

I have no friends, no people to talk to and everybody in Uni simply ignores me. Do you think I cry about that all day ? The rage consumes me daily and ignites my flame to trash all those degenerates. My parents are useless trash as well. 

In total I maybe have 5 acquaintances I can talk to. Now let me tell you something. Even though I only have these 5 people I can rely on, I still manage to use them to the fullest. One of them is going into Investment Banking, he will recommend me for the spring internship programme next year. I met him more than a year ago at a summer school, we had a memorable time together and now he, as a simple aqcuaintance, is going to help me.

Another person I have never met personally helped me with my application to the UK. Even though we never met he still was willing to help me (maybe it was because it was for the better that we never met). 

Now the next project commences. I am opening a volunteering service to help foregin (esp. russian) children with their homework. This will be my first major project to put onto my CV to get into Goldman Sachs. It will include me raising funds, recruiting and helping foreign children to cope with school and homework. Guess what ? Nobody helped me with this idea, again, all hard work alone. 


Stop looking for excuses you mongoloid retards. Just start doing something to distract yourself from the pain we have to experience. Do something for yourself and not others. Remember, most of the people around you are tiny pieces of trash. The hardest part about it is recognizing that you are different and are actually able to start something on your own, without anyone`s help, unlike the majority of those mongoloid low IQ trash normies.

The Department of Justice is investigating Bob Menendez, United States Senator of New Jersey and close Hillary Clinton associate, for claims that he engaged in illicit activities with underage girls in the Dominican Republic. As part of the same Department of Justice case, Menendez is currently undergoing investigation for assisting Salomon Melgen in procuring visas for Melgen's young sexual mistresses: http://archive.is/dnvP7

In a separate, but possibly related incident, one of Menendez's interns was an illegal immigrant and wanted sex offender: http://archive.is/2Lexd

Bob Menendez is the senior United States Senator from the State of New Jersey and a member of the Democratic Party. First appointed to the U.S. Senate in January 2006, he was later elected Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in January 2013. In 2015, he was also ranked #1 on The Hudson Reporter's annual Power List of the ""Fifty Most Powerful Political Figures in Hudson County"".

On April 1, 2015, Menendez was officially indicted on federal corruption charges in the United States District Court, related to alleged favors he did for Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen and gifts he received from him, including campaign donations and private flights. Melgen was charged as well. Menendez has pleaded not guilty to all charges: http://archive.is/2Lexd

""In further bad news for Menendez, the DOJ says the senator’s trip to the Dominican Republic was “during time frames in which one unidentified alleged minor victim specifically claimed to have had sex with him.”"" http://archive.is/ZaiTS#selection-1833.0-1833.210

Furthermore, Bob Menendez has connections Hillary Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein, and even was trafficking children from the Dominican Republic during the same time period Laura Silsby was attempting to take children to the Dominican Republic without permits."

I have a scholarship that covers 3 years, which combined with FAFSA, should cover my tuition fully

So I'm currently a history major, with a degree plan that leads to a PhD in 7 years. My school offers paid internships for being a TA, and stuff
I'm also interested in economics, and as a bi-product, it's also profitable. A job as an analyst could help me fund my post-grad studies while also working; and it would definitely help me be a much better historian.

So I'd want to see the possibility of double-majoring. With summer classes at my local community college for cheap, and it could help me start as a junior next year, credit-wise. I just want to pay as little as possible and get out of school as fast as I can, to take advantage of my scholarship.

I just need opinions, tips, any insight would be helpful. Thanks!"

She checked me and said my cervix was still closed. She made it sound like I would still be waiting a while, and that we could discuss induction at my 40 week appointment. 

Friday, Jan 27 - I woke up at about 4:30 in the morning with mild period-like cramps. I thought maybe they were Braxton Hicks so I tried to ignore them. When I got up to go to the bathroom, I felt a small gush of liquid. I couldn't figure out if it was my water breaking or if i just peed myself. So i woke up hubby, took a shower, packed my bag, and we went to the hospital. 

I was checked by a resident and advised that my water had NOT broken. We were sent home where I continued to have these ""cramps"" all day long. Going for walks and taking baths helped until about 6:00 when they started getting REALLY painful. They were about 3 minutes apart but only lasted 30 seconds each. I didn't want to risk being sent home again, so I just writhed in pain at home. This was the worst part... I could barely breathe through them and some got bad enough that I ended up puking. 

At 11:00 we arrived back to the hospital. A different resident checked me and told me that I was 5 cm (!!) and could get an epidural anytime. The anesthesiologist came in around 12:30. It took him like 20 minutes to give me the epidural. It was virtually painless compared to the contractions. It took another half hour for it to actually kick in..but once it did, it was AWESOME. I was checked again at 2:00 and was already at 9 cm.  I tried to get some much needed sleep, but the nurse kept bugging me (taking blood pressure, adjusting monitors)

Finally at 6:00 the on-call doctor, resident, and intern arrived and starting setting things up. At 6:30 I started pushing. I honestly didn't feel an ""urge"" to push but I did anyways. Around 7:00 I was told that babies heart rate was slowing down. They wanted to try using the vacuum. This part was slightly unpleasant. I couldn't see anything (obviously) but I felt and heard the suction. They tried this twice, and the vacuum sounded like it was popping off poor baby's head. So then they decided to try forceps. The doctors all started yelling at me ""you have to push!"" (like what do you think I'm doing here lady?) This was the scariest part. I was so worried about baby. Even my husband looked terrified. 

THEN, at 7:25 on Saturday, January 28 they put a screaming, cone-headed baby girl on my chest. My husband was tearing up but I was just staring at him in shock. He cut the cord and we counted all her little fingers and toes. It has been one week since we had her and she has been a complete joy (most of the time). We're still getting used to each other, and she doesn't let us get a lot of sleep at night..but we are really enjoying her. 

I may be biased, but she is probably [the most beautiful baby ever.](http://imgur.com/rQ6o8MZ)"

5s6dc3,13,2017-02-05,New carry gun help,Whu_am_i,CCW,https://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/5s6dc3/new_carry_gun_help/,"So I'm looking for another carry gun to partner with my P30SK, since I just sold my glock 22. However, I'm at a dead end. My options are:

Shield 9mm $300

Shield 45 $400

Glock 26 ~$450

Glock 43 ~$450

Glock 19 ~$500

Walther pps m2 ~$400

Now I automatically go to the shield because of how well regarded it is around here and the price (I'm a poor college student in an unpaid internship). I originally wanted something thinner and lighter than my HK because it can become a little hard to hide and cumbersome over time. However, all of these are thinner and most are lighter. However, after holding the shield I'm second guessing myself. It seems comfortable enough but the width and trigger is holding me back. I'm just not sure on it, it just seems like I can't get a good purchase. 

So that made me lean towards the 26 or 19. However the width is getting closer to that of my HK. And the 19 would be heavier. 

I haven't been able to hold the Walther just because I can't find it near me so that doesn't help. 

I'm not sure if I'm just being too nit picky here or if the ""perfect"" carry gun for me just isn't out there or what. 

Should I settle for the shield and just try to get used to how thin it is and eventually upgrade the trigger? Or blindly buy another gun? 

Any help would be extremely appreciated"

I am a South African with a BSC degree in Computer Sciences and I have been offered an Internship opportunity in Berlin, however I have a few questions:

1. My fiance and I are only getting Married in September this year, is it possible for her to come with me under Family reunification?

2. For my Visa I am required to have proof of accommodation, can I use Airbnb to rent a room for a month and use that as my proof of accommodation while I find a more long term place?

Please feel free to share any experiences you have had as a person from a non-EU country, whereby you needed the visa first before going over.

I've been applying to internships and jobs for over 2 years and never got a single offer. In fact, 90% of companies didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I didn't get the job, they just continued on with their lives and ignored my follow-up emails. They all forgot they ever interviewed me. 

I have lost what little confidence I had in myself. My resume could have been 100x better. Any interview I get immediately seems like someone in HR made a mistake by thinking I might be a good fit for the position, and that feeling is proven true when I am inevitably ignored following the interview(s).

My student loans start accruing interest in 5 months. My chances of getting an entry level job in my industry are gone in 7 months. If I don't have a job by then, I fear what I will do under the crushing weight that is 4 years of wasted time and money. 

I know getting a job won't cure me, but it will at least keep me going. It seems that my depression is keeping me from being a likeable, hardworking candidate that people want to hire."
5s73cc,3,2017-02-05,Being dumped has made my body dysmorphia and depression worse. Feeling hopeless.,almac26,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5s73cc/being_dumped_has_made_my_body_dysmorphia_and/,"Hi all, sorry for the length, but I could really use some advice. 


I met a woman this time last year at university. I was 26, she was 23. She was/is incredible- extremely beautiful, very intelligent, very caring. We fell completely in love with one another over the course of last summer. 


We both did master's in development studies, she had a job lined up in Liberia come September once we graduated. After our summer together we agreed that I would go with her, try and find a job and make it work out there. We visited her dad in the States before we left, everything was perfect. 


Essentially it all fell apart in Liberia. We began arguing constantly (we never argued in London), me not having a job rocked my confidence in a place where all the expats had a decent job, and living together was extremely tough. I felt she became distant, I became overly concerned about her still finding me attractive (I have a history of BDD and depression), started pushing her away and ultimately she dumped me in mid-November, 6 weeks after I had arrived. It was the most intense pain, shock and sadness I've ever felt. I flew to Ghana for a month (I suppose to try to hold onto hopes that we could get back together), we spoke once in that time where I explored the idea of getting back together, she said she couldn't do that right now but ""didn't want to lose me from her life"". I went completely no contact.


To cut a long story short, I arrived back in London in mid-December, completely and utterly heartbroken. But it got worse- on Christmas eve I broke my nose playing football. For many this wouldn't be a huge deal, but I have a history of BDD almost solely focused on my nose. I had come to a place of relative peace about my nose before this, but this completely knocked me back to square one. It's a little bit more crooked, and I'm completely obsessive about it- its hugely triggered my BDD- I feel hideous. 


So now I'm back in cold/grey London, doing an unpaid internship, with a broken nose and spiraling BDD. I'm taking anti-depressents for the first time in my life, which are helping somewhat. My therapist helps too, but I still feel completely broken and its been 3 months since we broke up. She is back in Liberia, in this tropical paradise, with new people (including plenty of young attractive guys), a good job and an exciting new life. I'm SO sad about losing someone I thought was the love of my life, and mourning the loss of this new life I had abroad. I feel un-loveable because of my new nose, and scared I will never meet anyone again (or feel good enough about myself/my nose to be vulnerable with someone again). I feel like objectively my life is pretty terrible in comparison to hers right now. 


I've deleted/blocked her on facebook, but she wished me happy birthday 5 days ago via email, which only made me long for her more. I crumbled and looked at mutual friends instagrams this afternoon and saw a few pictures of her having fun which triggered intense anxiety in me. 


Can anyone offer some words of solace? Similar experiences happened to them that they got through? I genuinely feel at my lowest ebb in my life (except for maybe when I first broke my nose), is this normal after 3 months breaking up? I'm considering getting a nose job too. If I'm honest I'm still completely in love with her, and feel hopeless about my prospects of ever finding anyone that comes close to her. I'll take all the love, tips and guidance I can take right now. 


Thank you so much in advance, your pal Al. "

- Spending the first 2 hours of each day checking emails, first by declining Clive's 4th attempt at requesting the 12th of the month off. 

- Liaising with co manager Widow on the overdue gauntlet project (for the 12th time) and getting nowhere in the process. 

- Having to deal with Sombras shit every time the network goes down because he's been too stingey when it comes to IT spending. 

- Constantly having to remind Deborah, the intern, that he has sweetener in his tea, not sugar.

- The paperwork; just endless invoices for shotguns. 

- Reporting to Superintendent Doomfist to be berrated for his overdue project. 

- Meetings with the Talon Hired Goons Union with regards to the lack of lockers in the changing room...again.

- Arguing with Widow for not declining enough overtime. 

- Pretending to look busy behind his computer whilst Facebook stalking ex Overwatch agents."

Dl. Sorin Mihai Grindeanu: Bună seara!

Avem ordinea de zi de astăzi începând cu Proiectul Legii bugetului de stat pe anul 2017, Proiectul Legii bugetului asigurărilor sociale de stat pe anul 2017, Proiectul de lege pentru aprobarea plafoanelor unor indicatori specificaţi în cadrul fiscal-bugetar pe anul 2017. Strategia fiscal-bugetară pentru perioada 2017-2019.

Dacă mai sunt alte ... da, domnule ministru.

Dl. Alexandru-Răzvan Cuc: Domnule prim-ministru, vă rog să fiţi de acord să introducem astăzi pe ordinea de zi Proiectul de Hotărâre de guvern pentru aprobarea Normelor metodologice privind acordarea facilităţilor de transport intern feroviar cu metroul pentru elevi şi studenţi ca urmare a prevederilor Ordonanţei de Urgenţă nr.2 din 2017.

Dl. Sorin Mihai Grindeanu: Bine.

Aveţi toate avizele?

Dl. Alexandru-Răzvan Cuc

Da, au fost preluate toate avizele şi observaţiile şi de la Justiţie şi de la Finanţe şi Consiliul Legislativ.

(pct.I.1 pe Ordinea de zi)

Dl. Sorin Mihai Grindeanu

Primul punct.

Proiectul Legii bugetului de stat pe anul 2017, sunt toate avizele, cred.

Dl. Viorel Ştefan 

Domnule prim-ministru, sunt toate avizele. Mai fac precizarea că prin dimensionarea bugetului şi aritmetica bugetară a făcut ca unele din limitele aprobate să varieze în plus sau în minus prin adoptarea proiectului de lege astăzi, aceste limite devin definitive în construcţia bugetară.

În regulă.

Dacă sunt discuţii?

Dacă nu, adoptat.

Dl. Sorin Mihai Grindeanu

În paranteză, fie spus, azi a avut loc şi şedinţa CSAT, s-a primit şi avizul favorabil de la CSAT şi nu, nu e adevărat şi spun lucrul ăsta pe bandă, ca să rămână, nici eu, nici domnul ministru al finanţelor nu am semnat vreun angajament, cum că trebuie să facem ceva la rectificare. Sigur, sigur atâta timp cât instituţiile pot funcţiona în limitele pe care le-am dat e una, în momentul în care nu mai pot funcţiona este cu totul altceva.

Dar nu există niciun angajament scris că am văzut tot felul de lucruri de tipul acesta şi vroiam să clarific aceste chestiuni.

(pct.1 pe Ordinea de zi suplimentară)

Dl. Sorin Mihai Grindeanu

Domnule ministru, vă rog.

Dl. Alexandru-Răzvan Cuc

Mulţumesc, domnule prim-ministru.

Foarte scurt, urmare aprobării OUG nr.2 din 2017 privind unele măsuri fiscal-bugetare, precum şi modificarea şi completarea unor acte normative prin care au fost aduse completări la Legea nr.1 din 2011 a educaţiei naţionale, în sensul acordării unor facilităţi suplimentare studenţilor, respectiv gratuitatea la transporturi intern feroviar la toate categoriile de trenuri clasa a doua, s-a elaborat actualul proiect de hotărâre a Guvernului pentru aprobarea Normelor metodologice privind acordarea facilităţilor de transport intern feroviar şi cu metroul pentru elevi şi studenţi.

         Pe scurt, actul normativ stabileşte următoarele aspecte:

         - rangul de tren şi clasa la care se acordă reducerea de transport;

         - modalitatea de decontare a contravalorii călătoriilor efectuate de către elevi şi studenţi;

         - acordarea gratuităţii la transportul pentru elevii orfani şi studenţii cu cerinţe educaţionale speciale precum şi cei pentru care s-a stabilit o măsură de protecţie specială;

         - diversificarea ofertei tarifare a operatorului de transport cu metroul pentru elevii şi studenţii, acesta incluzând pe lângă abonamentul lunar cu reducere de 50% şi restul de titluri de transport.

         Categoriile pentru care se aplică ştiţi foarte bine, au fost enunţate şi în Ordonanţa 2.

         Au fost obţinute avizele şi au fost preluate observaţiile.

         Mulţumesc.

5s7woj,13,2017-02-05,[Advice] Joined a tech repair shop as a technician. Would like some tips,nilekada,computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/5s7woj/advice_joined_a_tech_repair_shop_as_a_technician/,"Hello fellow techies. Like it says in the post, I would like some tips on what to do as a new technician at a tech repair shop. We mostly deal in used laptops and doing repair work for clients on desktop computers, laptops, projectors and their associated accessories. I graduated two years ago with a degree that focused on networking and sysadmin stuff with a bit of programming thrown in. This is my first job out of college. Previously I'd worked tech support at a large-ish organization as an intern and as cover for someone who was on leave for two weeks. I'm not unfamiliar with laptop and computer components, but I haven't been taking apart computers very often. I've been watching Mike Meyers' CompTIA A+ series to refresh my knowledge and reading the corresponding book (the videos are far more interesting than the book IMHO). I'm a week into the new job and so far it's been clearing out repair jobs, doing preliminary testing as directed by the head technician, receiving new repair jobs and handing out receipts etc. 

Here are a few questions I have, though you can feel free to add more advice outside their scope. 

* How often I should update my ISO collection. The list given in the sidebar is exhaustive and I wanted to know when to update them. Like every few major versions or so? 

* What the ideal amount of time to spend working at a tech shop? 
I enjoy the technical work and opening up the computers etc, but it seems to be a high pressure job. And I'd like to move on to eventually become a DevOps Engineer or a Software Engineer. Where I live, not enough Sysadmin or Network Engineer jobs are around. 

* How often should I update the application installers I use for clients? 
At the moment we do a lot of Windows 7 and 10 installations. Haven't come across a box on which we did a Win 8 install. Also how do you guys keep track of what driver software you need and where to get it from? A lot of the time, our clients don't have the driver CD that came with their computer and so it's up to us to install drivers for them. And our Internet runs at 240kbps. :(

* How do you have multiple installable ISOs on a bootable USB? 

Thanks in advance for your answers. 

EDIT: one more thing that I forgot to add. I'm on the skinny side of things (50 - 53kgs) and that means I tend to have trouble dealing with certain screws which require using quite a bit of energy to get out. Usually I call a colleague or our head technician to help me out with those. Is that a good long-term solution or does that mean I'm not cut out for being a computer tech? I have a bit of impostor syndrome when it comes to this, otherwise I know the knowledge will come with time and experience.  "
5s814i,6,2017-02-05,"[WP] You work for NASA and one day receive a transmission from a man saying he is ready to return from his Mars mission, despite no man ever being sent there so far.",rarelyfunny,rarelyfunny,https://www.reddit.com/r/rarelyfunny/comments/5s814i/wp_you_work_for_nasa_and_one_day_receive_a/,"Director Alisha Steffords felt a sharp disquiet hollowing out the bottom of her stomach as the debriefing went on. It didn’t help that NASA Control Room A was already a hive of directionless activity when she first answered the urgent summons from her subordinates.

“Get another team to review all the transmissions,” Alisa said, eyes darting between the printouts laid out neatly on the control panel. “We have to eliminate human error first before we continue.”

“We’ve told you, three separate teams have already done so,” came the curt response from Varnen Bianchi, an esteemed engineer who was already advising launch missions when Alisha first joined as an intern. “Their conclusions are that the transmissions are indeed genuine. We are receiving live comms, point of origin, Mars.”

As if the underscore his point, at that moment yet another transmission lazily scrolled across the giant monitor panels in Control Room A. The timelog running at a corner of the screens indicated this transmission was barely a couple of minutes old.

“Fine. What about authentication of the transmission codes?”

“I ran those already,” said Jason Rutriger, the newest addition to the team who had already proven his worth many times over as an insightful data analyst. “The codes check out. These transmissions are not rogue signals from Roscosmos or the CNSA. They are being issued from genuine NASA equipment.”

Alisha closed her eyes briefly, already recognising the signs of a magnificent headache on its way. “Well, I’ve pored through our archives and checked with the White House. There is no record ever of us ever sending any manned missions to Mars, despite what the transmissions say. It will be years before we are even capable of doing so.”

A note of impatience entered Varnen’s voice as he pointed at the screens. “Then please, Director, how do we explain that?”

Alisha nudged the audio broadcast volume up, and as the urgent missive in the transmission rolled around Control Room A, a lingering sense of unease began to settle in.

“… *brrzt*… this is… I repeat… this is Maven, and I am leaving Mars in… I will be returning to Earth in approximately ten… please acknowledge to confirm you will be ready to receive… at the Indian Ocean, location coordinates 443458… this is Maven, returning from 4 years’ active duty in the field… this is Maven… this is Maven… returning...”

The transmission ended, and for a couple of moments blissful silence reigned. Finally, Alisha spoke, putting into words what Varnen and Jason were dreading to hear. 

“Well then. Only two possibilities present themselves now. One, this is an elaborate hoax... and two, given that the only record of “Maven” in our archives is the unmanned space probe we launched 4 years ago, we have somehow been receiving detailed transmissions from a rudimentary AI which appears to have developed significantly during its time on Mars.”

“Director,” said Varnen, grimly, “do we prepare the welcoming party, or the missiles?”

A shadow of an enigmatic smile touched Alisha’s lips as she shrugged.

“We’re NASA, aren’t we? We prepare both. I don’t know which the President will choose, but either way we will damned well reveal the unknown, and we will damned well benefit all humankind.”

Me [M24] and my partner [F25] are both in grad school, so its pretty hectic. She is pretty much at work 7 days a week because of her internship (no classes, just internship left, and works on the side) and is really busy. Me on the other hand I have classes as well but I have my own schedule, and I'm a TA. Whenever she gets back from work she wants to do fun stuff like watch TV and just spend time together (which I do, happily), but I almost always should be spending the time studying instead of watching TV. What normally ends up happening is that this takes a lot more time than it should and it ends up with me getting very little to no work done. Which gets costly, pretty quickly.


The problem arises whenever I say no to spending time with her. This time, she got off work much earlier than expected and got to come home to spend time with me. Second she walks in, I drop everything and spend time with her, no problems. After an hour she tells me we should watch tv and I tell her ""I can't because I need to study, because I have barely studied at all"". She gets really upset and we start fighting all over like we normally do (which can get pretty nasty). It's not as bad as it sounds though. 


She gets so wrapped up in how I hurt her feelings that she doesn't understand that I have spent most of my free time with her and this one time I need time for myself to study, she thinks that I am being inconsiderate, our affection levels are different, I was being rude when I said it, I'm nice to other girls and not her (only a few times compared to being nice to her, but that doesn't count apparently), etc. And she compares that she has been working the whole day and all I've done is go see a friend (for the first time ever) and play video games (I also did some school work, get groceries and did some picking up around the house).


For me, I need to be spending more time doing school work because I am a horrible student and I was really really lucky to be accepted into graduate school. She on the other hand has always done well in school, 3.98 in her undergrad (me not even breaking 3.0) and thinks that I do't even have to read the textbooks to pass the class.


The reason why I end up this way is because I get that sense that saying no to her almost always results in a fight. Her justification is that whenever she gets upset I should apologize to her for saying something mean, and saying no to her obviously hurts her feelings, even though sometimes I feel it needs to be said (i.e. she needs to study instead of cuddling, she should be more aware of how she washes dishes or puts coffee grounds, because she makes a mess). And more often than not it ends up with her getting mad at me, and it is almost always because of something I am doing wrong, or me saying it wrong, even when I am being as nice, or so I thought.


What is the problem here and what would be the best solution? Breaking up is not the solution, because I know we'll get over this but to prevent blowouts like this in the future what would be the best thing to do? Looking for options that you and/or your partner have tried.


TL;DR she wants to spend more time together after getting off work earlier than usual, I spend some time with her and when she wants to spend more time together I tell her I cant because of what I feel to be valid reasons, she gets super upset at me. She thinks I am being selfish and inconsiderate, and this happens a lot. What is a good solution?"
5s8rn8,8,2017-02-05,Starting to realize I got a problem,s_ilentium,shoppingaddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/5s8rn8/starting_to_realize_i_got_a_problem/,"Hey there. Today's the day. I got to realize I have a problem with spending money on things I don't need nor even really want. I don't know too much about this whole topic, but I think it's quite normal to deny at the beginning. But some day comes the point you have to realize. 

I found out as I thought about how I will finance my apprenticeship I wanted to start this summer and for which I have to do an internship before, connected with a move to my boyfriend. He isn't flush at the moment. To be honest, he is searching for a job and has loads of debts. 

It isn't as if I had no saved money (thanks to my parents), so there would be enough for emergency theoretically. It's even not that little. But I just can't handle it. 
Whenever I got some cash or my monthly wage arrives, I have to spend it. 
I tried to collect all receipts and write them down in a book called ""Kakebo"", but I forget it. I've tried different apps, even the ones that cost (how ironically lol), but I'm afraid to use them. I'm so afraid to see how much I spend on useless stuff. Cause I could be disappointed. I could come to hate myself.

But this is honestly the last thing I want. I had this, low self-esteem, all the hate, all the disappointment. The point is I was mentally ill. (I still am, but there's no valid comparison to before I went to the clinics and received treatment and medical aid.) I was a shy and calm  kid, then my dad died out of  nowhere when I was eight and 
I've been a retiring person ever since. When I was twelve I finally realized and planned my suicide for my 16th birthday (which it wouldn't come to, at least not the exact day I calculated). But something changed and my inner me saw I just wanted to live for both of us (as he was only 39 when he died). And I begann wanting to improve myself, which isn't the worst idea at first sight. But I exaggerated as I mostly do. Started with eating disorders in all of their possibilities, then doing drugs (amphetamines mainly, cause they're the best thing you get when desiring to lose weight, aren't they?) and as if I didn't yet spent enough money on food supplements, sport courses and my ""happy pills""(that would strengthen my paranoia and effect psychotic episodes), I wanted more. I wanted to be better. Wanted to live life to it's fullest. Wanted to learn everything that interested me (due to the fact I abandoned school at age of 16 and with lower grades I could've had, I suppose), wanted to improve my skills on basically everything. I wanted to learn playing the piano (my father was an enthusiastic player), wanted to learn Swedish to do a canoe/tent trip over there (just as he did in his youth), then felt guilty about my mother and wanted to copy her all the same. But nevertheless I wanted to become a strong, independent young woman, I didnt want to lose myself in all of this. So I needed some hobbies, right? Stuff for those hobbies. Money to pay my ballet classes and my riding lessons. Money to buy clothes that were at least as fancy as the ones of those girls around my school (or when I didn't go there anymore, I compared with the perfectionists on the wide world web). 
It was so exhausting. So disappointing to never be good enough. To know I could be better and make my dead father proud, or at least me. 
I slipped into depression. I also may have been maniac from time to time. But that's the past. I'm not depressed anymore. I can figure out when losing my mind on negative thoughts. I don't do drugs anymore since my rehab. I eat normal. It could be the perfection I always seeked for.

If there wasn't this f*cked up money problem. The only thing that hasn't  almost changed at all. I still think I need things over things to be worthy. I think I could find the time someday to do all of the things I thought were important to live a fulfilled life. On the other side it gives me a feeling of safety. 

I just don't know what to do. Or if anybody feels the same, has comparable reasons to buy buy buy. 
I just want to get an overview without  hating myself, so I could eventually be able to change my habits. That's the most important thing I should ""improve"" - my ability to spent money in consciousness. Will you give me some tips? I would really appreciate. And please excuse my English, it's not my first language and I hope it's understandable. If not, please ask.

Thank you very much for taking time and reading."

5s8xgb,1,2017-02-05,"Underemployed, should I just quit?",blueskiddoo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5s8xgb/underemployed_should_i_just_quit/,"Quick background: I graduated with an engineering degree in 2015. I got an engineering internship for 6 months, but they weren't hiring when my internship ended. I job hunted for 4.5 months, until I decided to take a minimum wage technician position just to pay rent. When I interviewed I was told I would start at 14/hr, but after a three month probation period my pay would increase to 16/hr. However that was two months ago and I still don't have a raise. Additionally, due to mismanagement, all production workers are expected to work 14 hours of overtime a week for a seemingly indefinite period. So here is my question: I intended to be job hunting while working here to find myself an engineering position, but with all the overtime I just don't have the time to spend applying that I'd like. I'm pretty mad about the lack of a raise, and just the general shitty attitude from the management to all their workers. Would it look awful to recruiters and hiring managers if I quit and found something else part time? Or I've been looking into freelancing, something some friends have been doing quite successfully. Regardless of what I do afterwards, how do I explain quitting? Is it acceptable to quit because they won't pay me more? I'm really hating working there, and life in general, and I feel like I would be much happier doing basically anything else.

More info: I've been working there for six months now.

This is my sixth job held overall, and I've worked difficult manual labor and jobs with long weird hours, so it's not that I'm new to hard work, it's just the crap attitude that pervades the entire company.

I took the job partially because I needed money, partially because I felt it was slightly relevant to my career and would look better than say being a barista. When I was interviewed my engineering background was brought up, and I was told that after I had some experience building I could move into an engineering position. But I was blown off multiple times trying to bring that up, and last week they hired an engineer, so it looks like that's out now. 

I have brought up the raise to managers like 6 times now, and they keep telling me ""it's in the works be patient"". I feel like two months and 40ish hours of overtime if increased pay lost is enough to stop being patient over.

Thanks for any and all advice!"
5sa0s8,1,2017-02-05,CALLING ALL AUDITORS: Industry of Choice?,BTHOvapes,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5sa0s8/calling_all_auditors_industry_of_choice/,"I know this question has probably been asked about a thousand times, but I could really use some advice specific to my situation. I am wrapping up my internship with a Big 4 in Houston, Texas and have been informed that I will need to state an industry preference within the next few weeks. Unfortunately, I really don't feel like I've had enough time to figure out which one I like best, and I can tell that the people in each industry are trying to sugar-coat and sell me on their respective teams. What does your experience say about the different industries?

Here's my specific situation:

My main options seem to be Oil &amp; Gas or Financial Services. I'm also interested in Healthcare and Aerospace &amp; Defense, but know that those are little less feasible.

Financial Services - I have gotten along with the people and the teams here best and have made a lot of strong connections and established a few unofficial mentors. Overall, this is where ""the people"" have been best. BUT finance has never been my strong-suit from a technical perspective and I am worried about long term performance. I have also heard that Financial Services works longer hours year-round, has a high burnout rate, and that it has very limited and often lower paying exit opportunities down the road. Is this true?

Oil &amp; Gas - It's Houston, so energy is obviously a huge part of our market, with lots of opportunities. I haven't made very strong connections here from a people perspective, but I've had the most experience working in this area and feel the most technically sound with my ability to perform. From what I've been told, the busy seasons here are much worse than in Financial Services, but outside of busy season things are pretty much 9-5, and there are plenty of exit opportunities down the road. However, as recent conditions have proven, the oil market can make this a volatile and risky industry to place your employment prospects. Any perspectives on this?

Lastly, I've always been interested in Healthcare and Aerospace &amp; Defense, but have no experience in either. Is A&amp;D even something I can expect to move into or is that too much of a niche, especially in Houston? Also I've been told Healthcare is awful and that I should throw it out as a possibility even if Houston has a strong healthcare industry. Any opinions on these two?

I appreciate any information. Thanks!"
5saklh,2,2017-02-05,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5saklh/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I met her when she was 16 and I was 18. I love her so much.

I've been with her since then and I've honestly never met anyone like her in my life. I don't want to spew some, ""she's mature for her age"" cliché, but she is, and she's extremely insightful and smart and thinks about things in a way that most people her age wouldn't. She has hung out with my friends and I, and they all love her and think that she's really cool. 

She is not in high school. She graduated early around this time last year. She landed a rare internship opportunity and is doing great. We have grown a lot since we've met each other. We've learned a lot about each other and ourselves and have always been there for one another. We communicate, we take responsibility for things, we help each other when needed, etc.

We've actually talked about our age-gap and she told me that she used to be in a relationship with someone who was 5 years older than her (she was 14 at the time) and she never wants to return to that dynamic again as it caused her a lot of disgust.

I'm just asking this because I have seen people on here mention how gross this is. I would not date anyone younger than her and she told me that she wouldn't date anyone older than me. The only thing that sucks that has to do with age is the fact that she can't legally drink, but it doesn't affect us since she drinks anyway and where we live is also kind of a college campus area so it's fairly easy to get into bars with no ID. 

I just feel like we are equal on all levels and I love her to death.

5sccw8,2,2017-02-06,I'm [23F] about to move in with my boyfriend [21M] but he's leaving next year,idekatthispoint,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5sccw8/im_23f_about_to_move_in_with_my_boyfriend_21m_but/,"Okay so let me try to lay this out as succinctly as possible.


My bf, Sam, and I have been together for about 3.5 years now. We're moving in together next week with our dog. Our relationship has been pretty great, with a few ups and downs, but we're very in love. He's my best friend, we have tons of fun together, great sex, and ideally we'll spend the rest of our lives together. But obviously, there's this issue.


In August of 2015, Sam moved back to his home city for an internship. His home city is near the west coast of the U.S., and I'm directly on the east coast. The backstory is that when he was 14, his family moved to our east coast city when his dad got a new job. I feel that he has always pined for his west coast home city, since he was taken away right as he became close with a group of friends (his parents were pretty strict at this point, so that was a big deal). So in 2015 he moved back and pretty immediately reconnected with this group of friends. He had only stayed in touch with a couple guys, who I knew, but not this particular group. The group was especially large, like 30 dudes, plus girlfriends (and their friends). I'm not going to really get into it, but the gist is that these guys had established a really tight system, and basically referred to each other as family. My boyfriend was immediately welcomed into the fold.


In April of 2016, Sam came home. Again not going to get into the weeds, but Sam wanted to stay in west coast Home City, while I wanted him to come back east, and eventually he ended up agreeing to come east (a couple months late, as he had originally planned to only stay 6 months). He seemed fine with this decision at the time, although a bit sad to leave his new (old?) friends.


So now the situation is...weird I guess. Background on myself: I recently went back to community college, which I graduated. I'm now at a university where I get a full ride, and it has been established that 1. I was going to go this university eventually, and inevitably and 2. that this was the singular university where I would get my tuition waived, since before my relationship with Sam even began. Although obviously this has become more ""real"" in the past year-ish. Honestly, I was originally under the impression that Sam was coming home from his internship for good, and we would move to his Home City afterwards. Then I was under the impression that he would stay out east until my last semester at school, and he would move out west to his Home City, with me following when I graduated. And now, it seems, his plan is to live where we are now for a year (maybe 1.5 years, depending on the circumstances (according to him)) and then he'll move out west No Matter What. I'll follow when I graduate, which is projected for Fall 2019 at the earliest.


I feel...off. I fee like he keeps reassuring me not to worry, everything will be fine, we'll figure it out when the time comes....and then he just does what he wants. I.E...He probably wasn't even going to do the internship, he probably wasn't even going to hang out with his old friends, he probably wasn't even going to stay longer than 6 months...And he keeps putting me off! Stop worrying about it, we'll figure it out when it's closer, etc.


So my issues. I'm upset that the narrative keeps changing, or is impossible to pin down. He says he'll have to wait and see what jobs are available/which friends are available to be roommates. But I'll also have to find roommates/a place to stay in our current city, so I kinda need to know! And that's not even getting into my issues with his friends (potential roommates)...I've had some issues with a couple of them in the past. But how can I screen roommates when I won't even be moving out there for a couple years after he goes out? So much can happen in that time..


I guess my questions are, what is appropriate to bring up at this point? What should I be worried about, when my fears are so far away? Any of it? I don't want to just ignore everything, though it's so far off, but at the same time I don't want to get ahead of myself.


tl;dr: Moving in with my boyfriend this week, but he has plans to move across the country after our lease, while I'm still in school. What are appropriate questions/conversation topics, and when should I stop worrying bc it's too soon?"

5sctib,2,2017-02-06,relationship advice: 25yr old camgirl with boyfriend that used to be bad but is now doting,softkittyhappykitty,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5sctib/relationship_advice_25yr_old_camgirl_with/,"background: my boyfriend suggested camming to pay off school bills. I ended up trying it 3 months ago. I do shows but he talks (skype kik, even chats during shows) pretending to be me because I'm shy and apparently boring. when guys ""Cam2cam"" he watches them, turns off sound, and tells me to comment on some detail to be engaged without me seeing. Its not a form of control, its me respecting him. if you dont know, camgirls get on the internet and do masturbation shows. I use a mask to hid most my face. He suggested bringing a girl on as a guest to do a lesbian show, I was hesitant but agreed for the money. He took control of posting adds and creating dating accounts to find a fling but I got upset that he was looking at so many nekkid pics of girls and so the idea died. A month later we started looking again/rekindle with previous candidates, but he was told to not browse through dirty snapchats of these girls. But he sent me some naked pics of them and I had to remind him that he promised not to be snapchatting girls (even if it is for work). I believe he is faithful, but think he may enjoy the pics. Im seriously reconsidering a relationship with someone like him, but now Im a camgirl and no one i would want will want me (not to insult fellow camgirls). this recent blunder of his is making me rethink our relationship, which  I often do. I used to be the perfect potential wife--educated, virginal, good breeding, genuinely sweet, self-sacrificial-- and his influence has been damning as you can see b my job.

I come from a conservative family and he was my first kiss at 21. we met in college when i was super devastated from a personal tragedy. Once we started dating he sexually harassed me and physically pushed the boundaries to rape, at the least it was nonconsent (ask to stop/no, continues fucking on a few occasions). it was a bad part of our relationship but i am pathetic and stuck by. He apologized and worked on it, eventually becoming very doting and gentle. Hes not very classy, and neither is his family, which has been a cultural issue with me. I feel as though I am stuck because we are on 4 years and my own quality has been depreciated by my ""work"". I also wanted to do my best to sleep with only one person. [This is among my own qualifications; no one must prescribe to any particular set of ideals]  
By classless I mean: he once texted a girl to ask her boob size bc we were curious what it was (obviously this blew my mind), he puts no effort into his appearance, wealthy family returns items after use or at a new location to make money, talks about people while they are nearby, used to make fun of people &amp; used to make uneducated racial comments. 
Another criticism is that I put a great deal of effort into his preparations for medical school (writing cover letters, applying for jobs, internships, making plans and strategies) and even have given him blow jobs to work on his english literature and compositions skills (which are in a deplorable state). meanwhile, he puts no effort into helping me get into graduate school, and up until a year ago liked to tell me depression isnt real and rape is only rape when violence is involved. Im pretty divided bc he buys be so much and puts up with me, which is also appreciated. He also has broken many promises. its not terribly important, but he is obese and never sticks to the gym regime for more than a few days. I am very supportive and let him know its about health and not attraction even though its not cool to wait until marriage, get pushed around, then spend the next few years prepping them to be the man he should be, and having male-oriented no-female orgasm sex for the first 3 out of 4 years. 
My relationship is very dysfunctional but somehow feels normal. 
He has good intentions but I feel like i ruined my life. I can make it work and build a life, but should i?
Ive always been depressed so i dont expect much out of life, but even now I feel like I should want more. I know this is my own making, Honest thoughts are appreciated. "
5sdn2z,8,2017-02-06,Is a job offer only official when they actually give you the contract to sign?,iudexdicis,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/5sdn2z/is_a_job_offer_only_official_when_they_actually/,"I reached the end of the recruitment process in a company and they made the final job offer a few days ago, to which I answered in the next day, accepting it. They then welcomed me to their team and said they would get in touch with me to gather the necessary documents to write the contract and it would be ready within a month or so.

The starting date is only in two months and I asked if I could sign the contract as soon as possible, but I think it will still take some time. Meanwhile, I don't have any legal document, or standing, to assume that I actually have the job, so I will probably be wasting time on my current job (unpaid internship) just to play it safe, when I could be solely working on my dissertation.

What's the probability of them backing off with their offer after I've accepted it and should I wait until I have actually signed the contract to take care of my current professional situation?

5selj9,1,2017-02-06,My [M22] girlfriend [F21] threw away all of her anti-depressants and I don't know what to do.,throwaway499659,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5selj9/my_m22_girlfriend_f21_threw_away_all_of_her/,"Throwaway for privacy reasons, also going to be long so please bear with me.

I have been dating my girlfriend Suzy for 2 years. I love this girl so much and honestly see myself spending the rest of my life with her. But the last couple months have been extremely rough and I really need advice.

Late October of last year Suzy attempted suicide. Took a bunch of over the counter medication then tried to run into traffic. She was taken to the hospital by police and kept (involuntarily) in the mental ward for 15 days. 

Before I got the call from her sister, her parent were too upset to speak to me, I never knew Suzy was depressed. I regarded her as one of the most positive, happy people I knew. From what I've learned since then, no one in her life had any idea how depressed Suzy was. I know that her mother has taken a lot of guilt on herself because she thought Suzy's problems when she was younger (spending most of her time in her room, cutting, negativity) were just normal teenage angst.

The amount of guilt and worry I have felt since then have been pretty overwhelming. Though no one blames me, since no one knew, I feel like I should have known. I'm her boyfriend, I should've been there to help her through it!

I have done my best to provide support for her during the last couple months but last week was a breaking point for her.

I won't go into detail but she got into a very intense fight with her parents which ended with her flushing all of her medication.

She came to me afterwards pretty hysterical about the whole thing. I didn't bring up the medication until the next day, and I offered to help her figure out things with her psychiatrist and prescription to get her the pills asap (she needed to take them everyday). 

She told me that shes decided to go off the medication permanently, just cold turkey. Her reasons is that the meds were affecting her personality and she felt the cons were outweighing the pros. At that point she was on two types of antidepressants and an anti-anxiety med. To be honest, I agreed with her to a point. 

I definitely noticed a shift in her personality on the meds, less of a filter, more prone to outbursts ect, And she experienced some nasty side effects, vomiting, fatigue, insomnia.... The psychiatrist she was seeing would just prescribe her another medication every visit when she told him about the side effects. She was originally only on one that she was forced onto in the mental ward and he kept adding after the fact.

I cant imagine the stress she is under right now. only a month after being discharged she had to take her university exams. Then she moved right after the term ended to start her internship in a new city. Due to some poor circumstances, shes only started therapy last week. So after a serious suicide attempt, its taken 3 months to talk to someone.

The system has seriously failed her at every turn and though I know she wants help, shes basically given up hope she'll get it. As her main support (I see her the most often) I want to give her the best support I can. 

I personally think she should ask the therapist shes with now about going back on medication. My reasoning is that since shes been off, she confessed the thoughts are coming back. I'm terrified she'll try again. But its her body and I cant control her.

I know she respects my opinion and if I tell her I want her back on meds, she'll consider it more seriously. But is that good advice? Am I even qualified to have an opinion??

I want to be there for her so badly, shes everything to me and I cant lose her. What should I do?

I have no one in my life that knows the first thing about mental health.

TLDR: Girlfriend flushed her medications, what should I do?"

I'm really into Overwatch and sadly I can't bring any computer that could handle it, I have a feeling we're gonna get a lot of updates and stuff when I'm gone and I'd hate to miss it. 

I live in northern London but I'm willing to travel around an hour on the weekends to get to the place. Because I'm doing an internship money is kinda low, so not anything extremely expensive. 

Where I live there isn't any kind of these places so I'd love if someone cared to explain how you pay, hourly etc. and some do's and dont's. 

Thanks in advance."
5serh5,19,2017-02-06,Planning revenge on the creepy married man who stalked and harassed me!,Gullefis,myevilplan,https://www.reddit.com/r/myevilplan/comments/5serh5/planning_revenge_on_the_creepy_married_man_who/,"Long story short I have had to put up with a really creepy class mate for the last two months who has been making my life hell. 

I am 32-years-old (it is an adult education course) and he is a 47-year-old-married-creep who wants to cheat on his wife of ten years. A woman who gave up a career to raise his two children.

When I coldly and VERY clearly refused his advances (reminding him that he was a married man and to leave me alone) he started to stalk me. I would find bouquets of flowers on my car, he would bombard me with emails professing his love and pester me in class.

I had to tell him numerous times to leave me alone.

The thing was that, at first, I tried to be discreet about it. I suppose I was kind of embarrassed and ashamed. I didn't talk about it with anyone in class and I certainly didn't want to talk about it with his wife as it's not her fault.

However, I feel like he misinterpreted my discretion for me being a pushover and he tried to take advantage of it by pestering me right in front of people and being all smug when he saw that they had no clue what was happening.

Eventually, I went to the police and told those in charge in my school and although everyone has taken my claims seriously, there isn't much they can do unless he does more. And after I confronted him about the flowers two weeks ago, he started to leave me alone. So it doesn't look like anything is going to happen to him.

But in the mean time I still have to put up with him everyday, five days a week. And I just want to punch him in his ugly face! I cannot stand the man.

I have five months left on my course (two doing an internship so I won't see him then) and then I never have to see the man again.

I feel like if I am going to take revenge, I have to wait for the course to end, so that it's not so easy for him to find me (he lives quite far away from me). But when the course ends, I plan on telling his wife everything: I have the emails where he tells me he loves me, pictures of the flowers he sent me... I'm going to pass it all on to her. He believes that I can't get in touch with her because he never told me what her name was and neither of them are very active on social media. But what he doesn't know is ""not very active"" isn't the same as ""not on social media"" and of course, I found her...

Even though he may not be too bothered losing his wife, I know that he owns a lot of property, which might be why he's looking for an affair rather than just doing the decent thing and divorcing his wife. I don't think he can afford to divorce her. Which is why I figure that this would hurt him the most... And I want him to suffer as much as he has made me suffer.

Wow! I'm not normally the type to get so angry that I want revenge but I have to say that this s***face really knows how to push my buttons...

What do you think? Any advice and do's or don'ts? Could it be dangerous?

Cheers everyone."

|**Synopsis**|Leslie invites a local reporter (Alison Becker) to write a story about the pit, but the interviews go badly. Fearful of a negative story, Leslie asks Mark to talk to the reporter, but is jealous after Mark sleeps with her. When Leslie confronts Mark, he angrily quits the pit subcommittee. Ann convinces Mark to make up with Leslie and dissuade the reporter from using much of her negative material. Although the story is still largely unfavorable, Leslie remains optimistic. Meanwhile, Tom tries to advance his career by purposely losing online Scrabble games to his boss, Ron. [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation_(season_1\))|

|**Synopsis**|As Andy cleans up the house to surprise Ann, Leslie tries to infiltrate the boys' club of politics by crashing an after-work gathering at Pawnee Town Hall. Trying to fit in, she opens a gift basket worth more than $25, breaking the local government ethics laws. She apologetically refers Pawnee officials to a website about the pit to highlight her accomplishments, but gets in more trouble when underage intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) posts a video of herself drinking on the site. Leslie is called before an ethics committee, but is let off with a warning after Ron, who despises the town's disciplinary process, defends her. Leslie is pleased when Mark tells her the warning officially makes her a member of the boys' club. [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation_(season_1\))|

We've been together for over a year and moved in quickly due to the fact that I was in school full time and couldn't afford a place. He offered for me to move in with him so I could focus on graduating but after I moved into his place I could tell he was reluctant to live with me/ take the relationship to the next level and began arguing with me over petting things constantly. 
I have lived with someone before and I know red flags when I see them and I started seeing them the minute we moved in. He wouldn't let me decorate the place the first few months, refused to clean up his stuff to make room for mine, became lazy, apathetic to doing anything with me and we stopped having sex. 
The problem was/is that once I moved in with him, I quit my job to focus on full-time school and I was living off of my stipend which wasn't much. 

We've been living together for four months now and in the past four months he's broken up with me in a fight over 
-me not wanting to go to a party with him(I don't drink for health reasons). 
-stating we aren't compatible (we were completely fine before we moved in together)
-and honestly I think one time he was just frustrated that I asked him to do the dishes too many times?

I know, all the red flags are pointing me out the door but, 
I feel guilty because I put this huge weight on him by living with him and now he's reacting to it but also (he asked me to move in!).

I really do love him and I miss how we were before we moved in. 

I keep trying to spice things up a bit and to make room for us to have healthy conversations and to push him out of the house to see his friends because he literally spends all day playing video games and then complaining that I never let him see his friends which (where is that coming from!? I need him out of the house most of the time, Im a raging introvert who NEEDS alone time).

I don't know what to do. Im having a really hard time trusting him now, I feel like he is just with me out of obligation at this point and I don't believe him when he says he loves me anymore because why would you try to end something with someone so many times if you loved them?

I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship before (for four years) and it ended terribly and I didn't date anyone for years after and this man Im with now, is the first person I trusted enough to get into anything serious with since my ex and now I feel like a failure for letting this happen to me again. 

What do I do and where  do I go?
I have no money in savings, I'm in a four month internship that requires my full attention and I have no places to crash in the city I live in. 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!
TL;DR My partner has started to become emotionally manipulative since we started living together and now I'm worried if this relationship is even salvageable. "
5sgnw4,96,2017-02-06,"Cliff Notes on George Webb's Series, ""The Dyncorp Harvest"", Part 12",911bodysnatchers322,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5sgnw4/cliff_notes_on_george_webbs_series_the_dyncorp/,"**DynCorp Harvest**

**This series is rated R for Mature Adults.**

In the DynCorp Harvest series, George incrementally describes a luxury medical tourism resort in Northern Haiti, funded by USAID and built by the Clinton Foundation, whose revenue-earning underpinnings are purported to be a) an illegal organ harvesting market, b) human sex trafficking Dyncorp-Slim ratline and c) microlending loansharking debt slavery by DynCorp--the CIA's privatized, covert-services contractor.

The organs are proposed to be either transplanted in Haiti into rich elites skipping the lines with help from organ brokers he believes the Podestas and Braverman-the-doctor to be, or shipped to locations throughout the US to various aristocratic outlets; while women are forced into cellphone-based debt slavery and prostitution; and children are sex-trafficked to Colombia or stowed aboard a medical ship bound for a port in Norfolk Va to be (mkultra-best-use/sex/assassin/politician) trafficked in DC (and abroad).  Furthermore, and much like they were in Vietnam, the bodies would then be zipped in DynCorp bodybags, shipped abroad with organs removed and replaced with illegal drugs.

These activities, in addition to blackmailing police forces, politicians, and industry influencers into compliance and loyal servitude--the so-called *Brownstone Operations*--are the ""natural and necessary"" functions of the CIA, because--*the company* erroneously believes--these activities are needed to fund these selfsame covert operations!  Putting it more simply, *""We need to commit crimes so we can continue to commit crimes.""*

There.  Now you understand the CIA.

  * David Petraeus DOD plan -- the spoils of war include harvest of everything
  * ""Downstream Derivative""--the bonus--is they get to test vaccines by first creating the problem
  * ""I know CNN wants you to think about other things""
  * We started with Clinton Foundation and we ended up with Dr. Paul Farmer
  * We started looking at who he is teaching and what is coming out it.  It's a transplant specialty is what is taught
  * The Transplant doctors are going back and forth between the Cleveland Clinic and war-torn areas
  * The question I posed is: Are they doing this within the US?  Is the CIA/Dyncorp doing this to their political opponents?
  * Trump hosts their annual convention in Florida for the last seven years.  So is HE a customer?  I dunno!
  * Film, *21 Grams*, same 2 actors Sean Penn and Naomi Watts as in other Lionsgate film, *Fair Game*, about a drug dealer who sells Sean Penn a heart.
  * It's kind of a 'hidden in plain sight' with the Clintons and Dyncorp.  Maybe Bush did it too.
  * It seems to be Hillary's touch to add the film about it, just to show that, ""nobody's ever going to figure it out""
  * Dr. Eric Braverman organ salespitch redux, long relationship with Petraeus and Clinton
  * George discusses the shift of clientele from soldiers to the senescence market of the aging elite
  * Fergie was in on a charity called the Path with Braverman
  * You have a bank of hearts in one country but you only have an hour or so to get it to the US, so you need to create more ""targets"" in the US
  * If you want to challenge the facts on this I have [evidence for] Bosnia, Kosovo, Afganistan
  * JTTF in US: CIA has inserted itself into FBI via brownstown ops by planting a revenge motive to do something illegal and terrible like gangraping Jessa Dillow-Crisp.
  * [Christopher Reeve] -- lets say he did a protest movie about war, and the pentagon didn't like it.  They could shoot your horse with a pellet gun as you're going over a jump--to give you a warning.  I don't think they thought it would turn out the way it did.  If you keep on speaking out against war, all of a sudden your wife [Dana Reeve] does young.  I don't think she had ""old heart""
  * *James Elephantitis* -- has a pig farm.  Which I thought was interesting for one of the most powerful men in washington.    {{""le chomp"" ~~body disposal~~ restaurant leftovers disposal pig farm}}
  * Doug Coe: It's all intimidation along the way.
  * O.U.R. Operation uUnderground Railroad.  Using the revenge motive to get christian groups to attack guys like us.
  * OUR, everyone is saying it's a sham charity, a front organization for navy seal team that has no rules...to operate with impunity around the world.  No oversight, no paperwork, no followup.
  * Caracol park, I said this industrial park was going to get like a 1000 businesses, and they were all going to get loans from the World Bank and then they were going to fold over time after all the money was loaned out.  This is like the *Arkansas Development Fund*  I think this is done through the export/import bank run through the World Bank that has Congress oversight.  EXIM Bank.  They collapsed it last year in 2015.  They collapsed 10 yr insured loans, which Congress co-signed...Congress had to pay that out.  I think that's where Hillary got the extra 5B dollars.
  * George shows a spending ledger of USAID assistance money.  He points to Petits Freres et Soeurs, and says this was for moving kids around.  They all had different illnesses.  That's because--he believes--dyncorp was spraying the area with different things.
  * Cellphones help you track migration versus vectors and who died; micro versus macro longitudinal studies
  * Hospital ship comfort goes ashore in tents to do statistical studies and then do followup operations and biopsies on the ship.
  * You create traffic back and forth from shore to ship and then move in the bodies at night into the ship to do the organ extractions
  * People in the health field are going to start remembering interactions with the CIA and these details, now that the 'working theory' is out there.
  * If I'm CIA and I want to do a study, I put it through Dyncorp or through a foundation
  * CGI [Clinton Global Initiative] hasn't gone anywhere, they say it's shut down.  It's going to be funded by Rockefeller on the other coast through the Google Foundation
  * Bill Swing is Mr. Virus and Fred Eshelman is Mr. Vaccine.  And there's the body bags.  I believe they are going to atlanta to the CDC.
  * All these US foreign service officers, they're all from Johns Hopkins.  Is it like Cleveland Clinic...a big organ transplant center?  Yes it is! For overseas people?  Yes it is.  Who else graduated from there? Andrew Young.  Where else was he the mayor of? Atlanta: The Center for Disease Control.  I just connect the dots I'm not making any accusations.
  * I remember Wayne Williams [Atlanta Murders of 1979-81]^^[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_murders_of_1979%E2%80%9381)[[]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Williams) and these ***33*** kids dying [23 actually, according to wikipedia], and this guy had this Dr. Spock grip.  He didn't kill the kids initially, he just seemed to incapacitate them.

* [[**Day 101 part 1**]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMZ4mZ4KA7w)
  * CIA is like the fourth branch of government.
  * If the 3 branches are kids playing in the sandbox, CIA is kind like inviting Harambe [gorilla] into the sandbox.  You hope it will be nice but you start seeing Harambe dragging kids in circles. You wonder if it's safe
  * That's where we are at with Dyncorp in the United States.  It's been that way since 9/11. But it's getting worse and I'll show that.
  * There is nothing to say they can't do the same things they did the Libya, Syria topples in any country around the world {{ including the US }}
  * In order to combat this clandestine period since 1974 is an open operation, an open media research investigation.
  * I take in news stories, connect things and summarize it.
  * George calls himself a glorified stenographer in an open media investigation.  {{ Nope, that's me.  You're the Captain of video, steering this thing }}
  * Pfullendorf Germany ""Vile Revelations of 'Sadistic Naked Sex Rituals' at Elite German Military Base"" -- in a bigger picture view, it's part of a larger brownstone operation in the organ harvest chain -- compartmentalize and then compromise
  * Team Rubicon recap
  * Dana Braverman: It's almost like they took NY Jewish kids to Israel, retrained them and named the 'bravermans'
  * Update to Cleveland Clinic.  The gal who got sent home to Saudi is going to sue.  They are trying to make a big deal of this extreme vetting thing.  It's actually a cover.  The CLeveland Clinic has been hammered a couple of times.  They are called an 'organ-friendly hospital'.  I think I've figured out the link here:
  * Paul Farmer is teaching in Rwanda, in Haiti and these genocide countries.  He's teaching these interns--the same ones being turned away up here--to do organ extractions, and now then they are coming back to the US to do organ transplants.  You need semi-skilled people doing extractions, and then they go to Cleveland clinic to learn under an expert to do the transplants.  When you look at the money [behind organ / blood harvesting] it's just too [compelling of a profit motive drive] to ignore
  * Cord blood can be substituted for bone marrow, used to treat leukemia, and it's a lot easier to match -- university of denver and UCD medical is going to be a big cord blood bank.
  * Secret film by Project Veritas and Planned Parenthood and the cord blood.  Nucatola -- Senior Diretor of Clinical Services, aborted fetus heart harvesting/transplants
  * Emergent Biosciences Zsolt playing both sides viruses + vaccines
  * Hospital ship in Honduras right now called the Spearhead; I'm convinced it's a teaching hospital for doing transplants
  * There are 9 more ships being commissioned.  They are trying to speed up the ships / get faster ships to transport organs quicker.
  * Drug money is being laundered through Lionsgate films to create films of every operation they do {{""confessing""}} -- you find this in high tech also
  * There's also a film called *The Island* about CIA agents impregnating women so they'll have organs as they get older
  * Dr. Braverman's patient list is going to be the buyers. Sold by Podesta, by Paul Farmer, by office art, and by ritualistic practice with cake; Fleischaker email is the evidence and testimonial of an elite organ market.
  * New citation about a Turkish doctor that has done 23,000 kidney transplants in Bosnia, Kosovo and now doing transplants in Aleppo.
  * Glen Beck travels to Haiti with Operation Underground Railroad--his role is to add legitimacy
  * Tim Ballard, ex-DHS Ceo -- Operation Underground Railroad
  * Public-Private-Partnership?  No it's vigilante kidnap and extorting unit created for asset seizure; it's the farthest extention of a public-private-partnership you can get. In fact, there's no public piece to this.  They do stings with DHS.  They are extorting money.
  * Kids are being used, being kidnapped, and at least being bloodfarmed for cryogenics and for cord blood.
  * And their wives don't even know it, that's the sad part: they are all ex-special forces--guys trained to go in and kill everybody.
  * University of Denver will be a big transplanation center and blood banks
  * North of Boulder near RMNP, you're going to have your big underground complex.  With their current disposition matrix, they are deciding who is going to get to go into the tunnel into the complex if nuclear war happens.  Just like Kissinger's paper at Harvard.  And the movie ""Dr Strangelove""
  * With Palantir I can follow all my assets with the cellphones
  * Lots of recaps
  * Dick Gregory (activist) agrees with George about Wayne Williams Atlanta killings theory mentioned previously
  * ***The only way the open operations have a chance about the covert operations is by putting out the 650k emails, at least the metadata.  The public has no chance, there's no other way.  People say, ""oh Pompeo is coming in"".  No Intelligence directorate which intercepts everything going to the director and redirects it.  So that's not a solution. The only solution is sunshine.***

* [[**Day 101 part 2**]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4oiC9FgrsA)
  * The difference between Vietnam's Phoenix operation and this operation is organ harvesting
  * Petraeus added more use of gassing and psychological operations -- turning villages against each other. ""gang-countergang"" {{Jesuit trick}}
  * Bone marrow cells can stay alive 17 days after death, so that kind of negates all the other stuff [given the price per gram], don't know if that many people have leukemia
  * Somebody mentioned that Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins both have hospitals in Dubai, UAE
  * Repo Men, Daybreakers, Matrix and the Island -- organ harvesting films; trying to normalize organ harvesting
  * Trying to find if Dan Braverman from Team Rubicon is related to Dr. Eric Braverman.  It could just be Mossad, kids go back [Israel] and come back as a ""braverman""
  * George wonders if Fleishaker's PAM email list is a ""social justice"" list, like oh we got a new heart for this person and it came from this bad guy over here; and [for example] Peter Kadzik made it happen through the DOJ through a domestic harassment campaign [targetted individuals of government gangstalking]  DHS has this terrorist watchlist that--like the Phoenix program--targetted [baddies] originally terrorists but then ultimately ends up targetting completely innocent people [political adversaries doing nothing more than exercising constitutionally-guaranteed right to free speech, expression and collaboration]
  * Prayer breakfast tomorrow
  * I saw a guy named Doug Valentine who wrote a thick book about the Phoenix program, and he talked about the white helmets being a fake organization
  * What he said about the Phoenix program was interesting--south Vietnam had 44 provinces and they put a terror-torture center in each province.  Then in the districts (counties) they put a JTTF type officer in each district.  Exactly like our fusion centers.  One in each state and then expand out to each police force you put a JTTF officer.
  * Exactly what I was saying: 10,000 dollars and you take over a whole country [by taking over the police force]
  * Regarding Glenn Beck.  I didn't mean to say all Mormons were are behind all this.  *There's a group of Mormons called* ***FLBS*** *that believe in the bigamy, and they also believe in these tunnels because the feds were always after them*.  What I'm saying is that the CIA, when they go to a group like this--they are anthropologists almost--they look and see to the habits and patterns that they will respond positively to, and they [steer the cults using their own culture--""it's your culture""--alephantis]
  * CIA is going to have a hand in every type of religion and cult and steer it
  * Vietnamese were afraid they wouldn't go to heaven if their liver was eaten, so [the CIA] would cut out the liver and make sure villagers see it.
  * The same reason Israelis have women soldiers, because Muslims believe they won't go to heaven if they are killed by a woman.  Automatic machine guns in the Paletinian areas, they'll make sure they are manned by women crews
  * Mormon cutouts, and exploiting hierarchies
  * Operation Underground Railroad, Tim Ballard, and the Super Bowl.  Young women targetted.
  * They are not going to be prosecuted, they will be put into an asset forfeiture program; to put a revenge motive in a group and take the whole family's assets
  * World Vision Vaccine ""Cothy O'Brien""  Cathy O'Brien talked about the world vision vaccine used [in Haiti], she said she trafficked drugs and was used as a sex slave in Haiti
  * Anyone who has information about the foreign officers around the hospital ships.  Those are the people going ashore and making deals about who is going to get transplants, they will be the salesman for hospital ship transplants.
  * You're not forgotten Monica Petersen.

* [[**Day 102 part 1**]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQSv_kZH0fo)
  * News update: going to meet with an Oliver Stone person to make this into a motion picture
  * Jorge Puello from Haiti is trying to contact George
  * When the CIA/Dyncorp were created they had a kind of GOD complex  [Guns/Gold Oil/Opium/Orgies/Organs Drugs]
  * Dyncorp is the cutting up of the kill and using all the parts
  * Wild Bill Donovan was the cowboy that gave that spirit to these 'happy crew of pirates'
  * As you get closer to the reality, you see that it's ugly.  It gets into infecting populations with viruses and selling the vaccines, sex and drug trafficking ends up with a lot of ruined lives and prostitution killing themselves with drug overdoses ""that's just not a fun thing"" {Lol}
  * The profits are so big with organ biz that you end up throwing in guys-like-me in with the bad guys; we may as well throw in a few journalists in too.  They stand between us and overthowing the country.  So we got to get rid of them.  That's a very orwellian view of the world; but that's why Dyncorp was created.
  * George describes the slippery slope of using JTTF fixers to go after political enemies turning into going after business enemies
  * CIA and State Dept are kind of the same thing; it's just the State Dept is the political side of the Dept of Defense {{versus the Pentagon which is the military side of DoD}}
  * Is Monica Petersen alive and part of the witness protection?   I don't think so.  Too many upset family and friends
  * ""Political Military Officers Set Up Underground Railroads"" -- text
  * A lot of these kids are survivors of wars [wards of the cia] and become foreign officers, groomed, and selected by the Madam Allbrights of the world.  They are selected and groomed.  George mentions they could have been sired by the people in the CIA, again for potential organ harvesting; [and that would explain why Obama is related to George Bush and Dick Cheney within an otherwise statistically unlikely number of generations]
  * ""The CIA does not care about the people of Haiti"" They want to control 3 things: the military, the checkbook/budget and the President
  * ""I want to create a political bond with the elite in a country.  In order to keep a country you need the leaders and you need the elite--you don't need to worry about the people.  The elite need health services, so they are going to want to buy organs--hearts.  You are going in there [with the military] and farm it that way. The reason why this hospital ship is going all around to these 11 different places isn't to provide healthcare to the poor: it's to provide healthcare to the elite.""
  * CNN will have a cover story--always--about some poor person getting it so that the impression is given in your mind, but the healthcare is for the elites.
  * ""UAE Doctors"" -- UAE Cleveland Clinic in Dubai is a concentration point for all middle east muslim doctors in the muslim brotherhood
  * 454g / lb
  * If you don't have those public occult rituals then people won't know you're in that business
  * Petraeus Provides Flash Bang Moment
  * Rice study for Bill Clinton, probably several different viruses in it
  * USAID and UNICEF running that program and MercyCorp and World Vision will be the information collectors to see how the studies are going.
  * I'm not going to call Puello because I know it's a diversion, I know it's _____(unintelligble--sounds like saudis)___
  * If you don't publish the 650k emails, then you lose all credibility and you are fake news
  * Israel, China and Russia have this information!
  * Somebody said it's another 1M that the McCabes got. So that's 1.6M now (quid pro quo) for Mccabe's wifes run
  * Ok so let's see if we go to Hollywood or if we end up dead in the parking lot like Seth Rich.

* [[**Day 102 part 2**]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLu-u5dvlZo)
  * Disrupt -- this is happening in Berkeley now with Soros' groups.  Soros is openly calling for the overthow of Trump. Will probably call for impeachment.
  * Instead of farming crops they farm people
  * That involves introducing viruses to weaken the immune system so that organ transplants will be easier, believe it or not.
  * People who donate to this endowment to Harvard, you're going to find that these donors through Larry Summers are going to be trading life plans and replacement organs for endowments
  * UAE Dr Israel just had his practice shut down for selling bone marrow has moved to Germany
  * Cleveland Clinic is one of the greatest medicial institutions of all time, and they've moved to UAE
  * We split off UAE from Saudi to militarily control the Strait of Hormuz to retain access to the Persian Gulf, like the Suez canal
  * UAE has changed their organ transplant laws so you can call someone dead before they are dead, which enables live transfer
  * All those missing 15,000 organs are within short flight to UAE
  * The CIA likes to do things by running around the Congress.  [They avoid all the laws of the US and get away with everything we don't want them doing around the world.]
  * ""Doc to Dock No inspection for Organs Leaving Flex Jets"" -- it smacks of this cover.  Passenger, executive jet that seats 20, not a cargo jet, 20 prisoners going back, boxes coming out.  What you don't see in the social justice films.  Homen square is then the holding pen for the 20
  * ""La Difference School"" -- George Washington Barbados kid, Alexander Hamilton was the son.  If you want to have genetic matches in you later years, you have organ kids stowed away [maybe they suceed you or maybe they're your liver donor]
  * Dyncorp is spraying El Salvador and Columbia.  George believes they are spraying viruses
  * Meeting with Oliver Stone folks in a few minutes.
  * Jorge Puello is the fixer, sets up the translater, etc.  He sets up ratlines; and all the criminality is all-one-thing
  * You're going to find the same thing in India.  It started in India in 1974 (Yunus)
  * Before Watergate, it was the biggest brownstone ever.  The DC madam case with Barney Frank
  * Same with Syga Thomas---he bought his brownstone from James Alefantis
  * Max McCoby DC Metro ""James Alefantis Silby Connection"" Nous Petit Frere et Souer CIA Lawyer ""Set Up Man"" -- hes a cia guy.
  * Alefantis is a CIA guy, his dad is a CIA guy.  McCoby didn't study, wanted to be a Yale guy (""a yaley""), couldn't cut it
  * Carl Shoffler was the first Tim Ballard-- Watergate Arresting Police Officer.  He had all the informants and all the setups for the brownstones.  This brownstone stuff goes back 40 yrs.  It's been privatized with Booze Allen Hamilton

  * Met with the Hollywood couple.  They seem to know everyone in Hollywood to pitch this to them.  Let's call them Valerie and Joe.
  * I told them about the responses I've gotten from the community, using their unique skillsets.  Talks about a researcher in Korea.
  * Everytime I do an episode, it launches a thousand 'fruitful searches'.
  * Sibel Edmonds is closer to this with Newsbud.
  * There's no script just incredible researchers that give him the data
  * Haiti turned out to be the key to the whole thing.  Haiti is a victim of the vaccine, organ harvesting, sex/drug/gun trafficking everything, organ/bloodmining thing.
  * Haiti is the model organism for understanding the whole microcosm of criminality
  * I watched this Russian documentary they did after Kosovo ""Zene CRNOM""-- french named 'doctors without borders' is a Soros company directly in the middle of the whole thing.

  * There were 21 emails that came out today due to Judicial Watch.  It was a nothingburger.  They are slowfooting the investigation
  * Jorge Puello is no longer wanted--he served his time so George apologizes for saying that.  He wants to expose the downstream.   But we want to go upstream.  You aren't going to drain the swamp by going downstream.
  * Jorge tell us who the operatives are.  Just publish it.  They always want to diffuse and have you go off in different directions
  * PPD Vaccines.  Who are the officers in El Salvador and Columbia, Jorge--you have a chance to be a real hero.  Let's talk about hospital shifts.  Prove me right, send the information to the reporters in this group.  This is a real chance for you to expose what the State Dept / CIA is doing.
  * We had a good chat on the film about the Elites--they really don't care about anyone but the 1%.  YOu're a renowned scientist--what would it mean to the world if you lived another 20 yrs?

  *  All of this activity is for elites to have eternal life
  * Knights of Malta.  When Clinton Foundation shut down the CGI, which is really going to be reformed by Rockefeller and Google foundation, I proposed the question: did they go to Malta?
  * Malta can issue diplomatic passports so you can bypass the security lines.  Here are all the countries they have diplomatic relationships with.  And Canada is one
  *  If you are jewish you know this.  The maltese falcon is a bird you could put in the window of an art shop, hospital or church and that person would accept MONEY to get out of Germany into Jewish-friendly countries.  It's to let everyone know you can get letters of transit if you could pay that extortion money to escape.
  * Reason I mention it is the Knights of the Grand Master of Malta resigned today.  The Pope is saying he's going to take control of the Order of Knights of Malta.  It's not actually part of the Catholic Church, but it's always been the military wing of the Catholic Church.  These guys were assassins.  They called them knights of Justice; popes were killing each other and so forth. It's been a spy ring for a long time {{Jesuits}} and in recent times, since war of 1812 it's been a way to spirit away rich people who are in trouble with the law.  It's been a ratline for trafficking for a long time.  SO when the CIA goes to find a network, the CIA doesn't go to the Church to pray--they go because they want letters of introduction, letters of transit
  * FBI dominates in the US, so CIA inserts itself into Canada.  All the MKULTRA experiments are done in Quebec. And CSIS [Canadian Secret Intelligence Service] is a very strong partner of the CIA^^[[]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Canada)[[]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service)

  * People like this give just enough information to make it not look like a big network
  * George believes CENTCOM is going to be behind all the UAE transplants and the doctors coming back and forth
  * You need a cover when you get an organ transplant, but you don't need that in UAE
  * One of the interns that was blocked in Trump's ban is a UAE doctor that is suing Trump now
  * Nancy Scheper-Hughes wrote the book, *[Commodifying Bodies](https://www.amazon.com/Commodifying-Published-association-Culture-Society/dp/0761940340/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486391574&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=commodifying+bodies)* in 2009, which discusses how medical transplantation technology improvements is creating more war through the profit motive of organ harvesting
  * Hospital ships are going to be used for organ transplant for the elite
  * VA hospital through OHS contracts is going to be responsible for logistics of scheduling.  VA scheduling problems are from prioritizing the elites [skipping the line]
  * Swiss SYNTEK vaccine testing
  * Once you compromise the police and military [and set up the organ system], then you can export this [turnkey] system to other governments with foreign officers, and saying 'hey we have this plan for eternal life'; and if he can use his own country's people's organs for the elite, then that's a key brokering leverage
  * I'm more sure than ever that USAID is the service setting up kids for vaccines and moving them to remote areas where they can be harvested
  * The ""us think"", the MIC, ""our people"", the CIA, we're going to create this waystation or retreat in case anything goes wrong.  We're going to have this plan for longer life, and we're going to have underground railroads to take it from somebody else at no charge to ourselves.  This 'co-opting' idea that runs through the CIA

  * They use the kids for sex stings and then have revenge groups to 'harvest them'.  But there aren't enough sicko/pedos that they have to go after innocent people, by gaslighting the revenge groups into having a revenge motive for harvesting innocent people {{maybe those people are then outed as murderers for other revenge gangs, continuing the cycle?}}
  * The Army Intelligence is the precursor to OSS which is the precursor to the CIA.  It's basically Wall St. versus the FBI. FBI has always had this anti-communist [drive]. CIA has always been Wall St's pet.
  * Organ Transplants has been off-the-charts this year.

  * Africa is going to be the source for the ME for organs.  Kosovo for Europe and NATO.  Haiti is going to be a human experimentation place for vaccines and virus testing.  Bodybags going both ways.  Both a source of organs and a source of research.
  * Cathy O'Brian is a CIA whistleblower who has admitted the drug running and virus testing in Haiti as historical precedent
  * George is folowing USAID spending, tied to Alephantis via Sislby

5sh4k9,3,2017-02-06,[M(as A)4F(as A)] A collection of all my various prompts. Hope you enjoy!,freddiemercurious,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5sh4k9/mas_a4fas_a_a_collection_of_all_my_various/,"Hello there! I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

────────

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 2.

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid. This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."

5si7tr,3,2017-02-06,"EX:Online boyfriend, not who he said he was(?)",throwaway24101996,catfish,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfish/comments/5si7tr/exonline_boyfriend_not_who_he_said_he_was/,"I have a lot to say. I met this guy in August of 2015 on this random website called Zobe. We added each other on skype, and just started talking probably everyday for the whole course of our relationship. I live in Canada btw, outside of Toronto. He told me he lives outside Washington DC, his named, and goes to school at George Mason University and at the time when we met, he was a first year student. We exchanged pictures, and at first I was sceptical because I never really had online friends before or even a relationship. I told him about my worries about being catfished and he would dismiss it, and say that is not happening and those are crazy, etc. At the time, he sent me 3 photos of him. The first one was a regular one, the second was a full body nude shot with face and the third was just a picture of his dick. 

When we were talking, he told me his dad ripped out his webcam so all he has a mic. I never heard his voice over the 19 months we talked. During the beginning of us talking on talking, I reversed search the images he sent me on google and no matches was found, so I never thought much of it. Looking back their were a lot of red flags I ignored, but I genuinely thought he was who he said he was. He literally would tell me, about the university he goes too, what he is studying, etc. He told me so much about him, and vice versa. Like I could tell you so much about him from what he told me. We bonded a lot over the course of the relationship, and some point we fell for each other and started dating kinda. 
 
We were suppose to meet during Christmas break of 2016, but back in November of last year he told me he met someone in his class and that they are dating. So of course I was heart broken, and so I cut contact. We ended up kind of reconnecting early January, but we cut contact again because it wouldn't work with him having a GF. The conversation was hard, because I wanted to be with him but he said he can't do distance, especially not while in school and that someday maybe we could be with each other, and he hopes to talk to me in the future. 

BTW we only talked on skype, and occasionally through email because he didn't have anything else because of his parents. The email address he gave me was encrypted, when we met, he used this service called tutanota. When he gave it to me initially, I asked him what it was and he told me it was a private email so his parents don't snoop. After the breakup, I tried emailing him because I was so depressed but none of it would go through, and so I assumed he deleted it since I couldn't email the account anymore, from any email. 

So after I cut contact in January, I never deleted him from my skype just blocked him and he knew I blocked him because we mutually decided it. But last Saturday I went back on since we last talked, and unblocked him. His skype account now says ""we can't show more information about this contact because they have not been online for a long time."" This worried me a bit, because usually he is online and I never seen a message like this before. I tried to search all over the web, but I couldn't find a solution really. I have a second skype account, and so I thought maybe he blocked me, and so I looked up his account on the skype directory and it is not showing anything. I could find it before but I can't now. I tried to search it multiple times but nothing came up, and I wondered if this had to do because it said he hasn't been on a long time but 4 weeks isn't a long time. 

 So as this happened, I started getting more suspicious I decided to look up a website to reverse search images, I kept 2 of the 3 images he sent me and looked them up on a website called tineye. And a bunch of gay porn sites popped, and some of these date back to 2014. When we met, he told me they were taken recently and also that he only had 2 photos of himself. When I clicked on these website, their were multiple other pictures of him in different positions naked.

So then I started digging even more. I looked for his name in his city and I only found one, and he doesn't go to the university ""my guy"" says he does and it doesn't look like him. I messaged the guy on facebook, but he hasn't replied yet. And then I decided to look him up on the people finder on the university website, he claims to go too. No matches, nothing. I couldn't find him at all.

Also I was thinking about contacting some students in his ""program"" at George Mason University, but I didn't know if I would be going so far if I did it. I wanted to ask them if he went there or if they saw someone who looked like that going there. 

So now I am stuck, because I think I got catfished...A part of me wants to believe he is 20 year old, going to George Mason University, studies civil engineering and lives in Fairfax Virginia, but then how does it explain the pictures online? Did he tell me a fake name? how doesn't he show up on George Mason university at all, which would be weird because he told me about the classes and how he was looking for an internship during the summer, and that the he was struggling but it was a good school, and how he wanted to transfer to George Washington because that was his first pick but he didn't get in. And that he wants to live in DC in the future, because where he lives is boring. 

I don't know what to think, I asked a friend for advice and they said ask him when he comes on skype but I don't even know if he will come on again and if he does what do I say? I don't know if I should let this go, but I loved ""him"" and we literally had plans to be together until he dumped me. But now I don't even know if he has a girlfriend or not, and he only said that because he knew he couldn't meet me. But he spent months and months saying once we meet, it will all fall into place and that if their is chance we can be together in the future he wouldn't want to miss it. Like why say that, or why lead me on for so many months claiming to be somebody you may not be? Even if you can't do much for me, can you at least give me some advice. 

EDIT: Thank you! You guys actually made me feel a lot better. I was obsessing a lot over the last few days about trying to find out the ""real"" person, but right now I don't feel the need too. I rather leave this a ""mystery"" and just learn to live with the fact, I trusted someone who abused my trust. They lied to me who knows how many times, and I may never know why they decided to do the stuff they did to me. I got catfished and it happens to people all the time. It sucks but it happened, but I gained a valuable learning experience. I know as time goes on, things will get better and I am looking forward to the day where I won't have to think about this constantly or fixate over the fact I got catfished. I am just ready to close this chapter in my life, and focus on more positive things and who knows maybe actually have a ""real"" boyfriend."

Regardless, I've recently learned a little more about D&amp;D (never played, though, so I'm still pretty uninformed) and thought it would be fun to turn it into a sex adventure! I've posted before about my interests in world-building, and thought this might be a good setup.

I'm not entirely sure that the actual stories (interactions between characters) need to be dice-based, but it might be fun if we introduced some dice-related randomness to our character creation process. I thought it might be fun to use the headquarters of some small company as the backdrop for our adventures. Only 10-20 employees, all in their 20s or 30s.

My proposal: we create names and personalities for all of the characters who work at the company. Once we have a set that we like, we start assigning their sexual characteristics randomly (penis size, breast size, sexual appetite, sexual competency, anything you want!) and then we can either pick our favorite characters to RP or the two of us can collectively control all of the characters and see how the story unfolds.

Just to warn you, I'm fairly geeky. Maybe not when it comes to D&amp;D, but definitely comes to math. I want a realistic distribution rather than just giving every guy a big cock (or even worse, giving our favorite guy a massive cock and the other characters small ones). I'm still trying to figure out the rules, but here are a few examples.

------------------------

Penis length: Roll 4 dice. Throw out the two lowest dice, and keep the two highest dice. Add them together, subtract 2, this is your penis length in inches.

Penis girth: Roll 2 dice. Add them together, divide by 2, add 2, this is your penis circumference in inches.

Penis length (flaccid): Roll 1 die. This is your flaccid penis length. (NOTE it's possible to have a shrinker if your flaccid penis is longer than your erect length! Be prepared to explore how that might affect sexual encounters!)

Breast size: Roll 2 dice. [2,3,4] = A cup, [5,6] = B cup, [7,8] = C cup, [9,10] D cup, [11,12] DD cup

Breast appearance: Roll 1 die. [1] = -2, [2] = -1, [3, 4] = 0, [5] = +1, [6] = +2. This is how many cup sizes bigger your breasts look in your work attire. Negative is smaller, and the minimum cup size is A. 

Breast firmness: Roll 1 die. [1] = floppy, [2, 3, 4] = normal, [5] = perky, [6] = so full and round that they look fake despite being real.

Breast Examples:

* Size roll = 9, Appearance roll = 1 --&gt; Size = D, Appearance = -2, so her Ds will look like Bs when she's dressed for work.

* Size roll = 5, Appearance roll = 1 --&gt; Size = B, Appearance = -2, her As will look like As because your cup size can't drop below A.
* Size roll = 7, Appearance roll = 6 --&gt; Size = C, Appearance = +2,
her Cs will look like DDs.

Butt size/firmness: Roll 1 die. [1] = Ironing board, [2,3] = Normal, [4,5] = Shapely and attractive, [6] = Nicki Minaj.

Sexual experience: Roll 1 die. (Spectrum) 1 is a virgin &lt;--&gt; 6 was probably in a fraternity/sorority.

Sexual skill: Roll 1 die. (Spectrum) 1 is a virgin &lt;--&gt; 6 should be writing a sex advice column.

Sexual appetite: Roll 1 die. [1] = Monthly, [2,3] = Weekly, [4,5,6] = Daily. This is how often the character wants (needs?) sex.

-----------------------------

Obviously, I'm still trying to figure this out. We don't need to do include all of these measurements and I'm certainly open to adding other traits/measurements. But first things first! Let's come up with our theoretical company and the people who work there. Once we come up with their office backstories, we can start discovering their sexual side and figure out how they all interact!

Character backstories don't need to be too intense. For example:

* [Lianna](http://i.imgur.com/rTWEjh6.jpg) is in charge of product design. She's always been an overachiever and joined the company immediately after graduating from a prestigious university.

* [Joel](http://i.imgur.com/Vuo7Wna.jpg) does all of the coding. He's likable and competent, but has a tendency to show up late or take long lunch breaks. 

* [Ali](http://i.imgur.com/ySv6cwj.jpg) is a sophomore at the local college and is working part-time as a marketing intern to earn credits for her business degree. She's not afraid to work hard for what she wants... it's just that she's never actually needed to work hard before because everybody is so enamored/intimidated by her!"

I work now as an ""IT Developer"" for a small company, but I have only been there for 3 months. There are more reasons for me to leave for a different position than I'd like to explain, including a 19 year old CIO and internal issues. However, some of the experience I've gained has been valuable. I've picked up some Google AdWords skills, and worked with a third-party API that was pretty complicated, as well as gained managerial experience over an intern in our department. But, since I have only been there for 3 months, should I bother including this in my resume, or would it look bad?

5skvki,2,2017-02-07,My [23/m] girlfriend [21/f] of almost 2 years isn't sure about relationship anymore. I don't know what to do..,startup_vin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5skvki/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_of_almost_2_years_isnt_sure/,"We've been in this relationship for almost 2 years now and this is my first relationship. Before me she still had her 'highschool boyfriend' with whom she broke up. Although she didn't cheat with me we already met before she broke up with her previous boyfriend and we started hanging out soon after. Fast forward 3-4 months and we already have a relationship. I thought this might be useful context for what's currently happening.


It all started when I went on an internship abroad as part of my studies for 3 months (we've been apart for 4-8 weeks before but this was the longest). During that time she kind of noticed that she really liked being alone and that she didn't really seem to miss me. She already hinted me about this during my period away but I didn't really think much of it. Afterwards when I came back I really noticed the difference from before I went away. She was much more detached all of the sudden and seemed less happy overall. This went on for about 6 weeks until now and although things got better slowly it still wasn't the same as before I went away. So this weekend something snapped and she stopped talking almost completely with me, and I really wanted to know what's wrong. Resulting in her telling me what's wrong past sunday night (after continuously asking what's wrong..).


That's when she told me she's not sure if she really loves me anymore and actually has no clue what to do next. She kind of decided that it's best to take some space and not sleep together every night (we don't live together) and not spend so much time in each others rooms in order to test if she starts missing me then. This really broke me and although obviously I had some doubts every now and then about the relationship I never thought about it this way. I also asked her why she didn't try to tell me before, but she told me she was so reluctant to tell me because then the situation was actually becoming real. 

Resulting in me being really down right now. She said that I shouldn't feel too bad about it and it's a good chance that it will be okay if we work on this. However, I'm feeling quite pessimistic at the moment. Since this is my first 'real' relationship I'm turning to you for advice. I really hope that you could help me with the situation and maybe prepare me for the worst.


Thanks for reading. Also thanks in advance for any advice you kind strangers!        "

I am looking for an internship for a Front-End Engineering position. I have experience in:   
* ReactJS/Redux  
* jQuery,  
* Javascript,  
* HTML/CSS.   
Also, some Back-End tech I am familiar with are  
* MySQL  
* Express  
* Socket.IO  

The reason I have made a career switch to Computer Programming, is that I find a interest in this industry. It is a industry that is constantly growing, and with that, comes a challenge that I have been looking for. There is always something new to learn, and with that, comes the need for gaining knowledge in the industry. The chase for learning new things, never ends, which can be frustrating and rewarding at the same time. I am always willing to learn new things, in and out of my career path. A quote that has always stuck with me, is ""If a man has peaked, he should just die"". With that quote, I feel like I should never peak, but, only to keep growing as a human.

Any advice from people who were in similar situations would be great!

So I am a stats major and math minor at a large public school with a strong stats program.  I've done pretty well, about a 3.6 overall gpa and 3.8 in stat classes.  The math classes I've taken are calc 2, 3, linear algebra, intro-proof writing, analysis, and game theory.  I know both R and SAS, as well as Latex (idk if this matters at all hah).

I worked on an undergraduate research project this fall, building a pretty extensive shiny application that scraped and analyzed data on tennis players over their careers.  I also will have had two ""data science"" internships at a software company under my resume.

I plan to take the GRE and subject tests, if needed, this summer.

My general questions are:
* Does my resume indicate I could succeed in a PhD program?
* What other things should I consider when deciding whether or not to apply?
* And just any other information/advice would be awesome!"

5smp6h,12,2017-02-07,Musing: I interviewed and did not hire an INFJ,RoosterBearTiger,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/5smp6h/musing_i_interviewed_and_did_not_hire_an_infj/,"A few months back, I was interviewing candidates for an internship on my team. There was one candidate who had a very impressive resume and portfolio. When I brought her in for the interview, I figured it would be a quick decision to hire her. But then she completely bombed the interview.

The experience really stuck with me because, during the course of the interview, I learned that she is also an INFJ. Part of me wanted to hire her because I saw so much of myself in her (how could I not?) and I wanted to stand in solidarity with a fellow INFJ. But I absolutely could not move her forward in the process.

She had an education in marketing/advertising, and all of her samples were creative campaigns. I was hiring a technical writing intern. I knew she could write, but I needed her to investigate, dig for answers, question things. I needed someone with gumption.

That's something that an INFJ is completely capable of. I know that. But when I interviewed this young INFJ, she was so overly meek, so self-defeating, I couldn't justify moving her forward.

I asked her, ""Tell me about a time you made a mistake,""
She responded, ""Oh, there's just so many.""
I asked her, ""Why should I hire you?""
She said, ""You shouldn't.""

Her reluctance to sell herself, her strengths, and her skills absolutely floored me. I recognize an over-abundance of humility in myself at work, which hasn't quite served me. But I've always at least been able to speak to my strengths in a job interview. 

She just wouldn't fight for herself, or the job, and I couldn't take that gamble with such a high risk that the Development department would swallow her whole.

Since this experience, I've been left wondering if this is a common problem for other INFJs or if she just didn't want the job. And I wonder if other people feel the frustration I felt with her when working with me. It was certainly eye-opening and proved that even though I hate ""selling"" myself or accomplishments, that sometimes that's exactly what others want to hear."
5smvla,139,2017-02-07,"I [20F] surprisingly told my friend [21M] to f*** off. I have been fighting a lot with friends lately, my boyfriend [24M] says my attitude is now very alluring, as I'm becoming more decisive. Or am I just mean?",lizardofhope,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5smvla/i_20f_surprisingly_told_my_friend_21m_to_f_off_i/,"[REPOST because I used the b word and my submission got deleted]

In the past 6 months or so I have pretty much lost 3 of my dearest friends. 

The first and the closest one I lost because she was extremely bitter and hid under the excuse that she was sad. She decided to use a boy to not be sad anymore, I told her that that was unethical and disrespectful to him and the friendship pretty much ended there. ""I thought you were my best friend how dare you judge me!"" I apologized for the way I spoke, she decided she still wanted to be mad.

The second friend I lost because he broke up with his girlfriend, started texting me every day for 2 months. Nothing wrong with that, he said my support really helped him. He was in love with me years ago, I think it's important to know, since he now started to ask me inappropriate questions and flirting subtly, even though he knows I am taken. I asked him to stop, he did it again. What bothered me is that he stopped talking to his friends after he got into a relationship with his ex, and now that he needs me again he texts me every day, without even asking how I am doing. I told him to stop texting me, because he does it in an inappropriate way.

The third friend, 21M, is a weird guy. He's intelligent, but very envious and bitter. We live in an increasingly poor European country, so his family can't afford to send him to college. He's been trying to find a job for 2.5 years, and he's still unemployed. He was very depressed, but he found a girlfriend 6 months ago and he's gotten better. Today I asked him if he's going to spend some time away with his girlfriend in the summer, he said: ""We're both going to try to find a job. We don't lounge here you know, or at least try not to. We don't have the money to go anywhere anyways."" 

I am in a happy long distance relationship with an American man. My family moved to Switerzland some years ago so we are now decently well off and I can afford to visit him twice a year. 

I asked: ""'We don't lounge here'? Who does?"" 

""You do. You go to the US multiple times a year."" 

Normally, that wouldn't affect me much, but I got so incredibly pissed off. I have been doing an internship for the past 3 months, so I work 8 hours a day and at the same time I've been trying to pass all of my college classes, which I succeeded to do in the past exam session, that finished last week. I have been studying so incredibly hard on top of my internship to be able to keep up with university, and it probably didn't help that the exams finished some days ago and I immediately went back to work, so I'm still very tired but very proud of myself. What he said offended me quite a lot, because it seems to me that he was trying to say that I am lazy and that I don't work for anything. So I told him to fuck off.

What's interesting here is that I have never been like this. I have always been very compassionate and understanding, and I hate confrontation. It's a bad thing, because I couldn't really say ""no"" or be rude to people and that can lead to unsafe situations. 
In the past 6 to 10 months I've become much more decisive and assertive, and my boyfriend thinks that is very alluring and mature of me (to be able to say no and stand up if disrespected). 

My question here is: Am I becoming mean to people or is becoming less afraid of confrontation a good thing? What do you guys think/what's your opinion?

EDIT: I saw someone saying that the friendship with friend 1 might not be completely over, and I agree. I did apologise to her but at the same time I think we both need time apart, as we are growing into different people. I did tell her I still care about her and I will always be there if she really needs me. Right now it´s just really okay to be apart.

Regarding friend 3, a lot of you think I might have been too harsh. Maybe I have been, and I appreciate all of your opinions. Let me tell you a bit more about the story: yes, me asking him if he was going on vacation might have been inconsiderate, I did not think too much about that question because going somewhere with your SO for a couple days is extremely common, all of our common friends and his sister did it, so I was just wondering. I might have overreacted, but in the past he has proven to be very selfish and uncompassionate. His best friend was in love with someone, he tried to make that person fall in love with him just out of spite and envy; I have been harassed by men in the past, some of those situations where very unsettling and he said ""When you tell me about these stories I don´t really feel like they were unfair or that those men acted in a wrong way. I don´t get annoyed or anything. It happens."" I felt like that is not how a friend should act. He said that he´s lucky that his ""girlfriend doesn´t get approached, catcalled and touched by men"", and that was pretty much it. So I probably did overreact, I just realized that he can a bad friend and he´s really not worth it. 

tl;dr: Ended 3 frienships. Am I a b**** or is it good that I'm becoming more decisive?"

I am currently a junior in Highschool and am very interested in pursuing this field in college. I am currently taking that highest math level offered at my school and plan to take computer science next year. At school we have begun to talk about opportunities for camps and internships for our future careers. There was nothing at all for this area of work. I am wondering if any of you have any tips for me on maybe things to do in my last years in Highschool and if there were any learning opportunities that you took advantage of or wish you had. 

Thanks!"

I am needing advice on how I should feel in the beginning of a relationship and whether or not I am compatible with the guy I'm currently with. I've been dating him for about a month now, but we were acquaintances for a few months where I interned. When I was interning, I really liked him in the work place! I thought he was kind, generous, and friendly, which he still is. I really respected how he handles his job and interacts with people and I liked him so much because of that respect. I texted him after I finished my internship and that's how things got started.

The first date we went on was pretty good. We spent the whole day together and walked around, talking and getting to know each other. He never initiated a kiss but asked me to give him kisses which I was fine with at first. I am not good at initiating kisses so I usually do like a closed short kiss. Not terribly exciting but it's the first date so I thought whatever.

Then after that date, I went on vacation for 3 weeks. During those 3 weeks, we skyped almost every day. I thought it was kind of much since we had just started out, but I figured he likes communication and I guess it'd be good to keep the momentum going while I'm away. The large amount of skyping made it feel like I was already in a loooong old relationship past the honeymoon stage!

So then I got back and we had a second date in which we walked around the whole day and ate food. Same kind of date...same method of asking me to initiate the kiss! I'm thinking...if you want to kiss me, then just do it already! You have 10 years of experience on me...why are you expecting me to know how to start smooching. I am used to guys leading and he does not seem to be the leading type. He's super nice, very into the romantic holding hands and stuff like that, likely to be very loyal in a relationship. I value all of that very much. He's an overall reallyyyy nice guy. So then why am I turned off because he isn't more aggressive/taking control of the situation? Is he too nice to initiate physical contact with me? How will we ever do more than just kiss if he's not more forward??

The relationship is moving too fast in terms of the lovey dovey mushy stuff like holding hands and taking coupley pictures! But at the same time, it's not moving fast enough in terms of the physical part. Can that be possible?

Can anyone give me advice on what to do and whether I am just being too picky/impatient or if it's actually a fundamental difference between us?

TLDR; I am dating a guy for a month. He's super nice and we share similar values. However, he is bad at taking the lead and that bothers me. What do I do?"
5so6b1,45,2017-02-07,[Tool] How I effectively Built Positive habits into my life,lampbulb12,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5so6b1/tool_how_i_effectively_built_positive_habits_into/,"Last October when I started my second year of university I was determined to focus on just five things. Gym, passing my classes, learning Mandarin, having a good social life and setting up a summer internship. I had read about how we should only focus on a few things and become good at them.

&amp;nbsp;

University started and the first week I did nothing, it was the first week back and I was partying a lot so I said I’ll start next week. Next week turned into the next week and before I knew it, it was Christmas. I hadn’t even got a gym membership at this point however luckily for Christmas my dad got me a membership. I am the absolute master of intellectualizing issues/analysis paralysis however one new concept came up and has sparked my 2017 into a surprising success where I am achieving most of my goals. The theory of “habits vs goals”. 

&amp;nbsp;

Below are the three reasonably simple points which worked for me and may work for you.

&amp;nbsp;

Point 1; **Habits are much better than goals**. Why? Because habits are healthier and work long term. Let’s take the example of weight loss. Trying to lose 25lbs is a good pursuit however how you achieve this goal is more interesting. Say you starve yourself for 2 months and lose the weight. Now what? Likely you will regain the weight as your method of achieving your goal was not sustainable. Where as if you made the habit of eating healthy meals then naturally the weight will come off and it will stay off. 

&amp;nbsp;

Point 2; **Habits have a specific process**, From the book ‘The power of habit’ I learned about ‘cue vs reward’, it works like:
	“First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop… becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerges.” 
	Considering this, learn to manipulate this system for good. Taking a personal example, every morning I wake up and drink some tea (cue). Which triggers my habit of practicing my Mandarin flashcards. Over time this has essentially become automatic and does not feel like it requires a lot of effort now. So if you want to engrain a habit, think of a cue and build around this. For me waking up at 7am at boarding school was easy, now in university it feels terrible. Same thing, just one was a habit and one wasn’t.

&amp;nbsp;

Point 3; **“The habit ramp”**. I made up this name however the concept is simple enough. The habit ramp responds to building up to the level you want to achieve over time, *one skill at a time*. Again an example from my life. I wanted to have the habit of learning 20 mandarin phrases per day. Therefore, I divided this goal by 10 and work up to it over the course of 10 days. So day 1 = 10% difficulty of goal = 2 phrases. Therefore, day 2 is 4 phrases. Day 3, 6 phrases, all the way up to day 10 with 20 phrases. Of course you can do more in the early days, just make sure you do at least the required amount everyday. So you are doing something slightly more challenging everyday, it just doesn’t need to be such a huge jump to start the habit. As going from no Mandarin to 20 phrases a day would be unsustainable for me realistically. Also using this “habit ramp” I would recommend focusing on one skill a month. It sounds slow and unglamorous however the likelihood is that it is far more effective long term for you and is not too overwhelming at once.

&amp;nbsp;

So I hope you give it a try, I personally found this very useful and it actually stuck unlike reading motivational posts/watching motivational videos. Best of luck!

My boyfriend and I have been together 3.5 years now, more than half of that has been long distance while we both are at different colleges 2,000 miles apart. He is currently in the National Guard but will go active duty when he graduates in 1-2 years. 

We've always been able to get through the long distance. It was tough but we knew it was worth it. Now a days it seems to be getting tougher as I am looking for summer internships in DC but he will stay home in order to report for duty once a month. It is just starting to look like there is no end in sight. 

On top of it all, I am starting to struggle with how I am going to cope with the struggle of conflicting careers. I am studying international relations and I hope to build a career in the federal government but I am worried that I am going to have to give up my dreams to be with him. Does anyone know of career opportunities on bases (if we are stationed)? How do most spouses deal with this situation? Thanks for the guidance. "

West Chelsea is pretty desolate when it comes to getting a quick bite for dinner. I'm usually at the office from 6 to 11pm (or later) and just get these insaaaane sushi cravings.

It's an unpaid internship and I'm a college student, so **I'm far from rolling in cash**. I'm looking for a grocery store (preferably small Japanese, but I suppose any will do if I'm desperate) with CHEAP sushi (like, **50c per piece** cheap) to pick up on my way to work. I need those nutrients, but I can't afford most places. I found this great place on 7th st - ""Grab &amp; Go"" - that's wicked cheap, but it's too far from the office.

I welcome sit-down place recommendations (for the future) if you have any, but it will be a while before I can go to them because tipping and time and everything is just too much.

Thanks so much, guys!! &lt;3

**TL;DR: Broke college student needs CHEAP sushi to-go. I get off at Grand Central and take the 7 to 34th Hudson Yards, so anywhere along/near any of those stops or GCT itself.** I'm also open to Harlem-125th area.

So I know I need to come out, but I just don't feel comfortable to only come out to my mom and siblings and leave my dad out of it. We have a good relationship but he's very conservative and narrow-minded in his views. So that'll be difficult.
On the other hand I want to just be able to go to the LGBT activities here (there's quite a big LGBT scene), but I could run into family members/friends all the time. This is hard.

This is my personal recount of my journey towards understanding the nuances of human sexual dynamics as described by the Red Pill philosophy. How I went from a useless virgin college student looking for love to a valuable virgin clerk worker living only for himself and his job. It accounts my struggles with Oneitis, and my attempts to break free from its grasp.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

&amp;nbsp;

My friends, before I begin I just have to say one thing. There is nothing more noble than the pursuit of truth, personal fulfillment and happiness, but this will that I am about to say will be one of the absolute truths of my reality, that not even when my mind becomes addle by old age and dementia will erase. I’ll carve this truth on the walls, scribble it until the chalk runs out and write with my bloody fingertips. I will scream it on the top of my lungs and carry it on my lips until the day I die.

&amp;nbsp;

**Oneitis is cancer.**

&amp;nbsp;

Twice in my life, this horrible disease plagued me. Once in my teens and now in my late twenties, and both times it nearly destroyed me. My last bout with this crippling condition lasted well over seven years, and only recently with the help of the Red Pill have I managed to break free.

&amp;nbsp;

My tale goes something like this. Boy meets girl. Boy does college assignment with girl, doesn’t find her particularly special then. She wasn’t that pretty, a bit on the chubby side, fidgety and timid like a naked hermit crab. A very gregarious timid hermit crab, as I would find out. Now normally, a girl like this wouldn’t even register on my radar. My reasoning was that after suffering what I did with girls in high school, I just swore off women and relationships in my life altogether, and resigned myself to a celibate lifestyle. Like a chump, might I add. A year passed with nothing or worth going in my life (a trend that continued during my entire college years). 

&amp;nbsp;

And another year passed. We were assigned to the same class the year after that, and often sat near each other on the amphitheater. More like, she sat near me during classes, as I just kept to myself and sat alone near the exit. And this went on for a time, with minimal interaction between the two of us.

&amp;nbsp;

And then it hit me like a mallet to my chest. Like a weakness in my heart, a shaking to my legs and knot in my stomach. I knew this feeling all too well. And so, the tale reaches its climax.

&amp;nbsp;

Boy becomes infatuated with girl.

&amp;nbsp;

Most romantic inclined writers would describe this feeling as love. I now spit on that notion. This feeling I suffered was my brain tripping out on a cocktail of hormones, driving my conscious self completely crazy. My friends, this feeling is the death knell of logic and the treason of all reason. Love is as fake as the gynocentric holidays that take place in this disgusting age built to suit bra burning women.

&amp;nbsp;

Yet despite my attempts to break free from this spell, time passed and its influence gripped me tighter. It drove me to madness, having this female who was nothing to me be transformed into a magical creature, and every inch of my body craved being near this woman. I closed my eyes, and there she was. Every time we crossed paths, my heart felt like it was exploding. I wanted to talk to her, know her, smell her, touch her. And the more my body demanded, the more deranged its demands became. I tried talking to her, but words just wouldn’t come out. Maybe if I leave a note, I thought. That’s something that happens in Disney movies, right? Placed the note on her and… Nothing. Maybe a flower? That’s something romantic no? Again nothing. Guess I’ll talk to her then, maybe she’ll listen? But I could barely speak when I’m near earshot of her.

&amp;nbsp;

My friends, tokens of affection and declarations of love never worked. Didn’t worked in medieval times, didn’t work in the 50s, and they certainly don’t work now. And the brilliant, ground conclusion I arrived back then? The reality I knew was a lie, my college was a congregation of celibate nuns and they have no interest in men. I’ve been a dumbass all my life, I know, even my conclusions misinterpret the reality in front of me. Guess I could just look at her, since she’s such a beautiful woman, perhaps? Oh, I did look at her, often so intensely it left her silhouette scarred on my retinas for hours. And she still was a timid hermit crab, but my Oneitis filtered my eyes so that I couldn’t see this girl for what she really was. And so, I became a creep.

&amp;nbsp;

Being Blue Pill as I was, and a genuine nice guy sucker, I felt remorse for having unrequited feeling towards a woman, and didn’t want her to think I was a creep. My friends, you all know better than I do the importance of frame. Of sticking to your guns, to state loud and clear what you want and what you need. Being a wimp will get you no girl. Being considerate, kind and friendly will kick you in the balls hard and turn them blue. And thus, for the sake of my own well-being, I started to avoid this girl. My time in college ended, and we both went our separate ways. And that was that.

&amp;nbsp;

Or so I thought. The entropy of this universe always trends towards its maximum perversity, and the universe wasn’t done tormenting me just yet.

&amp;nbsp;

After dropping out of college, most men my age would just stay home and get fat, play video games and eat junk until their hearts collapse. Not me, I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be a secretary. And my time in college wasn’t so much spent on learning the stuff they were teaching, but instead learning and honing a set of skills. Excel spreadsheets, graphic design, web design, accounting, statistics. My life was worth it and my life hence forward was all about being a better me. And not only did I managed to get a professional school to teach me how to be a secretary, I got the government to pay for it too, with a scholarship on top of it. During internship, my strict work ethic, my charm and natural charisma (which only surface on a familiar work environment for some reason) scored me a contract in a firm. Minimal wage, but I don’t need much more than that, and I get to slack on Reddit from time to time. Every person on my office likes me, from my bosses to the janitor. Life in the last two years has been good and fulfilling, and I’m happy now.

&amp;nbsp;

But as fate has it, job obligations forced me to cultivate myself further higher. As requested by my bosses, I was to attend a seminar and workshop about unemployment, and the focus groups dedicated to help out unemployed adults finding a calling in their lives. I did not hesitate to spend an entire day bettering myself and get paid to do it, so I accepted gladly.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t need to tell who I met on this seminar, now do I? Yes, that girl from my college years was there. Apparently, she finished her degree and found that being a timid hermit crab makes it hard to work in Human Resources, especially when you have the allure of a beached dead dolphin. And even as I tell you things as they are, as cold logic and reason dictates reality as it is, my Oneitis struck me with a vengeance. The moment I saw her there, my heart skipped a beat. And another. I feel that I was clinically dead for at least a full ten seconds before I slapped myself back to life.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, this was two months ago, and I was still very much a Blue Pill Beta Bucks in the making, despite denouncing contact with women. Particularly hard when in my office, I’m practically the only male clerk working there. But the workshop went on as expected, with me absolutely mesmerized by the timid hermit crab in front of me. She couldn’t care less that I existed, probably didn’t even remembered we took classes together and went on to do her hermit crab things. At the end of it, a surge of courage jolted through me.  Against reason I argued that, it was destiny, and that I must ask this girl out on a date. And I did. She said yes. But here’s the catch you see. She didn’t give me her phone number. Rather, she asked me to befriend her on Facebook. Now I sort of comprehend the importance of this, but back then even table scraps and a shred of hope was all I needed.

&amp;nbsp;

After I was over the euphoria, logic and reason resumed their scheduled programming. I asked this girl out yes, but now what? I had no idea on what to do even if I managed to meet her at a coffee shop. What should I even talk about? What should I wear? Do I touch her on the first date, or wait for the third date to make a move? Do I even know how to kiss a woman?

&amp;nbsp;

I turned to the internet for answers of course. And in my journey of discovery on how to be a man, I found you guys. I found The Red Pill subreddit. For days, I devoured every piece of information regarding female behavior I could find, and the more I read, the more I understood. And this changed me to my very core, slowly but surely.

&amp;nbsp;

As I kept reading on how to engage a woman, I started prodding conversations at my Oneitis. What she did, who she was and her passions. Despite having a grasp of the Red Pill, I was still very much plugged in. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I tried to set a date with the timid hermit crab, and invite her to a social party happening at my workplace. Lots of important people, lots of connections and free food. It would be in her best interest to come, I thought. But she was too busy, she said, and was sick to boot. I knew she was unemployed for years, so how busy could she be? I didn’t even have a chance to say where the date was going to be but she shot me down all the same. Guess she wasn’t interested after all, so I move on. Instead of having a girl keeping me company, I humored the children of my colleagues and taught them the joys of playing Minecraft. Having fatherly instincts must be a blue pill thing, right?

&amp;nbsp;

Two weeks passed without her saying a word, but after New Year’s Eve she contacts me out of the blue. But why? Is she really interested in a date now? Or is she duping me for attention, like the Red Pill says women often do? No matter, I’ll go with the flow and ask her out one more time after buttering up with a conversation. She didn’t bother answering me this time and dodged the question. I asked her again when would there be a good time for us to meet, and she simply kept quiet. Well then, if she doesn’t want anything to do with me, why does she keeps me on her Facebook. Why does she keeps contacting me back after I start getting over her? Is she trying to keep me as an orbiter? Is that it?

&amp;nbsp;

Another two weeks passed with complete radio silence between the two of us, and I was reading everything I could get my hands on from the manosphere. Devouring information like a starving dog, I began to feel empowered by the unplugged world views I learned. Knowledge is power. And once more, the hermit crab spoke to me. But I was ready this time. I stroke a conversation with her, and I was getting a general idea of what kind of person she was. And the timid hermit crab was boring as a sack of bricks. She had no hobbies, no passions. Her days were mostly spent reading Facebook, playing Candycrush or collecting stops in Pokémon Go. Every odd Saturday night, she would have a meet with her friends. She visited an Unemployed Anonymous help group and struggled with failed recruitment interviews. Even my life as a social shut-in was more exciting that hers! The veil was finally lifting.
But there was just one thing bugging me. Why does she keeps coming back? Is it pity? Curiosity? Sadism? Is she even interested in me at all? In knowing who I am? What I do? What I live for? I confronted her, asked her why she kept talking to me? And she dodged the question. Frustrated, I had a final gambit to play. One question. All in. No regrets. Winner takes all. And so, I asked her this:

&amp;nbsp;

*“Hey, timid hermit crab. Do you have a boyfriend?”*

&amp;nbsp;

This was a rigged question of course, I knew perfectly well she didn’t had a boyfriend. If she had, her Facebook would be littered with pictures of the two lovebirds. But I wanted to hear from her, I wanted to touch her single life and see how she reacted. But her answer though, I think she couldn’t have answered this question in a more deliberate way to hurt me, even if she wanted to:

&amp;nbsp;

*“No. But there’s this boy I know, and I don’t like him. Sorry.”*

&amp;nbsp;

Not only she took a jab at me, but she doesn’t even have the gall of saying it straight to my face. She didn’t put me down slowly, she tossed me on the ground! She didn’t even know me! She didn’t even give me a chance! But she did string me along knowingly for two months. This is what I am to expect of women, this is what they are, this is what they do to betas like me. The final piece of the big picture, the last kernel of truth I needed to finally open my eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

I thanked her. Truly. I thanked her for her small part in my ascension, in my unplugging. I told her exactly that, and warned her that I would write this article. From that day forward, I was cured from Oneitis. The spell was broken. I was free!

&amp;nbsp;

*****

&amp;nbsp;


**Lessons Learned:**

My friends, I am spineless. A pushover. Always have been, always will be. I’m part of the bottom 80%. And despite subscribing to the ideas and advices explored by the endorsers and contributors of this subreddit, no amount of lifting or self-improvement will ever make me desirable to women in any other form than a free meal ticket of Beta Bucks. And that’s okay! It really is! I’ll still strive to be a better me. I’ll meditate, I’ll dress better, groom myself. But I’ll be doing that for one reason only. For me. For my personal growth. And for that, I thank you, Red Pill. Thank you.

&amp;nbsp;

As for the timid hermit crab? She can go suck on a lemon. Also, Oneitis is cancer.

I don't feel the want to smoke but rather I just feel down that she is going away for another 7 months after being gone for 7 months last year. Last time she was gone I used to self medicate with weed, and I really don't want to go back to that to avoid missing her. I'm probably in the wrong subreddit, but I guess what I'm asking is, how have you all coped with missing a loved one since quitting weed? I know i can go see her once a month which is comforting, but the anxiety and thoughts of ""is this worth going through again?"" Keep creeping in. For me, the answer is always yes she is worth it (been together for ~3yrs) but when I'm down I start to think about it and I just end up feeling so bittersweet and melancholy about it all. 

Any advice is appreciated, I love you all! "

5ssku3,21,2017-02-08,[40i] A phone call to Hana,sketches1637,JVX,https://www.reddit.com/r/JVX/comments/5ssku3/40i_a_phone_call_to_hana/,"*8 February 2017*

Hana tended the small garden outside her tea house. She could hear the traffic of downtown Tokyo, but her small building was tucked perfectly amid the skyscrapers that the noise sounded distant, even if the street was less than 50 meters away. From three centuries ago, when she first opened the tea house, until just two decades ago, few knew this tea house even existed. Her online reviews in the past decade had changed that, with her tea house becoming a sort of morning or lunch or happy hour refuge for the rising businesswoman class in the city plus the occasional tourist attraction.

There were 14 customers inside, a typical Wednesday morning, and Hana had no doubt her employees were taking good care of them. She preferred to use this time of day to trim the bushes with her small knife, branch by branch, needle by needle. Even though she appeared a young woman, she had the mannerisms and slow movements of someone who was decades older. 

Her morning meditative gardening was interrupted by Jane, a foreign exchange student she employed off books, “Hana-san, you have a phone call.” She held out a cell phone, which Hana regarded quizzically rather than grabbed.

“Do you know who it is?” Hana asked, still looking at the phone.

""Her Japanese wasn’t very good."" Jane commented, a bold statement, Hana thought, for an exchange student who still stumbled over the basics. ""I think she said her name was Aanya, or something like that. She’s calling from India?""

Hana sighed, her shoulders slumped, and she reached for the phone. Looking at the screen for a moment, she tentatively put it up to her ear and in English said a soft, “hello?”

“OH MY GOD. It’s soooo good to hear your voice.” Aanya’s English made her sound like she was a modern high school student in California and not a 500 year old woman from New Delhi. “Do you know how hard it is to get ahold of you. You don’t have a phone number. You don’t have WhatsApp, you never check the email account I set up for you. I’ve been trying to get ahold of you for at least three weeks!”

“I don’t think…” Hana tried to respond.

“You don’t even have Facebook. How are you not on Facebook? Even Adam is on Facebook. I mean, he doesn’t post pictures or anything, but he’s there and I can message him. And oh my god,” Aanya took a short breath, ""did you know he is friends with Yong now on Facebook. Yong! The guy who spent 20 years in a Chinese prison and still lives in a country that bans Facebook manages to be on Facebook. How are you not?”

Hana tried again, “I don’t think….”

“You're lucky you had some intern set up your restaurant's website because I would never had tracked you down otherwise. I mean, I can’t get you on Skype or iChat. Did you know I Skyped with Elsa last week. She’s great, by the way. I could tell she's a little nervous about our meeting in April even if she tried to sound calm. You are going right? Getting out of Japan for once? I’m sure your employees will take good care of your restaurant while you’re out….""

“It’s a tea house,” Hana briefly interjected as she stared at the sky. 

“Right, tea, coffee. Got it. Sorry.” Aanya continued, “It was really cute when I was there last year but there is more to the world than your garden. You need to come to come in April. It’s so important. So much going on. We need to make sure our generation is represented. Did you hear about Robert? Did you hear about Violet? Did you see what happened yesterday!!!! I can’t believe….”

Hana hung up. 

""If Aanya calls back,” Hana said as she handed the phone to Jane, ""please tell her that I’m busy, but that I will see her in April and that I will check my email one week from today to read whatever message she sends me.”

As Jane gave a small bow and returned inside, Hana picked her knife back up, put one knee on the ground, and cut a small branch sticking out of the bush to even it out with the branch next to it."

I've had an interest in ethical hacking and programming and I'm just finishing my first couple web development courses. I'm looking to get into tinkering with IoT and website security

Currently im about to enter university in a couple years after finishing my army conscription during which i plan to brush up my programming skills. However I'm actually planning to take a bsc major in computational biology and minor in business

My question: how applicable is computational biology to infosec, as in would the skills be transferrable in any way? Would the computational bio studies be similar enough to cs to help me to land internships in the infosec industry? Can I just enter the infosec industry with self-taught knowledge alone?

Also would it be wiser to just straight up take a degree in cybersecurity or computer science instead?

Tl;dr: looking to take computational biology bsc, would like some advice in case i actually decide to enter infosec instead

Thanks!"

How are the internship possibilities? Thank you."
5st2tx,6,2017-02-08,I [22 M] broke-up with my girlfriend [21 F] even though I still very much loved her about a month ago,throwaway8697521234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5st2tx/i_22_m_brokeup_with_my_girlfriend_21_f_even/,"So my girlfriend [21F] and I [22M] have been dating for just over 1 1/2 years and she was my first long-term girlfriend. The only other person I dated lasted for 2 months. Our relationship was great, I loved her very much, she was my best friend, we liked each other's families, she was willing to work out problems with me, etc.. It was honestly a pretty great relationship and she covered most of my ""What I want in a girlfriend"" checklist. Logically it makes no sense at all to break up with her. 

Some things did bother me though. One of which that I always felt she was kind of needy. Like I felt she needed a lot of my time and I always felt bad saying no whenever she wanted to hangout, which was most days. I felt like at times I couldn't totally be myself and I had to filter what I said sometimes because it bothered her. Like I have a very crude mouth and say pretty much anything that comes to mind regardless of how stupid it was, but I don't like filtering what I say. I also couldn't talk politics with her because she would get really upset, especially regarding the current election. Lastly, whenever she did get upset she would always say ""It's fine"" or  ""Nothing's wrong"" which drove me fucking mad even after I've talked to her about it plenty of times. My entire family also said that when I was around her I acted differently.

Onto my reasoning for breaking up:
We met 2 summers ago when I had an internship in the city she is from. I had absolutely no friends and all my coworkers were way older than me and definitely not people I would hang out with. I also stayed on in a college dorm where I shared a single room with anther, shitty, roommate and he never left. So being extremely bored after work /r/tinder inspired me to fuck around on tinder and attempt to get some karma (Hint: I failed miserably). I went into this summer with absolutely no intention of dating anyone and honestly had no intention of even hooking up with anyone on tinder. All I wanted to do was maybe make a friend. Anyways so we match because she realized that we went to the same college based on one of my shirts, and we had a great texting conversations for the next few days. We decide to go on date after some time and we really hit it off well. After 2 weeks of hanging out every day after work until 1-2am, I asked if she just wanted to be my girlfriend because it’s pretty obviously it was going t happen sooner or later. Yes, I realize that was really quick, but spending that much time together, being really happy with her, as well as other reasons, I figured why not.. Anyways up to this point I never really felt that passionate feeling or ""spark"" like I've felt before, but I just figured that just shit that happens with your first love and continued on, but I always kept it in the back of my mind.

In November, 5 months later, we said we loved each other, however, it was pretty much only love as a best friend and companion rather than passionately like lover or girlfriend should also be. A couple months later, after winter break when we were apart, we ended up almost breaking up. I began doubting that the way I feel is the right way and I should feel the way I've been expecting. She's good looking, cute face and pretty good body, but I see girls that I thought were way hotter and obtainable and I kinda began wishing I had a hotter girlfriend. I knew I shouldn't desire hotter girls or masturbating to the thought of banging other girls, but being 21 and really horny I couldn't suppress my hormones. So this also kinda fucked with my head a little, and I think it was a big case of the grass is always greener. I really hated myself for these invasive thoughts, though. Lastly, I began worrying if she is the one and how much of my life am I missing out by being with her, especially with the new confidence with girls I have from a first relationship. A similar occurrence happened again sometime during this past summer, but we talked through it.

So she is a grade below me and I will graduate next spring. I am studying engineering, and this summer I have an internship at an automotive company a few states away which will most likely lead to a full-time job when I graduate. Assuming I like automotive and stick with it I'll be very locked into the Rust Belt, which means extreme long distance this summer and for a full year after I graduate. She on the other hand, has chosen a career path that will allow her to work anywhere. So this means once she graduates she will leave everything and move to me. Since we both have family in the same state we will both be leaving everything behind. Essentially she also told me that she probably won't leave with me unless she is confident that I'm not going to dump her after she leaves everything behind for me, I.E. getting engaged. We talked about this around the beginning of December and I had already been questioning my relationship again right after thanksgiving. This prospect freaked me the fuck out because essentially I'm gonna be fully locked down in 1 1/2 years and I would have missed out on so much of my life that I feel need to experience during some of the best years of my life while single.

So she came down to visit me at home for New Years and dropped my bomb of doubts and stuff and we got super close to breaking up, but I told myself I could make it through and that I just need to change myself. It was also the night before New Years and we were both very excited for it and I didn't want to ruin it. So everything was fine after that, or so I thought. Then a week later I go on a ski trip and thought a lot about our convo and decided I needed to end it a live it up because I can't miss this part of my life. I came back and broke up with her. She was super mad because she had been expecting this since that night and she felt betrayed that I kept her waiting for 2 weeks and I should have just ended it then. I didn't think I was gonna do it so it's kind of a shitty miss understanding. I still love her to death and really hated to leave my best friend and a girl that I would love to marry and have kids with. However I knew I would have to end it at some point, live my life and find myself, and I figured ending it now would be easier than in 1 1/2 years.

Now its been about a month, I'm very depressed, not suicidal. That'd be stupid to break up with her and then proceed to kill myself; it wouldn't have served much of a purpose to break up in the first place. I understand it's just normal grief and time will pass, but I resent myself for doing it and generally hate my life day to day. I also saw her on campus and I tried talk to her about 2 weeks ago. She told me not to talk to her since she's still pissed and she will talk to me when she is ready, but I haven't heard back. I still love her so much. I feel like everything that I expected and wanted is pretty much non-existent and I really don't even want to hook up with other girls either. Maybe it’s because I'm depressed. She told me the day I broke up with her that she said if I wanted to try this relationship again, she still loves me and would want to. Obviously within a reasonable time before she gets over me. I couldn't ever see us breaking up in normal, we were very compatible and I know neither of us would have ever cheated. 

I’ve been having thoughts lately that I should try and get back together with her, and today I ran into her at the gym and we had some short chats between reps. It’s weird because last time we saw each other it was painfully awkward between us, but this time we actually exchanged some smiles and laughs. And to be honest, that was the first time I’ve been genuinely happy with myself since I broke up with her.

One more side note she had a long term ex that she was on and off with up until about 6 or 8 months before we met. However, the last time she talked to him and blocked him on all social media was like 3 months before we met. I also think a lot of how I felt was influenced by my brother seeing girls as a distraction from success. He loves himself more than anyone else, while I love everyone else and sometime hate myself. So he’s imprinted a lot of negativity towards me being in a serious relationship and letting it distract me from being as productive and successful as I could be.

So my questions are:
Should I take today as a sign that maybe I should try and get back together with her? Also were my feelings and reasoning for breaking up with her in the first place normal, or was I just being dumb?

Anyways I appreciate any feedback y'all have
Sorry for the long post

  ---   
 
TL;DR: Broke up with my 1 1/2 year girlfriend a month ago, whom I still loved, because I felt like I haven't gotten to experience a lot of my life by being in a relationship. The way our relationship was headed I would have broken up with her within 1 1/2 years if our relationship continued and ending it sooner than later would be easier. However, I ran into her today and we had a very brief chat about random BS, and for the first time since we broke up I was genuinely happy again. Is this a sign I shouldn’t have broken up with her? Also are my original feelings and reasoning for breaking up normal?

5su40t,4,2017-02-08,Desperately need advice with going into a Dietetics Program versus Nursing.,[deleted],dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/5su40t/desperately_need_advice_with_going_into_a/,"Hello! I have been very stressed lately with what to pursue a degree in. Some background information: I am 24, I have an associates degree in Art, and have about $18,000 in federal student loans(originally 14 grand, but interest accumulated, yada yada I screwed up). I changed my major twice when I was younger, went to an art school for a year and a half(hence the student loans) and had some major family/personal health issues and did not go to school then later continued onto community college. I was planning on being a french teacher, realized my heart wasn't completely for it and job security was not worth the additional loans I would need to get a 4 year degree. So, I have to take a lot of science pre-reqs in order to get into a program. I have been extremely interested in nutrition for the past 5 years and never really comprehended I could go to school for it until recently. I am currently taking some pre-reqs to get into a Nutrition program. I love the classes I am taking right now (Anatomy+Biology). I am volunteering with Food Pantries, Meals on Wheels, and I work part time in an organic juice/smoothie bar.
My problem is after research, it seems RD's are having a tough time finding jobs, internships are super difficult to get into, and only have a median salary of around 50 grand. I am terrified to take any more student loans on something that I won't be able to pay back. However, I also understand RD's with jobs are not going to be on internet forums talking about how great this field is. 
This is where the nursing part comes in. Nursing programs seem to be easier to get into than the Dietetics program, plus the job security that comes with it. I know a lot of nurses working straight after a BSN and make $69,000 a year. I am a smart individual and know I can get through both programs, I am just worried about the payoff. My heart is not completely in nursing, I don't really like the idea of giving people medication rather than changing lifestyle habits. (Obviously, medication is not evil and a lot of people NEED meds in order to live, but I personally see so many people pounding down meds instead of changing their lifestyle habits etc) However, I simply want to help people and make myself useful to society and if I could pay my student loans with a nursing degree, I will do it. I don't want to nurse for the rest of my life. I want to be a Dietician. I don't know if I should get a BSN and work for a couple of years as an RN and then get a coordinated Master's in Nutrition and become an RD. 
My other option is not being scared of student loans and just doing the Dietetics program to become an RD and not pursue nursing at all. 
Pros of Nursing: Money and the fact the I am helping people
Cons: Not exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life. 

TL;DR: I don't know if I should go into nursing for the pay, when my heart isn't completely in it, and then, after I can afford it, pursue to get a Masters in Dietetics (which I truly want to do) or just go straight into a degree in Dietetics and forget about nursing. 

[EDIT] I want to add I don't need an extravagant lifestyle. I don't care about having a super high salary. I simply want to have a career in helping people and not be in debt for the rest of my life. The only reason I am focused on salary is to get out of debt as fast as possible. After I am debt-free, salary isn't the biggest factor for me.

Any advice at all would be helpful. I am just trying to get my life together after a lot of setbacks. Seriously want to thank you if you read all of this. "
5su4cs,31,2017-02-08,I just finished RHONY!,mokokona,BravoRealHousewives,https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/5su4cs/i_just_finished_rhony/,"OMG THIS WAS THE BEST THING EVER! Thank you so much for the members who told me to watch this incredible show. 

So, I just wanna add some of my thoughts about some of the housewives. I hope you all share yours so we could get ready for season 9 &lt;3.

Sonja: Sonja is my favorite housewife from NY and probably my ultimate goddess. She is funny, genuine, nice... I can relate to her and her inability to let some things go. I love her lifestyle, the interns, the sexy J, how she has this amazing manor but is humble enough to clean her own toilet. She had her bad momments (like asking for fans to make her logo when Heather helped her so much) and the TipsyGirl controversy (I actually believe that she wasn't being mean or trying to cheat on Bethenny's brand). She is so fun and made for tv. &lt;3 I hope she finds love and money and everything she deserves.

Heather: man the HOLLAAAAs were annoying, but i actually LOVE her. Heather spokes her mind, is honest and such a great mother and friend. I miss her with Carole, who turned into this horrible bully season 8 and kind of lost her magic... their friendship was so real &lt;3 I don't see many people talking about her in the forums (maybe cuz she is gone), so I would like to know your general thoughts on her.

Ramona: Ramona can be a horrible person but god was she made for TV. She is hilarious! The catwalk is one of the best moments in RH history. 

Jill Zarin: seeing her going from voice of reason to mean girl was very entertaining! I wish she was in the show because like Heather she ins't affraid to speak her mind. I miss the 'BAAAAWWWBYs' too.

LuAnn: I used to love her (mostly because of her iconic voice), I love her musics but she doesn't learn, lol. I feel so bad for her staying with Tom after the cheating scandal, she was so desperate to get married in a very sad way... She is always going to be &lt;3 the Countess &lt;3 in my heart tho. 

Bethenny: I used to love her SO much, she was very real and gives great talking heads. She is wit, funny, sarcastic... and then she came back a little meanier and rude, but I understand that her life was shitty... She is great and I hope she doesn't leave the show again. 

Dorinda: I want to drink with her so much, she seems a blast of fun and I love how she needs subtitles lol

I also love &lt;3 Kelly &lt;3, she is insane but in a cute way? I don't know how to explain but I had so much fun when she was around. 

Season 3 and season 8 were the best, there were lots of memorable fights, drama and funny momments. I also watch BH but NY is so much better, these ladies know how to keep things fresh and not bore me. People told me that seasons 5 and 6 weren't that great but (even missing the original cast) Carole, Heather and Aviva were amazing in season 5. I don't like Carole that much anymore because I think she is very mean and adds nothing to the show. We get it, you date a younger guy. Aviva was a psycho but SO funny, throwing her leg was the most desperate thing she could do to stay on the show and she did it. Jules was funny (I still don't get the fork in the pizza tho), Kristen had that horrible husband, Alex was weird in the beggining but was amazing seasons 3 and 4, and Cindy... well, she didn't even tried to be relevant. 

Hope you like this (cuz I MADE IT NICE) and feel free to ask or interact about your favorite housewive, catfights and stuff.  "
5su7wl,1,2017-02-08,"(Ex) Girlfriend [20F] broke up me with me [21M] after a few very complicated months (including depression, lack of sex, uncertainty). Help me figure this out?",callofdjibouti,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5su7wl/ex_girlfriend_20f_broke_up_me_with_me_21m_after_a/,"So my ex-girlfriend and I started dating a couple of semesters ago and it was pretty much something out of a movie (for the first few months). We were reasonably good friends and naturally progressed into something more - and even though I wasn't sure about it at the very beginning, she won me over with her love and sincerity. Sadly, I'm an international student and couldn't stick around for that summer after complications with my internship yadda yadda so we had to go long-distance for a while.

It wasn't the worst thing and we still talked pretty much every single day - basically moving our honeymoon phase into the virtual world. The summer wasn't amazing for me as I broke my foot and was generally unhappy with how things had panned out. I wasn't in the best place overall so I would often question the relationship in my head and ask myself where it was going etc etc until a couple of pep talks from my friends made me realise I was stressing myself with hypothetical scenarios for no reason - and that it was just a side-effect of how much I liked her. I felt guilty about maybe neglecting her in the process and apologised later but she said she couldn't even tell. Fast forward to the end of the summer and everything's still great as far I as I'm concerned and I'm on my way back super excited to see her.

Now here's where it gets complicated: when I finally got there, it seemed like I came back to a completely different person... and soon after, I found out that she was depressed (she has a history with it and this was mild in comparison according to her; was also going to therapy the semester we started dating). After a rough couple of weeks trying to figure out what was happening, we had a rather emotional discussion about it and how she doesn't know what's wrong/why she's struggling to recapture her feelings + sexuality. I tell her I can't claim to know how she's feeling but I'm here for her and will still be here when it passes. Much of it was linked to the stress of jobs + grad school apps + uncertainty about life in general, but you can never know the full extent of it.

Seeing her like this made me very protective, and I just avoided bringing up any topics that could make her feel worse like the lack of physical intimacy + general excitement, not opening up enough, complications with my future etc. In hindsight, this only added to the problem and created somewhat of an emotional barrier between us - but we could talk about pretty much anything else and loved being around one another. Being the insanely smart girl that she is, she got into grad school and the internship she wanted - which made her feel better to some extent. Initially, she was convinced that this would lead to major improvements, but a couple of weeks later she broke down saying she still wasn't feeling well. While talking about it, she told me that part of it was related to me and how she didn't want me to leave, after which I assured her that I was working hard at finding a job and would keep trying because I genuinely wanted a future with her (and one in the US, of course). It made her feel better and the weeks that followed saw remarkable improvements in our relationship. She was being more affectionate, wanted to spend more time with me, and just generally had more happy days than sad. Unfortunately, the sexual aspect was still lacking and we just kinda accepted it. I would try to initiate it fairly often, and even though I did slack off towards the end, I can't say that I didn't feel physically attracted to her at any point. The semester ends and I spend the night at her place the day before my flight (was heading home for winter break). I genuinely see her the happiest I've seen her in months and she has this twinkle in her eye while looking at me, making me feel like everything's finally great and we're gonna come back from break and really kick on from there. Best of all, she's finally able to say she loves me (I had said it a month ago) and it melts my heart.

So we go off for break (she was travelling a lot and having a great time) and everything seemed perfectly fine until maybe the last week or so where she was kinda distant. We've never been big texters so it's kinda hard to tell in that respect too. I come back having made all these plans about things we're gonna do and the issues we need to address (mainly sex + more open communication) and when we meet, she takes me completely by surprise and says she thinks we shouldn't date any more. I tell her I need time to process this and gather my thoughts, so I text her a couple of days later and we talk over coffee. She tells me I'm a fantastic boyfriend but she feels we've turned into best friends because she just hasn't been able to capture that sexual feeling again (we were super active initially) + doesn't think she loves me that way. We have a fairly calm (and oddly flirty) discussion in which we bring up the things that bothered us, most of which were irrelevant and kinda petty. She brings up topic of jobs + uncertainty about my future again and implies that I didn't try hard enough, I tell her my parents are very supportive of grad school as a back-up (we'll be in the same place for another year if that happens) and that I genuinely have been trying hard af despite what she thinks. Ultimately, we reach the conclusion that we were both in a better place on a personal level when we started dating and should work on being those people again (for say a month or so) and then we'd talk again.

After thinking about this for the last couple of weeks, I've realised that tip-toeing around touchy topics was not the right way to go about it by any means, and that a more assertive approach - in tune with who I am as a person - would've been much more helpful. The shock of seeing someone you care about like that and my lack of experience in that situation got the better of me, but it isn't something that can't be rectified. I also regret not being more vocal about certain feelings in the moment, because having good intentions and making wonderful plans is pointless if your partner isn't aware to some extent. When it comes to the physical aspect, it really isn't a black and white issue - and it's hard for me to break it down. Part of me feels as if a candid discussion about our likes and dislikes in the bedroom and what we could do going forward would've made a world of difference, but then I also feel like she isn't acknowledging the role her illness played and the possibility that it may be more complicated than just 'maybe I don't love you' - especially given the abruptness of it all and the fact that it had happened to her before (part of it could just be a mental block + performance anxiety). I also know that the uncertainty played on her mind a lot... but at the same time, it's inevitable in every relationship at this stage in our lives because we're all trying to find our feet in the world. Sure, the international aspect makes it a little more emphatic, but I genuinely am trying my hardest to create a future here (this difficult political situation isn't helping) and also did/do want a future for us. It's one of those things you just have to put your faith in, because you'll never be able to enjoy the present if you can't imo. She's got a tendency to over-think as well, which makes total sense given that her doubts arose when we weren't in the same place and she wasn't seeing me often - a legitimate form of anxiety in itself if I'm not mistaken.

Now here's my predicament: do I try to advocate giving it another go when I do see her? I have gotten feedback from a lot of friends and while most of them are extremely unhelpful with the typical ""oh, don't worry, you're a wonderful guy, there's so many fish in the sea"" bs, some have been more critical and allowed me to better understand our failures as a couple. Despite our problems, we have a very rare kind of connection and I do still see an immense amount of potential in the relationship. There is literally so much we still have left to explore about one another + so many things to experience together that it feels like we've only scratched the surface. Approaching this with a clear head and no pressure might be exactly what we need to break down any emotional barriers and enjoy that period of vulnerability that our problems took away from us. Sexual aspect is still confusing but I'm confident we can rediscover that too with the right kind of communication. That being said, I don't want to rush back into it either, and would rather take things slow this time to figure out how we feel. I still have issues I need to address in my head tbh, and would have to see a willingness to work on her part for them to subside. This is all one big hypothetical of course, because I might not be able to convince her at all - but part of feeling confident again is regaining the ability to take her answer on the chin. So please help me out guys. What do you think happened? How much of it do you think was down to depression? And most importantly, what do you think I should do?

TL;DR - Started relationship with girl, had an amazing few months. Went away for summer (international student) and everything still seemed great. Come back, find out she's depressed and then try to help her feel better. Sex stops, and we have some problems with communication in the process. She thinks she's feeling better after things start going her way in terms of school + jobs, realises a couple of weeks later that she's still not well. Periodically expresses that she's scared of me going back, I assure her every single time that I will fight for my future and our future as a couple. Things get remarkably better towards the end of the year, we go away for winter break happy. I come back, and she abruptly breaks up with me saying she hasn't been able to rediscover sexuality and feels maybe we just became best friends/she doesn't love me. Think I know where I went wrong, but would love more critique. How much was linked to her illness? Ultimately, is trying again worth it?"

Now here's where it gets complicated: when I finally got there, it seemed like I came back to a completely different person... and soon after, I found out that she was depressed (she has a history with it and this was mild in comparison according to her; was also going to therapy the semester we started dating). After a rough couple of weeks trying to figure out what was happening, we had a rather emotional discussion about it and how she doesn't know what's wrong/why she's struggling to recapture her feelings + sexuality. I tell her I can't claim to know how she's feeling but I'm here for her and will still be here when it passes. Much of it was linked to the stress of jobs + grad school apps + uncertainty about life in general, but you can never know the full extent of it.

Seeing her like this made me very protective, and I just avoided bringing up any topics that could make her feel worse like the lack of physical intimacy + general excitement, not opening up enough, complications with my future etc. In hindsight, this only added to the problem and created somewhat of an emotional barrier between us - but we could talk about pretty much anything else and loved being around one another. Being the insanely smart girl that she is, she got into grad school and the internship she wanted - which made her feel better to some extent. Initially, she was convinced that this would lead to major improvements, but a couple of weeks later she broke down saying she still wasn't feeling well. While talking about it, she told me that part of it was related to me and how she didn't want me to leave, after which I assured her that I was working hard at finding a job and would keep trying because I genuinely wanted a future with her (and one in the US, of course). It made her feel better and the weeks that followed saw remarkable improvements in our relationship. She was being more affectionate, wanted to spend more time with me, and just generally had more happy days than sad. Unfortunately, the sexual aspect was still lacking and we just kinda accepted it. I would try to initiate it fairly often, and even though I did slack off towards the end, I can't say that I didn't feel physically attracted to her at any point. The semester ends and I spend the night at her place the day before my flight (was heading home for winter break). I genuinely see her the happiest I've seen her in months and she has this twinkle in her eye while looking at me, making me feel like everything's finally great and we're gonna come back from break and really kick on from there. Best of all, she's finally able to say she loves me (I had said it a month ago) and it melts my heart.

So we go off for break (she was travelling a lot and having a great time) and everything seemed perfectly fine until maybe the last week or so where she was kinda distant. We've never been big texters so it's kinda hard to tell in that respect too. I come back having made all these plans about things we're gonna do and the issues we need to address (mainly sex + more open communication) and when we meet, she takes me completely by surprise and says she thinks we shouldn't date any more. I tell her I need time to process this and gather my thoughts, so I text her a couple of days later and we talk over coffee. She tells me I'm a fantastic boyfriend but she feels we've turned into best friends because she just hasn't been able to capture that sexual feeling again (we were super active initially) + doesn't think she loves me that way. We have a fairly calm (and oddly flirty) discussion in which we bring up the things that bothered us, most of which were irrelevant and kinda petty. She brings up topic of jobs + uncertainty about my future again and implies that I didn't try hard enough, I tell her my parents are very supportive of grad school as a back-up (we'll be in the same place for another year if that happens) and that I genuinely have been trying hard af despite what she thinks. Ultimately, we reach the conclusion that we were both in a better place on a personal level when we started dating and should work on being those people again (for say a month or so) and then we'd talk again.

After thinking about this for the last couple of weeks, I've realised that tip-toeing around touchy topics was not the right way to go about it by any means, and that a more assertive approach - in tune with who I am as a person - would've been much more helpful. The shock of seeing someone you care about like that and my lack of experience in that situation got the better of me, but it isn't something that can't be rectified. I also regret not being more vocal about certain feelings in the moment, because having good intentions and making wonderful plans is pointless if your partner isn't aware to some extent. When it comes to the physical aspect, it really isn't a black and white issue - and it's hard for me to break it down. Part of me feels as if a candid discussion about our likes and dislikes in the bedroom and what we could do going forward would've made a world of difference, but then I also feel like she isn't acknowledging the role her illness played and the possibility that it may be more complicated than just 'maybe I don't love you' - especially given the abruptness of it all and the fact that it had happened to her before (part of it could just be a mental block + performance anxiety). I also know that the uncertainty played on her mind a lot... but at the same time, it's inevitable in every relationship at this stage in our lives because we're all trying to find our feet in the world. Sure, the international aspect makes it a little more emphatic, but I genuinely am trying my hardest to create a future here (this difficult political situation isn't helping) and also did/do want a future for us. It's one of those things you just have to put your faith in, because you'll never be able to enjoy the present if you can't imo. She's got a tendency to over-think as well, which makes total sense given that her doubts arose when we weren't in the same place and she wasn't seeing me often - a legitimate form of anxiety in itself if I'm not mistaken.

Now here's my predicament: do I advocate giving it another go when I do see her? I have gotten feedback from a lot of friends and while most of them are extremely unhelpful with the typical ""oh, don't worry, you're a wonderful guy, there's so many fish in the sea"" bs, some have been more critical and allowed me to better understand our failures as a couple. Despite our problems, we have a very rare kind of connection and I do still see an immense amount of potential in the relationship. There is literally so much we still have left to explore about one another + so many things to experience together that it feels like we've only scratched the surface. Approaching this with a clear head and no pressure might be exactly what we need to break down any emotional barriers and enjoy that period of vulnerability that our problems took away from us. Sexual aspect is still confusing but I'm confident we can rediscover that too with the right kind of communication. That being said, I don't want to rush back into it either, and would rather take things slow this time to figure out how we feel. I still have issues I need to address in my head tbh, and would have to see a willingness to work on her part for them to subside. This is all one big hypothetical of course, because I might not be able to convince her at all - but part of feeling confident again is regaining the ability to take her answer on the chin. So please help me out guys. What do you think happened? How much of it do you think was down to depression? And most importantly, what do you think I should do?

TL;DR - Started relationship with girl, had an amazing few months. Went away for summer (international student) and everything still seemed great. Come back, find out she's depressed and then try to help her feel better. Sex stops, and we have some problems with communication in the process. She thinks she's feeling better after things start going her way in terms of school + jobs, realises a couple of weeks later that she's still not well. Periodically expresses that she's scared of me going back, I assure her every single time that I will fight for my future and our future as a couple. Things get remarkably better towards the end of the year, we go away for winter break happy. I come back, and she abruptly breaks up with me saying she hasn't been able to rediscover sexuality and feels maybe we just became best friends/she doesn't love me. Think I know where I went wrong, but would love more critique. How much was linked to her illness? Ultimately, is trying again worth it?"
5suldg,1,2017-02-08,"[24/M] I'm probably in what people call a ""friendzone"" situation with her [21/F]. Sorry this one's a little long.",akash_karmakar,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5suldg/24m_im_probably_in_what_people_call_a_friendzone/,"First of all, I'm from India. So the dating rules or whatever are different here. Please keep that in mind while you answer. I'm Living in Mumbai for around 3 years now.

So, I met this girl once at a random party. Not met as such, but we just talked a little. We didn't exchange numbers or do anything except maybe talk for 2 minutes before she had to leave for home.

Anyway, a few months later around December 2015. I saw her on Tinder and we liked each other. We got to talking. And we had lots in common. She listened to the same kind of music, we had similar tastes for books, she loves to write too, we both have a dream of backpacking through the world.

Anyway, right afterwards she was going to Malaysia for an internship, so we couldn't meet before that. While she was there in Malaysia we used to talk everyday for hours at night (on the phone / over text). She would send me pictures of what she's doing, eating, wearing, etc. And well I really liked her.

After she came back in March, we met. We spent the whole day together. And it was amazing. We watched movies. We went out, we had coffee, we sat and talked for hours on the beach. It was amazing.

Anyway, we were talking for another month or so. We used to meet every now and then. We both loved ice cream. But then one day out of the blue she texted ""Hi akash, I just got back with my ex. And he does not like me talking to other guys and I hope you understand. Please don't call or text me anymore.""

I was a little heartbroken, but it was fine. I knew I probably wasn't good enough for her. And she definitely deserved better than me. So I said ""Okay. Take care of yourself. Let me know if ever you need anything.""

Then after around a month or two she texted me. I didn't ask her about her ex or what happened. I knew something may have happened and I just wanted her to feel better. So I asked her if we could meet. She said yes. And we started talking and meeting again. This went on for another 4-5 months.

Then it happened again. She dissapeared for like 2 days. Wouldn't pick my calls. Won't reply to texts, nothing. I was getting worried as hell when a similar text comes saying she got back with her ex and she doesn't want me to call or text her again.

I accepted the fact. And moved on with my life. By moving on I mean, I started giving everything I got to work. I started spending 16-18 hours at work. I couldn't sleep. Only work and me playing the guitar gave me some kind of solace.

Anyway, another month later. I suddenly noticed that she had unblocked me on whatsapp. I texted her. She replied almost immediately. We spoke on the phone for around 6 hours straight till 5 in the morning. And we decided to meet next day in the afternoon. I bunked work and I picked her up and we agreed to come back to my place. We were talking and I asked her about her ex and what the situation is. And she said that he cheated and stuff. We made out that day. A lot. I dropped her home at around 11 in the night.

We were meeting on and off since then. Then suddenly one day she texts me that she won't be dating me. She thinks I'm not the one for her. I was clueless. I asked her to meet.

But she kept putting it off and off and off. But we finally did yesterday after about a month of trying to convince her.

She told me that, she doesn't want to get tied down. She wants to be free and independent. Primarily because she is going to Australia in June for a job for a year, and she thinks that we'll get bored. That we won't be talking much. And we would feel stuck. She doesn't want someone waiting for her back home. And what she was emphasising on repeatedly is that I'm a really really really good friend and she doesn't want to lose me like this. She says I'm someone people should marry and not have casual dating relationships with. Yet she repeatedly asks me not to leave. She tells me that you've helped me through my worst days, I want you to be part of my good days too.

I broke down. I don't remember when I cried like that last. Maybe when I was little in school.

I've told her I would stay, no matter what. We are gonna go out this Saturday.

I'm not really sure what I should do. It's been more than a year now. And I love her. I don't know what I should do. Do I push? Do I try to convince her? Should I leave? Help me out here, please."

After seeking help on this sub, a couple of kind and considerate members informed me about well known companies having apprentice programs for anyone that wants to work in software sales. I am interested in applying for one such apprentice program very soon.

I would love such an opportunity but I have a couple of questions about this:

1 . What do a lot of companies typically look for when recruiting someone into their apprentice program? 

I have found that sales experience isn't needed since this tends to be more of an internship type of role but I ask this as someone who would like an opportunity to be in this sort of a role.

5swfks,2,2017-02-08,Me [21 M] and my gf [22 F] having a big issue. Need advice,rtf5466,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5swfks/me_21_m_and_my_gf_22_f_having_a_big_issue_need/,"So i have been dating this girl for almost 4 months now. I was friends with her/hooked up with her for my spring semester of last year and stayed in touch during the summertime. The beginning of 2016 fall semester we were still friends/hooking up but I was also seeing other people at the time.

One night I hooked up with a different girl and didnt tell her and the next night she found out and got really mad. I was super drunk at the moment and we argued till 5 am that night in person. The next morning she texted me that I pushed her last night during our argument (I have no memory of this event). I was very upset with myself because I am not a violent person and did not mean for that to happen

I have always liked her but didn't think i could handle a relationship. She came over the next day and told me what happened and said she was very upset obviously. She was mad i hooked up with someone else but I didnt know she wanted to be exclusive with me. Then she said if we aren't going to be exclusive she wouldnt be friends with me and might tell people what happened, possibly getting me in trouble.

So, I decided why not give it a chance because i did like her and i messed up. Things were stressful though, she wanted to hangout every night which i wasnt used to and she told me how much it hurt and how she might need surgery, which made me feel terrible. Eventually we started to move past it and eventually started dating a little over a month after.

There have been some great times in this relationship that i have truly loved, but there are things that make me question alot. For example, she usually is a little late to some things, I dont mind. But one time before a halloween party i was with my friend drinking and i was two minutes behind and she screamed at me on the phone for being behind, when in reality, her friends werent ready to leave anyway so it didnt matter, i got yelled at for nothing.

Stuff like that happens, but one thing has bothered me the most is that she will threaten to break up with me if i dont fulfill what she wants. What's worse is she will bring up what happened before we started dating and use it as a weapon to guilt me by saying she will tell people and ruin my life. And sometimes she uses this when I barely did anything wrong (or so i believe).

For example, I told her that i was living with my one friend who i have been friends with since sophomore year of high school. We are in different friend groups at school but still great friends, we were roommates freshman year of high school. But her ex used to be part of his friend group and she used to tell me how he would hurt her physically multiple times and how it ended ugly for them. She told me she was uncomfortable with me living there, even though the guy would not be around, because my friend once associated with him. She said i couldnt live there even after signing the lease which im trying to get out of for her. she threatened to leave me if i didnt and put my reputation in jeopardy

Another example, this one is somewhat my fault too but didnt know if it was that bad. Over winter break she had to get her tonsils taken out, weeks before this, i developed an awful case of psoriasis and desperately needed to be seen by a higher up dermatologist. My dad took me to the dermatologist on the same day of her surgery, i didnt know i was going till that morning we left on the spot. She told me on that day to not go anywhere, which to me meant not hangout with friends or family just chill, when she found out she started getting mad because i couldnt text her back. Keeping it short we got in a huge fight and she threatened to leave me, tell everyone what happened, and called me a terrible person for doing that, even though my case of psoriasis was awful at the time and very painful

Another time, she freaked out and said she couldnt handle distance in the summer, we live 4 hours apart when were not in school, and said we had to live together this summer, I told her i didnt know since i needed an internship this summer(plus you would think its kind of soon for that move in a relationship). She didnt like that answer and i was accusing me i wouldnt make a sacrifice for her and she started threatning me again. Of course, i told her i will make it work somehow, even though i dont think im ready.

She did the same thing when she got super jealous when i didnt cheat at all my friend snapchatted me on new years eve when she was in town and i was working that night and told her to come to my job and celebrate. Of course that looks bad since she cant see the convo, but thats all it was and i told her but she flipped and did the same thing again about leaving and what not. On my recent 21st bday, a friend of mine who is a girl gave me a longer hug in front of my gf, which i know isnt great, but once again i had no desire of attraction to her or anything. My gf brought it up a few days later and did the same thing.

Last weekend, we drove to my aunts cabin not far from our school. But as we got closer the driving conditions with snow made it hard to drive because her car is two wheel drive and she flipped a shit on me then threatned to leave me when we got there. We made up, but it kind of bothered me to get screamed at for not doing anything especially since i didnt know the conditions were bad.

Now, last night was when i realized i needed to reach out for advice. So i told her i had this event i was going to which had a big group of girls but also with my group of guy friends. She instantly turned pissed off and obviously didnt want me to go. Saying that i do questionable things even though i dont cheat and have zero desire too

I started getting annoyed and we started fighting even more.I told her i dont think we could live together this summer and she flipped. I thought we were breaking up last night, but then, she started saying she didnt want to protect me and would tell a lawyer or something about what happened before we dated, and saying how it wouldnt matter if i got an internship or not since i would be screwed. I felt scared and made up with her.

**TL;DR;

My point of this is, i question what happened that night. she uses it to guilt me and take power over me. I have not come close to physically hurting her besides that. I become skeptical of that night because she told me how she would possibly need surgery and it would take 6 month to recover but after about a couple weeks she stopped wearing a brace and then a month after the incident she didnt really talk about pain in her shoulder anymore. It just brushed away.

I just feel like she is using it too control me and do everything she says. Why is it that her ex is walking free from doing alot worse and is still an ass to her yet im being guilted and threatened for making that one mistake. I love her but this relationship doesnt feel right sometimes. I feel like im missing out with my friends and even family. I try to compromise but she doesnt want to.

I need advice on what to do, does anyone think her story of what happened that night is shady? Am I a bad person? I want to fix this relationship but i dont want it to make me feel powerless anymore, and if the case is this doesnt work out, i want to protect myself. Sorry for the long post but it needed alot of explaining. Anything would help

5swgsk,36,2017-02-08,"Nothing Is Free, Including Your Time",regressionsessions,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/5swgsk/nothing_is_free_including_your_time/,"I'm writing this because I've see it all to often: someone bring a marketer in for an interview, ask ""what should we do"" or ""take this test and provide the steps,"" obtain the intelligence, and never speak to the interviewee again. In fact, they never had the intention of actually hiring anyone, they just wanted free advice from a talented person.

This happens quite frequently. It's happened to me before with my own business, where people will ask for my advice through emails or phone calls under the guise of a potential business deal. Then, nothing, or they hire an unpaid intern to implement everything I've said. That hasn't happened in a few years, but it did when I was first starting out.

**Your time is worth something. Probably much more than you value it for.**

The other thing that happens frequently, especially through remote / digital work, are ""startups,"" many who haven't even started selling yet, not willing to pay interns, or trying to drive down your wages where you are essentially working for free. If they ""don't have the money"" but will provide ""solid references,"" then they aren't worth your time. 

The caveat here is if  you want to do something *good* like help a nonprofit, or you see a portfolio piece in the works that is too good to pass up. Then, you approach it as a project. I make sure I do one free project per year for a nonprofit, and I also try to make it a portfolio piece, too.

As a marketer or creative person, you can expect that people will try to take advantage of you. In the nature of business, you can expect that people will do their best to pay you precisely $0 for your time and services. 

Don't let this happen. Don't get screwed over. If it's not helping you in some way shape or form, then don't do it. 

Some unpaid internships may be worth it. Some. But good ones will try to at least pay something, or make sure you learn a tremendous amount while your there. Knowledge is money, but slavery is just being degraded.

If you're just starting off, or have been at it for a while, you can avoid these pitfalls by doing two things:

* Branding yourself (basic website, good imagery, social, etc.)

* Calling yourself a consultant

That usually scares away the people who want to build their business on the back of your sweet, free labor.

It's just easier most of the time. But now I've fucked up really, really bad, and I just want someone to know the truth.

Last March I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. I've had the disease much longer, probably around 8 years, but I never told anyone because shitting myself all the time is fucking embarrassing. But last March I had a terrible flare that left me incapacitated for about a week before I decided to go to the doctor, and then I spent another week in the hospital once I was diagnosed. I've tried diet changes, Prednisone, mesalamine pills and enemas, methotrexate, and am currently on remicade, and nothing's made any difference. I still have cramps and diarrhea at least 10 times a day everyday. 

When this first happened, I was midway through my 6th semester of college, and also working as an intern at a great company in the field I want to work in. I missed all my classes and work for those two weeks. When I got out of the hospital, I still didn't feel ready to go back. I told my professors and my boss that I just needed some time to recover, and that I'd be back soon. I told everyone it was going to be tough, but I'd make up all the work I'd missed, I'd just drop one of my classes and take it next year. One week went by, and I didn't go back. I was still having cramps, and I was terrified by the amount of work I would have to do to catch up.

Another week. I told my friends, parents and co-workers that I'd come back this week. I went to campus to go to my classes, but I couldn't go in. I figured everyone assumed I had dropped, and I had no idea what the lecture was on since I hadn't done any makeup work. I went to the library. I sat there, played some games on my laptop, read a book for a while, and just wasted time until my classes were supposed to be over, so my roommates wouldn't be suspicious that I came home early. I did it again the next day. And the next. The Dean of Students asked if I wanted to drop more of my classes, so I didn't fail, but I said no, because I convinced myself this was temporary and I would go back and make up the work. 

I didn't. I spent the rest of the semester pretending to go to class, telling my roommates bullshit about what I was working on, telling my parents everything was going fine. I stopped emailing my boss saying that I'd come back to work soon. Eventually he called and said they had to let me go, because they couldn't have me on payroll if I wasn't working any hours, but that if I ever got better I should call him. He was way too nice to me, I treated him like shit.

I failed the four other classes I was taking. The university put me on academic suspension, meaning I wasn't allowed to take fall classes and had to reapply for spring admission. I spent the first month and a half of summer pretending to go to work, but still just going to the library. It became routine. I wasn't getting paid, but my internship had paid well enough that I was able to make it for a while. I was still telling my parents that I was working at my internship. Eventually, my money was running out, and I needed a job. I emailed my boss from an on-campus job I had before the internship, and asked if I could come back. It was really strange to start a campus job in the middle of summer, but he needed the help and let me come back. But everyone thought I was still working at my internship, so I didn't tell anyone else that I was working on campus again.

Now at least I was being productive with my time, but I was still lying to everyone. I finished the summer working full-time, but never told anyone where. I assured all my friends, parents, and even my boss that I was taking classes that fall (you had to be a student to work campus jobs, but my boss never checked since I had worked there before). I started working part time, and made a pretend class schedule I had to work around, where I just went and sat in the library. I tried to work through some MOOC coursework to keep myself in the college mindset, but didn't make any significant progress. I did, however, apply for readmission and got accepted for Spring 2017.

So I faked my way through fall semester, worked full-time over winter break, and have now started the semester, and am actually going to class for the first time since last March. I'm also working part time at the on campus job, and am actually truly happy to be productive again. I figured I could finish this semester and then just tell my parents I wanted to work somewhere else, and not ever have to tell them I was let go from the internship or that I had to skip a semester. 

But this week, my parents got my 2016 tax documents. I didn't think to change the mailing address, so they were sent straight to my parents, who opened them, since they've always done my taxes. They got two W2s and a tuition statement. It was immediately obvious that I haven't been at my internship for the past 9 months, and that I only paid tuition for one semester last year. So they've been emailing and calling me all day, and I can't answer because I don't know what to say, and my shitty lies I told for no good reason are crashing down around me, just when I thought I could move past them. Fuck."

I would like to apply to PA school in the 2018-2019 cycle.

Stats:
-Graduated in May 2016 with a BS in Biotechnology (3.5 gpa).
-300 hospital volunteer hours in various positions and actively volunteering as an ED Research Assistant.
-65 MD &amp; PA shadow hours
-Two years of experience working in an cardiopulmonary critical care lab (clinically translational with animal 'patients'). One year as an intern plus one year as a full-time Senior Research Support Specialist.
-Obtained NYS EMT-B certification in Fall 2016.

I am preparing to leave my lovely research position to get PCE. I am currently in NY, but I would ideally like to work in Western Massachusetts (NREMT, here I come...). I found during my EMT certification that I don't enjoy the road as much as I had expected, and I want to work in a hospital. I am excited by the idea of working side-by-side with providers who I can learn from and who might write me a letter of rec for school, so I decided to seek out an ED Technician, CNA, or Medical Assistant job because I thought it would better prepare me for PA school. However, the ED Technician jobs I have found require AEMT or EMTI certification and/or 1+ years in the field, and I am not certified as a CNA or MA.

Has anyone out there landed a ED tech job without first riding with an agency for some time?
Further, and even more lofty- has anyone out there landed a job with direct patient contact that doesn't line up with their certification (CNA, MA, MOA, pt care technician, etc.)?

In conclusion: in your opinion, is it a waste of time to apply for ED technician, CNA, MA jobs in NY and Mass with my credentials? I am considering either giving up on the hospitals and applying to EMS agencies (after certifying with NREMT), or going for a CNA certification.
Did anyone prepare for PA school with EMT hours and CNA-like hours? If so, which do you think better prepared you?

Thoughts on any of my many questions would be appreciated. Thank you!"

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I will be gaming and doing some writing on it. I would like it to run League of Legends, XCOM 2, and maybe Overwatch

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

I'm going for internship and making like $500 a month, so my budget is about $500-$600

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

In about a month. I hear league runs on fairly low-spec PCs so i'm not too worried about it.
&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

I would like it to use windows 7(preferably not 10, I hear that's a buggy clusterf***). Just the Tower and Monitor, I have my own mouse and keyboard.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

I'm in singapore.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

I'm just reusing my old keyboard and mouse. Standard microsoft issue.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No idea. Not really planning on overclocking or playing intensive games, but I have no Idea whats the difference between a CPU and GPU
&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**
None here. would be nice but I don't know much about PCs...

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Nope

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Nope, I can get one for myself.

5sxjna,17,2017-02-08,Update: 50th Day without Gambling: The toll of addiction and the Results,sssssimponwave,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5sxjna/update_50th_day_without_gambling_the_toll_of/,"Hey /r/Drugs !

Im the 18 year old who put a post up 40 days ago, marking my 10th day without gambling (I know, not drugs, but im talking about addiction throughout this post) . Here I am still on the grind of not gambling. A little backstory/TLDR for my story, Im a law/commerce double degree student, who spent a whole semester (6 months) gambling at least 4 hours a day playing online poker. Usually it would be safe to say 8-10+ hours a day, sometimes stinting to 24+ hrs. All while 'studying'. I somehow passed all my classes and stopped gambling.

Whats happened since my last update? The urges came a little further apart. In the first 10 days they were really bad, all I thought about was gambling. I went from 4-8+ hrs a day under full stimulation, to nothing. I found myself bored and constantly needing to do something to stay sane. Since then, its been.. interesting:

* The urges arent as bad and are spread further apart, although at times those urges are gut renching and its really taken me a fair bit to not go back; going for walks at 2am just to avoid it, having a cold shower when its 18 degrees out side etc.

* I find myself still needing a large percentage of my day under stimulation which I have found as a little strange. I think this will slowly decrease, after the brain has had the whole day awake under stimulation for 6 months straight, id say this is a normal.

* In saying this, I have taken up further studies. Being away from Uni its at times boring, so im either playing video games, drinking with friends, or studying corporate finance. Everything to do with company administration down to the stock market (Red flag), Although in talking to mentors, I should be able to have a solid career in this industry after having this episode of addiction, mainly due to the fact that I can recognise the feeling of gambling tendencies, and that once I get an internship at a hedgefund and finish my finance studies, it isnt gambling per se. Its 500-750+ hours of study on a company and then a decision, its mainly sales orientated and market analysis, focusing on low risk and a 7-15% annual gain. Its more of a low risk for low gain mentality, Rather than ""fuck it, lets chuck it on this volatile stock and get 150% over night, or lose it all"" mentality.

* What does this mean? It means that I have found something that I really enjoy studying, I have become more productive because my mind desires stimulation of any kind; teaching myself things (Self learning). In a way im rewiring my brain and addiction to further my learning.

* I commented on my 10th day post that I didnt have respect for resources; In terms of mobile data when I would conserve it in the past, I just had the ""fuck it"" mentality, carried over from my ""fuck it"" mentality when handling money during my addiction phase. I find that this has toned down a little now, I respect things like this alot more, but i still have a little ""fuck it"" left, but I feel thats normal and not erratic like it was a month and a bit ago.

* As said in my last post, I have gained significant respect for people with addictions, and even more so for people who WANT to change but just cant. Furthermore saying that everyone should do 2 things in life, have a job in retail and have an addiction that isnt completley harmful. You gain a lot of respect going through each.

The conclusion of all this is, would I go back and not gamble if i could? No. This has helped me become the person I am today, and thats a good thing. Ive also learnt alot and know that this isnt the end of getting out of the addiction, but is the big first leap successfully reached. I just want to thank people who commented on my last post. Thanks."

I am currently in my last semester at school getting a CS degree and I just landed a cyber security internship at a DoD contractor.  They want me to get a secret clearance.  After doing some research I'm afraid that at least my interim clearance will be denied.  I plan on admitting that I last smoked cannabis about 6 years ago.  My mom is also a born German citizen but has since become a US citizen.  I've read somewhere that if I get denied my security clearance that I will have to wait at least 2 years to apply again.

After I graduate I plan on joining the Navy.  I know I can get a waiver for my cannabis usage while applying for the Navy, but if I get denied my clearance with this internship that can mess things up.  At this point I'm not sure if I can apply to a waiver for a civilian contractor position.  However the internship says the clearance is optional, I just wont be getting any real cyber security experience if I do not apply for the clearance.  

My question is, should I just play it safe and not apply for the clearance with the internship?  Should I just not admit to my previous cannabis use?  I want to be honest and I do not want to jeopardize my future career with the Navy.

Any insights will be much appreciated."
5sy8qk,3,2017-02-09,I thought I quit the gym. Debt collectors say otherwise,manuealesc,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5sy8qk/i_thought_i_quit_the_gym_debt_collectors_say/,"I spent this past summer in New York doing an internship. While I was there I join a gym for a couple months, but then I walked in and said I needed to quit because I was moving back. They said sure and I thought it was over.

Fast forward to a month ago. I started getting phone calls from a collections agency. I assumed it was a scam or a wrong number. I recently blocked them, and yesterday they left a message and had my name.

I called them today. Turns out that I never quit the gym, and I've been racking up a debt with them. Then the debt got pushed to the collection agency. I called the gym and the agency. Both told me that because I didn't send in a certified letter, like it said in my contract, I never actually quit. 

They said I owe $246. She said she could make it as low as $236, but no lower because they have the contract signed by me. She said I could call back tomorrow and pay the $236 and they won't report it to the credit agency.

I think that's a pretty bad business practice by the gym, but I understand that they do have the contract. Should I just take this as a learning opportunity and pay? Or should I try to fight or avoid it?

To put into perspective, I am 21 years old in collect. That is almost half of my savings, so I guess I'll live.

What do you guys think?

And I did plenty of checking before calling. The business is legit and she offered to email or mail my contract. It doesn't seem like a scam."
5sz3ms,5,2017-02-09,A love letter to marketing.,gloves1992,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/5sz3ms/a_love_letter_to_marketing/,"My dear Marketing,

I was thinking about you today, as I do every Monday to Friday between the hours of 08.00 and 16.30, and I felt compelled to put into words how I feel for you.

I still remember our first day together. I sat there as an intern in a new office. The lights were bright and white, and your mysterious ways were yet unknown as I was introduced to the principles of A/B testing. The results are in and they’re unequivocal: you have optimised your way into my heart.

There are many things I love about you. Each glimmer like a conversion notification on one of my dashboards.

The way you force me to be creative challenges me in the best way possible. While you give me so much, I also realise you have many admirers. Each competes for your affection like a blog post about writing great blog posts, but that’s okay. Captain Jack Sparrow, also known as Edward Scissorhands, also known as Willy Wonka, also known as Johnny Depp once said “it’s okay to be different”, and I can’t help but agree. To be different is to make you pay attention to me, and I strive for that difference every single day.

The way you show diversity and adaptability constantly amazes me. Whether it’s inbound, outbound, email or social, you don’t care. You’re open to them all. Your acceptance and willingness to try something different warms me like the gentle humming of my laptop when its memory is stretched by Adobe Illustrator. If you weren’t so diverse and interesting, I don’t think we could be together, but alas you are, YOU ARE, and it makes me so proud to say I know you.

You’ve shown me many things, and the best of all is that you are not jealous with introducing me to those who also admire you. While some still insist on ‘humanization’, ‘finding synergy’, and introduce themselves as a ‘ninja guru’, I know there are people out there with heart, passion, values, and who share my commitment to learning all about you. I know this, because I’ve met these people. These other people find joy in helping people solve their problems and use you as their medium, and I think that’s wonderful.

I admit it. Things haven’t always been easy. You change... nearly on a daily basis. Every week I feel like I don’t know you at all, which is at times scary. And yet, that’s part of what keeps me going. As you morph to be the best version of you for the world around you, I must constantly learn more to be the best version of me I can be for you.

And yet, our love is still young. I have only been in the clutches of your affection for three short years. I know I will face my challenges with you Marketing, but I’m willing to overcome them all for you. For us. You keep me guessing every day, challenge me to the best I can be. You are open, caring, and don’t take that buzzword rubbish. For those reasons and many more, I will never stop being yours.

Kind Regards,

J xoxoxoxoxo

About to begin the rebooting process.

My addiction started after a spate of depression around 17, since then I havnt kicked the habbit. Mostly because I assumed, it was normal behavior; however now I know it is very abnormal.

Since I started, many of the common traits listed in the 101 page have flared up. most specifically, very low self-esteem/confidence.

I am ambitious, 
Im in my last year of a computer science degree. However I find it very hard to motivate myself, Im hopping abstinence will increase my energy levels which intern will motivate me to do more positive things, rather than indulgence of negative things.

Im quite confident I will succeed and that abstinence will have a positive impact. will post on here my experience.

The most difficult hurdle I feel I will face is boredom, often I do it because I am bored or lonely and have nothing better to do.
I intend to replace this time with studying, and only returning home to my dorm when im tired. instead of when my lectures end.

Its going to be hard, as I use computers all day every day."

5t07yi,1,2017-02-09,Desperately need advice about Nursing vs Dietetics degree.,[deleted],nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/5t07yi/desperately_need_advice_about_nursing_vs/,"Hello! I have been very stressed lately with what to pursue a degree in. Some background information: I am 24, I have an associates degree in Art, and have about $18,000 in federal student loans(originally 14 grand, but interest accumulated, yada yada I screwed up). I changed my major twice when I was younger, went to an art school for a year and a half(hence the student loans) and had some major family/personal health issues and did not go to school then later continued onto community college. I was planning on being a french teacher, realized my heart wasn't completely for it and job security was not worth the additional loans I would need to get a 4 year degree. I have been extremely interested in nutrition for the past 5 years and never really comprehended I could go to school for it until recently. So, I have to take a lot of science pre-reqs in order to get into a program. I love the classes I am taking right now (Anatomy+Biology). I am volunteering with Food Pantries, Meals on Wheels, and I work part time in an organic juice/smoothie bar.
My problem is after research, it seems RD's are having a tough time finding jobs, internships are super difficult to get into, and only have a median salary of around 50 grand. I am terrified to take any more student loans on something that I won't be able to pay back. However, I also understand RD's with jobs are not going to be on internet forums talking about how great this field is. 

This is where the nursing part comes in. Nursing programs seem to be easier to get into than the Dietetics program, plus the job security that comes with it. I know a lot of nurses working straight after a BSN and make $69,000 a year. I am a smart individual and know I can get through both programs, I am just worried about the payoff. My heart is not completely in nursing. I love that I would be making a difference in peoples lives but I don't really like the idea of giving people medication rather than changing lifestyle habits. (Obviously, medication is not evil and loads of people NEED meds in order to live, but I personally see so many people pounding down meds instead of changing their lifestyle habits etc) However, I simply want to help people and make myself useful to society and if I could pay my student loans with a nursing degree, I will do it. I understand the program is very difficult, I know I can handle it. I just don't want to nurse for the rest of my life. I want to be a Dietician. I don't know if I should get a BSN and work for a couple of years as an RN and then get a Master's in Nutrition and become an RD. 
My other option is not being scared of student loans and just doing the Dietetics program to become an RD and not pursue nursing at all. 
Pros of Nursing: Money and the fact the I am helping people
Cons: Not exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life. 

TL;DR: I don't know if I should go into nursing for the pay, when my heart isn't completely in it, and then, after I can afford it, pursue to get a Masters in Dietetics (which I truly want to do) or just go straight into a degree in Dietetics and forget about nursing. 

[EDIT] I want to add I don't need an extravagant lifestyle. I don't care about having a super high salary. I simply want to have a career in helping people and not be in debt for the rest of my life. The only reason I am focused on salary is to get out of debt as fast as possible. After I am debt-free, salary isn't the biggest factor for me.

Any advice at all would be helpful. I am just trying to get my life together after a lot of setbacks. Seriously want to thank you if you read all of this. "
5t099z,4,2017-02-09,What if Pink Diamond was a kind-hearted gem? (Or at least a pacifist) &amp; thoughts about corruption and Steven's birth,letmehealya,stevenuniverse,https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/5t099z/what_if_pink_diamond_was_a_kindhearted_gem_or_at/,"[English is not my mother language, so please be patient &lt;3]

[Edit: formatting]


** **


She was a matriarch, born to colonize, sure. But I want to raise some points that hint at her actions in life.


**1.** We might want to look at Pink Diamon's actions as someone who's progressing, not a veteran leader. Earth was her first colony after all.


**2.** Gems are made by design to fill the needs of the diamonds. We can assume that by what Peridot said about the hierarchy of homeworld. And in ""That Will Be All"", Blue Diamond hints at the process of creation of a gem when she calls Rose Quartz gems ""Pink Damond's legacy"". Without drifting away from what I'm trying to imply here, Pink Diamond might have designed the features of her subjects to an extent. Jaspers and amethysts might also be her creation.


**3.** Assuming that the last point is true, and knowing that the traits among the same type of gems are similar, her subjects can be described as follows: 
* Rose Quartz: Natural power is focused on healing and defense, not attack. High empathy and curiosity towards others.
* Jaspers and amethysts (as seen in the zoo): Patience to deal with the emotion of others. Light-hearted and with a sense of family. 


*(Note that the existence of the jasper that is new corrupted doesn't automatically prove this point wrong, as we have witnessed some degree of personality variation on the five visiting rubys. We have kind jaspers at the zoo agains one meanie. Also, if she's ""the perfect jasper"", she could as well be devastated when losing someone that she cared so much, then adopting a much more severe personality. And our ruby is proof that gems can change their personalities over time to a extent.)*


**4.** As why Pink Diamond began the process to colonize Earth in the first place, she might not have known the collateral damage of such process in the first place. We ourselves can sometimes be alienated to what's going on around us. Think of what a court and subject hierachy can do towards that end. 


*[Note that there's a parallel theory that the moon base was property of White Diamond in the first place (by it's color). A diamond needs its subjects. So maybe WD began the harvesting of PD's subjects while she was busy at homeworld with something else, like studying or developing gems. So PD would not know the dread created by the kindergarten just yet. Or maybe this is just bs and she just didn't understand the weight of harvesting gems over the whole world].*


**5.** The very existence of the zoo can either support this theory of prove if wrong. It can hint at some degree of objetification and disdain towards the human race, yes. But also can mean that she, in an intern conflict, recognized the complexity and beauty of the human race and tried to preserve it at the same time that she needed to fulfill her role as a colonizer and ""destroy"" our world. The ""amusement park"" undercover wold be perfect to hide it in the gem society. And let's agree, that place it's like a sanctuary to human life. 


**6.** Lastly, the whole theory that steven's mom didn't shatter PD. Bear with me. Don't quit just yet. Four points:


* Bismuth affirms that Rose's sword is especially designed to not shatter the gem, but only destroy the physical form.

* Eyeball ruby affirms especially that Rose Quartz shattered PD with her sword.

* Blue Diamond may have hinted ate the relisiance of a diamond when saying ""as powerful as a diamond"".

* The alignment of rose's actions towards life itself.


It's hard do draw a specific conclusion on what really happened. But some thing come to my mind when accepting all the points and looking at the big picture.

* Rose might not have rebel against Pink Diamond. Rather, they worked together to create the conditions to a rebel movement towards the homewolrd and everything wrong with it to exist.

* That might, yes, mean that Pink Diamond could really have sacrificed herself for a greater good. Or could mean that she turned into something else and passedthe secret on how to do it to someone else (yes, I believe in the Pink Diamond = Lion theory). 


First, let me share my thoughts about how Steven came to be. Gems are genderless. Above all, incompatible with the reproductive system cause aliens. And sex is a less elegant way to bring Steven's birth to a kid's show. 


Homeworld holds the secret to create and corrupt gems. That's a fact. But what if the ""corrupt"" part is also what allowed Steven exist? I mean, using the power of only one diamond could alter the state of a being in a harmonic way, but mixing it would corrupt it. Putting this together with Rose ""giving birth"" to Steven would imply in the non-exclusiveness of the corruption to the diamonds. Collateral damage. But could also mean that it is only a secret hold by the diamons, as with the fusion between two types of gems. So corruption could mean mix the mineral with the organic. The resemblance of the corrupted gems with earthly animals and microscopic being also support this conjecture. 


So the scene where we see Rose walking with the lions might mean that se was trying to understand why Pink Diamond did choose that form or figure out how to do it altogether (with a sweet spot on the middle with Rose not understanding how to do it at first with the little information passed to her by PD, but staying with the lions to comprehend it).


Edit: One flaw in the Corruption = Steven's birth theory: Corrupted gems can poof, Steven can't. Maybe because Steven isn't just a corruption, but has a lot of Greg as well, Idk. Or Corruption is a more superficial version of what happened to Steven to the point where the being being corrupted wouldn't cease be but rather be compromised without losing it's essence."

We live in the NYC area so it's basically considered to be a middle class income around here. Rent and utilities are around $1500/month.

*Currently the distribution of expenses is: my husband pays for the rent. He also pays for his car (I don't have a driver's license or a car). I pay for most of the groceries and household expenses. We both pay for our own personal expenses. Since I have been unemployed I have used up the little bit I was able to save from my last job, my half of our wedding money, and some savings bonds I got from my maternal grandparents, and additionally my husband has given me around $9K. I offered to pay him back once I get my inheritance money but he said he just wants me to contribute $600/month to rent in addition to paying for groceries and household expenses.

*Currently my husband's savings are around $85K. He also has a 401K but he doesn't know how much is in it. I think he once said $50K, whatever it is he said it isn't much. I don't have any retirement savings because I have never had a good enough job to actually be able to save.

*We do not plan on ever buying a house. We are going to have kids, but not for a few years. My husband would like to replace his car in a couple of years and we will probably get a Toyota that costs around $25K. I don't plan on getting a car because it's honestly cheaper to take Uber for the one or two times a week I need to go somewhere by car without my husband, than it would be to pay for the car itself, gas, insurance, and repairs. (Most people around here commute to work by public transportation.)

*I would like to turn at least some of this money into some kind of nest egg or savings, through investments or putting it in some kind of special account. However, I am also concerned that there will be a stock market crash and I will lose everything.

*I really don't know ANYTHING about money or personal finance, taxes or anything like that. I have never had more than a few thousand dollars in my bank account and my highest paying job paid $27K a year.

*Here's where it gets kind of weird. My family was lower middle class for most of my life. We had a small and shabby apartment and we lived paycheck to paycheck for many years. However, my grandpa was able to accrue a ""nest egg"" in the later part of his life because he had a friend who helped him make good investments. My mom inherited some money from him when he died and he indicated that he wanted some of it to be used on our education. She used some of that money to pay for my college tuition in full. My tuition was around $22K a year and housing was around $5K a year. So overall about $105K in expenses. Anyway my mom and I have a bad relationship (she has some mental illnesses and was physically abusive, and has alienated many people) and we haven't talked to each other in a year and a half. But I do still feel guilty that she paid for my college education because I see so many people my age who are struggling with student loans. I feel bad that she essentially wasted her money on a bad investment (me). I would like to pay her back (whether she would even accept the money is another issue), and now I have the ability to do it. However, due to my unemployment situation I will not be able to do it right away and I would need to put the money in some kind of investment to make it accrue to the amount that I want. My mom is 58 and as far as I know she is planning to retire at 65. She has a government job with a pension and due to the inheritance plus some raises she got at work, I'm pretty sure she is doing ok financially. But I would like to pay her back as soon as possible.

So anyway, what should I do?"

5t2k51,0,2017-02-09,Anyone else get a weird vibe from Damien Chazelle?,thebyebyewoman,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/5t2k51/anyone_else_get_a_weird_vibe_from_damien_chazelle/,"Hear me out. I think the guy's a great filmmaker, but watching him in interviews (like this recent [THR Roundtable clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlbgekxUIV0&amp;t=5s) I can't help but get a weird vibe. Mainly because he's so awkward about discussing his past or hiding [how well-off his and his ex-wife's families are](http://www.mvislandweddings.com/news/2011/01/01/jasmine-mcglade-damien-chazelle).

First, why does Chazelle write off his first film *Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench* as a ""student film""? This is partially true, as he attempted a similar short shot on video while at Harvard. But the $100,000 16mm feature was made after he dropped out. Accepted to Tribeca over Sundance, the film got distribution thanks to Stanley Tucci (somehow he serves as the film's ""presenter""). Not too shabby for a ""student film"" he's now embarrassed by.

Second, why does Chazelle make himself out to be some writer ""no one liked"" before Whiplash? Yes, every writer struggles. But after *Guy and Madeline*, Chazelle signed with Gersh and started writing scripts landing on the Blacklist. That's better than most, even if *Grand Piano* wasn't an Oscar winner. And when he tries to be funny by hiding his past movies from Oliver Stone (see the end of the above clip), he honestly comes off a little smug. Probably not his intention, but every director at that table started at the bottom. I bet Stone would have liked him MORE if he admitted to writing *Last Exorcism 2*. After all, has Chazelle seen Stone's first film [*Seizure*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072136/)?

Third, as much as I enjoyed *La La Land*, why does Chazelle run around town talking about how ""magical"" LA is as if he's the first person to make a movie about it? Frankly, it's not surprising that the script was rejected for six years. Remove the actors, songs, and cinematography and *La La Land* is a story about how hard it is to make it as an actor in LA, how the majority of the word ""doesn't get *my* music,"" and how fun *Rebel Without a Cause*/Griffith Observatory dates are. He still made a fantastic movie, but on paper these cliches would definitely raise red flags under the scrutiny of any agency intern. His ""no one gets me"" shtick about the process is annoying.

Finally, why does Chazelle thank the ""love of his life"" Olivia Hamilton during every *La La Land* acceptance speech? He met her as an extra on the film, and she had nothing to do with getting it made. His ex-wife Jasmine McGlade financed *Guy and Madeline* with her mom, produced iterations of *La La Land*'s development, and got the *Whiplash* script to Helen Estabrook. They were on track to becoming the next Christopher Nolan/Emma Thomas. Who knows why they divorced, but thanking his new girlfriend at all these award shows seems disingenuous. He would be better off not thanking any girl at all.

Look, Hollywood is messy and stressful, and I doubt Chazelle is a bad person at heart. He has a huge ego that causes him to write off his past, or a publicist is trying to hammer a certain image. Either way, it comes off as forced and robotic."

5t3krv,1,2017-02-09,Can't stop thinking about my crush who is ruining me.,ThaparK,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5t3krv/cant_stop_thinking_about_my_crush_who_is_ruining/,"Don't know what and how to start with. (Sorry for my 'not so good' English)

This classmate from my college, I had a minute crush on him before we were started internship at the same workplace, and I accidentally rushed, and came out to him. *(I'm gay, he is definitely not.)* It did not turn out to be bad though. He said that I can trust him with it, and he asked me to be careful with life. I cleared a lot of his misconceptions as well *(Because he used to mess with me by saying stereotypical gay stuff)*. But we shared a lot of stuff and kind of became good friends, and I liked that.. Before our training ended, I told him about how he **used to** be my crush *(I knew that he's straight, and saying that I still have feelings for him would have messed things up)* His reaction was quite chilled to be honest, he was all like ""Why am I not your crush anymore?"" And he also mentioned that he is straight, so nothing would have happened anyway. But as the time passed by, I started liking him more and more. Maybe I fell in love with him eventually. There was something about him that made me like and care about him.

Things turned out bad when we went to this friend's party and we both got filthy drunk. A lot of puking and stuff happened (he told me some intense stuff about how his dad is cheating on his mom and shit, and I literally felt bad for him (I was silently crying. Because I understood what he's going through [even my dad cheated on my mom long ago and now they're divorced]), but I was still in my senses. He was not. He got up on a chair, said a lot of shit about his ex-girlfriends. After that he announced out loud to everyone that ***""/u/ThaparK is gay. He likes men.""*** I shut his mouth with my hands and instead of denying that fact, I said ***""I can explain!""***(Not that much in my senses, was I? It's kind of a /r/tifu material) I still took care of him, and his other friend dropped him back to his house. I went back to mine.
I was scared. Most of the people around me are homophobic, and I thought that now the entire college knows about it. The next day, we met again *(We do not hang out at all. The only reason we met is because he forgot his phone at the party, and I had it.)* He had no idea what happened. I told him what all happened and he was all like ***""I'll never drink again""***. I was not that mad at him, because he was super drunk. But I did point out to him over text that whatever he did was not cool at all, and I do not like him for that. To which he replied ***""Cool for me""*** *(He claims to be stoned at this time, when we fought weeks later)*. That got me infuriated.

College started, everyone knew about the party about how we both got drunk and ruined the party. No one mentioned or questioned about me being gay (Most of them know though, I'm pretty sure). Things were better than I expected. But I had to see his face everyday. I'm not good at fighting or being rude to people. But he did notice that I was ignoring him and was being rude to him whenever we met. That's when he texted me that ***""I'm trying to be normal here, but you have to be a stubborn asshole so it's not my fault""*** I mentioned how he was rude to me even though it was his fault, and he said ""I need to cut down on weed""
Tried hard not to, but I forgave him. (I kind of was in love with him, and I just couldn't deal with the situation properly. Still can't.)
Kind of became friends again. Hung out once or twice with his group of friends. He texted me that ***""You should hang out with is more often, you're like a part of us now""*** *(I thought I'm not in love with him anymore, and being friends is actually better than still falling for him.)* But then I felt left out all over again. He ignores my texts a lot of times. He still treats me like shit sometimes, just to look cool in front of his group of friends. We still talk sometimes, but I never feel good after that because I have trust-issues now and I'm just super confused (and maybe even depressed). I'm tired of handling so much of stress in my life. I try so hard not to think about him, but I still do. Unfortunately I still have feelings for him, and I cannot stop it, no matter how hard I try. I've cut him him off as many social media apps/websites as I could think of. (That's all I could do till now.) And now I just feel like a super loser who has no self-respect and is all stressed out.



TL;DR - Had a crush on this guy. Came out to him. I'm gay, he's not. We became friends though, shared secrets and intense stuff. One day, He got drunk. Told everyone that I'm gay. We fought and patched things up again. Thought that we're good friends now. Turns out we're not. He still treats me like shit and ignores me many times. We do talk though, but I never feel good. I don't know what to do now. Literally can't stop thinking about him. "
5t3oay,4,2017-02-09,The intern,TheChocolateGeek,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/5t3oay/the_intern/,"All stories I tell are 100% true.

There she was on her first day--looking lost and hair a little disheveled.  ""Can I help you find something"" I chivalrously offered.  ""No.  I am good just waiting for my manager"" She reflexively and dismissively responded.  But despite her words her eye contact lingered just a half second longer than it should.

Ran into her a couple more times in the hallway and slowly got conversation going and I took her to lunch a couple of times (my treat of course).  She is new to Atlanta from Buffalo.  Had moved down for school.  She got a new apartment next to the job but had no furniture yet.  ""Hey I know some great furniture stores in the area I will take you after work.""

Furniture shopping turned into drinks at a bar. We talked about pop culture the best I could---me being 38 at the time and she 24.  Afterwards in the car I tried to kiss her but she rejected me and I drove her home.

Long story short: more lunches and more after work drinks and we started making out in the car.  Helped her set up her cable and furniture one day after work.  Made another move.  She would only let me eat her pussy and wouldn't reciprocate.  She came explosively and just lay there exhausted while I made my exit.

Over the next few weeks she started insisting I come back to her place to watch TV, go to her apartment gym, play tennis etc etc.

Made another move:  Entered her *raw* for the first time.  ""You want to make this real?"" she said as I pumped.  Something made me freak out after hearing that. I pulled out of her and bumbled and excuse to leave.  I cant afford any commitment or attachments.

Long story short again:  started looking for excuses not to go back to her place.  Eventually SO discovers her numerous phone calls saved under ""Data entry support.""  She calls her back!  I get confronted.  Wiggled my way out of that one with an elaborate but plausible excuse why ""Data entry support"" was calling my phone dozens of times a week.

I had to end it.  Told her bluntly it is over.  Luckily her internship ended and I didn't have to run into her anymore.  Luckily I didn't get sued for harassment.

5t3ubl,2,2017-02-09,Advice on a sticky situation with me [24/F] and him [23/M]. Arranged marriages and gaslighting.,iamapair,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5t3ubl/advice_on_a_sticky_situation_with_me_24f_and_him/,"A long time ago, while I was still in high school, I began dating John. It was great, because it was mushy puppy love that high schooler's experience. We dated for a while and broke up at the beginning of 2015.


The breakup was not mutual. John said that I was suffocating the relationship. I didn't think I was, but I realize now that my depression and anxiety issues were destroying my life and his. During our break up, I became emotionally manipulative in a futile effort to win him back and keep him talking to me. 


About a year in, things started to get better for me, and I realized finally that I needed to take care of my issues. In a condensed version, I lost 30 pounds, transferred to the undergraduate program of my dreams and am on my way to my second internship in my field. I have learned to love myself and live independently. I rely only on me and it's a great feeling. Perhaps it's selfish, but at this point in my life, I put myself first.


During this time, John and I were still in contact. I felt it was not an unhealthy choice to continue speaking to him because I had become cognizant of my own issues and my part in our failed relationship. He had stated explicitly, multiple times, that he was not interested in dating me again or ever saw a future with me. Whenever we would fall back into old patterns, he was quick to remind me of this. These reminders forced me to move on completely and fully, and accept that the romance was done. It was extremely difficult, but it helped.


Recently, John has been going through difficult times with his family, who is very, very toxic and who he still lives with. He has no money to move out and is unemployed. He is currently in school. Because of his family issue, he is extremely isolated from his social circle and no longer has many friends. He spends most days at home because he is too depressed to leave the house. His frequency of contact with me has been increasing because he is lonely, and he often gets combative if I don't answer because I'm asleep, at work, in class, etc. I have tried to explain that I have a lot going on and I always make time to text him and keep contact throughout the day, as I do with all my good friends. 


A few night's ago, I receive a phone call from him, where he wants to discuss our future. Long story short, he wants to get back together with me. He also mentions the looming possibility and pressure from his parents for an arranged marriage (a tradition in his culture that his parents partook in). There is a girl they want to set him up with. He told me he realizes that he sees a future with us in it, and wants to know what I think.


I was absolutely floored. I don't understand why I would want to reenter a relationship that 1. was toxic, 2. that he stated MULTIPLE TIMES he saw no future with me, and 3. that I do not have a place in his culture. His parents don't like me, especially his mom, because I'm white and I don't have a ""favorable personality"" (her words). Additionally, the possibility of an arranged marriage makes me feel like a placeholder and last resort in his life, like a reason for him to get out of it. He is so intertwined with the toxicity of his family that I don't believe there is a scenario where he flat out says no to them if he has no palpable reason. 


So, I said this to John. He asked me to be honest and truthful with him. But of course, this was not the desirable answer he was looking for, and I told him he was setting me up to fail by establishing an expectation that I cannot give. He then began insulting me, saying I was ""too much for him,"" and that ""nobody will ever understand me better than he would"" based on how long we have known each other. This just gave me more and more reason not to want to enter a relationship. He told me that he ""expects a lot out of me,"" but how can I live up to someone's standard? It feels unreachable, and giving my history with multiple mental illness, sounds like a very unhealthy path for me to go down. 


I appreciate and value our friendship, but I am so stressed out and anxious over all of this. We ended the conversation with me saying I would think on it, which now I think was a mistake because I believe I gave him false hope. I went to bed crying last night. I don't want to be lonely and truthfully, nobody has expressed romantic interest in me for quite some time, but I also don't want to be the person someone settled for and just be a placeholder. I don't feel respected by John, as he loves to bring up my shortcomings to this day and tells me my career field is not viable. He barely listens to me when we have conversations. The friendship has its good parts, but it does not feel equal. I know by saying no, I don't want a relationship, we can no longer be friends.


Reddit, how do I dig myself out of this absolutely bananas complex situation? What do I say? How do I word this in a way to protect myself? And, if anyone has an understanding of arranged marriages, that would be great. Thanks.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Messy friendship complicated by an arranged marriage and feelings that are not reciprocal. "

I've got a job, after nearly a year of searching.",Geothrowaway3,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/5t4qwd/add_one_to_the_counter_ive_got_a_job_after_nearly/,"I was a petroleum geologist at an oil company, and got laid off almost a year ago.  I did exploration work and operations work.  The axe fell, and I immediately started applying for jobs.  Nobody was hiring.  

Two weeks after the layoff, my wife and I had our first child.  Luckily, I was able to still be on the company insurance plan.

I did a lot of random jobs for neighbors, over the past year, made some cash on the side.

We cut any additional expenses that we could.  Financially, we did fine, as I have always lived frugally, and will continue to do so.

My wife worked, this whole time, and we basically survived on her salary.

The impact of the layoff was severely damaging to me.  I felt trapped with a mortgage and had just started my role as a father.  Trapped, because there were no jobs left for me, and for many in my position, still are trapped.  Trapped with a specialized degree and skill set that wouldn't allow me to qualify for any job but oil and gas.  Some employers turned me away, because they knew an oil job could pop up and I would be gone as quick as I came.

""Should I go back to college.... again?""  

""When will I be 'good enough'?""   

""My degrees are currently worthless.""  

""Do I want to start another career path?""  

""Where are all of the geology jobs that I have heard so much about?""

I had multiple start-ups approach me, but not to have me as a partner, but to use me as an unpaid intern.  Slave labor.  I turned them all down.

The job is a geosteering analyst position, with a paycut of nearly 50% of my former paycheck, but I am grateful for the work.

My advice to others out there:

- Keep your resume and LinkedIn profile updated (that's how they found me)

- Keep attending networking events, job fairs, and other social events

- Contact old professors and colleagues that might help

- Continue to apply for all jobs that even remotely resemble something you might qualify for

- Remember that there are thousands of others who are feeling exactly the way you do

- You will survive this disaster, and you will go on to find another job.

- Every day, in every way, you are getting better and better."
5t4zzp,26,2017-02-09,HWW Game II: Pawnee Panic (Phase 4) - Mission Im-Pawnee-ble: Knope Protocol,PawneeSun,HogwartsWerewolves,https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/comments/5t4zzp/hww_game_ii_pawnee_panic_phase_4_mission/,"Ted Day was finally behind them, and the Parks department continued (rather half-heartedly) to break ground on the Harvest Festival. People might be worried now about sudden death via man-eating raccoon or man-eating librarian, but they had a job to do: to raise the spirits of Pawneeans with a historical (and agricultural) festival of fun and adventure! Nearly 110 businesses signed up to donate equipment, carnival rides, and assorted entertainment, and the Wamapoke people finally agreed upon an arrangement to allow the Parks department to hold the Festival on sacred Wamapoke territory as long as they honoured the Wamapoke people throughout the event. Leslie felt that they were pretty much ready to start plotting out sections for food, displays, and entertainment. She gathered what remained of her people around the site roped off for Harvest Festival.


""Okay, everyone. We have a lot to do today, so let's get started.""


Ann gave Leslie a disturbed look. ""Aren't you even a *little* worried about what might be lurking out here? Like raccoons? The murder-y ones?""


""Yeah, what are we even doing here? Everyone already knows that we're all going to die by Harvest Festival. And it'll be all gross and disgusting, because raccoons are going to tear our guts open. Or chew our heads off."" April snapped her gum.


Andy giggled. ""Haha, yeah, you'll be all gross and look like a corpse. And I'll totally divorce you.""


""Not if I divorce you first."" April broke into a rare smile while leaning in for a kiss.



""*Okay*, everyone, stop worrying, we're not going to die by raccoon, right Ron?"" Leslie looked to Ron expectantly.


""Right. But we may die by librarian if everyone continues to ignore my advice and compromise the safety of the group.""


""Moving on! We need to think about how we're going to build and transport all the necessary equipment to set up stages and booths. While Ron has graciously agreed to build everything we need, with Donna missing in action, we still have no feasible way to move everything in a timely manner. And although Ben is...*was*... our numbers guy, with him...""


Ann ventured, ""Missing?""


""Dead,"" April contributed.


""...not available to us right now, we need to work together to figure out how to fit everything in this space."" Leslie gestured to the area sectioned off.


Just then, a dark sedan with flashing lights and a blaring siren screeched to a halt just a few feet away from where everyone was gathered.


""--Leslie! Leslie!"" Chris, who never wasted an opportunity to go for a light 5K run, nearly tripped out of the government-issued sedan. Whatever it was, this news was serious.


""Leslie, they need you all back at command center right now! We have a class-one city emergency.""


""Oh my god."" Ann covered her mouth in shock.


""Gayle. My girls!"" Jerry, eyes wide in panic, started to run east, towards his house. Every else turned to stare at him, as he slowed to a desperate jog, bullets of sweat darkening his sweater vest already.


""Quick, what's the emergency?"" Leslie refocused on Chris as everyone else continued to watch Jerry's struggle to reach the next street over in a kind-of exhausted shuffle.


""Oh, this is just a drill, but I am having so much fun pretending it's real.""


""Are you kidding? The Department of Emergency Preparedness picked *today* of all days to review us?""


Andy wondered, ""What's the disaster preparedness thing?""


""They are a government group. Every year, all cities in Indiana are reviewed and graded on our level of preparedness. And Pawnee has failed every single year. In fact, on our last report, they stated 'Every time it so much as drizzles in Pawnee, the town is in danger of collapsing into post-apocalyptic mayhem', so it HAS to go well. As the town's Emergency Preparedness Czar, it is my duty to make sure we don't fail again,"" Leslie stated proudly.


""This better not mean what I think it means,"" Ron warned her.


""Everyone, new plan: TO THE VEHICLES! We're going back to city hall, Pawnee needs us.""


Leslie hurried excitedly to Chris' car, while everyone else shrugged and made their way to one of the 2 vehicles present.


April narrowed her eyes in thought. ""Wait...if we're busy all day with the stupid disaster people, who's going to do all the planning and stuff for Harvest Festival?


Leslie beamed. ""I have one word for you...*interns*.""


She paused to let that soak in.


""See, Ron? I told you hiring interns was a good idea.""


Ron's sigh ruffled his impressive moustache. Yet again, one of Leslie’s government ideas had come in handy.


“Come on, Ron!” said Leslie persuasively. “How much damage could the interns really do? Everything should be fine, as long as they don’t destroy the city!”


Ron kept his hopeful smile to himself. If only…


Ann took one last look at Jerry. The poor guy had finally collapsed on the lawn, and was clearly having trouble breathing. ""Hey, should someone stop Jerry?"" They stopped to think.


They could still hear his calls of ""Gayle!"" in the distance.


Chris shrugged. ""He’ll figure it out. To the command centre!""

My high school resume has a lot of programming EC's (Android apps,small games,tech startup with friends, hackathons, software internship, CS research) My GPA is 3.8 which I'm trying to bring to a 3.9 - 4.0 weighted. 

The only thing I am worried about is my classes. In Freshman Year I took all honor classes (Highest that school provides is Honors) but then messed up and got placed in regular/ college preparatory classes. Junior year I got placed back into Math honors but my school didn't let me go into Physics honors. I have A's in all my classes nonetheless.


Please be brutally honest: How will this affect my chances at SCS CMU? 


Any advice would be appreciated.


Thanks!"

So my doctor sent an appeal letter, and I included some brief comments as well.

I don't know what they're going to decide. If they ultimately decline my prescription, would it help to get a lawyer? Because I am on my last refill from the SDS pharmacy. I don't know what I'll do without Xyrem. I need it to be awake! I'm a college commuter with an engineering internship! I can't afford to not have Xyrem!"
5t52k1,8,2017-02-09,Was wondering if I could get some career advice?,teenagesadist,ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/5t52k1/was_wondering_if_i_could_get_some_career_advice/,"Hi /r/ccna, I'm in my third semester of a CCNA college course.

Now, I'm committed to completing this course, and getting my CCNA. I work at Subway part-time while I'm in school, and one of my coworkers works at a telecommunications business. It seems legit, and sounds like a good company.

However, over the past few months, I've been told to apply, and asked why I'm not applying, and been strongly advised to apply. Most people would wonder why I wouldn't apply. My only instinctual answer is that it seems to good to be true. Surely they could find people willing to work for them that aren't completely inexperienced IT workers? 

It's very possibly I'm reading too much into it, I just wonder if I'm not about to step into something with much higher expectations than I can live up to. The latest is that I'm wanted to apply for a summer internship, which seems like a solid gig. Over 15 an hour, doing cabling and maybe more, according to my coworker, because I'm in school for networking. I'm just wondering if anyone else has had any kind of the same experience. I don't want to jump in over my head here.

Any replies are much appreciated, thanks.

5t53b1,10,2017-02-09,[f4m] The intern with the lipstick,flirtygirl451,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5t53b1/f4m_the_intern_with_the_lipstick/,"You didn't notice me at first.

I mean, it's the largest law firm in the city. And with that territory, comes a flurry of interns, both law students and undergrads. Some are preppy frat boys whose daddies are old buddies of the senior partners. Some are college girls with tight, sexy bodies, but you can’t seem to get past their shrill laughter.

So lots slip in between the cracks. And for awhile, I did, too. But one day, a fellow partner made a crack to you. He mentioned how stressed he was, and made a crude reference to a few things he wanted a certain intern to do. Apparently she arranged a few things for a trial, and she was surprisingly competent, a rarity, even in this prestigious office.

And umf. Her body. But it was something else that drove his mind over the edge and into the gutter.

""She's the one with the lipstick,"" he mentions.

It's late one night, and it feels like all the partners are heading into trials or big negotiations. All of the interns are required to work — whether it be fetching coffee or redacting credit card numbers in trial notebooks.

You call down to the front desk and manage to spit out a few instructions to a secretary. You're exhausted, so you decide to waner down the street and get a quick sandwich. You instruct your assistant to have any intern still at the office this late deliver those notebooks to your office while you're gone.

You return a short time later and saunter into your office, not expecting anyone to be there. You open the door softly, and my back is turned towards you as I lean over your desk, placing heaps of three-ring binders onto your desk. Your eyes land directly on my ass. Curvy, and accented by a pencil skirt. My waist is narrow, and my long dark hair is curled down my back. With an exhale of frustration I turn around, and you see a young intern, probably 21, with bright green eyes that widen as I notice you. I'm short, only five three, with high cheekbones and striking dark hair.

And then you notice the lipstick.

5t54k5,0,2017-02-09,JLPT/Boston Career Forum/General Career Advice,daveburst,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/5t54k5/jlptboston_career_forumgeneral_career_advice/,"I'm currently a junior attending a top ten ranked undergrad business school in the US, majoring in Information Systems(have also taken multiple CS/programming courses to get a more technical foundation) and have been taking Japanese since my first semester. I also spent last summer at Sophia University studying Japanese. Lastly I will be graduating in December 2018.


My big plan was to take the JLPT(N2) this summer and go to the Boston Career Forum(in November) and hopefully get an offer. Unfortunately for me I just realized that the JLPT is offered only in December in America which I think will really hurt my chances trying to achieve that. I realize that there are smaller career forums by the same people in LA and NY but are there any other ways people have managed to get internships/jobs?


I also had to repeat a few classes from the beginning of my sophomore year(sophomore slump hit hard for me) which moved my whole schedule back a bit. I have looked for an internship in the US for this summer but I have to take two more business classes at community college this summer so most companies did not want to work with that time schedule. So for this summer I just planned on taking those two classes and studying Japanese like a mad man. (I'm using the Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course and 完全マスター books)


I guess what I'm looking for is how were you able to do it? What was the right path?

tl;dr I'm a very confused college student who is trying to land a job in Japan after graduation. I welcome any advice."

So my situation is as follows: I graduated with a B.Sc. in biology with minors in medical studies and history last March from a Finnish university. I then married my American sweetheart and moved from Finland to the States. After several months' wait I have finally received my work permit, and so I am now looking for jobs (doing graduate studies is also a possibility, but not right now). My biggest issue here is that I immigrated pretty much as soon as I finished school so I have zero bio related work experience, unfortunately. 

I am particularly interested in microbiology (esp. virology, in which I did my graduation thesis) and genetics and have been looking into finding a job in these fields, but so far with little (read: no) results. I've also looked into applying for internships, but most of them still require previous experience and/or a currents studentship and/or citizenship - all of which I sadly lack at the moment.

As I am still new to the country, I don't know where to go or whom to talk to... for example, back in Finland there is the Public Employment and Business Services Office, that is under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, which helps people in finding jobs that match their academic backgrounds/degrees. Is there something similar to that in California? From what I've read online so far it seems like proper connections help greatly in landing a job here, but I have obviously none of them (I live in the San Francisco Bay Area).

Should I contact companies/uni labs directly even if they have no open positions available on their websites? Phone or email or both? How should I start these interactions, what is acceptable and what is an absolute no no? If I find an ad that is about a job that would otherwise fit me and my background, but they require a certain skill I don't have, is it possible to take a course somewhere (open university?) to rectify that lack? At this point money is not a deal breaker, and I don't mind working with a minimum wage or even for free as long as I can work and gain experience and build a network in here (I understand that that is not something I should state when looking for a job so as not to appear too desperate, but I'm just writing it here for the sake of clarifying my situation... and because in reality I AM kind of desperate, lol). 

I would greatly appreciate all and any advice. Thank you in advance! "

Maybe I'm a masochist with a savior complex, maybe I'm just neckbait, but either way, I spend a lot of time in the company of emotionally manipulative assholes, some of whom actually have worn fedoras. Fedorae? Whatever. Here's the most recent one.

I met Jefferson at our school's tabletop game club. Right away, I could tell we'd clash on a few things--I'm an ambiguously gay feminist who interns at a homelessness nonprofit, he's a libertarian, Trump-voting environmental science major--but he seemed pretty cool, and we could both put political stuff aside and be friends. Fight out whatever you have to say in the comments.

After some time, Jefferson told me about the book he was writing. I won't go too far into it, but it was a scifi novel starring a teenage girl, so he wanted some advice from someone who had experience in that field. The funnier parts of that conversation:

* He genuinely couldn't accept the concept that a girl might be judged more on her appearance than a guy.

* As his character is bi, he asked me a LOT of questions about my sex life. Loudly. We were in the dining hall.

* Apparently, me not wanting to tell him in great detail about my experience level eating girls out makes me a ""prude"".

Here's the less funny part:

&gt; Jefferson: So, you've gotta understand that this is a girl with some value. Not, you know, like you.

&gt; Me (Luna): Like me?

&gt; Jefferson: You know, defective.

I decided to play along, if only for you beautiful motherfuckers.

&gt;Me: So what exactly does ""defective"" mean?

&gt;Jefferson: I mean, I could list a few things. For starters, your head's fucked. Don't you take stuff for that?

For context, I take antidepressants. I'd mentioned it once in a conversation about health care (preexisting conditions), but I didn't think Jefferson would use it like this. I'm also an ex-cutter, which affects my life more than it probably should.

&gt; Me: Yeah, but that's a genetic thing that I'm dealing with. How does that make me defective?

&gt; Jefferson: It's an evolutionary weakness. Like the whole, you know-- *with a cutting motion on his wrist* --slice-and-dice thing. You end up locked up in the psych ward for that. No guy's going to want you there.

Again, we were in public. As speaking softly is not Jefferson's strongest suit (he prefers to talk at you and anyone in the immediate vicinity), I could already see the next table in the caf looking over at us. I tried to shut down the conversation as fast as I could without some kind of freakout.

&gt; Me: Well, it's lucky I like girls, then.

&gt; Jefferson: Well, yeah. That does actually give you some redemption, the whole virgin thing.

&gt;Me: Jefferson, you know that [my girlfriend] and I have fucked, right?

&gt; Jefferson: Yeah, but that doesn't count as, like, real sex. Neither of you has a dick. So you still have that bit of value as a girl, since some guy's gonna get to take that. But outside that, you really don't hold much value as a girl.

Jefferson reached across the table as if to take my hand, but I grabbed it away.

&gt; Jefferson: Look, Luna, you're just not the kind of person who gets loved, okay? You should take what you can get while you can.

Now, two years ago, I might have fallen for that. Now, though, I'm proud to say that I got up, gave him a withering look, and walked away while ""Needed Me"" by Rihanna played in the background.

Except I didn't. I'd had a bad day overall, so when Jefferson hit that particular nerve, I began tearing up on the spot. And when he tried to give me an awkward, consolatory pat on the shoulder, I straight up started sobbing. Jefferson stuck around a little while longer until the dirty looks he was getting from a couple girls at the next table started getting to be too much, at which point he skedaddled. Bright side: one of the girls gave me a wet wipe for my mascara and asked me if I needed a hug, which was highly appreciated. Gotta love girl code.

TL/DR: I'm too damaged and gay to be loved, college girls are really nice."

Been thinking of transferring to computer science or electrical/software engineering. I was wondering how York prepares students in terms of surviving in work places, specially for co-op/internship placements. 

I've known people(who I would consider to be pretty smart) from different universities who had a really hard time getting a grasp on things due to schools not covering most of workspace environments. 

I know York has some special courses that helps with co-op interviews and such. But I'm mainly curious about the courses itself that they teach on the field of computer science / software engineering. 

If you are in or have had internship placements I would also love to hear about your experience :) "
5t665k,3,2017-02-10,Should I stay or should I go home?,Unleaver,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5t665k/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go_home/,"Okay guys this is the situation:


I am currently a student at the University of Pittsburgh. I study Information Science here at the school. Previously I went to community college, in which I got 2 degrees in IT Networking and IT Security. I have intern experience from last summer, and I am interning for IT again this summer.


Now the problem.
I am currently 33k in debt. By the time I finish here at Pitt I will be about 70k in debt. Not all of my credits transferred here to Pitt so I have to stay an additional semester, which means more loans. All of my college is, except my apartment and bills, I pay for in loans. My parents said they can keep paying for my apartment, but I just dont think I can do another semester here. Should I just cut my loses, go to work, pay off this debt, and go for my bachelors degree later, or should I just bite the bullet and get the degree now. 

Keep in mind that I have a girlfriend back at home that I havent see in a while (we long distance), I get kind of homesick, and I have not made my friends here. What do I do?!?


EDIT: A little bit more background. I can transfer to a lesser school in my area, however, is the University of Pittsburgh worth it or can I just go to another school and not pay as much, and still make as much money in my field? Am I going to make more money with this Pitt education?"

Upon uncovering the dirty secret of futuristic theme-park Futureworld, an ex employee is killed after he tips-off 2 other reporters who decide to do an undercover investigation.

It's an interesting movie, with an added political conspiracy. It's not as good as the first movie, but I did enjoy it and I would recommend it to the fans of the first movie. **7/10**

I started this challenge on 5th October 2016 and finished on 9th February 2017. It was an eye-opening adventure, I enjoyed it for the most part. I will continue to update every time I watch a movie for the first time until 5th October 2017. Then I will probably try to do the challenge again.

As an intern I don't have much time to Google this so I'm asking here.

I have to sort some Excel documents and update the e-mail contacts for some people. The problem is that sometimes I find a second e-mail address so when I double click the box to add the new information, the computer thinks I want to e-mail this person and so it opens Mail.

I went through the Mail program settings but there is nothing that prevents it from opening. Is there a way to stop this? I tried formatting the style of the column but maybe I didn't do it right (I don't know Excel inside and out). I wouldn't mind using a keyboard shortcut to edit the cell (I don't use a mouse so my hands are always on the keyboard anyways).

Hopefully one of you holds the answer that will save my sanity, thanks!"

It's always been something I've wanted to get into but just haven't had the funds to support it. I just got a paid internship so it looks like I can finally start! When talking with a friend about getting started, he said that it's PIVOTAL to have a good PC even if I want to mainly want to stream on PS4. The whole plan is still relatively new so I'm not sure exactly what I'll be needing it for. But here's what I DO know: I would like to run some basic games like Rust or rocket league. I want to run an el gato from the pc to the ps4. I'll be using 2 monitors. One for twitch and the other for game. And finally, my budget is around 500-600 dollars. Please don't crucify me if any of this is laughable, I'm extremely new to this all. Sidebar, is what my friend said true or can I do steaming just fine with my somewhat slow, basic desktop, el gato, and ps4. I appreciate the help!

5t89qa,3,2017-02-10,Any advice on how to pay for college with minimal student loans?,taariya,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/5t89qa/any_advice_on_how_to_pay_for_college_with_minimal/,"I'm an in-state extremely low-income student looking to attend the University of Illinois this fall. According to my net cost estimation, I could expect to pay about $15,000 through loans annually if I don't receive federal aid or get a lot of scholarship money. (Tuition is $$35,000 and according to them I can expect $20,000 in grants and need-based financial aid). 

If I take out $15,000 a year in loans (assuming I renew the grants I got and receive the same amount in aid from the school each year, which I don't know is realistic) then that leaves me a whopping $60,000 in debt after I get my bachelor's. Even just $10,000 in loans would amount to $40,000. 

This school is my first choice. I got accepted at UIC, but the computer science program at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign is miles and away superior to the one at UIC. Based on my research and conversations with alumni, they get a lot of internships and recruitment offers and make a lot more money upon graduation than the people who go to UIC since UIUC is nationally ranked. Plus, I just think UIUC is somewhere where I'd be happier and fit in better than at UIUC because of the different atmosphere and kind of people who go there.

Is it reasonable to accept that amount of debt for a chance at a higher-paying job later on? Is there anything I can do to increase the amount of aid I get either now or in the future? If I try to reduce costs by living off campus, will my financial aid cover my living expenses or will I have to find a job and pay for that on my own? Will the amount of aid I get from the school vary from year to year, assuming that neither my income or my parents' income changes dramatically?  Will I have to start paying back the loans only after I get a stable job, or will payments be due as soon as I graduate?"

I want to share with you guys the story of **Hamtern**, my office’s most recent month-long “intern”. Some quick context: my office is fairly active. Half my team goes to lunch yoga once a week together, and most of us make regular use of the gym facilities our building has. I’m also active and talk about my training/active hobbies often because I have no life outside of them and they’re genuinely fun. 

Meet…

&gt; Hamtern: 4’ 9”, 150lbs+. Looks kinda like a human, upright version of a tragically overweight dachshund. Barrel-like body, stubby arms and legs.

Hamtern is nearing the end of her month with us and we have run out of make-work for her to do (read: everyone avoids giving her work to do because she cannot complete the simplest task without fucking it up), so she’s just ~~playing on her phone~~ shadowing me for the morning. Our talk turns to what we’re up to and blah blah blah. We somehow end up on the topic of weightloss.

Hamtern hums and hahs about her dilemmas with her weight.

&gt; Hamtern: Well, I want to lose weight, but it’s just so hard. I mean, I don’t have the time to workout.

&gt; Me: Oh, but you don’t have to workou—

&gt; Hamtern: I mean, I have to wake up at *7am* just to get the kids ready for school. And then I have to work, and then I have to get the kids… By the time I get home it’s 5pm and I have to make dinner, and then I’m so tired by 7pm that all I can do is watch TV.

Note: She knows I have 5:30 am training sessions two or three times a week and am out of the house until 10pm doing my various hobbies ⅗ days of the week. There are also three others in the office who have children younger than Practic-ham’s who keep active despite similar time restrictions.

&gt; Me: Y-yeah, that sounds hectic…. But hey, I guess it’s a good thing that you don’t have to workout to lose weight, right?

&gt; Hamtern: No! Oh, no, no! You need to work up a sweat to lose weight! You can’t lose weight any other way. You really have to sweat it all out. It doesn’t work if you don’t work up a sweat.

&gt; Me: …

&gt; Hamtern: Besides, I don’t like to sweat and I’m not strong. I can’t workout. It’s too tough. It takes too much effort.

&gt; Me: Well, sure, yeah. We all start somewhere, though — you’d get stronger and gain endura-

&gt; Hamtern: But, you know, my doctor says I’m healthy. My weight is all because of the birth control I took. It isn’t my fault — the pill makes you gain weight.

Her youngest child is 6 years old. She has not been on birth control for 6 years. Unbeknownst to her, I’ve been on birth control for 5 years and have lost weight.

&gt; Hamtern: Oh, well. I mean, it’s not like I need to lose the weight. It’s all just water weight, anyways. Like, at least 20 lbs is water weight. My doctor told me so.

And that’s when I decided that, y’know, fuck the resources I was gonna show her. All the free workouts ain’t gonna help someone too tired at 7pm to do anything more than watch TV, MFP ain’t gonna work for someone who thinks 20lbs of water weight is totally what it is, and I am not going to risk my job because some intern can’t use brains.

**Juicy TL;DR**

* One *must* work up a sweat — not a light sheen, like you gotta fuckin’ drown a puppy in it — to lose weight. What you eat doesn’t matter, what you do for exercise does.

* Having only 12 hours (7am-7pm) of time during the day when you do things is more than enough — waking up early or staying up a little later to do any sort of activity is literally impossible.

* If you have children, you do not have time for yourself in any way.

* Going on the pill 6 years ago is what causes weight gain. Like, lots of weight gain.

* 20lbs of excess weight is just water weight — your doctor will say so."

5t9vme,1,2017-02-10,"Crohns Disease, the root cause of all my problems?",homeboy0,CrohnsDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/5t9vme/crohns_disease_the_root_cause_of_all_my_problems/,"**Warning: This post contains heaps of self pity**
I know the title of this post sounds irrational but hear me out. 

I am a 23 year old guy, I got diagnosed with crohns disease when I was 20. But in the last 12-13 months crohns disease has really f**ked me over.
Last year at University things were going great; I was actually at the top of my class in some modules. I had just started remicade/inflixmab and I was seemingly in remission. Literally everything was looking up. Then suddenly in January 2016, I took ill and in coming months required 3 long hospital stays (January-March 2016). On the third hospitalised I received surgery in which my large bowel was removed- I now have a stoma bag. This was a traumatic few months. I spent weeks on end in a depressing hospital ward feeling severely ill. My body was put through a lot numerous ct scans, mri scans, infusions- everything even before surgery. Then the recovery from surgery was hard. On top of that getting used to having a stoma bag was difficult. Even getting used to sleeping in my position with a stoma bag was hard.

By mid April I was feeling good again (a prospect I couldn't have imagined a month beforehand). Physically I was better and I was getting used to going out with a stoma bag. Remarkably, I got caught up at University and things were looking up again! I had performed so well at University I got offered a summer internship- a golden opportunity to make money and gain valuable experience. 

This is where I will probably begin sounding a bit crazy. I got a haircut in early June. This haircut was a f**king bad short haircut. My self confidence regarding my image was already in a bad place at this time I was very underweight (due to illness) and was getting used to living with a scar and a stoma bag. But this haircut just put me over the edge. I was eagerly waiting for my hair to grow back (normally it grew back quite fast) but after a few weeks it became apparent my hair wasn't growing back. I found myself constantly looking in the mirror wondering 'How could my hair be getting shorter?'
It seems the hair loss was linked with the surgery because male Pattern Hair loss does not run in my family. By the way, I know hair loss might not be a huge deal for some guys but I have a big and apparently odd shaped forehead so I really relied on having a long fringe.

I started  my summer internship being very discontent with my appearance. I hated how I looked to be frank. I no longer felt I looked like me. I was also anxious about my stoma bag leaking. I felt in a constant tense, anxious state and I just couldn't concentrate on the work I was supposed to be doing. I had to quit and I did.

I attended counselling sessions after quitting. My counsellor informed me that I had the symptoms of BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder), anxiety and depression. So three mental health issues. 

It seems my hair will never grow out again. I am currently taking a gap year at University and STILL struggling to get back on my feet. The amazing thing about all of this is I am currently in remission and crohns disease is no longer causing me any physical health issues. But my point is look at what crohns disease has cost me; 
-A year at University
-Work experience (which would have been gold for my CV),
- My self confidence
- My mental health
- My looks (I never was confident beforehand but I never thought about my appearance much beforehand either. Now I just hate how I look)
- And my happiness. On top of not feeling like I look like me anymore, I no longer feel like my happy self anymore :(  This feeling of unhappiness has caused me to lash out at my family and become isolated.

Has crohns disease had this huge negative impact on anybody elses life? And if so, do you ever wonder ""why me?"""
5ta645,1,2017-02-10,"I 27M/F have a workplace situation, not sure if handled correctly",Workhelp33,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ta645/i_27mf_have_a_workplace_situation_not_sure_if/,"Trying to keep this anonymous as possible. 

Work in a very technical field for a well known company not many women work in, worked in this place for 1.5 years professionally and 3 years as an intern before that. Work with people 10, 20, 30 years my senior, some having been there their entire careers. Company cut major benefits recently and we lost a lot of people and our team has been skeleton crew for a while. I also had a major surgery and major life impacting person stuff happen during this time (think divorce, adoption, immediate family death type situation). 

It takes people years of regularly doing what I do to get good at it. I'm not doing exactly what was taught in university either, they actually did not offer anything in terms of the speciality I ended up in a role for. I'm working very hard to become good at it but I just don't have the time after work on a regular basis to spend practicing, which is what most people do. I work 40+ hours a week and my boss is in board with how things are going. I was knocked on a yearly review for this being an area I need to improve and we discussed a plan for me to do so. Since January I've been busting my butt working most nights and some weekends when I can amidst my personal life but I'm definitely not able to spend much time outside of work doing more work right now. 

In comes a new director for our team since our old one quit after benefits were cut. I'll call this person TD. TD is not above any of us and reports to same manager but we are expected to look to them for leadership. To is not much older than myself. TD  has created a very hostile work environment and I've talked to my boss 2x now about it, once earlier this month, once this week, and found out from my boss the other team mates are in a similar boat with TD. TD is exceptionally skilled at what they do. Socially however not so much. We are supposed to be working closely with TD to learn more about what they know, like everyday kind of thing. Here's some of what's happened recently since TD moved to team. 

* 1) TD is very aggressive. When pointing out how something should be done differently things become personal attacks instead of focusing on the issue at hand. One such instance when a completely appropriate action was performed (senior team member getting clarification on a project they'd been assigned from another team member) turned into an hour long meeting with a lot of personal comments directed at them and the senior team member left due to the aggressiveness. The rest of us were still in the room trying to diffuse but it just ended up being TD repeating that other coworker didn't see it the way they wanted and it kept being drawn back to personal slights. This was referenced by TD multiple times afterwards until the coworker complained to several managers. That's when I went to boss the first time because TD couldn't let it go and now people were afraid to talk to each other to get work done, I saw that as a serious issue. I was asked how ok I felt working with TD and at this point said I was ok doing so as long as TD worked on communication skills and we didn't have more behavior like that. Management called a meeting to go over ""recent issues"" with the team the next week to discuss some of this in a very anonymous fashion and so I've been trying to wait and see if it resolves itself after TD was talked to and the team had a safe place to bring up these concerns and address them together. Apparently not. 

* 2) If people are so much as 1 minute late to a conference TD will aggressively gesture and and make sure we all look at their watch and shake their head. If the call involves remote employees TD will mute our room's line to comment on another team members work in a derogatory way, ie ""they must not be working since they did this or they aren't doing their job""  and insults them to the people in the room. Sometimes these talks continue after the call has ended. 

* 3) I had a very concerned coworker come to me in confidence yesterday regarding a conversation TD had with a couple other coworkers. Specific examples of me working with TD on things I was stuck on, which my boss directly told me to do when stuck, go work with TD, were used to explain to these other coworkers how this person (TD didn't name me, but used pronouns and examples that made it very clear who I was enough for others to come tell me) should not have their job anymore and how there are more qualified people that should instead and TD is looking for a way to make that happen. This co-worker expressed fear for their position as well and asked me not to talk to anyone about it. Now I went to boss again as boss said please tell them if TDs behavior doesn't improve and though it's gotten less outwardly aggressive, things are not going well and at this point I don't feel comfortable working with TD. 

* 4) I had coworker who was insulted for an hour pull me aside this week to express how they aren't sure they can work there any longer and urged me to think if it was a conducive environment for myself. They were deeply upset after being there for 25 years to have this level of fear and lack of ability to collaborate. We discussed hr but decided against it.

* 5) If TD has a suggestion for how something should be done and the team doesn't agree the team is kept in meetings for however long it takes for people to just finally agree to do it how TD thinks it should be done. There is very little room for compromise and many people are feeling unable to speak up anymore about simple basic things. I've just started leaving those meetings early to try and get work done with approval from boss to do so. 

People are scared. It's killed productivity and cost us a lot of time. Our team won company wide awards for our work last year and now it's a shell of what it used to be. I know others are looking for other jobs and I no longer feel ok working with TD at all right now when it's being taken to other corkworkers to sow discontent. I am constantly on eggshells at work afraid to take a lunch (taken 2 since January and don't take breaks anymore for fear it'll be used against me to others) or God forbid be a minute late to a meeting. I'm afraid if I'm out for an appt or whatever I'll be torn apart to my other co-workers because TD does it to me about others all the time. I can barely stand to be near TD after the visibly physical reactions TD has when someone upsets them. After 2 weeks of TD being there and incidents happening I began feeling so intimidated by TD I no longer felt ok even stopping by their office. 


So my question is, did I completely fick myself here? It's true I am the least skilled team member, it's true there are other people much more skilled than I that were laid off months ago (on other teams that were shut down)  It's true I've struggled with my personal life and not come up to speed as fast as many people do as I don't have the extra outside time to put time in. I'm getting fmla paperwork done to try and protect myself for missing work to handle legal issues, something before TD was there I had no issue with as I always make the time up and get my work done. Now I second guess everything I'm doing and worry I'll be called into TDs office for something trivial, ie a report had some spacing issues with a couple lines of text or something. 

It may come down to TD or me and TD brings more technical skill. However,  according to my boss I'm not the first or only person to discuss it with them, just the only one to step up a second time. I was urged to get others to come forward but they don't want to and I'm not comfortable pushing them to do so. 

I'm worried I just sealed my fate but felt like if I did nothing I was going to loss it anyway. I pay the mortgage with my income and have a kid to worry about, I'm really not wanting to lose my job after going to school and trying so hard. Feedback from rest of team is I'm doing well, ESP all things considered with what I have going on. 

Is it time to go to hr since TD hasn't threatened me personally? Since my boss asked me if I was comfortable working with TD I felt it was a good idea to tell them when I no longer felt comfortable doing so. 

I worry I'm being too sensitive but the fact everyone is seemingly feeling this way and multiple people are talking to me afraid and management already held a team meeting to discuss some of this I don't think I am being too sensitive, I think it's truly a hostile place and the seeds of discontent are being sown in a very counter productive way. 

How do I handle this? TD is going to know someone else came forward and I'm scared they will know it was me. That's why I wonder if hr shouldn't be involved, though my boss was seemingly offended when I said that and said there hasn't been anything personally directed at me so it's not the right thing to do. 

Advice on next steps? 

**tl;dr: new employee brought in after old one left as a leader but not above team. Creating hostile work environment multiple people have spoken up about. Just went to boss 2nd time and wondering if hr should be involved as I fear for my position. Not sure what to do**

I'm barely keeping my bills paid and I'm about 2 weeks away from not being sure how I'm going to pay for rent AND daycare on top of the shithole of debt I've dug myself into. It looks like I pass the means litmus to file chapter 7 in my state.

My mom passed away almost 4 years ago and it was kind of the catalyst that led me to where I am today. I relapsed into a depressive psychosis and was a hot fucking mess. I left an abusive ex. I moved states to get away from him shortly after my mom passed and the snowball kept rolling from there. Then I met my SO, got pregnant after a year together and had the tiny tyrant, who is now almost 4 months old.

I don't even know my tax situation, I'm sure the IRS would be harassing me if I owed anything? I haven't filed my taxes in almost 5 years... I dunno how to even go about making that right.

I guess I just need to know it's gonna all be ok? And that's why bankruptcy is a thing? To help people like me who've been dealt a shitty hand in recent years get back on the right track? I've been trying to hold it together long enough for my SO to get a job better than his internship, and God bless him he's trying. But it's not enough. Thankfully were not married so I don't have to suck us both into this shithole of filing bankruptcy.

I have a consult next Thursday. I'm probably going to break down into a blubbering mess in front of these people. =/"
5taiop,12,2017-02-10,"Has anyone worked with PCOS specialist Dr. Freije At the Fertility Institute in Encino, Ca.?",calamaririot,PCOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/5taiop/has_anyone_worked_with_pcos_specialist_dr_freije/,"I'm overwhelmed by my PCOS in a significant mental and physical way and as a self-employed Covered Ca. PPO health insurance holder, I'm getting straight up screwed by the system. Since I turned 26 (I'm turning 29 in a few weeks), I have had a series of strange, disappointing, and in some cases, downright unethical doctor visits. 

((((Really long rant about doctors, skip if you would like)))

When I had an HMO, I was given a primary care doctor who did not speak enough English to see me without an English speaking nurse in the room. He gave me info packets, some in Spanish, about how to take care of PCOS. One of them was the Wikipedia page on PCOS. He at least gave me metformin and spiro, but he was unwilling to negotiate on my birth control. He had one he gave out to all his patients, and with the prescription, he gave me a pen and a stress ball with the name of the birth control. 

Whatever the birth control did, I started breaking down and having massive fits of uncontrollable rage around my period. I fought to get another primary care doctor and the process took 4 months. This time, I got a doctor who spent had a two month wait for appointments and ended up spending five minutes in the room with me, didn't shake my hand, didn't call me by name, and didn't look me in the eyes. He got blood tests done because he wasn't going to do anything until he confirmed I had PCOS. He then sent me to a endocrinologist. 

The endocrinologist experience was the most dehumanizing thing I have ever experienced. They failed to tell me they would only be accepting my health insurance for two more weeks. So I get to the appointment and the receptionist tells me I can see the doctor and pay my $45 co-pay, or I can cancel the appointment and pay their $75 cancellation fee. I decide to see the doctor, because why not. I get sent to a room, wait 20 minutes, and then an Asian man in plain clothes comes in with a small medical gown (I'm 6 feet, 250 pounds) and tells me to get undressed, put that on, and ""prepare for doctor"". I tell him there is no way that this is going to cover me, so he brings in another small gown and tells me to put them both on. He leaves before I can say anything, so I look through the drawers in the room I'm in and find an XL gown that I put on, with the intention of telling the doctor that I found her assistant to be wholly unprofessional. I wait another half hour and then an old Asian woman bursts into the room, followed by one younger Asian woman and a younger Asian man. And by younger, I mean YOUNGER. The boy had a pimply face, and he blushed when he saw me. The doctor does not introduce herself and beings to bark at me. ""You have PCOS? How do you know?! Where are you symptoms? You have diabetes?"" Then she looks at the two people behind her and says ""she look like she have diabetes."" And then this bitch starts grabbing at me and showing them the dark hair on my face, the dark skin on my neck and underarms, my belly, acne. The way she was talking was as though she was showing them examples in a text book. I tried to stop her, but she talked over me. She started to ask me about hair loss as she was pulling out the stirrups for me to put my legs up, and so finally told her to stop. I told her so didn't know who she was, I didn't not know who the other two people were in the room, I do not consent to them being here, and I would like to stop the examination, because my intention was to talk to her about the treatment she would to take with me. She told me they were medical interns in training, like we were in a teaching hospital and so had consented for any of this. I told her no and she literally put her hand on her hip and gave me the longest sigh I had ever head in my life. I was almost to the point of tears (or rage). This woman had just pointed out every inch of me that I'm insecure about to two strangers, and she was being horrible. She told me ""you waste no more my time. You get blood test done and you come back."" I told her I already had a blood test done and that she had a copy of it. She almost screamed at me ""no, you get my blood test done!"" At that point, I blinked at her a couple of times, and then told her to please leave so I could get dressed and leave. I stood up so that I towered over everyone in the room, and she just left. The other two people didn't say or do a single thing the entire time. I got dressed and left, and as I left, the receptionist asked if I would like to set up another appointment and had a blood work form for me. I laughed at her and told her I was going to file a formal complaint with every single source I could find that would prevent other people from being abused by that woman. I ended up making several complaints, my health insurance took my side and didn't pay her, and I actually got to talk to someone with the Medical Board of California who took the complaint very seriously and told me I wasn't the first person to file a complaint. About six months later, I couldn't find her online, so I hope she lost her license or something.

Anyway, after that, I decided to go with a PPO. Two years ago, I got hooked up with an okay doctor who was really hard to make appointments with and listened, but suggested so try exercise and eating right before we try meds. Before so could see him again, I received noticed that he wouldn't be taking my health insurance anymore. Then my identity got stolen randomly and I couldn't pay my health insurance for 9 days because all my accounts were on hold, and my health insurance dropped me.

I had to wait until the next year to get new health insurance. I got connected with a really good psychiatrist, and an awesome ob/gyn. That was 2016. Things were just starting to get back to normal when I was informed that both of them would no longer be taking my health insurance. The psychiatrist is negotiating with me and is giving me a really fair deal, but the ob/gyn wants to charge $450 every time so see her...I just can't afford that and to be paying $300 a month in health insurance anyway.

(((End long rant)))

So I decided to say fuck it, and do some research on PCOS specialists in the area. I found the Fertility Institutes and they have a specialist in PCOS. They are going to charge me $425 for a consultation fee, but then most of the treatments will (hopefully) be covered by insurance. I'm not going for fertility treatment, just symptom management and general lifestyle improvement. This doctor has peer reviewed research on PCOS and I'm finding some positive reviews, but all in all, not a lot of anything. I'm just wondering if anyone has any personal experience with this man, or if you have any other recommendations in the LA area."

These are the most pertinent things to my situation. I NEED out fast because I will not be a puppet for the next four years.
I had an altercation with my parents just a bit ago simply because I asked not to get picked up this weekend, so I could take part in a game tournament. It may seem silly, but I've missed so many opportunities to form bonds with others but I can't. I'm alone, and no one around me understands why. I cut off intimacy and friendships frequently, not because I dislike them but because I know I'm not in a situation where I could get to know them for reasons stated above. I don't want to do that anymore."
5tatlp,0,2017-02-10,A Message to Jagex,Chicxen,2007scape,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/5tatlp/a_message_to_jagex/,"I know I know it's a wall of text, TLDR; at the end. I encourage the read.

First of all I'd like to thank you sincerely for bringing back the game I grew up playing, and the game we all fell in love with. Without a doubt a massive percentage of this subreddit wouldn't be visiting runescape.com in any capacity if it weren't for osrs, and that's something to be proud of. Second, I would like you to take the criticism in this post as constructive. I am not flaming on twitter, or saying ""osrs is now rs3 gg no re unsubbed.""

From the first day I found this game I loved EVERY aspect of it. Dying was brutal, I won't lie, but every aspect was amazing. The sub par graphics, the click to move (rather than wasd), and the insane achievement that was a 99. If I saw someone with 99 prayer, they were sooooo rich. If I saw someone with 99 mining, they were so dedicated and amazing at the game. The blue trim. OMG. This was how I felt when you guys brought the game back as well, and the polling system, well it was almost perfect. 75% is a majority by far, and every update would be polled. Perfect. First complaint from a friend when he heard I was playing again.. ""Won't it just go back to rs3 in 6 years.."", my response? ""Nah, they have this polling system.. etc""

It started well, but has become flawed.

Since raids were released you have taken it upon yourselves to make updates, whether you felt as a ""hot fix"" or ""patch"" without polling. Some things I understand, bugs, forgetting a feature that was meant to roll out in the update, etc. But some things you have changed (and specifically said you wouldn't) that affected the economy, the gameplay, and the style that was Old School Runescape.

I have two main examples. 

1) Manipulating the drop tables.
As I stated before, I loved every aspect of runescape. Someone with a 99? INSANE. Someone who got an ely drop? OMGGGG. However, a large player base likes aspects of mmo's that aren't what Runescape was based on. Raiding in WoW (the little I know about it) takes time, and teamwork, etc. You did well with raids. But in WoW, and other mmos I'm sure, the drops are consistent. Maybe not the best ones, but you seem them a good amount of the time, even the legendaries.. 

This is not what runescape was built on. We want things to be hard to achieve. We want things to take work. Otherwise, what's the point?

I was even a little sad you bumped the rates for the first day. I wanted to see a bow in the first week, not 3 in the first 6 hours. As I stated, changing the drop tables because ""you have an idea of what the price should be"" is just astoundingly confusing to me. The game was built on rarity, and the way the prayers were released and polled to be released were not price specific. And this is a game changing thing.

2) Changing the fundamentals of mechanics.

As stated before, I love this game, and have loved every aspect. The reason people play runescape is for the grind. When you start adding a hotbar and that hold ""2"" and drop an inv, or plant a trap in rs3, people lost interest. There was an achievement but it wasn't the same, the game was changed. 

Now we are voting on making dropping 2 actions, or 1 if you use sticky keys. Versus 3. Construction will be 2 less (move, click, move vs click) every time you create something. This equates to easier levels, easier exp, and easier gameplay and it's not what people play the game for. It's for the achievement.

Now I know this was long and went on a ton of tangents, but pretty much I'm saying that the game you created was amazing. And we like it as close to the original as we can get without it being RSC. All of these changes (which seem to be almost guaranteed to be implemented) are pushing us incredibly close to rs3. EOC was the first step, but you're dodging that bullet here. Taking away 2-3 actions, per action, for a skill that takes, idk, 100k actions? You're making it 50-75% easier than before on the basis of mechanics.

Basically, if you want to change the game to cater to the player who haven't played the game since the beginning, and thing ""oh yeah shiftclick would be sick cuz then I wouldnt have to right click"" you are looking at the audience who will drive you back to rs3, and the audience who DID NOT bring this game back to life.

-------------

Those were my concerns and feelings. I'd like to offer a few suggestions.

1) Make the ability to vote in a poll a way higher requirment. Something like 1250+ total (or higher, maybe like 1500) to show that you have spent a decent amount of time in the game and understand what it's about. Currently you could create and make 10+ accounts to the vote requirement EASILY before the poll is over.

2) Poll EVERYTHING. I'm sure it won't be hard over a month to find all the little things you want to update, write them down sequentially, and then have an intern type them up into the poll. It's not hard, and it will cause a lot less havoc.

If any JMods read this, thank you for what you are doing, we are all just trying to preserve a game we love.

Sincerely,
Noah
--------------------

TLDR;

-This game was built for the grind, if you don't want to grind, afk and get slow xp (there are plenty methods already, no need for more) or go play a different MMO.
-Polls need higher reqs
-More questions/poll, or more polls in general.

My limitations are that I can't give a long-term commitment (I would drop everything if one of the internships I'm applying to hires me) and won't work with kids. I'm very good with computers and don't mind manual labor. Is there anyone around that can use me?"

Even if the economy recovers I have a large resume gap and companies will just hire experienced people or the new batch of graduates who get pumped out every year. Tried applying to jobs away from Alberta but no luck there either.

I figured I should probably go back to school unless I want to make $18/h for the rest of my life. I was thinking of getting an electrical or computer engineering degree and becoming a controls/automation engineer(my diploma was in instrumentation and controls), or getting a computer science degree. But I have some concerns.

1: I'll be 31 when I graduate, will companies trash my resume because of my age, why would they hire me when they could hire some fresh 22 year old?

2. Would I be too old to get an internship? If I fail to get an internship or co-op position I would drop out immediately.

3. If I get a CS degree, the technology industry seems to have a problem with ageism, everything is dominated by young guys and by 30 you're expected to already be a manager, and by 40 you're considered ""obsolete"" and get purged from the workforce. Would they hire a 30 year old to work in a junior position? Also reading about all these social media startup companies worth billions and crazy salaries gives me dot-com bubble vibes, if there was indeed a bubble it would pop when I graduate.

4. Will I be a social outcast being surrounded by 18 year olds?

5. Do you see the Canadian economy improving any time soon? Job prospects seem quite horrendous even for STEM graduates, the trades aren't much better unless you have friends or family that can get you in. Hopefully Canada doesn't end up in an economic clusterfuck like Southern Europe or Argentina. The FIRE economy was a mistake."

Questa estate volevo cercarmi una Internship / Stage per iniziare a lavorare un po nel mondo dell'informatica e fare un po di esperienza nel settore lavorativo. 
Mi diverto a creare script in python, siti web, piccole app in electron e node.js e in generale sono uno che ama molto sperimentare con le varie tecnologie, insomma credo/spero di avere qualche competenza già spendibile e di non essere un peso morto nel mondo della programmazione.

Ho osservato molto /r/cscareerquestions, ma mi sembra una realtà molto Americana (come la maggior parte di reddit) e non sono sicuro di quanto i loro suggerimenti possano adattarsi in un contesto europeo.
Ho provato per curiosità a fare un CV e Cover Letter seguendo i loro consigli ed inviarli alle""big4"" del settore, ma a parte una telefonata con Facebook (suppongo proprio perché uno dei miei progetti personali era uno script che analizzava le connessioni su Instagram) non ho ricevuto molti altri riscontri.

Non sono esigente, non cerco necessariamente una grande azienda ma un posto dove possa fare esperienza e imparare. 

Cosa fareste al posto mio?

Ci sono aziende italiane che offrono lavori estivi nel campo dell'informatica che meritano?

Stavo anche valutando di offrirmi ad aiutare qualche professore della mia università nel campo delle ricerche, ma non ho idea se questa sia un idea valida o meno...

In generale voi cosa consigliate per portarsi in avanti per l'inevitabile mondo del lavoro? Magari invece di questo tipo di esperienze potrebbe convenire lavorare di più su progetti personali/concentrarsi a portare a casa voti migliori in università..,

Magari qualcuno di voi è passato per una situazione simile alla mia e potrebbe condividere la sua esperienza...

Mi scuso per il post lungo e probabilmente confusionario, ma mi sentivo di chiedere consiglio visto che sono veramente indeciso sul da farsi e divento ansioso a pensare a come prepararmi al meglio per il mio futuro.

Vi ringrazio per ogni tipo di feedback che vi sentirete di darmi, li terrò in grande considerazione."

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm a 24 year old with a diagnosed chronic illness. I grew up on the poverty line and receive no help from my family due to their financial status. 

9 months ago, I was living in another state for a paid internship and life was good. I was financially secure, had a beautiful apartment, was approved for a new auto loan, and was seeing a steady increase in my credit score. For the first time in my life, I was truly HAPPY. 

Around August, I noticed things were changing and wound up in the hospital. It was awful being there alone and even more shitty to find out I lost my internship as a result. After being released, I was left with no job/income and didn't know what the future would look like for me. I ended up losing my apartment and became homeless (instead of evicting me, they gave me the option of moving out immediately and paying the back rent later), I lost my car (this was the worst for me), and fast forward to today, my credit score has dropped nearly 300 points (yes, your read that correctly). 

Now the good news everyone is that throughout this whole debacle I've somehow remained positive. In addition to that, my illness is finally managed and has a great prognosis with the proper medication and regular visits with my doctor. I was readmitted to my university and will be completing my degree and graduating this August!! Regardless of this prognosis, it was suggested that I apply for disability (which I did) until I can manage this illness better.

As for the finances, I'm about $18000 in debt with credit cards and mostly unpaid collections (both health and personal accounts). Capital One, who I have my highest credit limit card and longest credit history with agreed to let me keep my card to assist me with rebuilding my credit (love them). 

My question for you is what the hell do I do now? After I graduate, I'd like to move and establish myself in a new city with a job in my field but as we're well aware, having a low credit score makes it EXTREMELY difficult to get approved for anything-including an apartment.

5tfkdk,34,2017-02-11,"How I met my boyfriend, who happened to be my best friend since teenagerhood.",IrreleventPerson,TransLove,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLove/comments/5tfkdk/how_i_met_my_boyfriend_who_happened_to_be_my_best/,"This is a bit of a long story that takes places from 2010 until now, so the past 6 and a few months years.

I met him in my first year of highschool, after having a bad experience with my only friend in middle school, I was left friendless in my new, bigger school, by the time, I knew already i was transgender, but I couldn't bring myself to transition or even let other people know, and for 6 years that was the case.

Upon meeting him during one of my french classes, we got along rather fast, sharing interest in mangas, video games and other common stuff.

I wasn't popular, he wasn't either.

Eventually, we became friends and started hanging together most of the time, making ridiculour projects about becoming manga artists, game developers or other things, we'd spent entire evenings talking about it while walking to the convenience store for unhealthy snacks.

We did have fights, but we always started talking back to each other, apologising and helping each other.

After high-school, I stopped studies for a few years due to depression while he attempted to go to college and worked at a grocery store in the meanwhile, we both had inner issues, my depression and him not knowing what to do in life, where we both went our own way a little.

Last year, he fell in love with a girl and told me all about it, the issues there were with the girl giving mixed signals and eventually playing him for a fool, all the while I did my best to support my best friend, and we started hanging again.

At the same time, I told him I was going to transition, at first,he took it with a bit of mixed feelings, saying he didn't know if we could be friends anymore, I never held it against him for thinking that way, and eventually, during one of our nightly trips to the convenience store, he told me it didn't matter if I was a guy or a girl, and that I'd still be his best friend no matter my gender.

A few months after that, I started my procedures and met other people I hanged with more often, during that time we played games online, just doing normal stuff together, but not seeing each other in face.

During October 2016th, I had an internship in a library, under the informatic department, by the time, I just started hormones. And while I was still presenting as male there, I was always wearing androgynous clothes and in general being andro in my voice, manerism and other details.

By the beginning of December, he and another friend decided to come visit me at my internship. We hanged a bit and talked till I went back to work.

When he left with our common friend, my now-boyfriend said to him: ""She's kinda cute now.""

After my shift, I joined them and, with lots of alcohol, went to my place and both of them, joined by my brother, started drinking, at the time I didn't drink at all.

With the three of them drunk, he (my best friend at the time) started to feel huggly, and as a very physical person, I spent the evening giving him hugs, the type of hugs that weren't between friend, where I rested my head on him.

A few days later, we took a walk together, where he was too shy to bring the topic of that night, but he invited me to his place on the night of the 24th, where he would tell me a secret. I spent that whole evening smiling madly, and so did he.

Come the 24th, I arrive at his place, we watch a movie and do normalish friends stuff, until we, again, go to the convenience store.

It's during that trip that he said he had feelings for me, which he really badly hidden. But I was happy that my guess was right, and that we were going to spend Christmas' Eve together, knowing we got sentiments for each other.

Back at his place, I set the gear into motions and rest my head against him, he's shy, never had a girl so close before, but eventually we go along and spend a great night cuddling together and kissing.

Fast forward to now, we are madly in love with each other, we both helped each other during rough moments and we're going to spend Valentine's Day together.

And that's how my best friend,"

She looked to be in high school, and was dressed in the sophisticated uniform of what had to be a local private school, her top with noticeable bulges and her hair done up in a single ponytail.  Candace walked up to the girl and asked if anything was wrong.  Something about calling her teacher a bitch and getting suspended, and needing to see her dad who worked for the company.

Candace smiled a warm, cheerful smile, and said she could help her out, and flashed her card to open the doors of BimboTech, and ushered her down the hallway to the elevator bay.  She led her to the end and inside a bigger elevator, pressing a button.  As the elevator began to descend, the girl looked at Candace in surprise, asking why they weren't going up.  Candace lunged quickly with a wicked snarl, grabbing the girl around the neck with her arm, choking her roughly.  The girl struggled against her grip, desperate for air, until her body went limp, having passed out.  Candace released her grip and let the girl slump to the ground, as the service elevator slowly continued to descend.

The tall, busty 27-year old blonde pulled out her phone and made a quick call, ""Tell Martin to meet me in the loading bay, ASAP"", and hung up.  A rush came over her, and she felt her pussy dripping.  She could still feel her Master's cum leaking out of her from the pounding the CEO had given her before her lunch break.  She always loved walking down the street in cum-soaked panties, with a fresh load also on her breath.  With a rush, she reached into her Chanel handbag and brought out a syringe, pulling off the stopper and plunging it into the unconscious girl.

The door opened and she was greeted by Martin, a big burly man with a heavy beard, tattoos and piercings.  ""Straight to His house.  She'll make an excellent plaything for him and his family.""

""Long-term?""

""Assume that protocol, yes.  Once he sees her I'm sure he'll put her through the program.  She's just his type.  His wife's too.  You know they like them young...""

""Understood.  She'll be ready in his dungeon within the hour.""  Martin had carried out several of these tasks, usually with young interns, so he knew the drill.

""One second.""  Candace reach inside her skirt and panties and swiped a finger through a glob of cum hanging just at the entrance of her pussy, shuddering at the touch.  She pulled her cum-covered finger out and smeared it across the lips of the sleeping girl.  ""Bitch better get used to the taste"", she smirked, as Martin chuckled in acknowledgment.

She watched Martin load the girl into the back of a company van and hop in, pulling the car away.  She smiled and went back in the elevator, eager to ride it up and tell her Master of her latest acquisition for him.  She already received big loads of his delicious cum in her mouth and pussy this morning, and was hoping this news would earn her a third in her ass.  After all, she was his bimbo slut, and her holes belonged to him.  As the elevator began to slowly climb, she reached down into her panties again and rubbed her finger through her slit, smearing the cum around, getting horny while thinking of her ass getting plugged....

**************

If you have read this far and are interested, I'd like to hear from you!  You can play the girl, Candace, or a combination (there are others that will be included, and I'd like to keep the story in 3rd person).  I'd like to make this long-term, with no requirements on speed or length of replies.  If you'd like to get something going, please let me know some of your biggest kinks and any limits you have.

5thet1,5,2017-02-11,Could someone tell me more about the MSE in CS program?,cartesiancategory,princeton,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/5thet1/could_someone_tell_me_more_about_the_mse_in_cs/,"I was recently afforded the opportunity to matriculate to the MSE in CS graduate program at Princeton, and I'm seriously considering it. I would like to know a bit more before making my final decision. I plan on visiting the campus in March during my spring break and seeing what it's like.

I was wondering if someone (preferably current or former MSE in CS students) could tell me more about this program. I have some more specific questions below about the thesis-track version of the program:

 * What are the research opportunities like? Is it easy to continue onto a PhD (at Princeton or elsewhere) from the MSE program? I am a pretty weak student coming out of undergrad in terms of research/GPA, so I'd like to use this opportunity to showcase improved academics and a better research portfolio when I apply to PhD programs in 2 years.

 * Are you required to do research between the end of your first year and the beginning of your second year? Or did you do a tech/fintech internship instead?

 * What kind of classes did you have to take? I went to another top-10 school for undergrad, so I think a lot of the classes may be of comparable quality (e.g. we have an equivalent of COS 326 at my undergrad school with some of the same assignments, like Moogle). So I feel like I would want to take classes that I haven't already done in undergrad. Did you get to take anything interesting, or was it mostly focused on your specialization within CS?

 * Can you combine disciplines? I'm interested at the intersection of PL and computer architecture (approximate computing and new hardware/software models to support the new paradigm). Is it easy to find advisors willing to work a little out of their comfort zones to accommodate unusual interests, or are people more traditional?

 * Where did you look for housing? As it happens, I grew up around the area, so I know about the happening areas (I used to frequent Hoagie Haven back in high school). My parents live in Kendall Park (which borders Princeton and is literally off of Route 27, about 10 minutes away). I could live with them, but the stipend makes it possible for me to live on/off-campus in an apartment or something. Do y'all have any recommendations?

 * Did you come to Princeton MSE from another undergrad or did you just continue from Princeton undergrad? If you're from somewhere else, can you talk about what it is like to adjust to the Princeton academic climate?

 * Are all the MSE students close? Did you find it easy to make friends/get involved despite being possibly new to the school? Do you feel like it's easy to have fun, or is it a lot more serious than undergrad?

So sorry about all the questions! I'm really excited, and I'd like to know more about the school. I'm definitely going to visit soon and talk to professors, but I'd just like to survey the opinions of current MSE students first."

So I've been playing guitar since I was 12. I'm now 19 (almost 20) so it's been 7 nearly 8 years. In which time I've worked many jobs to be able to afford to support a passion that has helped me through the years. What once was just me learning guitar is now me attending university to do Audio production and working in studios. Here are the guitars that have got me here and how they came to be.

**The Guitars:**

* **[PRS Tremonti SE:](http://i.imgur.com/xy49N3v.jpg)** This was my first proper guitar. It was brought for me by my parents for my 13th birthday just under a year after me starting to play guitar. This guitar was used everyday by myself for practice, any small gigs and a music school I use to attend. It use to be accompanied by a Orange Tiny Terror which I'd saved up for over the year with paper round money (An Amp I've now sold on) The guitar now spends it's life tuned to C standard so I can riff QOTSA tracks on it.

* **[1989 Fender Stratocaster:](http://i.imgur.com/jT1dF78.jpg)** I'm a huge Eric Clapton fan... yea I know big surprise. But he's the man who got me into guitar to begin with so it was expected that I'd want a Fender. Now usually I'm not a big fan of white guitars but this happened to be put for sale by a guy who lives 2 minutes walk from my house. My mum pointed it out online and that evening I went to go try it out... I fell in love the moment I picked it up. The neck, the body... the sound... It was just right. The guy had, had some offers but said if I could pay for it that night it was mine. I went home and my dad said I could have the money from him (On loan because I didn't have the cash on me) so I ran back up and did the deal. She was played for 2 years straight before she completely broke. In the last 2 months she's had a refret and new wiring and pickups. Now she sounds better than ever.

* **[Japanese Fender Rosewood Telecaster:](http://i.imgur.com/ERqwBoM.jpg)** One of my dream guitars is a Fender Custom Shop Rosewood Telecaster. For 3 reasons: George Harrison, Christian Mazzalai and the fact they look fantastic. Pre-ordered this guitar from a place an hour away and worked long hours over a summer so I could save up the money for the Japanese version of the guitar. Figuring I couldn't get the custom shop so this will do me well till that day comes. It finally came and that night I played a gig with it.... only problem I hated the neck. I simply couldn't play it properly. After almost selling it I decided to force myself to exclusively use this guitar at home for 6 months and now I love it. So glad I never sold it...

* **[Gibson SG Classic Faded:](http://i.imgur.com/uBNxg7e.jpg)** Was down Denmark Street in London and tried some guitars out without ever intending to buy one. Just as I was about to leave one of the shop assistants brought this down and sat it by the counter. It caught my eye for some reason and I asked to play it... The moment I played the first note I knew if I left without getting it I would regret it. So I told them I might be back for it, went and got a coffee while running some figures through my head and went back and got it... also got money knocked off due to it being 2nd hand and also having a chip on the back of the headstock. The SG has been used on a fair few recordings of mine now.

* **[Danelectro DC59:](http://i.imgur.com/OkZdzg3.jpg)** Now this guitar won't be for everyone as the colours are.... a little.... odd. But I got the guitar for under £100 and wanted something unique sounding for a recording I needed to do (and also a new guitar never goes a miss) so instead of just having it sound unique I also made it unique. Octopus guitar knobs, black pickguard and a book covering I found at the shop I worked at which was about to close down. After putting it all together I sat there in awe of it's weirdness... I love it and it always starts a conversation.

* **[Japanese Fender Jaguar Bass:](http://i.imgur.com/8DBq1Ae.jpg)** Made in 1997 (My birth year) I bought this 2nd hand at a bass shop. I knew I needed a bass for my own demos but also because there were a few people who wanted me to play bass on their recordings (Also the amount of bass players who don't own good basses is astounding) so I brought it. Previous owner put a homemade sparkly pickguard on it and I was gonna remove it but now I kinda dig the camp disco vibe it has. Offset bass is where it's at.

* **[Martin 00XA1E:](http://i.imgur.com/MgetxGB.jpg)** This was brought for my by my Dad outta the blue. It's be great to have a solid acoustic (also has a jack output) for recording and my own use. The amount of people who think they can go into a pro studio with a £150 2nd hand never been restrung Yamaha, blows my mind. Now I never really realised this but judging by the timing of my Dad buying me this. It would have been around the time he found out about his illness (Which he's now had 2 surgeries to remedy though it almost killed him the first time) I go through periods of playing this guitar every day and sometimes it doesn't get touched for a few weeks. But either way I love it and it plays, sounds and looks great.


**Others:** Not pictured but 3 guitars that I now don't own.

* Epiphone SG Custom: Brought it... sold it weeks later for how much I paid for it. It wasn't great.
* Westfield Strat: My first guitar that was butchered to build a guitar for a school project.
* Ashton Acoustic: First acoustic I brought the winter of me starting guitar. Wasn't great and was brought off me by a friend and gets much more use now.
* Epiphone Les Paul Standard: Brought it for £40, cleaned and fixed it's issues and sold it to the guitarist in my old band for £60. Basically brought it to fix up.
* Home build: A Guitar I built for my GCSE project and posted it to /r/Guitar years ago. I've been part of /r/Guitar now for 5 years I think. I joined when I was in high school and now I'm 5 months off finishing university.

**Guitars I dream of getting some day (Not saying I will end up with them all)**

* Fender Custom Shop Rosewood Telecaster
* Supro Martinique
* Rickenbacker 481
* Gibson SG Standard
* Gibson ES-335/9
* PRS Custom 24 (Bird Inlays)
* Literally any Echopark guitar
* Dan Armstrong Plexi
* A guitar of my own design (Which I currently have 30 pages of design documents for)

Though that being said I'm currently very happy with my guitar line up. Honestly not looked at guitars properly or had GAS for well over a year now. Amp wise I run an AC15 for personal use though often I use a Orange Tiny Terror at uni and a Marshall 1989 Lead at the studio I intern at. Pedals wise I'm a simple man and used about 5 which are strapped to a skateboard.

I use to play a lotta blues stuff and play in a weird psychedelic indie rock band but now I'm focusing on Audio Production so I play if a band needs me to or if a friend asks me to play as a session musician (though I'm no where nearly good enough to be a proper session musician) Just recently I've recorded/producer/mixed a single for a friends grunge band and it sounds.... amazing. The best production work I've done so far in my life.

So that's it. The guitars I currently own and their stories. I hope you enjoyed the pictures!"
5tikou,1,2017-02-11,"""Migraines"" keeping me nearly constantly in pain, doctors can't figure out what's wrong with me...",fewfoewijfewo,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/5tikou/migraines_keeping_me_nearly_constantly_in_pain/,"I'm age 21, male, 5'8"", 140 lbs, caucasian.  It's been happening for 2 years - currently taking Zyrtec and Trileptal (to try to help with the migraine diagnosis).

I've seen several doctors about it and they can never make sense of it.  It's been almost 2 years since it began, now.  I honestly don't know what else I can do  I'm getting desperate at this point; I don't know how much longer I can take this for.

I started noticing around 2 years ago I would have bouts of ""foggy headedness"" that would correlate with heat flushing through my face and sometimes upper body.  It was disrupting my work (as an intern), but if I tried really hard I could keep going.  I saw a doctor at that point and they gave me a CAT scan, no results.  They just asked if I did illicit substances and dismissed me.  (for the record, I do use cannabis once every few months or so in moderate quantities at special occasions)

Months later, they still continued.  I began accepting it as a part of my life.  But then, at a party, after taking a hit of marijuana (which I'm still suspicious of - the person to the right of me repacked it immediately before giving it to me, and the person to the left passed after I handed it to her), I had the most nightmarish experience of my life.  Gradually, everything from all my senses became intense and overstimulating - in particular, my vision and tactile senses on my face.  I had the most overpowering burning sensation inside my head that wouldn't go away, but got worse if I felt or saw anything.  I can't state enough that although it's painful, it's completely different in feeling from the traditional pain you would get from a normal headache.  They're two different sensations.  I could also feel a  ""lightning"" sort of tingling sensation traveling down to my hands and feet beginning roughly near my elbows and knees.  Within 5 minutes I was curled up on a bed sobbing - I could cover my eyes, but the sensation of something touching my face was almost more painful than the lights, which soon after got turned off.  Even the ""visual snow"" I could see in the dark was too bright for me.  Even imagining bright lights was painful.  I'll skip the rest, but I actually ran away (despite the intense pain) managed to stumble home crying, shielding myself from the lights, and eventually fell asleep.  (It takes about 30-45 minutes for an attack to end)

I saw a neurologist later, and he (amazingly) cut me off, told me it was a tension headache, and to try rubbing particular parts of my head (as if doing that wasn't really painful) when it happened.  Then I was dismissed.

For the next two months I would get the same sensations on and off, but at about 10-20% of the intensity (at its worst, I would be be experiencing fairly intense pain even lying in a dark room), and even when I felt better, it would still hurt to look at lights in general.  Symptoms were like a roller coaster, usually correlating with my mood and energy levels, going up and down all the time, sometimes multiple times over the course of a day.  I figured it would gradually get better after that, but it instead worsened, and about 3 months after the first incident, I had another ""attack"", which I recognized by the signature ""tingling traveling down to my hands"".  I had drank a cup of coffee in the half-hour leading up to it, but that was it - no other ""triggers"".  We were in the car at the time, and the streetlights passing by combined with the shaking of the car got so intense I was just weeping uncontrollably, covering my face.  It wasn't as bad as the first one, though.  Afterward, I felt much better - better than average, which seems to be the pattern when the attacks happen.   My mom was with me at the time and witnessed it, so we ended up seeing a migraine doctor about it.  I was told it was an unusual migraine and that I should try taking Imitrex (fast acting migraine medicine) right as I felt it coming on.  I can't really tell if it worked, but hopefully it helped once or twice - the problem is that symptoms come and go repeatedly over the course of a day.

Unfortunately, it didn't stop another attack that came on after a week of worsening symptoms (might be important that I had a lot of caffeine intake during the previous 24 hours).  So then we were recommended Trileptal (an anti-convulsant that's apparently been found to help with certain types of migraines), starting like 9 months ago, which I've been on and haven't had an attack since.  In fact, the ""ambient"" symptoms consistently improved for about 5 months.  But now, they've been getting worse again, especially the foggy headedness and the ""heat"" I feel at the front of my face.  This is accompanied by something new as well - real headaches (although compared to the rest of what I experience they don't really bother me), that feel like the ordinary pain that would come with headaches I would have occasionally growing up.  Now, it also always comes with a MASSIVE drop in my mood and energy levels, to the point that I'll give up and sleep at all random hours of the day just so that I'll feel slightly better when I wake up.  Yet still, at my very best (which happens very briefly), I'll have no light sensitivity/pain at all, and energy to do whatever I want for as long as I want, which almost makes me feel like it's some kind of rapid cycling bipolar disorder, but that doesn't have anything to do with the pain I'm experiencing, right?

Does anyone have any idea what's going on at all?  I've seen a total of 4 different doctors about this - doctors at two different hospitals, my GP, and a migraine specialist - and I haven't gotten any answers or any medication that I've definitively found to help.  I'm really desperate for any help I can get.

EDIT:  The ""normal"" headaches I get are sudden bursts of pain in particular locations, scattered all over my head, but often on the top or left side.  They're somewhat intense but only last a second or so."
5tj5ld,190,2017-02-11,I [23/F] think my supervisor doesn't like me and I feel ashamed that I cried when I recieved negative feedback from her,polythene__pam,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5tj5ld/i_23f_think_my_supervisor_doesnt_like_me_and_i/,"I'm doing a master's degree and I had to write a report about my internship, that is related with my master's degree. I had to deliever it on January 13 but instead I could only finish it by January 15, since I lost part of the file I was writting on and had to re-write it again.
I remember she said that there was no problem if we (she's supervising 6 different students) sent her the reports a few days after the deadline because she ""wouldn't read all the reports at the same time"". But I guess I already knew she was ""mad"" that I didn't previously informed her that I was a bit late, because she decided to stop answering all of my emails, after that event, and before she would always reply to me. She looks vindictive.

This friday I met with her to recieve her feedback about my report, and the meeting couldn't be worse than it was. 
I got there by the time she told me to be there. When I arrived to her office, she was talking (more like socializing) with other students, and I had to wait for 30 minutes or even more. Then, when she finally decided to tell them to leave, she looked at me and my other colleague, who was waiting for her feedback as well, and said ""You should leave, these girls have been waiting for a long time now.. *Looks at me* One of them even has dark circles under her eyes"". I mean...was it necessary? 
Then, since she told us the feedbacks would be given in private, individually to each student, and my colleague asked me if she could be first since she had a doctor's appointment, I asked my supervisor if I could leave and go eat something while she talked with the other girl. She immediatly said ""no"" and told me I'd be first and the both of us could stay, even knowing my colleague had things to do. It seemed like she want to just go against me. 

She started by criticizing me about the fact that I didn't send her an email telling her that I was behind schedule and would send her the report later, and instead I only ""informed her"" about it when I actually sent my report two days later. 
I didn't do it because, just like she mentioned again last friday, she told us before that there was no problem if we sent it later!

Then, she said my report was really ""weak"", that it seemed to her that I synthesized everything and that it seems like I ""try not to work too much"". She then was more specific but she would tell me that there were things missing in my report that actually were there. It almost looked like she was tauting me.
I started to feel desperate. I knew that was not my best work, also because I lost part of the things I had been writting for 2 weeks and then had to re-write them again in 2 days, but I also knew that many things she was criticizing me about weren't true and it truly looked like it was pleasurable to her to make me feel bad. This added to the fact that, the day before, I recieved the news that my cancer is back, and I had surgery to remove it only 4 weeks ago. 

So, inevitably, I felt like I couldn't hold my frustration and sadness anymore, like this is too much to handle at one time, and I burst out crying while she was talking to me.
And her reaction was something...she kept talking normally, and looking me in the eye, while I had my face completely soaked in tears. She didn't react to my reaction to her words. It got to a point where I could not even listen to her anymore and felt a bigger urge to cry because of her cold attitude towards me and I said ""Excuse me, but I have to leave the office for a while"". So, I went to the bathroom, quickly cleaned my tears and tried to compose myself and when I came back, her words were ""So...where were we?"". To me, this is unbelievable... and I'm stuck with this person. I depend on her. I have invested 5 years in this degree and my parents have invested a lot of money. I can't just quit. And I can't change supervisor, in the country I live in it's not possible. But this ""thing"" is treating me like dirt. 

Now I'm feeling ashamed that I started crying in front of her and my other colleague, and I don't know where I'm going to get the courage to face them again, on our weekly meetings. I'm feeling completely lost right now and it's like life keeps surprising me in a negative way and it won't stop. I'm tired. My wish is to quit but I think I'd regret it later.. I don't know what to do and I need advice.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My supervisor seems like she loves to go against me, for no apparent reason. Made me cry during our last meeting and said nothing about the fact that I was crying, or even tried to calm me down, when she saw that I was crying. Kept talking and looking me in the eye like nothing was happening. I want to quit everything but I'm afraid I'll regret it"
5tjhex,28,2017-02-11,My (22 f) boyfriend (23 m) is high-energy and has a lot of hobbies. I'm lower energy and have fewer hobbies. I find it hard to be confident in myself around him. Been dating for one year.,Burnt_Salad,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5tjhex/my_22_f_boyfriend_23_m_is_highenergy_and_has_a/,"I've never posted to relationship_advice before so let me know if I am not following the proper form or anything.

We've been dating for a little over a year now. I met him in September 2013. We met in a lab we had together (we're both in engineering, but different disciplines so there's only a little overlap). He's very outgoing and a little strange. He was into me almost immediately and we became casual friends over the next four months. At the end of the term, he asked me out, but I was about to go away on an internship so I didn't really give him a solid response (I wasn't interested at the time but am not very good at turning people down).

We continued our casual friendship over the next couple years. Eventually, in October of 2015, we started sleeping together. He was much more into me than I was into him at that time. By January 2016, I'd started to develop serious feelings for him and we started dating. 

The next six months or so were wonderful. We both fell in love for the first time and we get along really, really well. We have the same sense of humour. We are able to talk about anything and regularly check in and try to communicate whenever we're having problems. Our communication is totally respectful and productive. We're both open to change and are willing to admit when we're wrong. We have the same goals long term in regards to children, where we want to live, ethics, politics, etc. He's very loving and generally supportive.

Our hobbies overlap somewhat as well. We both love hiking and camping, although he had more experience with them. We both also enjoy skiing, although once again he has much more experience with that. We also enjoy our downtime, watching movies/TV, getting high, etc.

Over the past 5 months or so, my self esteem has really started to plummet. I don't know if I can pinpoint an exact reason, but I have a few guesses. My boyfriend is incredibly active and has a lot of hobbies. In addition to camping, hiking, and skiing, he also cycles everywhere, rock climbs regularly, bird watches, collages, speaks French, and many more things. 

Over the past 4 or so years, I've been very involved with my engineering students' society. Growing up, I played piano a lot and was pretty good at it, but stopped playing when I started university because I didn't have time anymore. These are basically my only other hobbies (aside from hiking and camping and occasionally skiing). I'm also much shyer and struggle in some social situations (usually when I'm around people I don't know, or people who are incredibly chatty).

My boyfriend's whole family is very active and intense, whereas my family has a few select hobbies and is otherwise pretty chill. 

Most of my university friends have tons of hobbies as well. So I feel a little bit lame in comparison to all of these very active people.

My boyfriend is very confident (but not cocky) and is also very introspective. He very rarely feels self conscious or inadequate. In contrast, I've always had much more average self-esteem, with a bit of fluctuation, throughout my life. In the first six months of our relationship, I didn't feel particularly self conscious, because he was the one pursuing me. But once things levelled out and we loved each other equally, the self-esteem issues started to arise. It's just so hard to feel good about myself when I see my boyfriend do all of these crazy awesome things with his life. I'm not interested in pursuing a ton more hobbies, because I like my downtime and that's how I've always (happily) lived my life. He's also much more interested in self-improvement, and is much more competitive, while I'm more interested in just doing things that I enjoy and make me happy.

I've talked about this with my boyfriend, of course. He says it's all the other stuff (our outlook on life, etc) that's important, not our hobbies. But I know he also has mad respect for people who do crazy things, and that makes me worried that he doesn't have the same respect for me. He has admitted to trying to make people be more like him and he can get a little... too confident in himself sometimes. Sometimes when we talk, I explain that just because people make different choices from him, doesn't mean they're any worse. He understands this and is trying to work on it. 

So I think part of this issue is my self-esteem issues, and part of it is the fact that I know my boyfriend does... have strong opinions on stuff, I guess? 

I think I could handle it if he was the only crazy active person in my life, but the fact that so many of our friends are active too makes it really difficult. No one else has quite as many hobbies as him (except for his family), but everyone does something very cool and I just feel so mediocre in comparison. 

This is starting to get really long. I feel like I'm forgetting things, but I've been typing this forever and think I should wrap it up. I love him so much, and he loves me too, and I really think I could spend the rest of my life with him. I just want to figure out how to deal with this! Any advice would be much appreciated.

TL;DR: My boyfriend has an insane amount of hobbies and DOES a lot of things. He's also very confident. I have only a few hobbies and like more downtime, and have some self-esteem issues as a result. Not sure what to do.

There is going to be an internship and research fair on Tuesday at my campus, and then a career fair on Thursday. I am going to both, although I am more hopeful about the career fair. Some internships pay (my NASA one did but they mentioned pay on the ad. This was many moons ago, pre-LunarTot) but most don't, and the ones in my field  I was reading about in the email don't look like they pay. It's a shame because I would die to get chosen for some of them just because of how amazing the experience would be, but I do not have that luxury of taking an unpaid internship anymore. I still want to go and make good impressions though, just in case.

For the career fair, there are going to be hundreds of potential employers there and I would like to look nice and make a good impression. I already printed out a ton of copies of my resume to hand out, but I need serious fashion help. Any and all advice, outfit, store, etc. suggestions welcome. 

My problems:

The only job where I had to wear sort of business/nice-ish clothes was when I sold cars at a dealership. I mostly wore more conservative (i.e.boobs concealed) cotton dresses, like from Target or Rue 21. It was definitely not the most professional though, and most of the girls there tried to wear the most provocative clothes ever to make the deals. **I don't think I have a clear idea of what business attire is in an actual professional setting.** I have no idea what looks good, if there is a particular style that's ""in"" right now, if something is outdated, etc. 

Second problem with my wardrobe: **NOTHING FITS!** Everything I own is now several sizes too large!!!! Right before I got pregnant I had actually packed on about 25lbs, so the couple of ""dress"" pants/shirts I have were bought in that time period, and they are size 7/8 or 9/10, larges, etc. I have lost a ton of weight and I am below even my high school weight now. Size 0,1,or 2 have NEVER fit me before, but now they do. It's crazy! 

Third: My fiance and I are **poor** and have been basically since I had to leave work to have our son. While we couldn't save at all, we were never actually late on anything and I could buy food without  worrying about my card declining. Then I went back to school for my last year, and with that came extra expenses. So in August we suddenly had to come up with $640 for childcare per month and a totally unexpected CC debt from years ago before my fiance and his ex divorced. Another $300, and if he doesn't pay it they will garnish his wages so....UGH. Plus books, supplies, gas, etc. My dad got me a pair of jeans for my birthday, and that is the only pair that fit from summer until Christmas, when an incredibly kind BroMo sent me a pair I had on my Amazon Wishlist. So...I was going to ask moms in a Facebook group for my city if I could BORROW an outfit, but my dad said he will come over on Wednesday and get me one as an early graduation gift. Woohoo! Still, it needs to be reasonable/cheap and I need to be able to use it for any interviews I may have until I find a job.

Problem 3: *The outfit can't include heels* . I know, that kills so many outfits. I developed bone marrow edema/ have an autoimmune disease. The pain in many joints/balls of feet has been flaring up so fucking bad for a month and I don't want to risk agony for weeks/months in order to wear heels. *What shoes are appropriate that are not heels?* I always feel so frumpy with my footwear. -__-

TL;DR: I need advice desperately on what I can wear for a career fair, and it needs to be reusable for any job interviews until I land a job. Conditions: reasonably priced, no heels, and keep in mind I live in the desert. It's already hit 84 this week, and it gets to a toasty 120ish in summer, so nothing supremely hot. Suggestions for outfits/stores appreciated. THANK YOU!"
5tkc0o,1,2017-02-12,"Me [21 M] with my GF [19 F] of 8 months, long distance and her kissing a guy friend.",trashyaccounty,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5tkc0o/me_21_m_with_my_gf_19_f_of_8_months_long_distance/,"so to give you guys the run down. my Girlfriend and i have been dating for 8 months. we both are attending college and we met in an internship over the summer. her family is moving to my home state from there state that is 11hrs drive or 2 hours flight (for reference). so she attends school at her home state. 


So recently she had joined a sorority and i have made it clear that i do not agree with any of that. i have been exposed to it and i made it clear that i know not every frat and sorority is the same but its just not for me. but told her i would support her in any decision she made  for i did not want to seem like a controlling boyfriend who didnt let her get her college experience. so i told her i would support her if she wanted to rush or not. so she did rush and like i promised i supported her but i still had my disagreements on the whole thing.

i am a jealous type. i know this and she does. and i made some ""rules"" about the whole sorority thing like absolutely to not go to any date night or social with another guy. for me i am just not comfortable with that at all and i felt bad telling her not to but at the same time its important for both couples to know and understand each other. 

so to the incident, she has a guy friend (we will call him X) who they went to high school together and are fairly close. i have never met X but have heard good things about him. so he is in a frat and they had a social event with each others fraternities that GF and X are in.

so they went together and drank before going and she got really drunk and came back very sick and her friends helped her get in bed and made sure she was taken care of. my GF calls me crying for feeling so sick and making a scene because she threw up at the bar and embarrassed herself and her sorority and X.  

so i talk her through the night and made sure everything was ok and then today she calls me saying she has to tell me something and she feels really bad. so naturally i think the worst. so she tells me she was really drunk and she was barely standing with X and she was leaning on him and she kissed his neck. and she told me that she instantly regretted it when it happened. i know she is telling the whole truth to what has happened and how she feels so guilty about it. i know she has 0 feelings for X and hes just a good friend. 

i just dont know what to do guys (and girls). like i know it was just a stupid one time mistake but at the same time she was in the wrong here. i dont know what to do or say. to make things worse i was going to fly in the up coming weekend to spend time with her and celebrate her weekend. like part of me wants to forgive her for her stupid mistake but at the same time im not justifying her actions nor saying its ok. i just really love her and shes been going through a hard time with many things and im also trying to get her to seek outside help. what should i do? what would you do?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: GF got really drunk at a social event at her sorority, kissed a long time friends neck once, who she has 0 feelings for and instantly knew she messed up and regretted it. i truly love her but im torn on what i should do. what should i do? what would you do?"

My dad was a very strict Asian parent before but got progressively more and more abusive towards me and my mom as I was growing up, with weekly beatings. I was quite rebellious as a teenager, getting arrested a few times for burglary/shoplifting and vandalism. 

-
I eventually got my act together in school and did quite well, going to a top college on full scholarship and eventually an ivy league law school. I was super shy and awkward growing up, getting bullied because I was ashamed of my family and of being poor. My mom was very supportive of me and that really helped me get through a lot of things, unfortunately she eventually was diagnosed with depression and had to be hospitalized, she recovered but had cancer a few years later, but is now in remission. 

-
When I went away to college I wanted nothing to do with my family and my past. I felt ashamed and did nothing but study and try to improve myself. I read a lot of stuff on charisma/public speaking/seduction and bought some nicer clothing/worked out/did some backpacking in Europe/Asia/South America from money I saved from part time jobs. I lied and reinvented myself as this cool kid from an middle/upper middle class family. This is still what my friends from school thinks. I had one relationship with a girl that never found out about my past in my senior year, before that I was too shy/insecure to date, there were a few times when I had gotten close to girls that I liked, but ultimately got too scared to pursue, and chose to focus on making myself better first, or at least that's what I told myself. 

-
I got accepted into and went to a top law school (harvard/yale/stanford). I kept up the facade, being afraid that people will look down on me if they realize what I truly am. I had trouble keeping up with the academics and came near the bottom of my class and couldn't find a good internship, which is the prerequisite for a high paying job in a law firm. I got seriously depressed and too scared to tell my parents, with whom I've avoided communicating as much as possible since I went to school. 

-
Since my mom got sick and better, she no longer speaks to my dad, they live in the same house but don't speak to each other. My dad has also lost contact with his own side of the family, having not spoken to them in several years, and having no friends to speak of. He eventually landed an engineering job that pays well but refuses to spend any money, and spends his spare time on the computer. I've been back home a few times in between, and each time ended up with him getting abusive and smashing things or getting into an altercation with me. He still pays the bills and my mom has barely any income, but they don't really speak any more and I avoid him whenever I come home. 

-
One of my friends from law school, who is quite wealthy, introduced me to a girl who is from my country of origin in Asia and quite wealthy (multimillionaire family, came to the states for boarding school and college, has houses in Asia and America) I was only slightly attracted to her but decided to date her, thinking that this was my golden ticket. The girls I truly had feelings for I never had the balls to pursue, choosing instead to facebook stalk them secretly. 

-
I met her family and friends, her family was very nice to me, but her friends were all really well off and they looked down on me, which made me even more insecure. As the relationship progressed she got more and more demanding, she was used to having a maid/nanny growing up so she would order me about and made me do her chores and even chores for her friends, which made me resentful. I don't think she did this out of malice but its probably more of a product of her upbringing. 

-
With my grades in the shit and no real decent job prospect on the horizon (to be fair I was seriously depressed and wasn't very persistent in my job search either after a dozen or so rejections) I eventually dropped out of school to join a startup and ended things with her. I was probably too naive at the time. All I wanted to do was to make some money so I can buy a normal house with some nice furniture so I can move my mom out and be able to support her while I became financially independent. This way I'll be able to go on telling my sanitized backstory and overcome the insecurities gnawing at me. 

-
Unfortunately the startup failed, but I did have a little bit of money saved up. I felt lost and it was around this time that my ex reached out to me. I was rather moved that she still had feelings for me and said yes when she said she wanted to get married. 

-
My parents live in a lower income part of town, they bought a house a few years back but its basically a tear down and barely had any furniture. Because her family was coming to visit us and I wanted us to look at least presentable I spent all my savings buying furniture on craigslist and fixing up the house doing renovations with me and my mom. My dad did nothing except to mock me for being a hypocrite. 

-
So her family came to visit and our situation did not really affect them, or at least it didn't show. So we ended up getting married but I feel like shit. She said she would lend me money to go back and finish school; and with her family connections and an ivy league degree it will probably be quite easy to land a good job back in Asia. 

-
I'm now almost ready to graduate, with a good job lined up. My wife is demanding as usual when she comes to visit me, I had to hand wash her clothes because she said the washing machine in my dorm is too dirty; or making me take the bus to get food from her favorite restaurant in the winter because they don't do delivery, I think I'm being petty but the sense of resentment is accumulating, and I don't really know how to tell her that I feel resentful. 

-
Recently my mom found out that my dad has been secretly saving money (200k+ in savings AND downpayment on second house) and this has made me even more angry. I try not to but its really easy to fall into the habit of blaming your circumstances and your upbringing. 

-
I know I have a lot to be grateful for, and that despite my obstacles things have turned out quite lucky for me; but its late nights like these when I stay awake and sad and think to myself what could I have done differently, if I could have had a normal family, or had been more secure about who I am and where I came from, or if I had dated and married someone that I had fallen in love with, and more importantly, what should I do now. 

-
Sorry for the long rant, had to get that off my chest. I'd love to hear some of your thoughts reddit! "

It is now 5:23 AM eastern time. 

 I go to college in PA.  This is all so irrelevant, but the 4 mg alprazolam (xanax) which I have been taking throughout the day for the same period of time is a combo made in heaven.  

I have been a lifetime lurker, I literally have never posted anything on reddit in my life.  

This shows the synergy between the two drugs.  Dexmethlyphenidate and Xanax have given me some of the most enjoyable nights of my college career.  

Now on to my more nefarious vice: the almighty bean.  We call 30mg roxicodone ""beans"" or quite often, ""jawns"".  I used to rip them with my one friend who I'll henceforth refer to as ""P"".  P had a connect at school in Rhode Island who happened to live close to us.  At first, I would only cop through P and not his connect.  Once I got P's connect, the frequency at which I copped increased exponentially.  

 This was my summer going in to my junior year of college.  I had an internship, so most of my days that summer were consumed by the 9-5 lifestyle.  Once I got home, I would hit up P's connect, henceforth to be known as R.  One profound memory I have of those times was when I would be driving to R to cop, who lives a few miles up the highway.  The contrast between being in NYC and whipping down the NJ highway to score blues literally 45 minutes later (the length of my commute) really started to make me feel like an absolute fiend.

Wow sorry for bombarding you guys with minutiae, I swear I'll get to the point. 

Long story short, I kept doing blues throughout the summer and into my junior year of college.  Junior year wasn't bad, I would pop perc 10s and of course rip 30s whenever I had the chance, but I didn't get withdrawals at that point.  That was the one rationalization I have made which may be a turning point in my life.  I am a master at rationalization, that's why I've been doing opiates at least 6 times a week for the past 4 months.  

If you guys care to critique my life choices, feel free---but actually this is the opiate subreddit so you guys will be pretty understanding- damn now I finally understand why so many people take their time to write anonymously on reddit.  Judgement free zone, hard to find these days.  JESUS this combo makes me ramble even when I try my absolute hardest to be succinct. 

MY semi-MAIN QUESTION-

What's the best way to smoke roxys.  Back story:  I was strictly snorting them for about a year and then my boy showed me how to slide one on tin foil and get massive hits. Not only were we getting high, we were also fostering a camaraderie, because even though we are just doing drugs together, me and my smoking buddy, henceforth to be referred to as WM, had some unforgettable times roasting and bumping tunes cruising around campus.  We call the process of smoking a roxy ""roasting"".

My ORIGINAL purpose in writing something on reddit for the first time was to dispel the myth that smoking oxy is stupid/ineffective.
Yes, the bioavailability is signficantly lower.  But the ritual, the ritual of getting the necessary materials (foil, lighter, blue), taking massive rips as that bad boy slides down the foil, and generally just kicking it as you get rocked is a great facilitator of camaraderie.   

TLDR:  Smoking roxy is not dumb, it gets you and your boys rocked and maybe you can even make a friend by showing someone how to roast a bean properly, trust me WM will be my boy forever.  And it all started with one little roast, ah the tangled webs we weave.

So if anyone disagrees with me and thinks smoking blues is dumb I'll be up all night, or morning, because its actually now 6:15 am. 

WELP I gotta finish the remnants I have in my handy dandy foil.  Happy smoking folks- and figure out a way to quit or you'll fuck up the trajectory of your life, whether thats your academic trajectory or your spiritual trajectory.  

ONE LAST THING: my girlfriend just broke up with me so send me that reddit gold shit so i can get enough money to cancel our valentines dinner and take a different girl.  Is that reddit gold stuff real cash?  Please answer that if you can, its pretty important.  I think I could make a living out of interacting with intellectuals and drug addicts alike.  

If anyone gives me a thoughtful response to my absolute incessant rambling, I would appreciate it.  I honestly couldn't tell you if I made a point in what I wrote in the paragraphs above because when I write I write things once and then I don't look at it again.  Proofreading is for those with a weak understanding of the English Language.  

If you read this all, I commend you.  I hope my blabbering will elicit some responses. 

AND FOR THE GRAND FINALE: I'm about to finish off one K9 roxy I have.  What will be my ROI, you may ask?  

I'M ROASTING IT MOTHAFUCKA"
5tlz90,8,2017-02-12,How do I tell my sr. tech I'm being scheduled too much and it's affecting my college classwork?,littlekapkan,PharmacyTechnician,https://www.reddit.com/r/PharmacyTechnician/comments/5tlz90/how_do_i_tell_my_sr_tech_im_being_scheduled_too/,"I am a young freshmen in college (pain in the ass) pharmacy technician. I say that because I was not given much training, usually work alone with a grumpy pharmacist, and I feel like I am back at school being bullied by other technicians and pharmacists because I have not honed my pharmacy technician skills to be like they are (by the way they all went to school for their jobs, I was hired by a friendly pharmacist back when I was his intern where I didn't do much but fill). I literally have panic attacks every day I am scheduled for, sometimes even the day before because I do not want to be in that pharmacy since there's ALWAYS an issue I have because I have not been there long enough to know everything. When I ask questions, I am super scared and frustrated because I know I'll be yelled at, especially by a woman pharmacist that hates my guts and I always feel like crying during the job, but I have to deal with it.

This is why I am so stressed out, but I still manage my grades. However, while I was only working the weekends during this, maybe a day or two during the week, my sr. tech recently asked me my availability.  I told her that I have classes from 9am to 9pm on two days of the week, but told her when I am ""available"" (which I meant as not in class, not completely free because I still need to freaking study and practice!) which is basically from 4pm onwards for 3 week days and the weekend. 

So now I am scheduled for five days, including weekend, for the next two weeks, and I have a couple exams during that time I am very stressed because I know I won't be able to study unless I stay up LATE and get up EARLY as hell and that isn't going to be good for me. I do not want to work basically anymore than maybe two days a week (probably the weekends) because I really need to study and I need to get tutoring, which is during the days I work, so now I am forced to let my grades go down for a job I hate and who hates me. I do not want to let that happen.

I have 17 credit hours of school, and I am being scheduled just as much as a girl with one 6 credit hours. 

TL:DR My question is how should I approach this school/study time situation to my sr. tech? How do I tell her that I misunderstood her when she asked when I was available and that I actually need the week to study??? HELP"

Because the flat I'm staying in is too small for me to prepare my 3 month internship in a local school I'm staying at my Nmom's and dad's house. Every day I hate waking up and working for 13 hours straight, knowing that my heart will jump several times during the day.

I feel like I was forced into this education when I was 19, right after I came down with a serious case of mononucleosis.

This course just isn't for me, I've been giving it my very best for four years and I just can't handle it anymore.

My Nmom ""helps"" by demanding to read all my lesson preps and yelling for the most inane little typos. I made it very clear that she is driving me batshit crazy, without hurting her feelings but she's having none of it, demanding that I somehow get a degree because ""she paid a lot of money for it"".

This years internship is a delayment of last year, after I had a bit of a breakdown. I worked two different jobs for half a year and never in my life felt as calm and content as I did then.

My dad knows I suffer and says he regrets marrying my Nmom because she ""wasn't that way"" before they married. But he does agree that I should put their invesment above my sanity.

I feel like I can emotionally pull through the coming weeks, but I don't know if I'll be succesful. I don't know what I'll do after.

My dad questions why he never divorced Nmom, he says he gave up on dealing with her and often stays away late ""for work"" and never made attempts to ""stop"" Nmom

Even though I've been in this situation for as long as I can remember,I feel like I have been delaying my life and being happy by trying to complete this ed and staying dependent on my parents, I miss my workplace and my friends.

We have been dating for about 5 months. We are very good together and we really do love each other. However, there are moments were we end up arguing or disagree on something and it results in us having a bad mood for the next few hours, but eventually we make up and all is good. I would like to mention here that its mostly me trying to patch it up and always me saying sorry (she never said the word sorry) but I don't mind taking the first step, imo saying sorry doesnt make a man small, matter of fact does the opposite. 

Besides this, recently she is using words/statements that are hurtful and/or shocking. For example she mentions that sometimes I dont care about her or am not a responsible man when I dont ask her ""if she has food at home"" or ""if shes hungry"". But it is not true, I really do love her and care for her well being in every way. We dont live together, she lives alone in a small flat, I live with my parents and am in the process of finding a job (just finished with internships). 

I am very open and share all my thoughts and ideas with her and she is well aware of my current situation. I am very generous when it comes to shopping/dining or just spending in general on us and her. But when I address her about such statements she says its not about money, its about the thought.

Recently, she 'indirectly' threatened our relationship (again), which left me shocked. She said she is an adult and wants an adult boyfriend and relationship. After asking her to explain what she means by that, she says I should get my own place and a job and should be able take care of myself, her and our future kids if this relationship is to work. This left me frozen and my heart dropped. To me this sounded like a threat, that if I dont get all these things in order we will breakup. When I tell her this she says no she did not mean it this way, but doesnt explain further what she actually meant. (this sort of threat happened once before too and had the same reaction from me and same response from her)

Going back to the ""future kids"". We really do love each other and were serious about our relationship. However, from the start I've made it clear that I do not want kids or marriage right now, mostly because I know the responsibilities that come with it and I'm not ready mentally, financially or otherwise, and she was aware of this and agreed with me. However there is a situation, she can live here in this country for 2 more years maximum, and is forced to go back after and keeps reminding me of this ""deadline"". I tell her that in 2 years a lot can/will happen. I will not be in this situation forever; living with my parents without a job.  She keeps insisting if she were to get pregnant today (we have sex without protection sometimes, but pull out), what will I do for her and our child, to which I honestly do not have a clear cut answer right now, of course I will take care of both of them to the best of my ability but I do not have a word for word plan. After hearing this response from me she gets upset and leaves and we have not spoken since (1 day) Maybe we need time to cool down and think? I honestly do not know what to do and am very frustrated and confused. Would really appreciate any advice. Thanks

tldr: gf and I love each other but she threatens our relationship if certain things arent done (moving out, job, independence) which I am in the process of doing and she is well aware of the situation."

5tmmji,42,2017-02-12,How the Rosary saved my Brother's Life,Pray_Rosary_Daily,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/5tmmji/how_the_rosary_saved_my_brothers_life/,"I was going through a phase where I felt God was not answering any of my prayers and I was not praying regularly. I usually check this sub for some motivation or personally I love to walk under the starry sky and Pray my Rosary on such days.

One such night I prayed the entire 5 decade of my Rosary for the good health of my Family, I usually break up the decades for many intentions but that night I prayed solely for the good health of my Family.

The very next night my brother was bit by one of the 2 most poisonous snakes in India when he was on the way to the Temple ( My family members are Hindus).  My brother was admitted in the same Medical school that I studied which was on the way to the Temple he was going.

My family doctor whom I had discussed the situation with told my parents and me to go to my Medical school immediately.
During the 3 hour frightful journey, I was continuously begging God to spare my brother s life and take mine instead. I also had a feeling that Mother Mary will surely crush the head of the serpent as Mother Mary is usually depicted in the pictures.

My family doctor had also told me to see that the blood tests to detect the poison was done every hour but initially the interns refused and upon my insistence they decided to do it. The intern who had did the test told me the blood results were normal and had clotted but I asked her to show it to me just to be sure and the blood had not clotted. I redid the test again myself and when the blood did not clot again, I demanded they start Anti Snake Venom immediately for my brother. A few days later my brother recovered after a mild cellulitis.

I had been upset that I was not able to come and do rotations in the US as I had planned and I was thinking God was not answering my prayers but God in His mercy saw all this coming and made it happen in such a way that my plans had to be delayed and I be in India during this time, demand the intern to show me the results because of which I was able to repeat the test and start my brother on Anti Snake Venom. If I hadn't been there, I really can't imagine the consequences. I can fail a thousand times in my life but I cannot lose my Family.

So that is how a single Rosary prayed for my family s good health saved my brother s life. To all those who still doubt if the Rosary saved my brother s life, If the snake had bit him in some other area where there was no access to a good hospital or had he not noticed it, things could have been very worse.

 I am still a Hindu who prays the Rosary and attends Mass so to all of you faithful Catholics, God is much more closer to you'll. Please don't feel hopeless, God hears every word we pray and as St.Teresa of Avila say 'May you trust that you are exactly where you are meant to be'. 

And PRAY YOUR ROSARY DAILY, the blessing from a simple 5 decade Rosary is enormous. God bless."

Both of her parents were farm dogs, and the rest of the litter were sold to be service dogs. Our Monty was the last one left, as she was the runt of the litter. She was fixed around a year old, after her first round of going through heat. She had no issues before then, and this has only started occurring around maybe 2 or 3 years old? Her health issues have been minimal. When she was a puppy, she had a urinary tract infection. Took her into the vet and got her antibiotics and she's never had any issues since. When she got fixed, she had a stitch that popped and we had to run her to pet urgent care. That healed fine as well. She's an amazing dog, is completely house broken and is socialized with both dogs and people. But she has a pheromone problem. Or at least, that's what we've diagnosed it as. Every so often, the most fouling smelling liquid comes out of her. We honestly aren't sure if it's her vagina or anus, as we've never checked in the moment. It's a pretty random occurrence, and usually notice after the fact. It's a dark brown liquid usually, and smells absolutely foul. Why is this occurring? Is there a health issue we're missing? We try to put her health and happiness the best, we're good dog owners and love her more than anything.

Other general info: she's about 35 lbs, and just had her shots updated in December, in California where we were for an internship. We're now in Rhode Island for a separate internship. She eats the Natures Brand (the Kirkland brand from Costco) and eats MAYBE 2 cups a day. We feed her a cup to cup and a half in the morning. We exercise her in the afternoon and maaaaaybe give her a little more if she asks (She'll do this thing where she pushes her bowl with her nose if she's hungry). She sleeps in her own bed, or sometimes ours if it's a cold night. She's not used to the cold New England quite yet. Her poop is normal, and the only time she barfs is if she eats too fast when she's excited. Help please! If anyone has any experience with this.

TLDR; my dog has a pheromone problem and it's gross. Does she has a medical condition that we're missing?"

I'm extremely unfamiliar with Windows, but am interested in building one of the projects at my internship (with fellow interns) using ASP.Net Core + MVC. 

The other interns and I gave it a try last week, but once we started trying to merge our working github branches to the github master, we kept getting merge conflicts all over the place. It seemed that the MVC project kept generating references to absolute paths (from our local machines) and it would end up being pushed to github. 

This isn't an issue we face when we write our projects on Mac OS X + Node/Express, so we're quite lost on how to get around this. After reading around a bit, I found that it might have had to do with environment variables and/or build configuration settings, but we never really got to the bottom of it.

I don't have access to any hard info about the errors right now, but many of them seemed to have stemmed from (name-of-project)/.vs/.../.suo and (name-of-project)/src/build/config... files.

Sorry for being very vague about this (I could perhaps provide more information later), but the question is basically this:

How do I ensure that a ASP.NET Core MVC project, started on Visual Studio Community 2015, can be worked on collaboratively with others using Git/Github? Do we have to mess with environment variables? Configuration settings? Untrack certain files when pushing to Github? We really have no idea, so please help!  "

But the more ""career exploration"" I do, the more I find myself coming back to actuarial science, and the more I desire to concentrate my efforts in subject areas related to it. For now, I feel like I am at least focusing on subjects that could be useful to someone in actuarial science (machine learning, algorithms, general comp sci subjects) but I'm not necessarily focused on studying for exams, for example. 

I already passed Exam P and have an actuarial internship this summer that will hopefully tell me more about if I like the career path. With all this in mind, I guess my questions are:

1. Do you for sure need 3 exams passed to get an entry level job at this point?
2. Would it hurt me if I were to do an actuarial internship this summer, but then do a job in something else (like software engineering) for the summer after my junior year?
3. How likely am I to get an entry level job if I do decide to pass 3+ exams and have a GPA of 3.8+ with one internship? It seems like this should make it easy (granted I put in a lot of hard work to try to accomplish these things), but I don't have a sense of exactly how hard the job market is.

Thanks."
5tnj61,1,2017-02-12,[Advice needed] Trying to safe up effectively while living costs will increase starting from April (Student Loan - GER),unknowngalaxy22,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5tnj61/advice_needed_trying_to_safe_up_effectively_while/,"Hi reddit,  

(This might be a quite unusual case and not as extreme as other cases that I have read here. Though, it keeps me awake every single night during the last couple of weeks. I will try to be as precise as possible and I am deeply sorry in advance if I forget any important details and I am even more sorry that it turns out to be so long)

I am 25 years old, born and currently living in Europe and just finished my first year as a full time employee. I earned 30K during the last year (so about 1600€/month after taxes) and just finished really positive contract negotiations. I have a student loan of 9600€ (current amount) given by a government-owned bank. I was forced to take that loan, since I got accepted for a semester abroad at a university in South East Asia and did not have the courage to ask my parents for that kind of money. Last year in October I had to start paying 100€ each month to slowly pay off my debts. I have around 12 years to pay that student loan off (at the same rate), but I'd like to avoid that and get rid of my debts as fast as possible (logically, I will pay much more if I just leave it like that). There are two key-days every year (in April and October) where I could pay off that loan immediately if I had all that money.

To get a better overview:

What I have/earn: 

- All the money I have currently are 4000€ in a saving account (not touching it)
- (Why only 4000€? - some might ask -&gt; family incident during the summer last year, had to leave the country for a funeral with a last minute flight. Total costs: around 3000€ for flight, hotel and costs for the funeral  - so I 'lost' quite a huge amount due to something I wasn't able to foresee)
- around 1000€ at my normal bank account
- Income by the end of this month (after taxes): 1600€
- Income starting from next month (after taxes): 2000€

Expenses currently per month:
- rent: 400€ (currently living in a shared flat)
- student loan: 100€
- food &amp; gym etc.: around 400-500€

Additionally:
- every second to third month: 150-250€ for a flight in order to see my girlfriend in the UK


I am trying to live as cheap as possible (sorry, if I leave different impression here) and rarely buy clothes or anything else for myself except the basic needs.

My problem:
I will have to move by the end of next month and found a two-room apartment. The situation for a person like me is quite complicated. Affordable apartments are really hard to find where I live (well, I guess that’s a problem everywhere), especially since I do not have a permanent working contract and I got this offer by a friend of a friend (so, no long application process and additional fees). Additionally, my girlfriend will move to the same city by the end of this summer and we would need an apartment one way or the other. 

Total rent if I would take the apartment (starting from beginning of April): around 600-700€ (everything included, no additional costs - People usually pay around 1000€ for that kind of place).
Security deposit: 1000€
No additional costs so far since the new place will be fully furnished.
My girlfriend can pay a part of the rent once she will move in, but it won't be much since she will absolve an internship and won't earn that much. I hope that she can put in something between 150-200€ every month.

So, what I basically need is some kind of advice, because currently I feel like my money is just getting out of my hands. I know that the next couple of months won't be easy as I am trying to save up money as much as I can in order to pay off my loan in an instalment payment (I hope that is the right term here). I am also really eager to find out if people might have similar experiences and how they dealt with that situation. Also I am not quite sure if I am taking the right way at the moment. I didn’t grant myself anything last year and this year. No vacation abroad. Told myself ‚no‘ more than I would like to admit (my birthday present for myself last year was a pizza delivery), and still I feel really bad because I couldn’t save up more money. 

Some might ask why I want to pay the loan off asap. Actually, I would like to start a distance masters degree starting from next year. My goal is to pay off the current debt, before starting a new degree."

i just finished my masters last november in sustainable development, environmental economics, and environmental management. i had two successful internships as a corporate social responsibility officer, and am actively searching for a stable job right now.

i received an offer within an ngo who specializes in studies, events and groups in sustainability. basically i would be a an event/logistics manager for these events. and while i am an economist at heart, i am certain i can challenge myself and be up for the task if i put my mind into it.

SO, i stalked the exective director's twitter to prepare myself for interviews, and he seems pretty active on social media. however i found out he is extremely liberal, and that annoyed me a bit since i more ""moderate"". meaning i knonw how to reason, be logical and apprehensive about a lot of current issues (immigrants and refugees for example) and don't let my heart or emotions decide for me.

that won't be a problem to me in work since i know how to adapt, keep to myself on issues, and because living in this world means living with opposite-minded people. (plus i need a job). BUT i did have a question for everyone here, and please i am genuinely not trying to stir shit. i would just like to see if **I** am sustainable in this field with my points of views.

**does being in sustainable development means that i MUST be a liberal? can i be against refugees or against certain religions if i don't think they fit into the mold of the field?**

as a corporate social responsibility officer, i know that i should promote diversity and equality of chances. but to me this furthers the concept of accepting anyone's application but only pursuing those who will fit in into my ecosystem. moreover, the whole concept of sustainability is smart reasonable allocation of resources over a certain territory. so why put more pressure and unneeded weight on one? finally, it is out duty to strengthen third world countries to make them stronger and let them retain their youth and minds INSIDE their own countries to keep the momentum going instead of draining the ""good"" out of a poor country and just keep encouraging immigration even more.

Hello, I am Aleksi “Wampie” Majander, a competitive player, streamer and caster from Finland. I have been competing in the game since closed beta in late 2013 and even without never really having my big break, i have loved 95% of my time with the game.

One of the few events however which still haunt me to this day is the Gentlemen Cup played from may to october in 2014. The cup was the first team league ever in Hearthstone with 6 teams invited and 2 teams getting their spots from qualifiers. It was amazing up until the last few weeks of league play when it became clear that the admin, “P4wnyhof” was willing to do everything in his power to make sure his team PlanetKey Dynamics would advance over my team vVv Gaming.

In this thread I will address again my original thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2gruxc/disputing_results_of_gentlemen_cup_why_i_feel/) and the P4wnyhof “Truth” video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfsnUP1WkbM ). I will not address the gosugamers article, since back then we never wanted a witch hunt for an individual admin, so the skype logs were never released. 

Now it’s clear that there is two versions of events, so I aim to prove that P4wnyhof knew his admins rulings regarding vVv were inconsistent from other cases in the league, knew every one of them favored pkd, and was not going to listen to reason because as an admin he has the last say on everything. The issues fall under two categories, miscalculating scores and allowing of standings.

**Problems in the score calculations**

So Gentleman cup was played with 4 player teams, where each player played another player in a bo3. A win was 2 points and a lose was -2 points, and there was a ace match is the match was 2-2 to determine match winner. The playoffs were to be decided based on matchscore first, gamescore second. 

This event starts unfolding 16th of september when P4wny announces the playoffs to be played on the 18th and posts these scores: http://www.gosugamers.net/files/images/features/2014/september/W14.png that right away gave me doubt, since we had calculated our own score, and knew we had to be above PKD in gamescore, and even if we were tied in matches and games, we were 2-0 againts them on our matches, so would win the third tiebreaker.

Basically the scores given here assumed that a freewin we got against eEriness in week 13 gave us the win in matchscore, but 0 points in gamescore. After that we were having problems in our team, and were not allowed to bring in a substitute, so we played with 3 man roster, and was ruled -2 points for Spo not attending.

I contacted p4wny right away about the scores. Logs about the scores can be found here: http://imgur.com/a/ZhmEg

Basically he told me he did not want to give us game points againts eeriness for the free win since “In the end i think it would be unfair giving you a 8-0 for a not attending team - You already got a 1-0 easy mode out of this couldve also been a loss on your side.” meanwhile our game with Spo missing was ruled 0-2 because we were playing with missing players. This means in P4wnys argument, coming to the game with 1 player missing and trying to win 3-0 is more punishable than missing the whole week in terms of game score (So in fact we should have skipped last week, have the same Matchscore but better game score).

**Roster issues**

So what sparked the problem with us having to play with 3 players on week 14 was our internal problems, Basically Portex and Spo had quit at that time, and Kaldi had already left vVv making me and Ostkaka only signed players in team. Kaldi had an agreement with the team to play through the event if needed.

Basically when we realized this issue, even before week 14 Ostkaka informed p4wny about the issue and asked about rules in terms of standings. P4wny responded with “swap them in asap” so we contacted Xixo and Frezzar to stand in for the last week, and after that fact were told that they need to be contracted with vVv in order to play. I dont have all the logs from Ostkaka sadly, but I do have a snippet on my last talk with P4wny before going to reddit: http://imgur.com/a/bGBvi

Now we know there was issues with our roster and we are sorry about that, yet there was a clear precedent with both players joining rosters late (Kolento of Cloud9 and P4wnyhof himself.) There was also a case where a player called Pozmywam playing for P4wnyhofs team in the playoffs, he was never announced, nor was he ever listed in the team website, We never got a answer to why he was allowed to play, but it was basically the last nail to coffin which allowed us to proceed: http://imgur.com/a/cDi6S

Even after we were allowed into the playoffs, P4wny still decided to target us by trying to impose limitations on who we are allowed to find for subtitutes. This log takes place in 19th of september: http://imgur.com/a/wPfcS

You can fairly clearly see he is still trying to force arbitrary rules on us in terms of players we can play with, and the time we have to find the roster.

**Highlights**

I will share some of the more condeming comments here just for anyone who does not feel like reading through all my images, all the quotes are from P4wnyhof unless stated otherwise.

* “Ok first of all so you dont get a wrong picture of me having any intend of getting PkD in the play offs - I do not care if it would be PkD or vVv since i wont get anything out of it in the end. - There is the rule in the english rulebook just in so bad english that the german version is the understandable one i can show you that version also (Discussed that matter with Ostkaka already). - In the end i think it would be unfair giving you a 8-0 for a not attending team - You already got a 1-0 easy mode out of this couldve also been a loss on your side.”

* “The Problem about that is the Play Offs are already tomorrow and there is no way it will get delayed after being already promoted. Inconsitent Admin ruling that is your opinion. - Ostkaka reached out to me and missunderstud what i told him about players - I mean taking 2 random player from the internet to fight for you? I guess that should be obvious. - The Rules might not been perfect in the end there is the most important rule - Admins always have the last decision if there is questionable stuff going on.”

* ""I used everything to calculate from Liquipedia Scores Visible to everyone. Caunted it 3 times with excel and an intern counting it too. Had to get it clarified - The first is a team walkover the second a player one (Which was announced as not attending) - With a 2 player lineup since Kaldi isnt vVv anymore attendence would be possible - Made exceptions and put the ruling into a 2-0."" - Added this because in his video P4wny blames gosugamers for the score misscalculation while gosugamers was actually the ones who demanded recount.

**Closing words**

Back in the day I did everything I could to be respectful, not name P4wny in any of my posts, comments or even the article. Even though during the controversy I was willing to give him the benefit of doubt, in the end I only asked him the following: 

“I think best way way to go about this now is P4wnyhof making a public statement recusing himself from the administration of the the tournament and explains why he decided to rule walkovers that were in favor of us 0-0, and walkovers that were in favor of our opponent 0-2 and address the other points I rose in my reddit post” ( http://i.imgur.com/I4mvbb1.png )

To this date the only thing he has apologized or addressed is the misscount in scores, which was only a minor detail which ended up giving the score in our favor no matter how P4wny tried to enforce the rules, the underlying problem was that he tried to enforce rules in his favor in the first place, and we should not be dismissing it just because it did not work in the end.

If any third parties want to evaluate the logs I am happy to share them, just contact me through my twitter https://twitter.com/WampieHS Also my deepest apologies for Nydra and Take who are present on the logs, I hoped i could only share my personal logs with P4wny, but his behaviour was also apparent in the other discussion so I think it needs to be shared.

**Edit**

* fixed few spelling mistakes.
* Added a quote to show gosu was not behind the wrong scores like video says

*Adding a little clarification on the walkovers, When the scores were first presented, vVv and PKD were both 7-7 in matches, and PKD lead the game score with 1. We quickly realized that all the games where our opponent forfeited (4 games in week 13 vs eEriness) gave out 0 game score, yet the only game we forfeited (one game in week 14) gave us -1 gamescore.*

*Now we didn't care if all walkovers were 0, or all walkovers were 1/-1, since if they were 0 we would be even with PKD and win by third tiebreaker, or if all were 1/-1 since we would have won PKD by 3 game points. We did however object to the fact that they meant 0 when we won due to them, and -1 if we lost due to them.*

*This ruling actually stood until the end, it just happened that PKDs score was miscalculated from the beginning, and no matter the ruling on forfeits we still happened to be even with them so there was no choice but to let us play*"

There are only 6 other sophomores in my Pc (of 60) and most of them already know each other. I really try so hard to connect with the PC, but freshman year your mindset is A LOT different (boys, parties, etc.) and things always just get awkward when girls start talking about their ""friend group name"" or how many boys they've hooked up with on their floor.

Also, we have pledging for 3 hours a day EVERYDAY besides mondays. I have a ton of work and am trying to get an internship, and pledging just feels like an extra class I  don't want to be at. I stay up until nearly 3am doing work, and the girls are all sassy to me because I miss pledging for club meetings.

Also, big little is coming up, and everyone has been telling me how I'm JUST LIKE one girl in the house (aka she will probably be my big). I met her, had no connection and am truthfully a little scared of her (long story). I just feel SO uncomfortable in the house. I try so hard to make jokes (no one laughs), have a serious talk (no one cares or listens) and its just horrific. 

What do I do? I want to make friends and branch out within greek life, but is it worth it?"

From January - May of 2016 I did not hold a job since I had savings from a summer internship and wanted to enjoy the rest of senior year before moving away. 

Now I'm trying to do my taxes and I've run into a bit of an impasse on my state taxes. I'm required to prove that I had health insurance for all of 2016 to avoid getting a penalty. I was covered on my parents insurance from January - June and I was on my own plan from July - December. Do I have to file my taxes in both states to avoid looking suspicious to the IRS?

My MA 1099-HC form shows that I only held coverage from July to December, but I had coverage in NY from January to June, so can I somehow indicate this on my MA taxes to avoid having to file in two different states?

Seems silly that I would have to file in two different states even though I didn't make any income in NY while I was a resident there. Any advice here would be helpful. Thanks."

So I'm going to travel through New Zealand after my internship, and will rent a car for 8 days for the North Island (it's a bit short I know).

My mate and I are planning to go to Bay of Islands on a Sunday morning (from Auckland) to spend a day there, sleep at a hostel and probably leave the next day. The next stop are the Glowworm Caves in Waitomo (probably sleep in Hamilton and leave early to the caves). After that the plan is to go to Hobbiton, and drive to Rotorua. We've heard that this is a place where you can spend 2 days so we might do that, go to the springs, the falls, the lake etc.

Then leave and drive to Taupo, check out the lake and maybe do a track there. Next day: Tongariro Crossing, which takes a full day. Probably stay at a hostel south of the park after that.

We're flying to Dunedin from Wellington on a Sunday, so we 7 days to get from Auckland to Wellington (the flight is early in the morning so we're planning on staying in Wellington from Saturday to Sunday and then get to the airport). 

My question is: are there any hot-spots between Tongariro park and Wellington (free or paid, but low cost pref), or should we spend more time at the things/places I just summed up? The things I read on the internet and hear from flatmates/travelers are mainly based on the north side of the North Island.

By the way; I love New Zealand, been here for 4 months now (in Auckland, people say they don't like it here but I actually do) and can't wait to explore the country even more!

5tqbk5,1,2017-02-12,Is my preoccupation with illness unhealthy?,octoober,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/5tqbk5/is_my_preoccupation_with_illness_unhealthy/,"After a neurological virus one year ago, I fought bad health anxiety (e.g. thinking it was actually a brain tumor) for 10 months. During that time I was afraid of cancer a lot and even thought about how I would tell my friends or how I would deal with a bald head. Eventually I felt healthy again and most of these thoughts went away. 

However, the neurological virus experience still rules my life. I frame my whole year in terms of the virus: that summer, I didn't take an internship because the virus inspired me to work in the hospital instead. That fall, I didn't make friends in school because I was too weak to go out at night. I don't bond well with peers who have never encountered illness because I feel like they don't *get* a major part of my life. I don't drink or take risks because it feels like I understand in some deep way what it means to lose your health. 

I remember all the ""anniversaries"" like the first migraine, and in a weird way I *want* to remember every detail. I write a lot about the experience, and strongly desire to publish or do a public reading and be acknowledged for it.  Even now, I have to make *everything* about gratefulness, and being healthy after a long trial. I'm trying to live life to the fullest because I understand the health dangers that are out there, and I want to tell my friends all about my new desire to live life to the fullest. 

Although it's hard to admit, I think I want to be acknowledged, pitied, or told I'm somehow better than people who haven't gone through a health issue.

Is this is a natural response, or an unhealthy dramatization that could lead to something like Munchausen's? 

I was hospitalized for 1 night, 2 days, never unconscious, never needed medication. I had bad pain and weird neuro symptoms, but it was never life-threatening. Should something of this severity (or lack thereof) be causing this much emotional reaction?

Thank you. Happy to answer any questions.

5tqmtw,7,2017-02-12,Dear Husband,Imightbeflirting,Askasurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askasurvivor/comments/5tqmtw/dear_husband/,"Weirdly, my calendar is still very full, despite a few casualties. I suppose some of them wised up, eventually. Repetition will drive almost any point home. More on that someday, I suppose, but right now I'm talking about the girl in front of me.

The girl before me was practically quaking. I rose from the throne and she flinched, ducking her head underneath the ornamental brass pot she’d shined to a mirror finish and then filled with small coins. I'd been impressed with her until she'd tried to buy favors with those coins, but she'd finally crossed a very serious line by insulting the church's traditions. “P-p...please don’t hurt me!” She stammered out after saying something about the contract for Ambrosia, the new Energy Drink I was receiving royalties from, being a defilement of our Church. Oh how *little* they knew about what the 'Ambrosia' could really do. *Ah, so she knew full well she’d been sent here to die. Interesting. This one isn’t an idiot, nor is the one who sent her. Or he's testing what offends me. Clever.*

I took a knife from my hip- it was the Gould Blade, a distant second to the one the Gamer had taken from me so long ago, and I longed to stop using this soulless weapon the Goulds had given me.

I offered it to her, hilt-first, and my guards went on edge instantly, drawing weapons. I raised a hand, and they steadied. “It seems you have been sent here to die, and you have already made yourself appear weak before me. I do not tolerate weak subjects, but I will entertain the notion that you are doing as Sun Tzu advises- pretending to be weak when in truth you are strong. Take this knife. Extract a blood tithe from the one who sent you. I care not if they survive, but they will be the ones to suffer for this. Now, it was Mister Chen you were representing, wasn’t it?” She bobbed her head. I closed her fingers around the hilt. “You understand your orders?” Another bob of the head. “Go.” She did.

When Mister Chen thought to enact reprisal, instead of begging my forgiveness, I had him dragged before me. He and I had a chat, but he tried to buy my favor, forgetting what became of the corrupt in New America and my disdain for them. I ran him through the neck with surgical precision, the tip stuck out the back of his spine, the furthest point wiped clean by his own split skin. There was boldness and cleverness, such as sending interns on suicide mission after suicide mission until you know enough about your new boss to flatter them and curry favor, and there is also a quality to not sacrificing your own pawns, let alone not sacrificing your knights. But sometimes the corruption has traveled too deep inside the valuable piece. Sometimes it is best to make an example of someone valuable, to show that nobody is above the law. 

Especially when they are a menace to your own pieces on the board, and imagine themselves to be the King or Queen, and begin dictating orders of life and death to pawns without my or my husband’s blessing. He has joined the small number of people I've had no choice but to purge. Unlike my dear husband, I don’t rip something out root and stem, I merely prune the worst parts and hope the rest can heal themselves. As an example, the girl made it out alive, I heard. And she is now working an entry-level job at the business Mister Chen formerly ran. She has a friend in me, but she must climb the ladder on her own. I let her keep the blade.

Edit 1: Fun fact. The next appointment was an assassin with poison food he offered, to try and avenge you, King Davey. She presumed you dead. What do you want done with her? Trying to kill the Prophetess is obviously unforgivable, but her heart was in the right place- loyalty. I doubt she acted on your orders; you could try to kill me yourself. I’m… working on her right now, trying to see if she had a superior who hired him, but so far she’s saying she did it on her own. Complicated.

Edit 2: Ah, crap, seems Reddit’s down for good. I can’t reach you, I can’t prove you meant it when you gave me power. All I can do is continue to make examples while you do nothing- they may not believe me that I took power from you willingly, but I can at least get them to fall in line until you return. The assassin’s in prison, on Death Row with a hearing set for Six years, but she has a comfortable stay. I talk to him every now and again, mostly about you. She really doesn’t hate me- well, past thinking that I killed you. She hates me for that. But it seems you’ve inspired some genuine affection from your subjects. I’m listening to him talk about you. I don’t want to be seen as imitating you, but it certainly can’t hurt to take a lesson or two if these are the results. You have six years to get back here- seriously, I didn’t want you gone *this* long. Dakota’s growing so fast, and maybe you would like to hear his first words.

5tr3y6,1,2017-02-13,Summer internship in different state than permanently reside in,lolmanwhat,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5tr3y6/summer_internship_in_different_state_than/,"I've been filing my tax returns for the past several years, but this is the first year I've done a summer internship in a state (B) that's different from the one I attend college in (A). I've already submitted my tax return (through TaxHawk) but I need help determining whether I need to submit an amended return. Here are some details:

I work a part-time job throughout the year in state A and I worked a three-month full-time job in state B during the summer of 2016. I was charged a state B income tax on this income; this tax was automatically applied to my paychecks. 

On the ""State"" section of my TaxHawk tax return, it seems that this three-month portion of my income was considered as state A income, and that an additional state A income tax was applied to this money -- even though I already paid this income tax, and to state B (the appropriate state), not to state A. TaxHawk calculated that I owe $800 to state A.

I submitted my federal return and my return for state A, but I did not submit a tax return for state B. Also, I do not think I said on my return that my summer income was taxed by both states.

My expected federal refund is more than $800, so paying state A won't really be a hit, but I'd like to not pay as much. Is there anything I can do to more accurately reflect my situation?"
5tsj7p,5,2017-02-13,Why students should not save for retirement.,sterlingcartman6969,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5tsj7p/why_students_should_not_save_for_retirement/,"I have a theory, that I would like some other opinions on. The goal of this post is to convince you that US students should not begin saving *for retirement* until they are working full-time jobs. The scope of this theory applies to students that fit the following criteria:


1. Full-time students who will begin working full-time after graduation.
2. Either financially independent or semi-independent. Meaning that they do not receive large sums of money from relatives.
3. Students that have a large probability of a large pay-raise from what they currently make while attending school.


This theory hinges on:

1. The relative proportional loss of purchasing power while attending school working for low wages versus the time cost of money saved while working full-time.

2. The financial flexibility sacrificed by saving money for retirement in low-liqudity funds.

3. The decreasing marginal utility effect that a dollar has relative to different levels of incomes. 

(I am ignoring the effects of student loans because I am confident that it has been proven in this sub that it is more effective to pay off high-interst student loans quickly than to save for retirement.)

First, the proportional loss of purchasing power costs of saving:


A student working part time 20 hours per week at a typical student rate of $10 per hour will make $10,400 a year before taxes.  If they save 20% of their income it will be right around $2,000 saved. Meanwhile, the average college graduate is expected to make [$50,556](http://time.com/money/collection-post/3829776/heres-what-the-average-grad-makes-right-out-of-college/) in their first year out of college. This means that if they save the half the proportion they will have more than $5,000 saved, while still having close to six times as much purchasing power for quality of life. 


Even if the student is saving $2,000 a year for four years of university and they are getting an 8% return each year they still would only have $9,012.224 saved while living off of $8,000 a year. Is this level of sacrifice worth it for such little returns when you realize what your future value could be?


Second of all, the loss of financial flexibility for investing in low-liquidity funds:


Being in uni, I see friends go and work summer internships for great wages and be broke a few months into the semester because they're parents have advised them to invest in an IRA. I understand that investing young greatly increases the expected value of your retirement funds, and the power of compunding interest, but dollars are not absolute. A dollar has a different effect on and individual's utlity who makes $10,000 compared to someone who makes $50,000, right?


So now, Jack has to decide if he can afford meat for the rest of the semester while in two years he would be deciding if he can go out to eat twice a week. Which brings us to the decreasing marginal utility.


A brief explanation: if you give any individual $1, they will become more happy. But, the amount their happiness rises will become smaller as they become wealthier. [So, if you give somebody with an income of $8,000 an extra $2,000, they're utility will rise more than if you give $2,160 to an individual with an income of $50,000.](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_Chapter_4/PThy_Chapter_4.html)


Is the effect on a student's utility worth it to save a relatively little amount to what he or she could save in the next couple of years?


Last point: I am **not** saying that students should not save. They should save, it should just be in low risk, high-liquidty places where they can get to their money without penalties.

So, thoughts? Where am I wrong guys, let me know!"

I turn 23 this month and I feel like I've accomplished close to nothing in life since high school. That's not to say I *haven't* accomplished anything, but it all feels like wasted time and effort in the face of what's happening with my family right now. Last year, I accepted a contract for an internship under the National Park Service in one of the most popular parks in the world. It came right after I completed a technical degree in another field, and between everything positive going on it was the best point in my life. The internship represented my chance to start anew, to make something of myself. For the first time in years, I was happy. I was doing well at my job, I was active and social, reading, writing and making artwork frequently, you name it. It all came crashing down the moment I got a call saying my stepfather had been killed.

Nothing has been the same since. His death was seven months ago and nearly every day since then has just felt wasted. I should have quit the internship when I had the chance to tend to my family during the fallout of his passing, but I didn't. My contract provides an education award at the end of my service term, which I need to pay off my school loans. If I had quit early I'd have lost it. Meanwhile my mom is stuck at home taking care of her own elderly father, who is so far gone with Alzheimers and dementia to where he's basically a giant child. She has no mobility and no one to help take care of her, so her life is a living hell until I can come home. I'm stuck down here for my internship until the end of March, which will mean I won't be returning home until April- two more months she's stuck with no help. In the process I've lost interest in everything I had going on here in the park. I hardly socialize with people anymore, most of the friends I made early on have made it clear that they aren't interested in keeping friendship once we part ways, and I haven't written or drawn anything in months. All my interests are gone or minimal at best, and I feel like every day I'm here is time betraying my family.

This wasn't supposed to happen. Working within the NPS was supposed to be my big break- my chance to finally give myself the life I've dreamed of. Now it feels like it's all been taken away. For complicated reasons I won't be able to stick on with the Service even if I was closer to home, and I might have to abandon this career choice entirely. I feel like I've got no friends in real life that I can rely on, only people I know online who all live hundreds of miles away. My family is falling apart and I'm the only one who can do anything about it, but I can't leave here for two more months or else this entire year will have been for nothing. And I'm about to move back home at 23 years old not by choice, but by necessity. I feel like the world's biggest loser as a result. The only thing I have to look forward to anymore is going back to school at the end of the year, but that's only if I can afford it. A huge chunk of whatever my next income is will go straight back into my family before that happens- with my stepdad gone we've got no income and our savings are dwindling rapidly.

I just don't want to leave this year-long internship empty-handed. I've accepted fate and the notion of moving back home for my family's sake, but I don't want to do so on bad terms. I found out today that the remaining hiking trips I was scheduled to go on have all been cancelled, and that was my big hope for the end- get in as much wilderness time as I could. Now that's not likely to happen with busy weekends, so I spend my workdays just doing miscellaneous computer work instead. Everything I came here for is about to be a waste, save for that education award. All I want is to close this out feeling like I accomplished something. Instead I think more and more that this was nothing but a step back.

Sorry for rambling, just needed to vent I guess. I have no real goals in mind for this post other than to calm the nagging thoughts in my head for a little while."

I start a new internship today :) I've freelanced through school but I'm at the point in my senior year where that, for the precious few hours I'm home, I can dedicate that time to my thesis and maybe sleeping instead of homework, human maitenance AND any freelance projects I may have. 

So horray! I'm hired. Due to the nature of the company, they are just now branching out to having a ""design department"" outside of their remote in another state, so that starts with me, and they have nothing by way of design computers or.. anything. They're starting a new path with me, and they asked if I can use my existing 2015 rMBP. I said sure, but I requested they get me an external monitor, a dedicated desk area, and a smallish whiteboard. They've made it clear that if I need anything that isn't too crazy, I can make a request. 

That leaves me with ol Betsy, here. I took the initiative to make a separate user login for my computer, so that way when I'm at work I only have access to work stuff. Due to apple being *so generous* with space on their machines, I'm also thinking of requesting an external hard drive from the company so that when I work, work stays at work- also so that when they ask to see what all I'm up to, they can just yoink the hard drive whenever I'm not there and poke around. What else can I expect to do? What tips would you have from me? What should I be worried about? What questions/requests should I have for the first day?

Thank you :) "
5tu5fx,10,2017-02-13,Still dealing with the things said and done,ChainmailAndLace,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5tu5fx/still_dealing_with_the_things_said_and_done/,"Hey, y'all. 

I can't seem to describe how relieved I am to find out that there are other people out there who understand what being raised by narcissistic parents is like. Both my mother and father are awful in their own ways, as is my dad's mother. 

My best friend directed me to this subreddit because of some things I've been having a hard time dealing with. 

My mother has been threatening to disown me recently over complete nonsense, including her making assumptions about my sexuality. I'm working towards being financially independent, but I have to take care of not only myself but my twin sister, too. She doesn't work or drive and if it weren't for me working she'd probably starve to death and not be in school. I'm in school, as well, but have had to take the semester off to afford to even eat and pay rent. As it is, I go hungry on a lot of days. 

Now, in recent months mom has been increasing her threats of completely cutting me off. Her doing so will leave me without insurance. I'm a type one diabetic and without the insurance my insulin costs are well over 1000 bucks per prescription. Not to mention other medication I'm on. I've started using an insulin pump to get my sugars under control after my parents ""punished"" me for nearly a year by refusing to buy my medicine which resulted in the doctor not even knowing how I was alive at one point. Naturally, they both acted like they had no idea I wasn't taking the medicine and were so ""shocked"" that I was in such bad shape health-wise. 

Over the years things have been bad and getting worse, all while my mom tells me that I'm her best friend and the only person she trusts in the world. She gets so bitter at the thought of me having actual friends that see me as a person. A few months back I was in the hospital for a rupturing ovarian cyst and my sister and best friend came to be with me. Before driving away and leaving me alone at the hospital, mom threw a fit about them coming to see me. Even though everyone thought it was my appendix and that I was in bad shape, she was mad because it showed me that other people other than her care about me. Also, my best friend kept mom from stealing all of the pain medication I had been prescribed. (She's done that after every surgery or injured Achilles' tendon I've ever had)

What's been bothering me the most lately, however, is something that she said about 3 years ago. I'd taken an internship and had just moved down to Florida to work for six months. I'd called home, as I was expected to every day, and mentioned that I was going to go shopping with a few friends. Out of nowhere my mom told me that my friends and the world in general would be better if I'd just inject an entire pen full of insulin and ""go to sleep forever."" 

Shocked doesn't even begin to describe how I felt. My own mother had just told me to kill myself. I cancelled my plans with my friends and laid in bed crying my eyes out for the rest of the night. 

I'm wondering if I can ever really get past the things my family has said and done. I try every day, but it's hard. I've been in therapy through the school, and talking things through with my best friend has helped more than I can say. I'm happy that I've found this place as a resource to know I'm not alone. I'm sorry this ended up so long. "
5tuppm,2,2017-02-13,[M4F] - A Week in the Life of an Intern,joecalla,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5tuppm/m4f_a_week_in_the_life_of_an_intern/,"**Monday**  
I pondered, on the way to your office Monday afternoon, what would make you summon me. I think ""summon"" is the right word when an executive requests the immediate presence of a lowly intern without warning. It was only my third week, and I needed to check the wall map outside the elevators to even find your office.

I couldn't guess what you wanted when you closed the door behind me. I didn't take the hint when you told me to sit in your chair, or when you looked into my blue-grey eyes with amused certainty. I thought, somehow, that it was  some embarrassing mistake when you sat on the edge of the desk and shifted so that I could clearly see your red panties peaking out beneath the hem of your black pencil skirt.. I was innocent, far too innocent, 96 hours ago.

It was thirty minutes later when, on the way back down in the elevator, I finally began to process what had happened. I could still taste your cum on my lips, could still feel your fingers pulling at my short hair as you held my mouth to your pink womanhood. I had to check my watch to realize how long it had been, my sense of time and space lost as I tongued and sucked on your pussy until, with a playful shove at my forehead, you instructed me to get back to my desk.

**Tuesday**  
My Tuesday passed in tense silence as I sat at my desk and struggled to concentrate on my work. Thoughts of you kept intruding on my efforts at a comprehensive competitive analysis of my assigned market segment, until at 6PM I finally gave up on the thought of you calling me back to your office. *Was it all a dream?* I wondered to myself, until my phone buzzed on the way to the elevator. Five minutes later I was in your office, gritting my teeth to avoid withering under your intimidating gaze.

I couldn't say ""no"" to you,  and not just because of your position at the company. It was the look in your eyes. At your command, I withdrew my hard-on, solid and throbbing with the energy of youth. You looked on with an amused smirk as I stroked myself in front of you, fingers curling around turgid flesh slick with pre-cum, until I came on command onto the shiny hardwood of your desk. And then you sent me on my way, as though I'd delivered a report on the Asian markets that you wouldn't have time to review until tomorrow.

**Wednesday**  
There was no waiting on Wednesday; you were in my office when I arrived at work. I'd come in early to get some work done, to lay low, but you were there. Like you knew my schedule before I did.

I could see the confidence in your gaze as you lifted your dress up above your waist and leaned over my desk, your bare ass framed by a pair of garters. I could hear that confidence in your voice when told me to get to work. Ashamed as I might have been to admit it, I'd been aching to taste you again since Monday, and I moaned in pleasure as my tongue slid through your sex from behind. I remember the bemused look in your eye a moment later when you looked back at me and shook your head disapprovingly. You didn't correct me with words, simply pulled my face into your ass and pressed my lips to your tight anus.

I licked until you moaned, until I felt your ass hole clench around my probing tongue as you came. I tried to pull back then, but you explained with word and body that I wasn’t done, that I wasn't to stop rimming my boss' boss' boss until I was told to stop.

It wasn't even 9AM when you left me, somehow looking put together while my cheeks were red and coated in the juices you'd made me lick from your thighs when I was done.

**Thursday**  
Thursday's lunch-time lesson was a new one; you called it a ""reward"" for my good service the day before. I got no work done all afternoon, not with the picture of your eyes smiling up at me as your lips were wrapped around my manhood. I came hard, harder than any other time I remember, until drops of cum dripped from the corners of your smiling mouth and my balls ached with emptiness.

I felt suspicion from everyone on your floor as I returned to my office downstairs, as though they could all tell I'd just been blown by the Marketing VP.

**Friday**  
And now it's Friday, 6PM. The elevator beeps as it arrives on 24, your floor. The office is quiet now, late on a Friday. Only a few unrecognized stragglers spot me as I make my way to your office, and I can almost see them forgetting me as they pass me in the hall, their minds focused on tonight's plan or this weekend's upcoming adventure. My mind can't even focus that far out.

I knock on your door, and hear a ""Come in, Josh,"" from within in a voice that's still not particularly familiar; we haven't spent a lot of time talking so far.

I take a deep breath, reach for the knob, reach down instead and adjust my hard-on to make my arousal less obvious, then take the knob and push open the door.

V: Master of the house. Father to a young child and recently divorced. He is charming, well-mannered and pleasing to look at. He is hoping to break the inevitable dry spell that follows the end of any serious relationship by going to bars and flirting with women. V has never considered himself adept at flirting and has been turned down several times in the past few weeks. He is employing M both out of habit and, maybe without himself knowing it, from a sense of attraction to her. 

M: A cute, but badly behaved teenager employed by V. She sees babysitting as ""easy money"", a phrase that she uses frequently when describing the job to friends. In her mind, she turns up late at night, spend the time watching TV, raids Mr. Vs fridge and occasionally the liqueur cabinet as well. This job has kept her in good finance for the last year and the pay has actually increased since Mr V got a divorce a few months ago. M does not care why, she enjoys the ""easy money"" and the opportunity to oogle Mr V as he comes home from wherever it is he goes when she works for him. She likes older guys and likes to tell her friends so. She doesn't really think she'll ever sleep with an older guy, but enjoys the attention it gets her. 

S: A good friend of M's. She is not as careless as M and tries to keep her out of the kind of messes she often puts herself in. More often than not, it ends up the other way around with M's bad behavior rubbing off on S. After a year of dating both girls and guys, S ended up in bed with one of her female friends at a new year's eve party. She's been wondering if she's complicated the relationship and am looking for M's opinion. 

---

**Scenario**

V has been working a full week and wants to reward himself at the start of the week end. He's been eyeing an intern girl at work and wants to take her out for a drink in hopes of getting lucky. He calls M and asks her to babysit the entire night. She accepts.

M arrives late (as usual) and V chides her before rushing off to meet his date. He is now more than fashionably late. M knows the rule of the house and does not need an introduction. She's done this before and knows how to bend the rules without breaking them. M starts by going through Vs cabinets to find both candy, ice cream and chocolate syrup. She helps herself to a big serving and makes a bit of a mess. She doesn't clean it up (she'll do it later she decides). Instead of check to see that Mr Vs child is sleeping, she turns on the TV and starts watching a movie she likes quite loud. She's been texting with her friend S who wants to meet her. She knows she's not allowed to have company, but figures it won't matter since Mr V is never home before 1 AM. 

Around 9 PM, S knocks on the door and M opens. They haven't seen each other in days, which to them feels like an eternity. They embrace and start talking loudly. M remembers herself and shushes them both, giggling. The girls sit down to talk and soon wants something to drink. Mr V has nothing but water in his fridge, but M knows where he hides his liqueur. She triumphantly presents S with a bottle of red wine. They laugh and open it together. As the evening progresses, M and S get more and more drunk and less and less careful. They end up spilling wine over Mr V's table, they break decorations and leave ice cream cartons on the counter, melting. 

A short while after S decides to leave, M starts feeling lonely again. She searches through Mr V's computer and finds a poorly hidden folder marked ""Tax Returns"" filled with porn. While finishing the wine, she starts to masturbate and drifts off to somewhere completely different. 

*If S should remain at the time when V comes home, she will be witness to the end of the written scenario. She knows better than to talk back to Mr V and will be made to leave in a rough manner.* 

Just before 11 PM, When V comes home, it is to the scene described above. An apartment in ruin, broken decorations, spilt wine, melting ice cream and a babysitter who is so drunk she doesn't notice him stepping through the door. He has been rejected by the young intern and is feeling angry and sexually frustrated. Seeing M in this sorry state is more than he can stand. He doesn't say a word. Grabs her hard by the arm and forces her into his bed room where he in a hushed voice starts berating her and through gritted teeth tries to keep from yelling at this quite bad babysitter. When M laughs, talks back to him and tries to tell him to ""lighten up"" and ""it's no big deal"" his patience is at an end. He forces her down on the bed, pulls up her skirt and spanks her hard. Telling her that her bad actions will have bad consequences. M is so surprised, she doesn't know if she's being punished or used to satisfy some other urge. 

From here, the scenario is improvised but will most likely involve

* Spanking

* Slapping

* Rough fucking

* Anal

5tvpcb,2,2017-02-13,Me [20 M] and my GF [21 F] 1.5yrs have decided to take a break while she figures out sexuality,afraidtosaybi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5tvpcb/me_20_m_and_my_gf_21_f_15yrs_have_decided_to_take/,"Short synopsis of our relationship; We've been friends for 10+ years, and have been dating for just over 1.5 yrs. Since August we've been semi-long distance (about 2.5 hrs away from each other) and spend any time we aren't busy with school (weekends/holidays) together.

---

I have known since before we started dating that she wasn't interested exclusively in men, but she had always seemed to be more interested in men than women, probably due to her Christian upbringing in hindsight. In the past few months she has started hanging out with a new group of friends through a hobby of hers, and they have all become a big 'family' very quickly. Many of these friends happen to be gay/bi/poly/etc and this has allowed my gf to explore her sexuality a little more, and around November she began to embrace her bi-sexuality more and more. 

For example: we both created Tinder accounts while messing around one weekend, and will occasionally just sit on the couch looking at people, showing each other people we find attractive/weird/funny or any cute animals that pop up. As time has progressed she has gone from looking at men to almost exclusively women. She also had another app that she used that I think was exclusively for women. I can't recall what it was called, since I always just referred to it as 'Gay Tinder.' (Wasn't Grindr either)

She also had her first real girl-crush in this time. She happens to be a friend of hers who I also know. When she told me this she expected it to hurt me, but I knew she wouldn't pursue anything, and was alright with it (despite teasing her a little about it).

This weekend I went up to visit her so we could do our Valentine's Day dinner and hang out for the weekend, and I could quickly see that something was on her mind. I asked her, and with some work was able to get her to open up to me. She told me a lot of stuff I suspected was going on in her head that she hadn't been telling me.

* She hand't been enjoying sex as much over the past few months, despite us trying new things, mainly for her benefit
* She reached the point where she had been only looking at women on Tinder, or when watching porn
* It had been part of the reason she had wanted to take a break last year (This only lasted about a week, and was due to problems on both sides, most of which have been resolved)
* She also said this, but was very unsure about it, and took it back before the end of the conversation: She was worried that she might just be gay, and not bi at all. She said that she did still find me attractive though, and that was one of the reasons she didn't think she was just gay.
 
We talked it over, and we both agreed that unless she had the opportunity to explore this side of her it may damage our relationship with her constantly questioning herself, especially since she had seen it ruin a friend's relationship.

She suggested we take a break, while I suggested an open relationship. She thought that the idea of an open relationship was to foreign for her, and she was worried that it would hurt me to know she was sleeping with other women, and I would hurt her if she knew I was sleeping with other girls (which probably won't happen FWIW). 

In the end we decided to just set some terms, without really naming the whole situation.

* We were both free to try things with other people
* We could still talk to each other everyday if we wanted (Even though we are probably each other's best friends, I feel like this is mainly for my benefit. She's basically all I have as far as friends go at the moment, whereas she has a big group that she hangs out with.)
* We wouldn't visit each other like we had been, but we could play that by ear
* In a month we'd have a real talk about everything and decide what to do from there (this was mainly decided by the fact that I got us concert tickets for next month in trade for her handling our Valentine's day dinner)

I have the feeling that when we talk she is going to want to extend this time, especially since she's not the kind to just go hooking up with anyone. It's probably going to take her a while to find someone she's willing to open up to.

Now that we've decided all of this and I've gone back home I can't help but sit here and worry that this may be the end of our relationship. We had talked about her moving in in the fall while she works on her internship near me, and I had been really excited for that, as well as the possibility of our future together. 

But now all of that seems like it's up in the air, with no real way to tell what's coming. And the fact that there is nothing I can really do is upsetting.

The only real thing keeping me sane is the fact that I know that this is what is best for her right now, and that this could really be a good thing for our relationship if we decide to continue it down the line. 

But, despite this, I do wonder;

Am I wrong to just hold out for her? Should I start the process of trying to move on?

Is there any real hope of things going well here? (I don't expect any of y'all to be able to help me here, I just keep on thinking this.)

Is she just going to fall in love with whoever she meets while were apart, ending what we had?

Would it be better for us to just not talk while she goes through this whole process?

If things do go poorly, can we maintain our friendship?

Thanks for any help, and sorry for making it such a long post, I honestly tried my hardest to keep it short.

&gt;“Hello. This is Kaori Yaguri, on board the survivor-shuttle ‘*Xenon 001*’ I have no engine power, and the host ship was destroyed in a collision. Half of my shuttle is inaccessible due to vacuum. *Mayday, Mayday*.”
 
The short band star-wave® radio hissed back at me. Just like it always did. The ambient garbage, waves of the stars caused it to lap and sway like the shores of Bora Bora. 

&gt;In other news, it’s my 24th birthday - and Xenon’s third. Xenon had a growing pain today, the circuitry on my surveyor panel fused during a solar flare. I was able to shield my self in the main cabin using the old space suit to cross the vacuum. Its going to be out of air soon, i’m down to my last six canisters. Seven had a leak, turns out.”

This was the best way to maintain my sanity - and to keep the barely audible radio waves alive with my signal. If a ship would get close enough, they’d receive my emergency broadcast. An alert would pop up on their sensors and they could tune in if they wanted to. … You’re supposed to do it any way, but distress beacons are so good these days that is not usually a problem. 

&gt;“I was able to scavenge some wires and other stuff out of the main cabin. and performed our weekly check on the food preserve. We fixed the surveyor’s panel, and i was able to apply rotation to the ship using a piece of tape and slice of ham – had to make the screen think i was holding the dish-alignment button down for three days. This rotation will keep Xenon from losing power to her own shadow over solar arrays. The colony of spiders i had with me have died, the last one starved - i could no longer support it, and the gnat farm had a crack in it after i knocked it over, so they are all eaten. ”

Every morning i wake up, turn on the shortband, talk to .. no one. 
then leave the short band on for as long as i have the power to do so, letting the galaxy listen in on my private conversations. I once watched a ship sail right past us because i didn’t have the short band on long enough for them to find me. I didn’t even know they were there till the sun shined on their aft.

&gt;“I’ve finished programming my first game, Shattered Ship, the art looks a little stupid but for a two dimensional game, its pretty fun. I’ve had a lot of time to work on the random event generator, and the crew finally stopped killing each-other every time there is a torpedo fire. I’ve moved on to finish working on that adventure game i started last year, about the desert planet. I dunno, seems ambitious. We’ll see. I'll have plenty of time”

Xenon is all I have left now, she is my sister and she is sick. Her power coils won’t last another two years, they’re 2 years past warranty. Her antennae is gone, broke up in a low-orbit pass through mars’ atmosphere. We’re scheduled to pass by again this year, If we’re too low – Well i’ll probably die unless Xenon’s parachutes still work. If we’re too high, I’ll be flung into solar orbit with the Euro-care Space Stations, where I’m most likely to be found in another year.

&gt;”All things considered, Xenon is really quite happy today. Her batteries are pretty much full, the solar array is only down to 80% maximum efficiency which is great, considering how hard it is to sleep with the blast-panels open at night. means I won’t get locked inside the crew quarters again this week. But out heat waste is minimal and we’ve got plenty of spare parts now that i got the door controls to the cabin working again.”

If the mars colonists have their defense radar pointing at me when i pass through, they’ll know its a rogue shuttle, might even notice the distress signature… But i’m from earth so they’ll probably just let me drift another three years till i show up again.

&gt;“I read the manual - last night -  the service manual - Xeonon’s diary it feels like. She says these emergency signals are saved on a data storage somewhere in the ship, as part of the black box. I don’t know how much storage there is, or how much these take up - but the idea that some pooor soul is going to listen to me drone on for three years is terrifying. If there is enough of this material to turn into a book, and then sell it - leave some money for my daughter if i die. 

&gt;In about six more hours I’ll pass by Kathy-sixsix again, the signal buoy! marking our third year in this eccentric orbit. I’ll be leaving another message for Kathy, the radio operator for this area - maybe she’ll get it, i don’t know. It took forever to build the second net, I don’t know what I’ll do if I miss again..”

I stayed up all night two days ago to make sure i would be awake to see Kathy-Sixsix on the surveyor radar - it gives me a better idea of when I’ll have to get out into the space walk with the net. Kathy-SixSix is part of a network of surveyor buoys, with radio dishes set to record, and analyze radio data from other solar systems. It still picks up 16 year old news from the Proxima Colonists. Surely my short broadcasts.. and.. annual vandalism are enough to get some ones attention?

“Kathy-SixSix this is Kaiori Yaguri, on board the survivor-shuttle ‘Xenon-001′. We’re on course to attempt another netting of your buoy. I have the net’s anchor welded with the backbone of the ship now. One of us is going to be very unhappy in a few hours. I’ve already prepared a Message in a Bottle for you to collect assuming the magnets do-

**But then, the Buoy had a *response*.** 
&gt;“Shuttle Xenon, this is buoy six six. If you’re hearing this, the buoy has detected your radio signature and is responding automatically. This message is two hours long, you need to hail the buoy. Any way you can, I’m not allowed to be on a shift longer than twenty four hours. I’ll have my friend listen for you, If i’m not here. ” 

It was a very plucky, childishly feminine voice. Reminded me of a flight cadet freshman. I was so happy to hear another voice, another person. It wasn’t on a song, or a radio-advertisment. It was a one-way-broadband audio superhighway into my heart. She knew my shuttle by name!

&gt;“The surveyor’s guild is ready to pardon all damages to the buoy, and we have located your daughter, Artemis. Acting Captain Yaguri, we have secured several hooks to the outer-hull of the buoy on break away welds. There will also be a local unpaid intern assigned to Kathy-sixsix every fourth hour for two hours. If you agree to the terms of a contract, the surveyor’s guild would like to do a series of interviews on your journey….” 

The message was official, and long. Finally I could hear her, *Kathy*, the buoy operator.  I had listened to my own voice for so long, and Xenon wasn’t equipped to talk. This person, Kathy, she sounded gorgeous, and also a little sad.

&gt;“Kaori, this is Kathy. We’ve been picking up your radio logs for the last three years, and I’m sorry. For everything. It is my job to listen for voices like yours. Once we had your signal code on record I was able to keep track of your transmissions. I’ve been listening to your stories about your friend.. I’m at the part where she died. I guess now i know how the story ends, but. I’m so sorry. I .. wasn’t listening to the emergency signals, never even checked them. No one ever flies out here without an escort, there is too much debris. Your ship’s fabricators are already willing to make a settlement with you, since your engines failed. And.. I’ve been letting your daughter listen to every signal we decode. You’re quite the hero back on earth. No ones been able to find you, even the teams on mars let us know if they see any thing weird on radar. The fabricators even put out a finder’s fee, like you’re a *lost dog* or something. 

&gt;*Shuttle Xenon, this is buoy six six. If you’re hearing this, the buoy has detected your radio signature and is responding automatically. this message is two hours long, you need to hail the buoy. Any way you can, I’m not allowed to be on a shift longer than twenty four hours. I’ll have my friend listen for you, If i’m not here.”*

&gt;“Kathy-Sixsix, this is Kaiori aboard the survivor shuttle ‘Xenon’. I have your message loud and clear, I’m six hours from the mark, and I have no ships on my radar. Please, someone respond. If i have to agree to some fucking contract, I agree, sign me up, what ever just 

&gt;***GET ME HOME.***

Then i waited.

&gt;“*Shuttle Xenon, this is buoy six six. If you’re hearing this, the buoy has detected your radio signature and is responding automatically. this message is two hours long, you need to hail the buoy. Any way you can, I’m not allowed to be on a shift longer than twenty four hours. I’ll have my friend listen for you, If i’m not here.* 
**Your daughter** has been doing better in school, the Surveyor’s Guild has put her in a junior academy. Her father had to ask the reporters to stop harassing her so much. He was accused of profiting off your situation a few months ago, and some one dedicated a song to you at the music awards. It.. was a cover of Major Tom.. I’m sorry. No one asked for this. The new flight marshal was instated a few days ago, and wants to put no fly zone for rookie pilots in the debris cloud , to ensure no one ever has to be stuck out there ever again. You have to have a B level rating or higher to fly non-commercial. I don’t know if that’ll help. Seems weird to put a no-fly-zone somewhere where people are more likely to be stranded or worse. Don’t smugglers hide in NFZ?”

I watched the radar until it was nearly time to do the space walk. two hours until mark, and i had to get ready to deploy the net. But first i wanted to hail the buoy. The radar was still empty.

&gt;“Kathy-SixSix, Xenon here, when the Guild assigned Unpaid Interns to watch for my passing, did they check the pilot’s flight rating? 
***Am I currently in a no fly zone?***

&gt;I have to get ready soon. I’ve got a better net and a better anchor this time. I’ll be able to tow, or destroy the buoy. In either case, something will happen and I’ll have more scrap material to build an antennae out of. Or the spine of the shuttle will collapse and I’ll be dead, or clinging to the buoy. I’ve got a tool-bag i can fit all the spare air canisters in….

&gt; jesus christ ***please respond.*** 

&gt;Kathy, please. Give me any better option.”

I waited, tears in my eyes as I stared into the bandwidth monitors, waiting for the static signals to change. This was all I had left.

&gt;“*Shuttle Xenon, this is buoy six six. If you’re hearing this, the buoy has detected your radio signature and is responding automatically. this message is two hours long, you need to hail the buoy. Any way you can,* ~~~ I’m not allowed to be on a shift longer than twenty four hours. *I’ll have my friend listen for you, If i’m not here.* 

&gt; It seems like people, rookie pilots mostly, have taken to scratching their name and their rating in Buoy sixsix’s paint using their repair tools. There were six or seven names when the trend started, I counted seventy last time i went out to repair it. Maybe one of these enthusiasts will come out and try to add their name to the buoy. One way to survive would be to anchor onto the buoy some how. Your relative speed is quite high, so you’d need to slow down. I’ve added some commercial air tanks to the repair storage on the buoy. the keys are magnetized to the underside of the buoy’s new collision-safety lantern, opposite of the ion drive. I’ve been talking to your daughter about things that might help keep you company. 

I had to go, it was time. I needed an antennae, and the buoy had several just flying about last time i left. I managed to knock several loose.  Maybe they magnetized to the buoy or stabilized near the buoy in some kind of Dzhanibekov spin.  I’m probably not lucky enough for that. 

Out here on the magnetic surfaces, watching the buoy slowly get closer to me and Xenon, i could not see anything other than the buoy. No ships, no debris. Just a floating hunk of spare parts. I had 30 minutes to set out the net, one hour to stabilize it and another thirty to get safely inside the ship before i created another debris cloud. There wasn’t any A-ARCS left in my suit, i burned that a long time ago just trying to slow the shuttle down, so i couldn’t jump ship and transfer to the buoy itself. Once the net was ready to catch the buoy, I was on my way back inside. I drifted through the rear cabin’s hull breach, used the fixtures to navigate inside and was lucky enough to have an emergency airlock between every major substation on the shuttle. 

Just had to slip out of the suit, disconnect the canisters and then strap my self into the surveyor’s console.
&gt;
“Shuttle Xenon, this is buoy six six. If you’re hearing this, the buoy has detected your radio signature and is responding automatically. this message is two hours long, you need to hail the buoy. Any way you can, I’m not allowed to be on a shift longer than twenty four hours. ~~My co-workers no longer wish to take additional shifts to fill that time.

&gt; It was really hard to get people on board with your net idea. No one wanted to rebuild a buoy, but now that you’re such a celebrity, the cost of our public image seemed rather high. There are these videos on the web, about how to get you safe. It started with a simple mag-tow and RCS burn.. the whole thing devolved into more complicated plans over time. You could, for example, tie together sixteen thousand socks, and create an elastic brake that you lasso around one of the hooks we welded onto the buoy. The buoy would tear the socks and you’d slow down just enough to.. well, collide with mars but we’d know where you were going. Oh that reminds me, don’t dissemble the parachute systems for any reason. A lot of junior academy simulations are showing how easily you could enter mars atmosphere this coming year, and you’ll want those to be operational. You’ll have to set them manually to deploy when there is enough atmosphere for them to grab onto, though. The maintenance guide on board with you should provide the information on how to do that. I’ve gotta go to bed, when i record the next message I’ll read you a chapter from a book your daughter said you like. Be sure to stay tuned in for that when ever this gets added to the message loop. Its been six months since I set this message and now i am adding to this loop, it can only fit 2 hours of data..editing it is a nightmare though. sucks, right?”"

I know I've been posting the same thing over and over again, but my mind really never changes on what I want. Though tonight, I am going to be looking for the same concept of what I am looking for. I am going to just write up a new post and have some fun explaining what I want. 

I am a mother. And I am a slut. I love sex, I love fucking, I love cock and I love pussy. I just love anything naughty. That's why I am here on DPP, because I know I am going to be able to find some young lady out there that can beat me at my own game (of slutiness, of course) or at least try to be just as wild as I can. 

I am looking for someone tonight who wants to play out my new idea that I've got thanks to going to see Fifty Shades Darker today. I want to play a very wealthy business woman who has hired a new intern for a position at the corporation I own. Of course, things become very sexual and what not. I want you to become the girl I use to pleasure myself and maybe even the people who are my business partners!





Now, I am open to other ideas too. Or we can take one of mine and work on it a bit. I am **only looking for females.** So if you're male, I am sorry. I won't be replying to you *tonight, maybe another time.*

I have a NSFW idea of who I am going to play, so please come to me with an idea of who you may want to be. Either yourself or someone else. 

As for my kinks, you'll find more out about them in messages. "
5tx7gv,1,2017-02-13,Recent grad living alone on a $12 p/h internship in Chicago- how difficult?,velvetmoons,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5tx7gv/recent_grad_living_alone_on_a_12_ph_internship_in/,"Hello everyone, I'm seeking out various opinions on this situation because I'd like to move out on my own within the next 2-3 months and don't really have anyone to ask for specific advice. So here's the situation:

- I'm starting an internship soon that will be $12 hourly, extra for overtime, so anywhere between 40-50 hours weekly.
- I'm fortunate enough to have health insurance with my parents until I'm 26 (...for now) so I'll only pay my medical bills as needed
- After I get settled I expect to my pay share of the phone bill: approx. $25
- I don't have any debt (credit cards, car loans, student loans)
(--For those wondering how: community college for 2 years, finished last 2 at a university and paid off with scholarships, financial aid, &amp; savings while commuting from home)
- $2,000 in savings right now, starting another fund to slowly furnish apt.
- $100 monthly transit pass, maybe an additional $50 for cabs/uber when needed?
- $XX for renter's insurance, is it really worth it?
- Approx. $50 weekly for groceries. I'm a small person and expect to rely heavily on meal planning
- $30 maybe monthly for toiletries?
- I don't have a social life so maybe $25 weekly for drinks/food/etc?
- $15 monthly for netflix and spotify
- Getting internet, but no cable

RENT
I'm budgeting everything else around my rent &amp; transit pass because my main priority is living in a safe area with quick access to public transit. That being said I don't care if it's a small studio or tiny one bedroom. I'm also trying to calculate how much I might pay for utilities because some places include certain ones with the rent payment. Advice on this would be appreciated too.
I'm estimating $800-900 with or without utilities 

I think it's doable because many of my peers are in similar situations but most of them have roommates or get monthly help from their parents and that's not an option for me. So I know it's possible but I'm wondering how difficult it would be for someone in my situation. I might move on to a stable, better paid position in June or a better internship but this is something I want to do ASAP, in 2-3 months.
I appreciate your advice on this!

SIDE NOTE: when I say Chicago, I mean the nearby areas surround the loop, like the south loop, wrigleyville, LP, etc. The suburbs aren't an option"

What's really going on?,vicky_gee13,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/5txie0/baileycatherinemannick_whats_really_going_on/,"I like Minnick's teaching method cuz the interns need that exposure to learn n make mistakes. Afterall, it's a teaching hospital. You remember Lexie, Sadie and the likes had to cut themselves to learn... that's not good enough. When Mer, Christina, Alex, George n Izzie were interns, they learned and Bailey's theory ""See one... Do one... Teach one"" worked. But Lexie's set didn't have that opportunity because their residents (Mer, Christina &amp; colleagues) failed to teach them the way they were taught and that's what needed to be changed. 

So I like Minnick's method. However, I really dislike Bailey's execution of the new method and Catherine being cunny. Catherine is evil! Neither her son (Jackson) or husband (Webber) know she started this. What kind of person does that! 

Minnick's cool... her heart is in the right place. Yes! She's condescending, disrespectful and rude but... she got that vibe from Bailey when she signed on - the ""Get the job done, step on as many toes as you see fit, it okay to be rude!"" vibe.

Bailey didn't have the decency to address Webber and she thinks disrespecting other attendees/and their office is okay! Afterall, she's incharge, she's the Chief and she and her army of one (Catherine) is all she needs to make Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital great again.

She didn't put her house in order before Minnick came in- by talking to her attendings to make them see reasons why there should be a change (she used to be very convincing until Catherine started throwing evil ideas). Minnick's just following her footsteps. If Bailey stopped the secrecy, spoke directly to Richard n the attendings and defended her doctors as a leader should, Minnick won't have this problem cuz they will all be on the same page. 

Afterall, it's supposed to be for the good of the hospital."

We fell out with my husband's family, started grad school 3 weeks after baby was born, my father's cancer came back, helped him through hospice, and buried him last weekend. Now my brother and I are doing our best to manage his very large and varied ""estate"" (he was a hoarder) from 200 miles away. On the bright side, I was blessed with the sweetest baby and nipples of steel. 

Now, I'm in my second semester of school and tomorrow we put baby in child care for the first time. I was stressing about a lot, including pumping enough for his first day. By this evening I had about 8 oz saved up. I knew something was wrong with my freezer stash but I didn't think to check the stuff in the fridge until this evening. Milk from yesterday and the day before taste like straight up dawn dish soap. I bawled. 

My husband's reaction was to say, ""Don't worry, we can just use formula"" which made me even sadder. I never thought it would come to this...

So I scalded the stuff from today because it didn't taste bad yet. Now it smells and tastes a bit like rice pudding... I was already stressing about the effort of pumping at school and my summer internship, now this? It just sucks. 

Baby hadn't been taking a bottle for a long time, I never thought this was the issue, however. I did give him an oz, cold, in a bottle a couple of hours ago and he drank it! But I'm not convinced that he'll continue to take it since he's refused bottles for hours at home with dad. I gave him the bottle while he was laying flat on the floor and he was holding it. Maybe he was just excited to be holding the bottle himself for the first time? I don't know what to think.

Looking for support and other people's stories in dealing with this issue. "

I'm still plugging away at Calvin's Institutes, but I'm on a year reading plan so i'm obviously not too far into it. Like I said in the reading group though, i'm pleasantly surprised at how accessible the writings of Calvin are. I thought ""Institutes"" was going to be way out of my lane, but I'm hanging in there okay. 

I'm reading Tim Keller's ""Center City"" as a requirement for my internship. It's good and all, but if you have heard many of his sermons or conference talks then a lot of this book won't be new information to you. 

Also reading Aimee Byrd's ""No Little Women"" and it rocks. I feel like this is a good book for women obviously, but I'm also thinking about my guy friends who are preparing to become pastors and church planters. Byrd discusses a lot of the typical pitfalls of women's ministry and religious materials marketed to women. I think a lot of male leaders are kind of unaware of some of the problems she points out, so a book like this could be really useful to men going into church leadership as well.

5tylj6,5,2017-02-14,Fuuka Readthrough: Chapters 6-10,Legomaster12356,fuuka,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuuka/comments/5tylj6/fuuka_readthrough_chapters_610/,"What's this? Part two of the Readthrough nearly 4 days late?
I know I said I would update daily, but haven't I already proven my ability to stretch the truth so far it actually isn't the truth anymore and is now a lie?
In all seriousness, I had a big project come up with my internship over the weekend and as such I only got about one chapter in a day. But whatever, at least it's done now. Here we go, with

Fuuka Chapter 6: ""Spread Your Wings!"" Or ""Yeah, no, I don't even have a replacement title for this chapter. The original title pretty much sums it up.""
So this episode is pretty interesting and semi-cryptic. It's a shame it wasn't split up, but I'll get to that. So Mes (that's Mikasa es su casa) is all like ""Woah dude it's like Fuuka is trapped in a birdcage and maybe Yuu (haha you) can set her free"" and Yuu is like ""bruh what kind of weed is you on"". Anyways, the Chapter moves on and Fuuka takes Yuu to a shrine and is like ""Hey pray for me to get these tickets"" and Yuu is like ""aight"". Anyways, they pray and then Yuu suggests Fuuka sings or joins a band, since she doesn't know what she wants to do and he thinks she'd be good at it. She's like ""b*tch what did you (ha Yuu) just say to me"" and then she's freed from the cage. Just like that. In one chapter. Don't get me wrong, I love Fuuka, but I wish seo had played this out a bit more, with the turmoil of Fuuka being lost and Yuu freeing her. That's just my opinion though. 
Important progressions: Fuuka is finally freed from her cage (after a whopping 10 pages) and Yuu sees her wings that she will fly into the sky with. Forever. Into the future. No interferences. 

Now, the most exciting chapter thus far,
Fuuka Chapter 7: ""Promise!"" Or ""How to make and break a promise in 5 pages but realize you (haha, Yuu) actually kept both promises a mere 5 pages later!!!!!""
So this chapter is pretty straightforward. Yuu says he'll go to Tampa's concert at Budoukan on a Saturday, Fuuka invites Yuu to a concert on the same Saturday, Yuu cancels on Tampa but then realizes that the concert Fuuka invited him to was Tampa's all along?!
Important progressions: Yuu is going to Tampa's concert, all right, but it's with another girl? Gasp? Also, we establish the yaoi love triangle between Yuu, Mes, and Mr Pushy. 

And now, the most anticipated chapter of the last five minutes...
Fuuka Chapter 8: ""Stage!"" Or ""Some decent character development!""
So this chapter is straightforward as well, which makes it easier on my thumbs (I type these on my notepad on my phone before copy pasting them into Reddit). Yuu and Fuuka make it to the concert, and Fuuka determines that she WILL play at budoukan one day. We also get more concrete added on to the sidewalk that is the Tampa-Yuu one sided crush. We learn all her songs are written so they will reach him someday. And then the performance starts. 
Important progression: we see Fuuka's determination and Tampa's love for Yuu.

Just a note. I am a hardcore Yuuka shipper. Fight me. 

I can't keep hyping up chapters one after the other, with
Fuuka Chapter 9: ""Crush!"" Or ""What the hell am I supposed to do with all this ship fuel?""
So this chapter gives fuel to both ships in a serious way. First, Fuuka mentions that since Tampa writes her songs based on a crush she had/has, that means Fuuka should be able to write good songs as well. Yuu says ""wait, you (haha, Yuu) have a crush on someone?"" To which Fuuka replies ""Probably"" with a huge smile. Yaaaaay! Score one for S.S. Yuuka!!!! Then, Yuu gets a call from Tampa where they talk about the misunderstanding with the concert, and Yuu says he really enjoyed the songs. That's the gist, but Tampa really loved that Yuu liked the songs. Yay! Score one for S.S. Koy-Yuu-ki. 
Important progressions: does Fuuka have a crush on Yuu? Is Koyuki going to confess at some point? Who is best girl??? Why isn't S.S. Mikasa es Yuu-kasa making any progress? AHHHHH!!!!!!!!

And now, the final chapter of set two:
Fuuka Chapter 10: ""Band!"" Or ""The start of a legendary rollercoaster of feels!""
This. This right here. Here is where the legend starts. Yuu takes his promise that he made with Tama as children (""Let's grow up and be as good as the hedgehogs or whatever"") and merges it with Fuuka's desire to start a band, as Fuuka ropes him and Mes into joining the band club she is making. Many adventures await, and not all of them are great. But I hope that the people following this read through prepare their buttocks. That's all I can say. 

Anyways, that's set 2. I timed it this time and it took me an hour and twenty three minutes to read and write this. That's a whole lot of minutes!
I hope there are people out there enjoying this read through, somewhere, and are reading along with me. 
TL;DR: no. No more of these. Nah fam. If there are any recipe requests, I will take one per set of chapters in the comments. One. Not counting the one I hid in this set of chapters, about ultra cheesy bacon mac n cheese :)"

For example:

* JD talking about telling Turk about meeting Elliott for the first time with the the refrain ""JDs gonna hit that flat butt"" buzzing in his head. But, JD and Turk met Elliot for the first time, at the same time: “are you surgical or medical?”.
* In the early seasons, it is surprising that Carla would show up late to work. Seems out of character. Best line from that one was Ted lamenting he was going to be a Senator.
* JD being bad at sports but some how being a gymnast in high school and going to batting cages.
* Turk's brother not being co-bestman (maybe they just didn't show him)
* Turk being unable to hug JD but hugging the dude that JD made cry when he said ""I heard your sister is drinking again.""
* Dr. Cox having so many people over at his house when JD comes over to talk about the patient that will not quit smoking but then no one shows up when Dr Cox throw a party for a fight.
* Elliot being in private practice but teaching interns.
* Ted calls Gooch his first girlfriend but was married, lamenting his ex-wife left him for his brother who is ""9 inches shorter but wears a piece.""
* JD and Turk's origin story keeps changing and when they got Malik (sp?).

Edit - Added More:

* When Dr. Kelso meets Enid. In one episode (3.15 - ""My Tormented Mentor"") it shows him slapping her behind at the hospital while reflecting back on simpler times but in another he was with Enid in college because she was Bunny (1.18 - ""My Tuscaloosa Heart). It is possible that both events could have happened in the same timeline, particularly when Kelso talks about (1.15 - ""My Bed Banter &amp; Beyond"") Enid not working when he refers to her has Shelly (because she was a shell of who she once was)."

The good in me won't let it.

I try and try and try to smile through my teeth and just pretend like I'm fine, everything's fine. I say that I'm doing great, life is fantastic. I make people laugh everyday, I joke and tell stories and always provide people with a shoulder to cry on.

But no one in my life provides the same for me. I get told to get over it. People tell me to man up...but I can't. I'm too tired to take back my life from this. Everyday is a constant struggle to get up and be out and get active. I force myself to go run and exercise daily, eat healthy, and read (on top of study). But it hasn't changed a thing. 

I've been given so many opportunities lately because of random bursts of energy that I've gotten with applying for internships and jobs (both of which I've gotten). But those bursts of energy just come too few and far between. I constantly feel like I deserve anything good in my life. I feel like I'm just taking everything for granted and I'll just make a waste of anything that's given to me. I'm constantly asking how I could possibly deserve anything or anyone. I feel so selfish for feeling so sad all of the time, when I know people out there have it worse than me. I KNOW people who have it worse.

My close friends and family are sick of hearing about my worries and sadness. They pretend to listen now. They were caring at first, but now they're just indifferent. I've faced and overcome this once before, so they thought that that was it. That I was done with it. I think they see me as the boy who cried wolf, and honestly who could blame them? I'm trying desperately, DESPERATELY to reach out to the people in my life, but no one will listen. I have no one left.

Even my girlfriend is doing the same to me now. We were once so close and comforting for one another. She would often go through the same, and I would be there to comfort her. But she's grown distant, doesn't want romance or the stress of it. Wants space and time and God knows what. All my head tells me is that I'm not good enough, I never have been. No matter how good of a loving man and partner I am, I'm not enough. Her words comforted me when my own thoughts failed me. Now all I hear is a cacophony of maddening fucking silence. 

I'm waiting, listening as hard as I can for someone, anyone to find me and hold me and tell me that I'll be fine, that I'm loved and appreciated. To listen to me. To give me guidance. There's nothing I hate more than being alone. I get scared of my own thoughts. Of what I might bring myself to do if I'm alone for too long. I cling to people as hard as I can, and I think that's what drives people away.

But I'm alone. If I could snap out of this I would in a fucking heartbeat. The universe keeps throwing me so much promise, but all I see are broken promises. I think I'm just waiting for some luck to come my way, for some bright epiphany that will make this go away into a box in my mind. 

But it's not going to come. The new antidepressant won't help. The therapist, sweet as she is, won't help. Family won't. Friends won't. Internet forums won't. 

I just can't see brigher days ahead, as much as I lie to others (and try to lie to myself) that I do. But I want to. A little piece of me does.

The bigger piece of me doesn't.

5u0nsj,57,2017-02-14,Sharing the Various Reported and Witnessed Experiences I've Encountered,DeltaEchoXray,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/5u0nsj/sharing_the_various_reported_and_witnessed/,"I've been wanting to share all of this here for awhile to get people's opinions and have finally found the time to do so. This will be a lengthy post because I've had my fair share of paranormal experiences and stories shared by people in my family. I'd love to know what everyone here thinks of them. 

First, I'm going to tell you about my deceased grandmother visiting her grandchildren (including me). Now, my maternal grandmother passed away before I was even born. I never met her (in physical form). I have two younger brothers, the youngest being 12 years younger than me. He is a half-brother, technically, as we have different fathers since both of my parents got remarried after getting divorced. One day, my mother was in the kitchen with him and preparing supper at the counter while he played on the floor and was about 4 or 5 years old. No one else was home, as my step-dad was working and myself and other brother were on our way home on the school bus. 

While my mother is chopping stuff on the counter, my brother randomly out of nowhere asks her why there is a picture of ""Nana"" on the refrigerator. Now, like I said, my mother's mom passed away before I was even born. ""Nana"" was what my older cousins referred to her as when she was alive. My youngest brother had 1 living grandparent, my step-dad's mother, and he referred to her as ""Grandmom."" She also looked nothing like my mother's mom. Thus, ""Nana"" was barely ever mentioned to my brother before, if at all. On the side of the refrigerator my mother keeps a sort of mini memorial with pictures of people who passed, funeral cards, etc. There is a black and white picture of her parents when they were somewhere in their 30's I'd guess. Surprised by my brother's question, my mom asked him to show her the picture of ""Nana."" Yup, he points right to her mother in that picture. Next, she asked him how he knew who Nana was. His response? ""She talks to me before I go to sleep sometimes.""

Now, my mother only ever told my brother and I about this afterward. She didn't want to upset her siblings or get their hopes up by telling them. This prompted my mother to get into going to see mediums and stuff like that, which she has been doing off and on for years since. Fast forward about 10 years to a couple Christmas Eve's ago. My mother and I are hanging out with 2 of my aunts (her sisters) and a great aunt (Nana's sister) at my uncle's house where we always celebrate Christmas Eve and having some drinks. For some reason, people start telling ghost stories. So, I asked my mom if I could tell them this one about my baby brother and Nana visiting him. So, I do. One of my aunt's ends up telling us how she never told any one this but it also happened to me when I was younger. She used to live in the house they all grew up in and when I was a kid we used to do a Sunday dinner over there every week. She said one time she had called everyone into the kitchen to come eat but everyone came but me so she went looking for me. She said at the bottom of the stairs she could hear me upstairs talking. So she came up and found me sitting on her bed in what used to be my grandparent's bedroom. She asked me who I was talking to and I pointed to a picture of my Nana on the dresser. I have no recollection of this whatsoever.

My father had been struggling with health for 8 years following kidney failure as a result of not taking the best care of himself as a juvenile diabetic. He had a transplant and that is what gave him the 8 more years he had before passing away from multiple organ failure very young at 44 years old. He was sent home on hospice on a Saturday and told he had 3 weeks to live. That night, while we were all hanging out after dinner he promised my stepmother that if he could give her a sign that he is there after passing he would. The next morning, my father passed away while he was alone with me in a CVS parking lot. I'll spare the details of his death as it is the most traumatic experience I've ever gone through. However, I had to drive his lifeless body back to the house since we were told to not call 911 if anything happened because he was a DNR so they wouldn't be able to do anything for him anyway. When I got back to the house, my brother helped me carry him into the house and put him in the hospice bed. My stepmother sat next to him and cried the entire time until the hospice nurse came to take his vitals and officially pronounce him dead. After awhile of her crying over his body, my stepmother exited the living room where his hospice bed was setup and walked into the kitchen. The second she did, the landline telephone on the wall in the kitchen rang. The caller ID read 000-000-0000. She let it ring a few times, suspicious of the caller ID but then answered. Nothing but quiet static on the other end. The same thing happened later after family arrived to come see him before the funeral director picked up his body. (We had a cookout planned where he was going to say his goodbyes to everyone and everyone was already on their way from out of state when this all went down). Although, I cannot remember who answered the phone that time.

That night, I had a dream that I was sitting at a table in the backroom of a public library with my brother and stepmother. We were sitting in silence and a door opened. In walked my dad looking as he had when he was healthier in life. He sat down at the table and we began questioning how he was here since he had died today. He told us he was there to just let us know he was okay and that we don't need him any more.

After his memorial services, I was back at my college apartment, alone for two weeks until my roommates finished their summer internships. My first night back, I had my second and last experience of sleep paralysis of my life. Only this time, while consciously awake I could feel somebody's weight as they first sat and then laid on the bed next to me. As I struggled to look around to see what had put their arms around me, I noticed it looked just like my father laying in bed with me. I freaked, forced myself to wake up and that was that for me.

That same week, my stepmother returned to work and had to use my dad's car instead of her regular commuter car because there was something wrong with it. It was the same car I had driven him home in when he died. As she pulled into the driveway after work, the car's radio turned on by itself and the volume went from low to maximum right away, scaring the crap out of her. She took that as another sign of him letting her know he was there.

About a year later, she called me, a little freaked out and saying she felt she had to tell me about this right away because of the stuff I had experienced since he passed. She was in the house alone and her iPod randomly started playing ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" by The Foundations while it was docked on her nightstand in the bedroom. This was their song. When she went to go look at the iPod, instead of the title of the song scrolling across the screen, it read ""Missing You.""

This is all I've got with the exception of my brother telling me now and then my dad still visits him in dreams. But this, along with research I've done into what kind of evidence exists from studying Near Death Experience and things of that nature have all been enough to convince me there is a good chance there's more beyond this world and our physical death in this dimension of reality."
5u0vr8,28,2017-02-14,I just got fired,Kayters,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/5u0vr8/i_just_got_fired/,"Hi guys,

I was doing an internship in an ad agency in London. I've worked there for a month and today the Managing Director called me in his office and told me I was fired (apparently I didn't lived up the expectations). They're going to pay me for everything and also today as well. That's it.

He also told me he's going to write me a good reference letter and maybe give me some of his contacts.

It was a media agency. I've found a job there and so I've started working, but what I really want to do is going into creative. Maybe this is the right opportunity to do it. I didn't like the Media department that much and that's probably why I wasn't performing well.

The bad thing is that I've moved yesterday with my girlfriend and I was counting on my salary to pay the rent. I think I'm good for at least 2 months, but I'll need to make a move quickly, because I need a job and I would love to work in another agency.

Any advice on this front? Thank you!

P.S. I believe there's something that says that if you get fired [in advertising], than you made it. Let's hope it'll be true for me.

I'm a sophomore CS major and have yet to connect with my academic advisor. I've recently landed a summer internship and have been given the project outlines, some of which I know is beyond my current skill level. I was hoping to get some insight with a professor as to what I should be learning between now and May. 

Currently my advisor is Professor Heffernan, and from my quick Google search he seems to be involved with graduate students far more than undergrads. Although I'm not on first name basis with any CS professors, I've had good experiences with Wills and Claypool. Is it worth it to shoot them an email requesting for them to take me on? What are people's experiences with these guys regarding academic advising or general personal project help?

Thanks a lot :) "

I know I've been posting the same thing over and over again, but my mind really never changes on what I want. Though tonight, I am going to be looking for the same concept of what I am looking for. I am going to just write up a new post and have some fun explaining what I want. 

I am a mother. And I am a slut. I love sex, I love fucking, I love cock and I love pussy. I just love anything naughty. That's why I am here on DPP, because I know I am going to be able to find some young lady out there that can beat me at my own game (of slutiness, of course) or at least try to be just as wild as I can. 

I am looking for someone tonight who wants to play out my new idea that I've got thanks to going to see Fifty Shades Darker. I want to play a very wealthy business woman who has hired a new intern for a position at the corporation I own. Of course, things become very sexual and what not. I want you to become the girl I use to pleasure myself and maybe even the people who are my business partners!





Now, I am open to other ideas too. Or we can take one of mine and work on it a bit. I am **only looking for females.** So if you're male, I am sorry. I won't be replying to you *tonight, maybe another time.*

I have a NSFW idea of who I am going to play, so please come to me with an idea of who you may want to be. Either yourself or someone else. 

As for my kinks, you'll find more out about them in messages. "

Help?,SecretPerson1234,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5u2hjw/i_24m_dont_know_if_my_teacher_m_is_an_asshole_or/,"It seems clear to me that hes an asshole but all my life people tell me I'm overly dramatic so for several years I've just avoided confronting people with problems even when it seems clear to me that there is some kind of problem. I try to state things clearly and be reasonable but it almost always ends up worse so I've sort of learned to just keep my head down and my mouth shut.


I'm having a hard time in a class I'm taking and most everyone seems to have picked up the material by now. A few people are still struggling besides me but most everyone has it down and is ready for the upcoming test we have.

Today we ended class early because the other people struggling didnt show up and everyone else was good to go. The teacher said ""Anyone who still needs to practice, youre welcome to stay... [my name]"".

So then he decided we would go to his office and these other 2 girls who needed help with another class hes familiar with came for help in that class. The whole time I just silently did my work while girl1 did hers for the other class and girl2 just bullshitted with him. Thing is, girl2 is pretty damn hot and he was more interested in making veiled sexual innuendos with her than helping me. Like jokingly telling her how he can set her up with an internship at his house. I dont care if he wants her or what they do or dont do, thats none of my business. I just want help because this material is hard for me.

I did a few problems after the one he told me to do because once I finished the first one and went to ask him to give me another one, he was too busy talking with girl2 and I couldnt get a word in so I continued and did 2 more. When I went to show him once I had 3 done, he told me I went too far ahead and wouldnt get the right answer because the 3rd problem requires a different method. He then told me ""You just arent good with numbers, bless you"". After this I just wanted to leave so I said well I have to go meet a friend for lunch. He asked me if it was a girl and I said yes, so he told me to put a belt on (Im no gangster. I always wear a belt and wear clothes correctly but I was in a rush this morning. My pants werent sagging or anything, and its not like my underwear was showing, plus I was wearing a sweatshirt). Thanks for the advice.

He just always seems to have these remarks toward me where Im the butt of a joke. What really set me off was telling me Im just not good with numbers. Im trying not to let that take my motivation but its hard. I would like to say something like, ""Look I just dont like that so please Id like you to tone it down"" but every time Im in a situation like this it just makes the problem worse. Im either told to stop being a bitch and nothing changes or things become weird and the person makes a big deal of things almost sarcastically like ""Oh Im sorry did I hurt your feelings?"".

This is why I just keep this shit to myself. I realize I must be wrong because this doesnt seem to be an issue for other people, only me. I just wish I could change and be different but I really dont know how. I suppose I can pretend by not saying anything and continue to just laugh because its what people expect but the truth is that it's a fake laugh and I really havent changed at all. I really hate when this happens and I feel helpless to do anything but just accept it.

Is there anyone here who is like this and if so how do you manage?"
5u2j7w,2,2017-02-14,"Me (23F) with my boyfriend (25M) of 4 years, recent fallout is causing me trouble at work",Catworldullus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5u2j7w/me_23f_with_my_boyfriend_25m_of_4_years_recent/,"Hi Everyone,

Need some advice on how to handle this.

This past summer, my boyfriend interned at the software company I work at. The company is based overseas, and there is a small satellite office in the States (10 people). This is where I have worked for 2 years. One of the many perks of working in the small satellite branch is that you get to work from home.

 To say my SO is over-qualified is honestly a bit of an understatement. He is an MIT graduate in computer science as well as two other courses. The work he was doing there was very easy for him, but he was making good money. Officially, he was working this summer as an ""intern"" since he had not yet graduated. Because of the perks of working from home and creating your own schedule, my boyfriend showed interest in working there after the summer ended. He wants to make his own company and this would have been a good side job to support him.

Here is the problem: the US division of the company is absolutely bonkers. There is no organization, everyone is under-qualified, and no one knows how to run a business. The company overseas does not have this problem at all. My boyfriend did an excellent job in his internship and notified his superiors that he would like to work full time. The company was enthused, as they could really use some strong leadership in the US. They told him they would love to have him on, but never followed up with any offer. Specifically, in August, my boss (Jake) asked how much of a salary my SO would want. Jake immediately said it was doable, and that the contract was impending. 6 months went by until in January, Jake said they would not be making an offer (he promised my SO that amount of money without checking in with his superiors).

This peeved my boyfriend a bit, as he was graduating and wanted stability: either hire me or let me move on. He emailed hire-ups all summer, and no one responded to him. The team in the US (especially my boss) kept saying, ""Don't worry, they are preparing the contract"". My boyfriend bit the bullet and kept working part time, waiting for the contract. Another 6 months go by of him working part time, and my boss ultimately tells him they will not be giving him an offer.

At this point, SO is pissed. He turned down other similar jobs with the expectation that a contract was on the way - that is what my boss (who oversees all US employees) told him, after all. I agree with my boyfriend that this was handled very unprofessionally. Not only did they knowingly string him along to get him to do more work, but they cost him other jobs.

So here is the problem: my boyfriend is really mad at the company. He still has 2 of their laptops and a timesheet to submit, from January. He has been scrambling to find work, as the news to not hire him full time left him jobless. He has bills of his own, and finds what my company did quite shitty.

Here is where it gets complicated for me: after getting the decision to not hire him, he sort of ghosted. He is working three jobs right now, and i don't blame him for not prioritizing the company that screwed him over. I have the laptops in my possession and have notified the woman in the US collecting them (Catherine, who works in finance dept) that I will be bringing them in on behalf of my SO next week.

Despite this, he still has hours to submit. The only person that is going to hurt is himself. Catherine is lashing out at me though. She keeps sending me messages along the lines of one I got today, ""can you also tell [SO] that personally, I am very disappointed with him, it is both rude &amp; unprofessional to not respond to my numerous emails !! You will not be getting my recommendation"" (as if he is dependent on it) but she prefaces all of these messages with ""I don't want to involve you, but...""
 
I do NOT want to be involved in this. She has been texting me multiple times a week, calling me, and leaving me nasty messages about him. We have an agreed-upon date for me to bring her his hardware, but I don't think it's her place to direct her anger towards him at me. She says she doesn't want to involve me, but even in the messages she is sending me, she is being unprofessional by asking me to say she is disappointed in him 'personally'.

I'm not going to defend my boyfriend that he should be taking his sweet time to get back to them, I get it that it's a company they need to be in order, etc. But those laptops are just going to sit in a closet for the next year. There is not technically a rush. Furthermore, say this was an employee who had no relationship to me. What would her course of action be then? She would have to be patient. She wouldn't have me there to let her know I was bringing in the laptops and to inform her that he said he would submit timesheets this week.

Part of me does not blame my boyfriend for his behavior, because I agree with him that he was treated very unprofessionally and manipulated into stay longer under the guise of an 'impending contract', but I also am sick of the daily nasty messages. It does not make me want to rush him into doing this. 

How do I handle nasty comments about my SO from coworkers, even though i think SO is justified? It will only be going on for another week.

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend was strung along to believe he had a 100% chance of getting a job at my company following his internship; Company bailed last minute and boyfriend has equipment and hours to submit; Finance director is sending me nasty messages about him."

5u2tp7,1,2017-02-14,Debt repayment and building credit: 0% APR CC vs Line Of Credit vs Personal Loan.,unfaceit,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5u2tp7/debt_repayment_and_building_credit_0_apr_cc_vs/,"Hello everyone, 
I've been reading you guys for awhile and finally am ready to post. 
I've been to all the wikis and search results from 3 years ago and still want your advice on the situation: 


I'm 27 and am
$53K in debt. 

I went through my first years in US and through college with just one credit card that I didn't really use. I was making all payments on time. At 24 I read on credit history and eliminated my debts, my cs was 760. Then Chase sent me a Sapphire offer and i took it - BAM, 17K limit. I've been using it at 10-15% and then I met a girl. I set my own hours at work, so I started to cut on work and spent more and more time with her. Spendings went up with the mentality of ""I'll just work extra next week"" without me working extra. Then couple travels, I got a new car for work (MISTAKE, oh depreciation!) and then I got an AmEx offer. I didn't need it but decided to take for CS as all my other cards are visas. BAM - 18K limit. 

Then we have decided to get an apartment together, bought and decorated everything inside from scratch, my earnings got cut by 25%... Then we got married and now am moving from a Big City on the East Coast to the Big City on the West Coast. 

I have observed the mistakes I've made, the amount of money wasted and consumerism culture we've been consumed by (Ha, the tautology!). We adjusted our lifestyles and spending habits. We plan to start our lives anew, from many angles, including budgeting. 

We have saved a safe amount of money to get a month sublet, pay for moving into a new apartment and money to get us through 2-3 months once there. We don't have jobs there. I plan to finally pursue a career in marketing, which I got my degree in ($40K/year if I'm lucky not to start with internship), she will look into high-end restaurants (20-40K/ year). All seems to be adding up but I'm concerned paying off credit cards WHILE getting charged interest might be a headache if I won't find a job right away. 
I've been getting personal loans offers which started me thinking. Their 35K loans at 5% seemed false after reading fine print. Credit Carma showed 20K at 15% for monthly payment of around $650. Don't see benefits VS 16.99 and 17.99 APR cards I currently have, except for increasing available credit for CS purposes. 

Back to the actual question: 

I'm $53K in debt out of which

-$15,692 outstanding auto loan 

and 

-$3K in student loans 

do not bother me much, those are my monthly expenses of $350 and $50 respectively. 


**$34.5K in CC debt is my problem**


* Sapphire - 15K/17K @16.99%.


* Amex - 14k/18k @17.99 starting next statement.


* Freedom - 3K/6K @21.99 (being paying heavily lately).


* Slate - 500/ 2K @11.99.

I have never missed a payment in my life *knocks on wood*. My CS is 660 now due to high CC utilization. I would like to amp my credit score and lower interest to be paid. Here are two trains of thought: 

1. Applying for a MasterCard for Balance Transfers with 0% APR, using hard inquiry, wishing for 10-15K limit. 

2. Try to increase SLATE's line of credit. This is my first card. I owed it for 7 years and have never asked for an increase. 

I also have never used balance transfers and don't know if there are any limitations to them. 

Thank you all for your responses and pardon my flamboyant style of expressing my thoughts. "

It's been one month, been working 13h/day in order to be well prepared and I just ended the first day of teaching, it went alright.

This morning I woke up at 4am, my dad was quick to leave the house, not to come back until 8pm, always slamming doors as he goes. I lie awake for another two hours, stressing out. Nmom wakes up at 6am and decides to wash every dish in the house loudly. I step out of bed at half past six, try to eat something at take four out of twelvepills Nmom had the doctor prescribe me for stress, work-related headaches and vitamins because I barely have time to leave the house anymore or eat decent food.

I go to brush my teeth and vomit everything out again, nauseous with worry.

Teaching actually went pretty well, apart from dealing with one particular pupil. The workday was motivating for me.

I come home and ry to prepare lessons for the next day, all this time is taken up by Nmom's inane screeching. At one point, I was on the toilet for a number two, she started screaming for me to come and look at sth that instant. Turns out she misread something and there was no problem, which set the tone for the rest of the night, during I had to help her every five minutes with her work. By 9.30pm, she left me alone. Can't sleep.

I just don't get it. At one point she told me she did not understand why I was annoyed at her. How does she not see that I'm killing myself here, I've been sitting all alone and miserable in this house (that I'd just love to burn to the ground), and I haven't seen any of my friends in weeks. "

5u3545,1,2017-02-14,What to do with 401(k)/savings/investments? Leaving work and going to school full time.,throwaway_leavework,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5u3545/what_to_do_with_401ksavingsinvestments_leaving/,"I need some advice on how to proceed and plan my finances for this year since I am planning on leaving my job and going to school full time. 

**Current situation:**  
•	Age: 28, Computer Engineer.  
•	Income: 90k/yr (pre-tax)  
•	Checking account: 7k (high cash flow since I manage household finances for 3 people)  
•	Emergency + Savings(liquid): 23k  
•	401(k): 40k (4k in Roth 401k and 36k in regular 401k)  
•	Investments: 20k (5k in Lending club and rest in stocks and index funds)  
•	Student loans: 10k(&lt;4% interest so I haven't paid them off and invested instead)  


**Current monthly expenses:**  
     •	Rent + Utilities (gas, electric, water, internet): 1200   
     •	Phone bill : 200 (I pay for my parents as well)  
     •	Car insurance: 100(full coverage 2011 Lexus 50k miles, was bought used on a sweet deal)  
     •	Food (groceries, restaurants, bars): 500 (high because I travel a lot)  
     •	Travel + Gas: 500 + 100 = 600 (gf and parents live on another coast)  
     •	Gym + Haircuts: 100  
     •	Misc (netflix, spotify, audible and other small expenses): 100  
     •	Student loan: 100 (will be deferred once I start school)  
     •	Total: 2900  


**Upcoming financial changes:**  
     •	Business school: 120k over 2 years(possibly 1.5 years till Dec 2018), could go down to 90k if I get more scholarships.  
     •	Income would be limited to an internship which would be a total of about 20-25k(pre-tax) for working 3 months in the Summer of 2018.  

1.	My first question is what should I do with the 401k? Should I use it to pay for the tuition or should I let it ride and take on student loans (~6.5%interest rate)?  
2.	Should I use my savings and only leave emergency fund to pay for school?  
3.	Should I sell all my stock positions and pay for school? Some generate a 2-3% dividend and I have a long position on most investments.  
4.	What happens to my 401k account? I have fidelity currently, do they keep my account once I leave my employer?  

Other notes:  
     •	My monthly expense might not go down by much. Maybe down to 2500. I will have a major lifestyle curb but I am in a city with high expenses. Rent would not change by much. Where can I cut?  
     •	If I need emergency money, I could ask my parents for about 3k-5k.  

Please advise on the best course for a sound financial long term and don’t hesitate to ask for more info if it can be useful in giving advice. Thank you!

I'm an American C#/.NET developer with no degree, about a year and a half of industry experience, and a strong portfolio. I finished about two years of college but dropped out because of the high cost of attending school in the US.
I'd like to find an internship or full time job in Stockholm, Gothenburg, or any other major Swedish city. Which leads me to a few questions...

* Do Swedish companies typically require a bachelor's degree no matter what it is in?
* Has anyone in this sub been in a similar situation?
* What is the job market like for C#/.NET developers?

I'm also interested in applying to the Universities in Sweden to possibly finish my bachelors but I would unfortunately have to pay the full tuition which was my issue here in the US.

* What is the scholarship ecosystem like for American students looking for a bachelor's degree in a computer science related field?

Tack så mycket!"

I won a scholarship that pays basically the tuition of one/two semester(s) at Vanderbilt. This means, however, that I have to pay for housing and meals somehow. Now I tried looking for job opportunities at the uni's website, but I couldn't find anything reassuring.

Do you know if it is possible to work part-time at the uni with a J-1 visa? Also, is it possible to work somewhere else?

I am mostly looking for computer engineering related jobs if possible, I've plenty of experience and I've done european internships already."

I have a problem with social situations, especially when it comes to speaking a group (presentation, meeting etc.) I've been suffering with my anxiety since I was 11. Whole my life I had trouble with school, friends, love, etc. Now I have finished my internship successfully where I had much fears and problems with last year that made me did not complete. At that time I came facing allegations by a psychologist and psychiatrist and I use some medication. The recent months proceeded very well and I never felt so good in my lifetime. To get some extra help, I joined an ADD support group and an additional axiety training. I'm going there with the idea to ​​learn to speak in a group and of course to learn to deal with my anxiety and learn something about ADD. One of my assignments at the training for anxiety is to give a presentation on what I've learned here. But last Monday I went back to school after a training period of 4 to 5 months. I notice that it's really difficult for me and I'm constantly worrying about everything. But now I got an assignment at school to give a lesson to 25 other students and that I have to give a presentation this Friday. It felt like a slap in my face. I can't think about anything else besides that. I can't focus on other school assignments and I'm not able to start a conversation with some classmates. I finally decided to send an email to some teachers to inform additional (they already know from my situation) that I am not able to give a presentation. I'm working to reduce my anxiety, but teaching a full class is a too high step for me. What do you think about it? Someone who recognizes this and has tips for me? Thanks for your time and I look forward to reading what others have to say,"

Myself (25/f) and my boyfriend (25/m) have been together close to two years. 

He moved away and we were LDR until after Christmas when I moved in with him. This is what we had both always wanted as the distance was allowing us only 1.5 days together every 3/4 weeks. Prior to this I had spent a lot of time at his (before my internship based in my hometown) and we were incredibly close. We face time every night when we're apart. 

I was offered a job in his town before Christmas, but freaked out at how serious the relationship had become and the job wasn't really for me. I suffer from anxiety and suffered a bad prolonged spell where I really isolated myself from everyone including him (for the first time in the relationship). We didn't see each other for two months, I turned down the job and he admitted he thought we were going to break up, but as a result he was able to settle in to life in the new city without me there. 

Anyway I recently moved in, but things have evidentially changed. He is always on his phone. Texting a new female friend from work. There are 4 of them in his office. I am happy he has finally made good friends, because he struggled for a year until now, but definitely needed me in his life more then than I feel now. I told him that the constant texting her on top of them spending all day together makes me a bit uncomfortable, but I made it clear that I trust him and I'm not accusing him of anything. He's started a PhD and is extremely busy, it's not like last year when we had more time for each other. We just don't seem to hang out anymore, merely exist together. I miss feeling like absolute best friends. 

I went on two night outs with him over his birthday and met the girl. I felt really uncomfortable, like they were blatantly flirting with each other. They were drawing on each others arms, play fighting, I felt like he was way more interested in talking to her all night than me. I was making the effort to chat to all his friends and not be a burden but something didn't sit right. But equally I think, if something was going on, why would he flaunt it in front of me? 

After those two nights out, he stopped inviting me out when she was there. Saying that I glared and went quiet by the end of the night, but I asked him to please bare in mind this occurred two days after my grandma had passed away as well. He said he wanted independent nights with his friends when I wasn't always there. I do get that, I think I'd be the same if it was the other way around. It just felt weird because I was invited one evening when his two best friends (including her) had bailed. I said no in the end. 

Anyway. I couldn't help it much longer and I searched his phone in the night last week. I saw their texts, nothing explicitly evident of cheating, and I don't think he would as he strong morals about it ( I knew him when he was in an LDR with a woman who lived abroad and he never cheated) However I saw a lot of "";) and :p"" style messages. He told her she was pure muscle in one message. The rest of the time they're constantly checking in on each other, asking how their evenings were and he was offering her comfort and cuddles from him and his other male friend when she was ill. That made me feel sick to see, but maybe I am being too possessive. 

But, just my luck. He catches me on his phone. Absolutely mortified I apologise prolifically but explain I'm feeling extremely insecure and what to know what's going on. We argue until the early morning. He said he's feeling trapped, and responsible for my happiness while I'm living there, and was preparing to ask me to leave at the end of my course for him to have time and space to think about what he wants. To this I responded by packing my bags, and saying if he couldn't decide I would make the decision for him, break up and leave. He then cried and told me I was the love of his life, he had never felt this way for someone before and didn't want to make a mistake as a result of a quarter life crisis. 

However, he asked for a break in the relationship, and I asked if this meant we were unfaithful and he didn't dispute it. I made it clear that there was no way I was agreeing to this. To me that is a break up and I would only accept a faithful break if he wanted to try things after time apart. He finally said ok. The next day I was again ready to leave but he said he didn't want to sacrifice what we had and wanted to see what some time and space did for us, so I stayed until the end of the module but then left early Saturday. He was shocked by this, saying I was welcome to stay the rest of the weekend. He expected me to just go for the weekend but I have left for 1.5 weeks in total. When he found this out he hugged me super tight and said nooo, text me when you're gone, but I'll see you soon! He smokes a couple of joints in the evening. When he is high he is more affectionate. When he isn't he is more hostile. 

Since I have been home I have been suffering but also trying to act strong. Three days have passed and today he text me saying how much he misses me, how sorry he is, he doesn't know where his head was at last week and that he loves me. He has text me as though nothing ever happened. I wonder if he just wants to brush it all under the carpet. Now he's decided he wants to work on the relationship too, maybe we can fix things. 

I'm just really confused. What has happened here, what do I do? I need to return to his town to finish a qualification I am studying there  week. I love him, and can't imagine my life without him, but I'm finding it hard to forgive the fact that he basically asked for an unfaithful break. 

TLDR: moved in with boyfriend, suspicious of his close relationship with female friend, searched his phone, got caught doing so, he asked for a break, now is apologising and wants me back

Much of my homework is done online and I LOVE the efficiency of using a two-monitor setup. It is, however, not very practical for gaming. My PC build is almost ready to be assembled and I plan on playing a mix of FPS / RTS games come this summer (assuming I don't land an internship).

Should I invest in one high quality monitor (27""-32""), or settle for two to three lower quality monitors (24"")?
Any advice is appreciated, thank you!

5u5e2r,3,2017-02-14,[M4F] - A Week in the Life of an Intern,joecalla,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5u5e2r/m4f_a_week_in_the_life_of_an_intern/,"**Monday**  
I pondered, on the way to your office Monday afternoon, what would make you summon me. I think ""summon"" is the right word when an executive requests the immediate presence of a lowly intern without warning. It was only my third week, and I needed to check the wall map outside the elevators to even find your office.

I couldn't guess what you wanted when you closed the door behind me. I didn't take the hint when you told me to sit in your chair, or when you looked into my blue-grey eyes with amused certainty. I thought, somehow, that it was  some embarrassing mistake when you sat on the edge of the desk and shifted so that I could clearly see your red panties peaking out beneath the hem of your black pencil skirt.. I was innocent, far too innocent, 96 hours ago.

It was thirty minutes later when, on the way back down in the elevator, I finally began to process what had happened. I could still taste your cum on my lips, could still feel your fingers pulling at my short hair as you held my mouth to your pink womanhood. I had to check my watch to realize how long it had been, my sense of time and space lost as I tongued and sucked on your pussy until, with a playful shove at my forehead, you instructed me to get back to my desk.

**Tuesday**  
My Tuesday passed in tense silence as I sat at my desk and struggled to concentrate on my work. Thoughts of you kept intruding on my efforts at a comprehensive competitive analysis of my assigned market segment, until at 6PM I finally gave up on the thought of you calling me back to your office. *Was it all a dream?* I wondered to myself, until my phone buzzed on the way to the elevator. Five minutes later I was in your office, gritting my teeth to avoid withering under your intimidating gaze.

I couldn't say ""no"" to you,  and not just because of your position at the company. It was the look in your eyes. At your command, I withdrew my hard-on, solid and throbbing with the energy of youth. You looked on with an amused smirk as I stroked myself in front of you, fingers curling around turgid flesh slick with pre-cum, until I came on command onto the shiny hardwood of your desk. And then you sent me on my way, as though I'd delivered a report on the Asian markets that you wouldn't have time to review until tomorrow.

**Wednesday**  
There was no waiting on Wednesday; you were in my office when I arrived at work. I'd come in early to get some work done, to lay low, but you were there. Like you knew my schedule before I did.

I could see the confidence in your gaze as you lifted your dress up above your waist and leaned over my desk, your bare ass framed by a pair of garters. I could hear that confidence in your voice when told me to get to work. Ashamed as I might have been to admit it, I'd been aching to taste you again since Monday, and I moaned in pleasure as my tongue slid through your sex from behind. I remember the bemused look in your eye a moment later when you looked back at me and shook your head disapprovingly. You didn't correct me with words, simply pulled my face into your ass and pressed my lips to your tight anus.

I licked until you moaned, until I felt your ass hole clench around my probing tongue as you came. I tried to pull back then, but you explained with word and body that I wasn’t done, that I wasn't to stop rimming my boss' boss' boss until I was told to stop.

It wasn't even 9AM when you left me, somehow looking put together while my cheeks were red and coated in the juices you'd made me lick from your thighs when I was done.

**Thursday**  
Thursday's lunch-time lesson was a new one; you called it a ""reward"" for my good service the day before. I got no work done all afternoon, not with the picture of your eyes smiling up at me as your lips were wrapped around my manhood. I came hard, harder than any other time I remember, until drops of cum dripped from the corners of your smiling mouth and my balls ached with emptiness.

I felt suspicion from everyone on your floor as I returned to my office downstairs, as though they could all tell I'd just been blown by the Marketing VP.

**Friday**  
And now it's Friday, 6PM. The elevator beeps as it arrives on 24, your floor. The office is quiet now, late on a Friday. Only a few unrecognized stragglers spot me as I make my way to your office, and I can almost see them forgetting me as they pass me in the hall, their minds focused on tonight's plan or this weekend's upcoming adventure. My mind can't even focus that far out.

I knock on your door, and hear a ""Come in, Josh,"" from within in a voice that's still not particularly familiar; we haven't spent a lot of time talking so far.

I take a deep breath, reach for the knob, reach down instead and adjust my hard-on to make my arousal less obvious, then take the knob and push open the door.

5u5rh4,9,2017-02-15,Are you queer and living in New Farm?,drinks-coopers,brisbane,https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/5u5rh4/are_you_queer_and_living_in_new_farm/,"Hi all,

I intern at 4zzz 102.1fm and help out in their newsroom. I'm a producing a a story for one of their programs and I'm looking for someone queer and living in New Farm who would be willing to be interviewed for radio (not live on air). The story is about the history and future of New Farm's queer community. I've already talked to quite a few people who have told me about New Farm's place as a safe space for queer folk and I'm hoping to find someone who moved in for that reason. 

If you're not queer or living there yourself but you know someone who is willing and ready for a chat, feel free to pass on their details to me with a PM.

Also if you used to live in New Farm, but moved out because of how the suburb has changed over the years, I'd love to talk to you too.

If you're keen, you can PM me for more details."
5u5x1t,43,2017-02-15,"[Massive Spoilers for all 3 games] I'm sure you all have had a million posts like this one, but I just finished my first (complete) run of the entire series, spending 50-70 hours in each game, and I wanted to write my thoughts about the series and it's ending.",le_sweetie_man,masseffect,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/5u5x1t/massive_spoilers_for_all_3_games_im_sure_you_all/,"First of all- what a ride. I've always been a SciFi nerd, but spending this much time in this universe was truly a great experience. I want nothing more than to jump into Andromeda as soon as possible, and hope that Bioware manages to learn from the major mistakes of the series.

I think if I had to pick a favorite entry into the series, it would have to be ME1. This isn't because ME1 does things particularly well- in fact, I'd argue that ME2 &amp; ME3 blow it out of the water in regards to character interaction and story immersion, but goddamn does ME1 do a great job of creating a universe. ME1 feels massive, the areas feel explore-able and interactive, and the characters have a certain layer of maturity about them that is lost in the sequels, oddly enough. The simple narrative involving Saren, the discover of the reaper threat, and the ultimate plan unraveling is a great experience, and the small scale of most of the encounters made you feel like a small team making a huge difference. I thought that while ME1 was a little rough around the edges, it was overall perhaps the most succinct and cohesive entry into the series, wasting no time on things that it didn't find important and delving deeply into the things it found interesting. Each area had a multifaceted story, each character had motivation and took believable actions, and the general narrative maturity went a long way to helping me feel as if I was taking a real role in this world. To give an example- I could never imagine ME2 or 3 giving me the option to non-lethally gas indoctrinated colonists, or to tell a squadmate they were way out of line when expressing their racist views to me, nor would I imagine ME2 or 3 would ever give me so many ways to get a damn garage pass. The dungeon-crawling influence of some of the areas, the general openness of objectives, and the narrative subtlety made me fall in love with this game from the get go. 

In ME1, I picked Liara as my love interest, because Ashley was a racist and Liara had cool mind melding stuff, plus seemed very intelligent and goodhearted. I saved the council, because come on, we have to do our best to ensure galactic stability and peace, no matter how often we aren't believed, and I picked Anderson for the councilor role. I saved Wrex, managed to get Saren to shoot himself, and saved the Rachni Queen. 

I initially quite disliked ME2. The new focus on faster paced narrative and faster paced gameplay was incredibly jarring with only a day between playing it and the prior entry in the series, and I was pissed that I couldn't *instantly* tell Cerberus to fuck right off- instead, I had to go along with them for the entire game, only getting to *finally* tell them to fuck off at the end- this was tough immersion wise, because every time Miranda or the Illusive Man would talk about how Cerberus ""is getting results"" or whatever, I wanted to tell Miranda to get off the ship and hang up on the illusive man, ME1 council wise. Once I got over this new, darker (to a fault, in my opinion) tone and greater focus on linear narrative, I started to have a lot of fun. Overall, ME2 has the weakest plot by far out of the games- its a shoestring of ""lets kill the collectors!"" without anyone really stopping to ask how, or why, or what, is even really going on. Hell, some characters join up with you without even knowing what the hell you're even doing. But, with the exception of Miranda and Zaeed, who were infuriating and who I kind of wish I'd let die, I liked every member of the cast in ME2, and while Liara's absence was missed, it was made up for in the DLC. That DLC added a lot of much needed heart into this oftentimes exhausting dour game. But where ME2 excelled were the characters. It was so fun to do everyone's loyalty missions and get to know them better. I found myself LOVING Legion- he was such a great addition to the game I wish we'd had more time with him. Garrus also rose into his own as a character in this game, becoming really great to have around, whether he was quipping or just being the best damn space buddy ever. Tali, of course, also was great. I missed Wrex, but I suppose I understand his omission, although Grunt didn't have a great arc in comparison. 

But the suicide mission- an ambitious and FANTASTIC finale. Bioware NAILED the ending of ME2, and I'm so glad I got to play it. Smart play was rewarded, and the tension was so high- the majority of the game is spent getting to know these characters, only for them to be snuffed out permanently, in an instant, if you fucked up somewhere down the line. I can't say anything about this mission that hasn't already been said, but pretty flawless from beginning to end, although the whole ""human reaper"" thing was a little odd. And dumb. Overall, edge of my seat fun for a solid hour of pure cinematic bliss. 

I managed to save the crew and get through the suicide mission with everyone alive, but I'll admit, the only reason I knew that I needed to upgrade the ship was because of something I'd read years earlier. I'm glad I did, though- I think the ship upgrades weren't emphasized enough in ME2, given how important they actually were.

I stuck out my romance with Liara via shadow broker DLC, which was really great, and that had some cool emotional moments between Shep and Liara. I assigned Tali to the vents and Samara to the bubble, as well as Garrus as the fire-team leader. As I said, everyone lived. Overall, ME2 was narratively weak but made up for this with some great character building and squad moments, along with some of the better story DLCs. Killing mercs got a little old, so did the orange and red everywhere and the dour tone, but that ending and the loyalty missions really made this game something special. 

Fast forward to ME3- and goddamn, did this game take that ""linear narrative"" to the extreme. Gone forever are the minute dialogue choices of ME1 and 2, gone forever is any real semblance of exploration, and gone forever are any real moral grey areas- but my initial distaste for this change was at least partially made up for when I realized that Bioware had not taken this choice lightly. While there is now significantly less choice in all facets, and significantly less interaction, there is now a plethora of laser-focused content that delivered the tone of ""galaxy at war"" almost perfectly. This game, from beginning to end, is a non stop ASSAULT of misery, but yet manged to have some breathing room sprinkled in there as well, especially with all the DLC (God I fucking adored Citadel, the best part of any mass effect game IMO). 

Liara was oddly stoic, and I guess she lost her sense of humor when she lost her homeworld (bazinga), and that aspect of my Shepard kind of fizzled out- Liara was just so stony and nonpersonal in this game that I started to question why I'd romanced her in the first place, although some moments (namely in Citadel DLC) reminded me. Some character kinks aside, though, and ME3 knocked the tone out of the park. Getting the Geth and Quarians to cooperate, feeling the Galaxy at the bring of complete annihilation, and doing your best to unify rather than to destroy gave this game an incredibly punch, that to me, was also enhanced by the current political climate in the US (I know, I know, but that was just me). I adored this aspect of the game, and seeing my war assets skyrocket after forging a new alliance made me feel a little bit better about my chances against the reapers. 

I can't praise Citadel enough, my favorite few hours of my entire playthrough by far, and I also can't praise the way the game made you feel truly immersed in this conflict enough. I can say I was disappointed there was generally less dialogue to be had with your squad, as well as significantly less dialogue in general, but I think the direction was fine, ultimately, and still led to a great game that really pulled no punches when it came to big moments of success and loss. 

Legion :(

The ending, though. I have mixed feelings. Fighting through the gray streets of earth against impossible odds? They nailed that entire sequence. I truly felt suffocated, stressed, and like I was the last hope for the galaxy. The moment when you run for the beam- everything I could have hoped for. When that truck flipped over and I audibly gasped, praying it wouldn't kill Liara and Garrus only steps behind, I truly knew this was one of my favorite game series of all time. Saying goodbye to Liara and Garrus at the end was such a great character moment, and I like how Bioware knew players were going to bring their favorite squad-mates with them- raising the stakes of that moment and making that moment much more emotionally impactful for your playthrough. As I left them to escape, safe and sound, and I ran for the beam alone- I had chills.

The catalyst, though, was disappointing. I wanted to talk more to the starchild- I wanted to explore what each option meant, how it would work, and how it would affect the galaxy- in *detailed terms*. I've just spent countless hours in your universe, Bioware- let me talk to you about it. I didn't feel as if I had a strong idea of what the control or synthesis endings really meant, and I wanted my Shepard to ask questions upon questions about them, but I couldn't. And the explanation for the reapers was... iffy, at best. I ultimately chose synthesis- it seemed like the choice that would be best for all forms of life (although that was halfway a gamble because the starchild explained jack shit) and that's what I went with. 

The choice to give everyone green eyes and circuitboard skin was probably the worst creative choice made in the entire series. Aside from looking ridiculous and distracting, it also made no sense- since when does the helix structure of my DNA changing give me circuitboard skin? My choice was to preserve the characters I loved, allow them to live on in a better future, and ensure a permanent solution to the reaper problem- but what I got was making everyone look like borg. This was a blatantly lazy choice, and there were a million ways bioware could have done that better. The extended cut DLC didn't really help much, either. Cosmetic choices aside, though, the ending still felt quite rushed. You can't tie up 200 hours of gameplay with 5 minutes of slideshows- you just can't. 

So there are my long and disorganized thoughts on the series. I didn't write down everything, but those are the main things I've come away with. A fantastic trilogy of great games, all with different strengths, that came together to create an amazing SciFi world, and the weird piece of fanfiction some intern apparently tacked onto the end known as the ending. I can't say I'm not disappointed by the ending, but looking back, I have experienced a great series and hope Bioware can craft an even more amazing game with Andromeda. 

Thanks for reading, guys. Would love to hear any thoughts on your own playthroughs."
5u6fd4,2,2017-02-15,Some thoughts on Valentine's Day regarding my depression and the break-up with my Ex.,throwaway28905950,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5u6fd4/some_thoughts_on_valentines_day_regarding_my/,"While I am focusing purely on my own situation here, as a form of catharsis, I hope that perhaps some of you are able to relate to these thoughts and feelings. 

I've suffered from severe depression since I was 15, and not long after moving abroad in July, my ex broke up with me due to the stress of maintaining our relationship. What has followed has been an emotional rollercoaster, and I nearly committing suicide due to psychological effect that the break-up had on me.

5 months on, and seeing that love is in the air around Valentine's, I'm reminded that fundamentally, coping with depression (particularly in a situation like this) is a process, and one that takes a lot of time. It feels like you're taking two steps forward, then getting your teeth kicked down your throat. I had my first date in months last week, and unfortunately the person said that it would be best if we stayed friends. I also found out that my Ex had a new partner, and even 5 months on, that felt extremely raw and I had a good cry to myself at home. 

A day later, my workmates invited to me watch a game of cricket and I also found out that I might potentially have an internship lined up for me in the Summer. I don't really feel ""happy"", but I feel less shit, and I know that you have to roll with the punches and it really matters not so much what happens, but how many times you can get kicked in the teeth but still keep going. 

I've also learned that you're never alone in this world. Not really anyway. I've had friends that I haven't spoken to in months come out of the woodwork and support me. I'm also relatively open about my mental illness and I've found that once people realise that you are, it encourages them to either open up to you about their own issues, or simply to encourage and offer you support. Even if that person is on the internet in some forum, or if its on Tinder, or if it's the cashier at your local supermarket, you'll be surprised at what others are going through. We've all got to care for one another in this world. It's just that people don't want to admit it at first. 

Happy Valentine's Day everyone! Even if it's just ordering a take away, or going for a walk, or rewatching a favourite movie, do something special. Because you are special, all of you. "
5u6kn6,3,2017-02-15,"Me [27 M] not desperate enough, but not content enough to stay idle...",silentphotographer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5u6kn6/me_27_m_not_desperate_enough_but_not_content/,"TL;DR : I'm an average short guy who has few friends with only few modest aspirations with outrageously high standard (looks, mindsets, etc). I don't think dating down would work, but unless I become a millionaire (even then, physical limitation remains) and time is ticking. I don't get nervous when I talk to guys and girls, but I die in the inside when I ask someone out for a date. I have plenty of ways to keep busy so I'm not desperate but I feel like I'm procrastinating and that ends badly in my scenarios coming from a college student. I lack confidence (in life, not talking to girls) and I feel like I have too many frontiers for me to commit to someone atm. 


This is long version with contexts:


-------------------------------------------------------------
 

I'm 27, 5""4, 150 lbs, glass-wearng guy living in Canada. I was a typical above avg biut not exceptional kid academically in high school and spent much of my time with video games and studies rather than socializing much. I got invited to events and birthday parties, but I fell out socially after I graduated and moved on to college. 

I got an internship in college after my 1st semester (managed to hang out with couple of cool dudes) but I left college to do internship and ended up working overseas for a bit. Most of the peers were much older than me, so it was just work+internet streaming/games rinse and repeat. 

Now I'm back in Canada and trying my luck again by majoring in IT field. I made few friends (chosen to be more specific; I respect them for their intelligence/solid habits/humor... and they will be a nice network to have, and if we get along as friends... a bonus). It's hard to find girls as most of the people in my class are guys. There are few girls but almost of them are not just stunning enough or lack other qualities (most of them barely get by in class) that gets my attention. Competence is what I have a thing for, I guess.


Now that I'm starting to picture what life is after things settle down, I often think about why I have had shitty luck with romance yet. It's fairly easy; I'm an average joe (I consider myself as a 6.5 so realistically we're talking around 5 lol), my social life sucks as I just study, work (it's tutoring mostly so it'd be illegal for me to date few students who are cute welp not to mention terrible professionalism) and end up streaming videos/reading articles on web on the side. I try to do things that will benefit me, so I tend to not be in clubs/volunteering. Recently, I'm practicing/playing with stock market, which also lets me by the laptop with few group of people to chat online with.

What I have a thing for is competence, regardless of what it may be. Maybe she aspires to look like a Goddess so she scores 9-10+ in terms of looks. But it could be other things like a girl who is 7-.5-8 but has a serious aspiration like I do she has a lot of cool things going on with her life that makes me wanna hang out with her, romantically or platonic-wise. I find confidence and competence to be valuable currency that rarely inflates. As looks are probably out of options, I try to a competent person myself. I have quirky humor that my friends find amusing, but it's mostly insider joke.

Statically, it seems like asking a girl out is suicidal. At my age, if a girl is that accomplished and/or pretty enough to turn heads, there is a pretty good chance that some other guy spotted on earlier and already claimed her (Found out that 2 girls I fancied in college so far had boyfriends). If that stat isn't bad enough, my avg/below look and short height seems to bring my stat even lower. And even if I can get away with that somehow, I'm not very interesting. I fell in love with computers, stocks market and drawing (with actual skills not just doodling), but it's more of a hobby on a solo mode. I'm not that charismatic about regular life stuff (except for cooking which I'm fairly good at). Career and comfy life is the only thing that gets me going so I probably won't compromise my busy schedule for an uncertain factor. It'd be tough to balance my schedule and find a time to socialize and have good quality time with my potential girlfriend who is already hot/fun enough to have her suitors lined up. It seems unfair and illogical that a girl would date someone like me. Hell, if I was a girl I'd take second thoughts before even glancing at me tbh.


I thought hey, maybe I'll start dating in earnest when I have my life figured out. But it seems like what one might do when working on the assignment. It looks a little hard, so I'll do it later. I feel like I'm being a coward and procrastinating. Older you get, the harder dating life is I presume.


It's got so bad to the point where I'm even thinking about going on with mail bride strategy. I know, I didn't even dream of going to that route but maybe it makes sense for me? I'd be ahead of the typical competition (I won't wait till I'm old enough to be her dad, I should be financially stable enough to invest some money and time (albeit with caution... filter out scams first), most of them should be all set with looks at least (not a guarantee but favor the odds my way), screen out for people with good English (no communication, no chemistry), try to get to know them so that it's not purely trophy-wife/visa pump&amp;dump ordeal, and I'd be opening up a new world for a pretty girl who can bring out more out of her potential. Nothing is guaranteed in life but this seems like better odds (like you're the house in casino) compared to the former ordeal of meeting someone way out of my league locally.


I may have to accept the fact that I'll die alone (that's the catch of living in a free society welp. You have a right to choose what u want in life just as everyone else does) but I'm trying to see if I can avoid such fate. I'll try to bite the bullet and try asking out to few girls who click with me, but when u are poorly prepped and just go with the guts without assessing your odds like in the stock market, you die in flames every time. Many of the pretty girls I fall for tend to be in work/same class, etc... so social consequence is there as opposed to just asking a total stranger out. It's hard for me to ask out a total stranger cause even if they may be pretty, I don't know anything about them. Also, I have terribly lack of experience with sex, so that's also another thing that's holding me back. Sex is like any other field; it takes a lot of practice and experience before u can really enjoy and appreciate it. 


I'm sure I'm not the only one like that. I talk to girls easily when it's work-related, school-related or just hanging out for the lolz. I just end up being a useless potato when I jump from casually knowing them to potential romantic interests. Just interested in what I could do better, or maybe stories where they started similar like me but nice twist that finally broke the curse and ended up with a happy ending... I donno. Just spilled my POV and hoping to strike some cool replies thnx"
5u7k7a,41,2017-02-15,Spooky Suit's interest in Emily,DoctorGarbanzo,questionablecontent,https://www.reddit.com/r/questionablecontent/comments/5u7k7a/spooky_suits_interest_in_emily/,"I recently reread some of the earlier strips where we first met Emily (as an intern at the library).  There was a strip (I don't know the number, and my heartfelt gratitude to whomever figures it out and posts it) where Emily stated something about one of her school projects being shut down and confiscated by the government.  Specifically, she said it was something about getting Sattellites talking to each other.  I think there was also a rather ominous threat to her family's livelyhood if she spoke about it.

(speculation follows)
What if Emily's project is what kickstarted Spooky Suit's existence?  An AI borne out of the collective computing power of the communication system for the entire world.  It would certainly explain why she (yes, Spooky just strikes me as a ""she"") was privy to Station's communications.  She didn't tap into the communication system... she IS the communication system.


And certainly would explain her being immediately aware of Emily's existance and her abilities to handle the AI brain interface thingy.  Hell, it was probably custom made FOR Emily (the cartoonishly obvious symbolism of the user interface).  Suit probably considers any new technologies that Emily develops/discovers would greatly advance her own agenda.

As long distance partners, we haven’t seen each other much lately because we’re both busy and limited by transportation. We spend hours in call most days, though, with or without talking, and it doesn’t feel like any obligation to be around for each other like that. We’re quite serious, and have shared intentions to stay together indefinitely. 


We’d talk about wanting to live together in the foreseeable future, and it seems like we’re going to try this summer. I’ve accepted an internship offer and he’s looking into sources of income in the area. The place is about a 4-hour drive from our shared home town, and we initially wouldn’t know anyone but each other there. Optimally, we’d get a small, 1-bedroom apartment together. We are on the same page about everything so far, so this isn’t a conflict-solving situation.


**I was mostly looking for advice on how to prepare for living together in this situation.** It’ll be the first time either of us have really lived with others (because, although we have dorm-mates in college, we don’t interact with them much). **Here are a few questions I have:**

What kinds of ground rules may we want to establish? 

When discussing the finances behind living together, what should we be thinking about? 

What do we need to be prepared to contend with that isn’t as present in a long distance relationship?

Are there any things we should actively avoid?


I’m open to any advice to guide the discussion we’re certainly going to have prior to making further decisions about the situation, as well as things that we should consider individually.


Thank you!"

Ben Affleck is not leaving nor has there been any goddam talks about it for even a second. Now please let me do my thing and stop spamming my inbox its a genuine request.
If anything try to think of it logically. Do you really think 2 movies in, he would consider leaving? Maybe after Live by Night he would have contemplated giving up but he now needs that financial success of JL and Batman more than anything. For the last freaking time, there has not been talks nor is he thinking about it. When someone says they got from 3 seperate sources ""connected in some way"" to WB telling them the same thing, you dont think they would add fuel to to fire by all these recent reports trashing Dc following Bens resignation from directing Batman. These supposed insiders wont be exposed only Campea will. He didnt want this info to get out but its not even info. Ben is staying unless JL fails. Then it woudnt be unrealistic to think he would consider leaving. Not as a report but just common sense. Big Star, reputation will go, he cant make his other passion projects occupied with this etc.
SOrry for the long post but in the end Ben is not leaving. Now if you still do not believe my intern story then thats another topic just dont bother with me. Sorry again and i hope i stop cheesing you with my posts.

BTW i watched JL Dark and lots of animates series. You guys are good :)

EDIT: You can doubt me go ahead. Im tired of listening to this now. Im gone from here. We ll wait and see what happens"

It caused me to lose my paid internship but I finished school. The illness got worse and my ability to bare children was put on the line along with my general health. At the time my parents insurance no longer covered me and I was left on my own. I applied for insurance and soon returned to the doctors to get better. Because my illness is not well own it left me with costly bills and doctors visits to get better. As a recent graduate work was not avaliable and I was unemployed for about a year and with all these bills and my desire to get better I began to make mistakes. I started borrowing money to get better. I relied on family people I thought would be understanding. I soon began working in my field and thought I would pay everyone off and be on track. But again my illness took that away. I was let go and used as a consultant instead of a full time employee. The unsteady paycheck and costly medical treatment left me in a worse situation. Now I have my borrowers hounding me down. One is particular is becoming threatening and I'm getting really worried. I'm scared my loved ones will be affected. I recently started a new job and I was hoping this would help but I need time to get to a point of getting paid but that won't be for a few more weeks. I'm hoping to borrow the money owed to buy time to execute my plan and be at a better place with this new job. I want to get her off my back and move forward in a new place. My desperation clouded my judgement and the love I thought existing between us gave me a false idea of money between people. I need 3500 to get her off my back. Hoping someone can help me and guide me out of this hole.

The competition is strong and candidates have accomplished far more then I ever had at their age. That said, here are my observations and recommendations as a lab manager in academic research. 

Demonstrated research experience is key. I'm mostly looking at 3rd years, and already they have 2-3 research experiences. While you are at school do whatever you can to take advantage of opportunities working in labs or with your professors. If you can't find a summer internship, offer to volunteer. 


Develop hard skills in statistics, modeling, data analysis.  I can teach you how to perform a laboratory task, or how to carry out field work. It's much harder to teach somebody how to manage data and code. If you can demonstrate that those are your strengths then you will stand out.

Have a GPA of 3.4 or higher. Sorry but, there is so much competition that I gloss over applicants with resumes of 3.2 and toss any less than 3. 

Have a professional resume, and an enthusiastic concise letter of interest.  It's easy to toss a resume for being sloppy, and long winded letters will lose my interest. In the letter be enthusiastic, clearly state what you want to do, and play up your strengths. Also, it's good to demonstrate that you are busy, but I don't care about your work experience in retail.


Hope that rant helps someone.

DH and I are officially starting to try in August. We got married last year in August, and want to get to our 1 year anniversary before we start trying :)

So, DH's brother's fiancé (soon to be SIL) is making having kids a competition. They have been together for 8 years, and we have been together 2. They're getting married in September and are planning on a honeymoon baby.

Anyway, this all started on Christmas last year. My mom was cooing over a baby, and I accidentally let it slip that she wouldn't have to wait much longer as we were starting to try in August. My bad, total accident. BIL overheard and went crazy. He said things like, ""We let you guys get married first, we are having kids first!"" and, ""8 years trumps 2, so we're having kids first!"" I just rolled my eyes and told him that he was not in charge of my uterus!!

Family stood up for us and said it will happen when it happens for both couples. Things died down and I let it go. 

Then, on NYE, SIL decided to sit down and have a conversation with me. Now, I really love her. We are good friends and hangout often. But when she started talking I wanted to pull my hair out! She started asking about my plans with school, which I am in full time. It's a 3 year program. If we get pregnant when planned, I will be in my second year while pregnant and have the baby the summer before a paid internship that would start in September. 

Anyway, she asked about it and I told her. She said, ""So you'll get a house, graduate, get a job, and THEN babies!"" I just smiled and looked at her. I was cringing deeply inside.

The thing is, it's really starting to affect me. I have anxiety and the baby rabies has been amped up since this has been happening. I want to enjoy the process and not obsess, but a tiny petty part of me wants to get pregnant just to spite them, you know? It would make not getting pregnant right away that much more of a disappointment, like we have to hurry up because they're trying too. I know that the chances of getting pregnant right away are slim. I know that I shouldn't care about them and live my life. I mean, we're talking about a MONTH here!

It's ridiculous and I know this. The anxiety makes it that way. I wish I could have a normal experience of trying instead of this, so I'm talking it through in therapy. But talk about annoying! 

Thanks for letting me rant!"

We've got a bad case of the clap, and it needs to be treated before it's too late.

* The title is determined by popular vote within the community
* The title must be earned by the one that makes the funniest contributions to the show throughout the year

In the long-term, I think this would be best for everyone. It could serve to incentivize unique and interesting contributions to the show, tone down the mental health/existential crisis olympics, and most importantly, free us from the compulsory stranglehold that's imposed upon us by the unfunny.

The power is in your hands. What pill will you choose? The red? The blue? The rainbow? Unfortunately, it might be time to swallow that red pill, people. Just don't swallow three, or Mike Thernovitch will appear in your bed and sexually assault your girlfriend.

I'm sure you all are getting sick of these questions, but you should know that I'm really appreciative for any advice that you all can provide. 

I'm a 1L (top 1/3) who had a really successful interview with a Superior Court judge this past week. This was meant to be my back-up plan, but it ended up being the first place to call back. I'm going to hear back from them early next week and I understand that you generally shouldn't turn down offers from judges for fear of harming your/your school's reputation.

However, I've got an interview late next week with the the General Counsel's Office of a major federal government agency that I'm really really interested in. The problem is that I'll have heard back from the Judge by that point and I likely won't hear back from the agency for at least a week after the interview.

So how do I navigate this? Should I remove my name from consideration and shoot for the internship that I really want? Or should I settle for the one that I suspect that I'll get with the Judge (though again, I've not officially received an offer yet). For someone looking at IP law like me, the government agency would be exponentially better, but I suspect more competitive. 

Help!

They all were either only looking for undergrads or weren't looking for human resource interns at all.  I was kinda disheartened, but I talked to a couple people in the business school who kinda gave me an idea of where to go from here.  

Good news of the day though...  The maintenance guy came and replaced our fan, and he said our place looks way better, and we almost certainly won't be evicted.  Which is awesome.  Still have to finish cleaning out the second bedroom and clean the carpets, but we're most likely not going to be homeless in a couple weeks.

I found out I'm still being considered for the hr internship from Boeing.  I would really love to get it... The commute would suck, but they're an excellent company to intern with.  I applied for it a couple years ago when I was graduating with my bachelor's and found out pretty quickly that I didn't get it.  The closing date was in October, so basically I've been waiting 4 months to hear anything.

I'm at school now.  I'm going to try to talk C into having paneer curry tonight for dinner.  Then I have to do some homework, and I have to try to tackle my storage issues and finish getting stuff out of my second bedroom.  I need to box stuff up for Goodwill too.  After that, I should just have to vacuum the second bedroom and clean the carpet before our inspection Monday.

Anyway, how are you guys?"

Hi Section Editor,

My name is Julio Cesar, I'm a reporter based at the El Paso/Juarez border.

I'd like to write a story for you about life on the border fence. As the new president calls for a wall to be built between the US and Mexico, opinions and perceptions across the country vary, but it is here, on the border, where they are most complicated. People I've spoken to on both sides say the fence has been a mixed blessing and has helped push crime out of urban areas into the rural outskirts, where the fence ends, but they fear a continuous wall would bring crime back to their neighborhoods. I believe an article would be able to explore this complex relationship people on both sides of the fence have with the current and possible future barrier between our countries. I would cover this story by interviewing people in the US and Mexico (I am perfectly bilingual) who live and work next to the fence itself to see how life was before, how it has changed, and what they think would happen with a cement border wall.

I have been a reporter with KVIA, the local ABC affiliate for two years now and have concentrated on covering border issues after spending most of my internship shadowing Angela Kocherga, the Gannett Border Bureau Chief. I've covered separated families hugging  on the border for the first time in years, the rise of American medical tourism in Mexico, and how Americans in Mexico were eager and planning to vote in the 2016 election. (Each claim has a link)

Please let me know if you would be interested in getting a story about life on the border fence or any other piece of border issue coverage,

My name and number

Final Fantasy II Banner - Feb 17,DefiantHermit,FFBraveExvius,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/5ubg1l/defianthermits_should_you_pull_final_fantasy_ii/,"Hey guys and gals, it's /u/DefiantHermit here once again with a slightly early SYP. I've started my internship on a great engineering company and while I'm loving the work there, I got a bit less extra time during weekdays. However, since I really enjoy doing these, I'll always try to find some time to make them, without (hopefully) any quality loss. You'll just be seeing a bit less of me on the comments, but I'll make sure to answer all of them eventually!

If you have any corrections, suggestions or just have a question about a unit, please do let me know and I'll be happy to help!

Without further ado, here's my analysis on the Final Fantasy II banner.


________________________________________

**[Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/422)**

**Rarity:** 5* to 6*

**Global Party Rating:** 9/10 

The first character on the line up is this banner's 5* base, which is a.... mage! And while Emperor is a very good one, we'll be comparing him to our beloved Mr. Tree (Exdeath) and Ms. Whip (Majin Fina) throughout the analysis to see how he fares. So.. let's start with stats! 

He comes with base **149 MAG** (+34 with pots) and has that great **+30% MAG** passive, culminating into a total of **237 MAG**. All our three contenders share the MAG passive and have about the same base MAG stat, so no one really stands out here as they're all equally strong.

Emperor's equipment choice is fairly straightforward for a mage: rods, staves, robes, clothes and hats. No shield slot for that stellar shield, but being able to wear robes certainly gives him an edge over Exdeath.

Now, for the main course, what skills does Emperor have and are they any good? To start off, his spells: He has the standard **-aga elemental trio** (Fire, Ice and Thunder), with the addition of **Aeroga** for some extra coverage. He also comes with a built-in **Flare** (230% ST 1 Hit Fire Magic Attack &amp; ST 3 Turn -30% Water Resist), which is only really great if you have someone to abuse the Water debuff (basically Mercedes' Axe at this point on Global).

For abilities, Emperor has a varied offensive and defensive/support set. The support set is as follows: **I will not die** (Recover 10% MP per Turn), which is a significantly better Auto-Refresh; **Impertinent Fools** (Decrease Target Chance 1.75x) as a fantastic built-in Camouflage; **Rule** (AoE 5 Turn -40% SPR Debuff &amp; Self 5 Turn +60% SPR) as a very limited, albeit powerful mage break; **Give your offerings** (ST 50% Target HP Damage &amp; Self 100 MP Recovery) as worse Osmose as it can't be dual cast and **Reign** (Self 5 Turn +100% MAG &amp; AoE 5 Turn -20% SPR Debuff for your own team) as a significant MAG boost for a solid duration.

While the support set is pretty varied, the offensive set is more concise, but still extremely robust: **Hellfire** (200% ST 1 Hit Fire Magic Attack + 200% Each Use (Max: 10)) is a very strong single target hit for long battles, capping at an absurd **2000%** modifier; good ol' **Dual Black Magic** for elemental chains and **Starfall** (230% AoE 1 Hit Magic Attack + Ignore -50% SPR - normalized to **460%**) as a pretty good nuke. All these are complimented by a great LB: 270% to 390% (depending on rank) AoE 7 Hit Wind Magic Attack &amp; AoE 3 Turn -25% to -49% All Elements Resist.

So.. with all that out of the way, how much better, if at all, is his set compared to Tree and Whip? Ultimately, I'd say they're very comparable and very close, with each character having a slight edge on some front. One thing's for sure: Emperor's support set is leagues better than the other two. He has less chance to be targeted, has a better refresh, can break SPR while also buffing your party's SPR and can buff his MAG to stupid levels (it gives him extra 130 MAG over the other two for 5 turns if they also have Focus on, and 183 if they don't). He technically loses a bit on the MP recovery front, but he won't really be spamming double meteors or ultimas, so his innate upgraded refresh should be more than enough.

Offensively, he's a bit worse than our contenders on shorter battles. Exdeath has double Meteors with a 666% modifier and Fina has double Ultima with a 746% modifier, while Emperor can only do 460%. That's 30% worse than Exdeath and 38% worse than Fina and that's nothing to scoff at. On *longer battles*, though, things get more balanced: Exdeath is stuck to his 666%, Majin Fina can get to 760% with Dystopia and Emperor can reach the crazy 2000% with **Hellfire** if the battle drags for that long. The equalized modifier obviously depends on the battle length, but due to MP concerns, Exdeath does has an average 500% over 4 turns, Fina catches up with 520% on turn 4 (increasing every turn until it averages to 760%) while Emperor ties with Exdeath on turn 4 (taking Exdeath's killers into account, Emperor surpasses his damage at turn 6) and it's all uphill from there til the 2000% cap. It's actually even better for Emperor because his MP refresh gives him more than enough MP to keep using Hellfire til the end of times. So, **TL;DR:** If the battle takes more than 4 (or 6, if Exdeath's killers are proccing) turns, Emperor outdamages Exdeath and Majin Fina by a veeeery large margin.

Before we end this section, let's talk a bit about chaining, as we all know you can get way more bang for your buck if you're getting the big combos. Even with enhancements, the only thing that Emperor has that can chain is his LB (this is a major plus for Majin Fina's enhanced Ultima) with 7 hits. Since he has no built-in LB rate enhancer, he's not gonna be spamming that a lot, so he's virtually a chain finisher with Hellfire.

**Japanese Altema Rating:** 93/100 (After Enhancements)

**Global Trust Mastery Rating:** Mateu's Malice ATK +19, **MAG +129**, HP +10% - Rod - 9.5/10 

Even if the 129 is a typo (on JP the rod gives 109 MAG), this is the strongest rod in the game and a fantastic equipment to have for your mage. The +10% HP is just icing on the cake.

**Japanese TM Rating (altema.jp):** SS Rank

**Why would you want Emperor?:** On this physical meta, it's hard to consider a slot for a mage that virtually can't help chaining. However, not only are we in the baby steps of this new meta, but Emperor is a very solid all around mage. Ridiculous MAG stat with his self-buff, varied supporting skill set and robust offensive set that shines in longer battles.

**Is he Future-proof?:** Emperor has got some pretty good enhancements in Japan that boost him further, but none of them gave him a chainable hit. However, they more than make up for it. Here's the run down:

* **I will not die** gets him an extra **+30% HP** passive and 50% chance to ignore up to 3 Fatal Attacks when HP above 40%. This is very significant for a squishy mage and further amplifies his surviving skills.

* **Hellfire** gets a boost to its multiplier (250% base and +250% every cast) and gets a 2 turn -25% Fire debuff, just ramping the modifier to stupid levels.

* **Reign** gets boosted to **+200% MAG** for 11! turns (holy crap), the SPR debuff is amplified to -50%, but it also now debuffs your enemies by -50%

___________________________________________________


**[Firion](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/140)**

**Rarity:** 3* to 6*

**Global Party Rating:** 7.5/10 (8.5/10 with Dual Wield) 

Next in line is our buddy, the man of the hour, Firion. With his shiny new 6\*, unparalleled weapon selection and **ALL THE KILLERS EVER**, Firion is here to take his spot as a great unit. Once again, let's start with stats! This is one of the places where Firion falls short: pretty underwhelming base **132 ATK** (+26 with pots) and a single **+10% ATK passive** for a total of 173 ATK. However, there's a few solid reasons why his base ATK is significantly lower than other physical attackers and you'll see them soon.

For equipments, aside from robes, heavy shields and heavy armor, Firion can wear and wield **ANYTHING**. That includes all the major weapon types (Sword, Greatsword, Katana, Knuckles) and pretty much whatever else you want to put on his hands.

Now, skill time! Let's start with the main reason his base ATK sucks: to go along with his incredible weapon list, he has masteries with *every single one of them*. You've read that right, even Gilgamesh envies him. To break it down:

* +30% MAG/SPR when equipped with **Staff, Rod, Harp and Mace**

* +25% ATK and +30% SPR when equipped with **Bow, Whip, Throwing Weapon and Gun**

* +30% ATK when equipped with **Axe, Hammer, Lance and Knuckles**

* +20% ATK/DEF when equipped with **Dagger, Sword, Greatsword and Katana** 

This means his innate +10% ATK becomes, at least, a +30% ATK passive and can be further enhanced with Dual Wield. These masteries not only mean that you can viably build him any way you like (aside from the MAG ones, as he has no innate Magic attack and the SPR buff isn't worth it), but he also makes the most of any great weapon that's currently not in use in your party.

The second reason his base ATK is crappy is because he has *multiple Killers* against the major monster types, that add to +125% vs Plants, Insects, Birds, Beasts, Demons and Dragons. This is nothing to joke about, as it scales his damage to exceptional levels.

However, he also falls flat on offensive skills. His only major one is a finisher: **Fin Briar** (180% ST 1 Hit Physical Attack + Ignore 25% DEF - normalized to **240%**). It has very mediocre modifier, but can get to a crazy 540% if his killers proc. His LB is a 310% to 430% (depending on rank) ST 5 Hit Physical Attack, which can be chained, but it's not gonna happen really often because no innate LB rate up skills. He also comes with **Lance** (ST 80% Attack w/ 20% HP Drain &amp; ST 30% Attack w/ 10% MP Drain) for that Arena annoyance and minor MP recovery and Bladeblitz (140% AoE Physical Attack) if you want some AoE with good modifier with killers (normalizes to 315%)

**Japanese Altema Rating:** 95/100 (After Enhancements)

**Global Trust Mastery Rating:** Equip H. Armor - Enables unit to equip heavy armor - Materia - 3/10 

Meeeh. Equip Armor materia is extremely underwhelming, as the survivability increase is just not worth the slot and your time grinding this out. This can be used to allow some units to trigger future Heavy Armor masteries but, once again, it's just not worth the slot over other offensive/defensive materia.

**Japanese TM Rating (altema.jp):** A Rank

**Why would you want Firion?:** You don't have good 6* physical attackers or you're lacking a strong finisher for your chains. Before enhancements, Firion is a good unit, but only goes that far. He can supplement your dps nicely if your team is lacking, but even with masteries and killers, a 540% modifier is not *that* fantastic for a finisher, so be sure to run the math and see if you can fit him on your team.

**Is he Future-proof?:** Holy yeah. Alim was extremely nice with Firion's enhancements. **Fin Briar**'s modifier is ramped up to a normalized 460%, **Lance** becomes legit sustainability, both HP and MP wise (ST 100% Attack w/ 40% HP Drain &amp; ST 50% Attack w/ 30% MP Drain) and his **Legend Killer** gets upgraded +25% vs Beasts, Demons and Dragons (totalling +150% vs these types) and now includes +100% vs Humans (and Undeads :/)! Firion is a killing machine with enhancements and definitely worthy of his 95 score.

___________________________________________________

**[Leonhart](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/420)**

**Rarity:** 4* to 5*

**Global Party Rating:** 3/10 

One of the 5* max of this banner, Leon joins the rank of the Dark Knights with Gaffgarion, Garland and Co. You already know the gist, 5* max on a 6* meta are only relevant if they have very noteworthy skills or TMR. Let's glance over his stats and equipment selection.

Leon has base **113 ATK** (+24 from pots) and a **+20% ATK** passive, alongside a **+30% ATK** if equiped with a Sword, totalling a completely and expectedly mediocre 205 ATK. His weapon selection is a bit restricted, only being able to wield Swords from the major weapon types, alongside Daggers, Spears, Axes and Bows. His armor selection is great, being able to wear light and heavy armor, including heavy shields.

So, is there any saving grace on his skills? Not really, no. He has two Dark attacks, one Single Target (150% modifier) and one AoE (190% modifier) with the upside of not taking away his HP, like his comrades'. Aside from that, he's got your run-of-the-mill **Barrage** (4x 80% RT Physical Attack) and **The Phantom** (2x 160% AoE Physical Attack), which is a decent AoE. And that's about it.

**Japanese Altema Rating:** 80/100 (After Enhancements)

**Global Trust Mastery Rating:** Dark Knight's Soul - Boost ATK when equipped with a sword or heavy armor- Materia - 9.5/10 

Aaand **THAT'S** why you want Leon. Fantastic materia acts as a second Blade Mastery for characters that can wear heavy armor and benefit from using swords (Gilgamesh, Luneth, etc). One of the few must have materia if you're aiming to deck out a character.

**Japanese TM Rating (altema.jp):** SS Rank

**Why would you want Leonhart?:** For his TMR, really. He'd be a fantastic character, had he been released during the 5* meta, but he simply can't compete in terms of dps against 6* and that's the only thing his skillset allows him to do. You can maybe fit him into a dark chain, but even that is a stretch.

**Is he Future-proof?:** Nope. Leon's got some very mediocre enhancements in JPN, but with no 6* yet, his future doesn't seem that great. **The Phantom** gets boosted to 400% and he gets **+30% HP** passive. Neither are saving him.

___________________________________________________

**[Guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/417)**

**Rarity:** 3* to 5*

**Global Party Rating:** 3/10 

Aaand we have **another** 5* max on this banner, Guy. You know the gist at this point, so let's move forward.

Mediocre base **108 ATK** (+16 from pots) with a single **+10% ATK** passive adds to a grand total of 136 ATK. Yeah... His equipment selection is okay, being able to wield Swords, Knuckles, Spears, Hammers, Axes and Daggers, with a decent armor layout of cloth and light armor.

His skill set is narrow and pretty weird. He comes with **Draw Attack** (Increase Target Chance 1.5x) to synergize with **Clutch Factor** (+50% ATK after HP drops below 50% &amp; +50% DEF after HP drops below 50%). That's a cute combo, but a 5* max won't survive a hit and doesn't even have the stats to make this significant.

Aside from that, he's got a subpar AoE and ST skills (160% and 200% modifiers, respectively) and **Full Break** (160% ST 1 Hit Physical Attack &amp; ST 3 Turn -30% ATK/DEF/MAG/SPR Debuff). However, we're way past the point where that's a redeming quality on a subpar unit.

**Japanese Altema Rating:** 76/100

**Global Trust Mastery Rating:** Hill Digger - HP +30%, ATK +10% - Materia - 6/10

And once again, his TMR is his only redeming factor. It's a strict upgrade to Amarant's, but falls into the same thing you guys are used to now, that defensive TMRs provide so little upgrade to your team compared to offensive TMRs that they're hardly worth your time. 
 
**Japanese TM Rating (altema.jp):** A Rank

**Why would you want Guy?:** You want him for his TMR and even then there are so much better TMRs you can get that he'll be on the waiting line for a loooooooong time (very likely forever)

**Is he Future-proof?:** Nah. No enhancements, no 6*. Guy's just as good as his TMR.

___________________________________________________

**Quick Bonus Non-Banner Upgraded Unit**

**[Maria](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/wiki/units/083)**

**Rarity:** 3* to 5*

**Global Party Rating:** 4/10 

Maria got upgraded and dumped into the 5* max healer box. Noteworthy upgrades is the addition of **Dispelga** (AoE Stat Buff Removal), good ol' **Curaja** (AoE ~1000 HP Heal w/ 3.4x Mod) and **Raise** (ST Revive with 30% HP). That's fantastic... if that happened 6 months ago.

**Why would you want Maria?** You don't, really. At all. Even if you're just starting, Fina is gonna be a much better unit with Cheer until you can get a proper healer.

___________________________________________________

**Should you pull?** You guessed it: depends. If you haven't gotten Firion from an off-banner pull yet (like me!) or if you're lacking a decent finisher, pull for him. He becomes a fantastic unit later on and can be serviceable now with his wide variety of weapon and killers.

If you're macroing, you definitely want at least one Leonhart. If you're really into macros, you'd want some Guys to deck out your Tank/Healer. If you're a whale, pulling for Emperor is okay, but don't expect a mind-blowing unit. And once again, if you're not and pulled Emperor, yay!"

5ubvvo,2,2017-02-15,“Individualism” and relational deprivation - Why Western Women Don't Have Real Friends (Witchwind),ShaunaDorothy,RadicalFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalFeminism/comments/5ubvvo/individualism_and_relational_deprivation_why/,"I’ve been thinking quite a lot about relational deprivation between women in Western countries recently, and even more so since I’ve been spending some time with two feminist friends from a non-Western* country who were here for a few months (and left a few days ago).

Seeing their photos with their friends, how physically close they are together, and seeing how tactile they could be with me too, in ways that would be interpreted as lesbian (sexual) here without ambiguity, when apparently it’s acceptable female friendly touch there, and hearing about how much time they spend with their friends and how casually they can reserve entire days for each other, made me realise that I wasn’t hallucinating about feeling isolated and deprived of contact with women in this part of the world, even from radical feminist friends. To see that women could relate differently elsewhere really opened my eyes to my own situation, and to the effects this deprivation has on women in general, and on feminism.

I’ve been noticing more and more clearly the divide between how I organise my life, travel destinations and work time according to friendships and how this is rarely if ever reciprocated in the same way, and how it always feels like going against the tide when trying to catch up with my local friends. I completely understand now what various female immigrant friends were talking about when they’d say how depressed they were because of being isolated here.

As usual when I strongly need to get my head around a pattern of violence that affects me personally, the things I’ll share about myself with women I know and trust will tend to revolve around it, in the hope that they might have some helpful answers or perspectives. Even just formulating it verbally or in writing helps a great deal. And the insights these discussions lead to are always surprising and incredibly enlightening.

After these friends got back home, I mentioned to one of them (I’ll call her A) how fascinated I was by her relations to her friends and how it contrasted so much with norms of acceptable closeness to women in Western countries. Here much of what we consider friendship often barely exceeds acquaintance relationships. I never thought that differences between countries could be so strong, or that it could even be possible to be so close to women as adults. I thought it was impossible, that it’s something we only experience as a child if we were lucky enough, and everything stops as we become adults and have to give up our friends for men and work. It was really interesting to talk about this with her, to compare social organisation in our respective regions and how it affects women.

Another one of these exchanges was with my mum. Mentioning a close friend of mine who had moved to another town for work reasons a few years ago, she mused about how enthusiastic this friend was in doing things with me, even in sharing mundane chores, which is very unusual. And yes, it’s true, she was the only friend like that, it’s one of the reasons why particularly I miss her since she’s gone. This made us think of how little we do things with our female friends. Our friendships are mostly restricted to fixed appointments for a cup of tea, sometimes booked weeks in advance, which rarely exceeds 2 hours and it’s you tell me your life and I tell you my life and we analyse it a bit and then bye-bye, until the next appointment.

Yet going through common experiences and discovering, learning things together, committing to each other for projects, music bands, repairing our bicycles on a sunday afternoon or sleeping over at each other’s places, gives depth to friendship and teaches things about each other that a once-a-month discussion on its own, sitting in front of each other in a square room or in a noisy cafe without moving doesn’t. It’s like we’re not allowed to commit to each other more than being therapeutical social workers.

By the time I talked to Friend A, I had already given some thought as to why women’s isolation in the past century in Western countries has worsened:

    
The first factor being, I think, the capitalist nuclear family model becoming much more the single primary unit of socialisation for women, where we are left completely on our own to deal with children and domestic slavery, with much less access to support, community or regular female presence from the “outside world”. Western individualism has reduced some amount of control/surveillance on women by the surrounding group (control by neighbours, relatives outside of the nuclear family (brothers, male cousins, aunts etc), which is the downside for women in less individualist countries), but has increased our emotional dependency on our male-owner and reduced our possibilities of creating sustainable bonds with other women.
    
The second thing is the ongoing disappearance of sex-segregation in all our major places of socialisation such as schools and workplaces, which means nowadays entire generations of women in Western capitalist countries have never experienced interaction that wasn’t physically monitored by boys and men, where surviving and adapting to their sexually abusive behaviours takes up all or most of our social efforts, where we are kept in all ways possible from bonding to women. Almost two generations of women have been conditioned to despise and fear women-only spaces, to view them as a threat to our social existence, as something backwards, revolting, from a dark distant patriarchal time. This has immensely contributed to destroying our capacity to socialise with and to identify to women early on in childhood and to increasing our trauma-bonding to men / idealisation of maleness, and self-hatred.

Going through our comparisons with friend A, she added a factor I hadn’t quite seen: that Western women tend to be more absorbed by their professional work. She said women she knew from Western countries were always busy, always working, and had very little life outside of work.

Well that was an interesting finding to me, as I had always assumed that because the level of women’s occupation by work was similar in all places, it had similar effects. But it’s very obvious that the kind of work women are expected to do differs from place to place (and social class) and this affects our social relations too. It’s true that here, our outside work and “career” has taken a similar function or status as that of marriage / coupling with men, as we are also expected to sacrifice our lives for it, including our local networks which are essential to our social survival and take many years to build, especially as a woman.

What’s even more interesting is that as I began to write this post shortly after my discussion with friend A (excited about sharing all these new insights), and halted at precisely this stage because I didn’t know how to formulate it — another friend (which I’ll call B) responded to one of my emails with the most amazing analysis of how busyness and work divides women in Western capitalist societies. Answering her question of how I spent christmas, I said (in part) this: “I was a bit frustrated that my friends from my town weren’t available (or even responding) as this time of the year is usually when I have most time, and I was hoping to catch up with them. It’s been a bit frustrating lately that many of my friends are so busy and taken, and not to be able to spend more time with them. I realise how in Western countries adult women aren’t supposed to prioritise friendships at all, and how difficult it generally is to become close to women.” to which she responded this (forgive the long quote, but I thought everything was worth sharing! with her permission of course):

    
“I can totally relate to what you are saying about your friends. […] I find that other radfems tend to prioritize their friendships more, but I have found it very hard since [..] I have a lot more time on my hands than other women so I am wanting to be in touch more but they are often too busy.

    
I think a lot about busyness vs not. I know this guy who is happy to work weekends on top of the week because he wants the extra money, and he lives in this incredibly cheap place and doesn’t do a whole lot – I wonder what the hell he spends it on. And him and this other guy I know – both of them struggle to use up their holiday! Can you imagine? I mean why on earth would you want to spend all that time working? I think about the SCUM manifesto, what Solanas says about men not being able to be alone with themselves, and it’s true.

    
There are two things to think about this. One is that for all this talk about capitalism being alienating, it seems like men like it that way. The world is like this because they built it that way and it suits them. I mean, whenever I’m out in mensworld, I need a lot of down time to recover, it’s always been that way and it was that way too for some of my other women I used to know, nonfeminist ones. Men don’t need to recover from it because it’s their homeworld, it nourishes them, in fact they feel empty without it. In fact married men often work more to avoid their families too.

    
The other thing to think is how entering into the capitalist workforce was supposed to make women less dependent on men, but in some ways it has increased the dependence and has worked very effectively to divide women further from each other. Firstly, women are overburdened in both the workplace and the home – they do more work for less pay, shittier work, and they work a double shift of domestic labour if they are living with a man or children. So they have less time. I am currently reading The Women’s Room by Marilyn Frye and her account of suburban housewives, it really struck me how much more emotional support and friendship the women had among each other than they could ever hope to have if they were working. The housewives’ community was a women-only space – something which working women rarely have. The mensworld was like a foreign country to them. Today it feels more like women’s world is a foreign country because entering into the male workforce means being around men all the time and it means having to absorb their ideologies to get ahead.

    
In the home, the women were left largely to their own devices and were in charge, at least of the children. They had a sphere of influence. Even though the man ruled over them, he wasn’t there for a large quantity of the time and also didn’t care about many of the decisions women had to make. Now, women don’t have time to create a local community of women since they are working and child-rearing at the same time. So in both spheres they are isolated from women and alone.

    
On top of this, since women always have to try harder to get ahead in the workforce, they have to do all this extra training and always feel like they have to be doing some kind of self-improvement activity, endless accumulation of ‘human capital’. Men have to do this too, to some extent, but they can bond with men in the workplace while women can’t bond with women, because if they bond too much with women and stand with women the men will reject them so they will never get ahead. You have to be male-identified to get ahead. Additionally, capitalism says we should move with our jobs, which hinders building a local community of women. And we are indoctrinated into this ideology early on – and it’s not just ideological, it’s legal too. I mean, you might expect your family or your partner to move with you, but to prioritize your friends over your job when deciding where to be? It’s basically unthinkable.

    
I know probably most of your friends do not have men or kids, but we absorb this mentality early on. I remember living in the US and how hard it was to make friends, everything was so superficial. It seemed like there would be no more friends, only acquaintances to have dinner parties or drinks with, now and again. I thought, is this it? Is this what adulthood is supposed to be? It was horribly empty. But everyone was so busy, all the time, all the time accumulating internships or volunteer work. Not that I really liked those people, but still.

    
Anyway the point is that while women were largely shut out from mensworld, they had much more opportunity to bond with other women. A lot of that has been destroyed by women’s entry into the workforce, and it has resulted in women becoming much more male-identified. In the book the main character gets divorced and goes to graduate school, and she talks about the contrast between being a housewife, where at least in some sense she was in charge for large swathes of time, and the way she gets treated like a child and an idiot by male professors.

It’s so obvious how relational deprivation, isolation from one another and more generally, the promotion of individualist ideologies are a very deliberate repressive strategy against women: to prevent any form of bonding which is the precondition for concerted rebellion against men’s control. Since the 90s and even more so in the last few years, with the global, massive taking over of neoliberal capitalist politics, it has become harder than ever to mobilise anyone even for non political activities, as the oppressed have so integrated that we have to compete with others and focus on ourselves in order to defend our own interests, and that our interests and life conditions can be separated from those of our class. Yet only members of the dominant class can further their interests (as oppressors) purely through individualist pursuits, because their egocentrism is congruent with their actual dominance.

Men define long-term social isolation and relational deprivation (when used against men in “real” political repression with “official” prison cells of course), as a method of political torture. It is recognised as affecting victims in most durable ways, destroying their ability to socialise even long after their liberation, causing them to lose their jobs and ties with family… 

Indeed, destroying our relationship to ourselves and to women is probably the worst, most deeply traumatic effect of men’s oppression. Intentional male violence is essentially relational, as in, their actions deliberately annihilate our bond to the world and to ourselves, which, when it doesn’t kill us, is an act of spiritual killing — as they need us emptied of our selves in order to be useful for them for very large amounts of time.

In the same way, an essential part of healing from trauma caused by male torture is through reconnecting to women and to ourselves. My own healing largely progressed along with my ability to form stable friendships with feminists, as well as reconnecting to my body, my soul and making cognitive connections about men’s necrophilic system.

It’s more and more obvious to me that there is no such thing as individual freedom and identity outside of social context, social relations and even natural environment. It’s illusionary and absurd to think that our lives and pursuits for improvement can be done entirely on our own, abstracted from social interaction and change.

Our raised consciousness, our leaps, our movements of liberation and solidarity networks are inherently relational. Feminism is entirely dependent on the bonds we create with women, on our continued interactions, and nothing of this would exist if we didn’t meet and spend time together, away from male surveillance. The more we do this (and learn how to do it in healthy, respectful conditions obviously), the stronger our feminism.

This is also why I eventually chose to structure my post according to the genesis of its creation, to show how each new connection and feminist understanding was very directly stimulated by all these spiralling exchanges with women, as well as by my own thoughts, readings and analyses of my social experiences with women. To quote friend B again:

    
“Isn’t it funny how these things are happening at the same time? i think this is like, the wormholes Sonia Johnson talks about. Because I feel you have been working on these issues a lot longer than me, so you can help me shortcut to where you are, and then I can add to that too, and you can add to that, so we all advance more quickly. I’m sure the same is happening with your other friends too, and then I benefit from that too even though i don’t know them because it works through you”

The constant stimulation and discussions I have with other feminists are my life force. Creating an alternative world can’t be done in isolation, it can only develop and evolve in relation to other women.

5ucbkl,3,2017-02-15,Advice - Intern vs. Job,sandrabullockfan,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/5ucbkl/advice_intern_vs_job/,"Here's my problem. I recently interned for 9 months at a well-respected agency in my city. Due to budget constraints they could not afford to hire me full time (I was assured it was not because of my work).

As for my next gig, I currently have a job offer at a place I wouldn't mind working at (less respected as well), and an internship offer at a place I REALLY want to work at (better respected). Do I take the job knowing I'll have more security, or take the internship knowing I'll be somewhere I want to be doing good work?

I have asked about a job at the place I want to be, and they have said there is no position currently available, but judging from what I've heard, if I work hard enough they will hire me. The worst case scenario is I don't get hired after the internship, which I think looks really bad for me in this industry.

Please let me know what you think I should do. Thanks!"
5ucigt,94,2017-02-15,The Cold Call - overcoming rejection in the professional world,Hillary_For_Prison,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5ucigt/the_cold_call_overcoming_rejection_in_the/,"**Summary:** Making that phone call to a company who has never heard of you and being told ""not interested"" a few dozen times is good for you.

**Body:**
The summer of my sophomore year in college I needed a job, an internship preferably.  Unfortunately I was too clumsy, too insecure and too unimpressive to land one prior to the end of the year.  The first week of the summer, while living with my parents, I called every single manufacturing and engineering firm with a 45 minute drive.  I called about 30 companies.  I was told ""Not hiring"" and ""We don't need interns"" and ""we're full"" about 29 times.  One firm was interested in having me as a summer intern and hired me on as a CAD monkey.  That first experience with cold calling taught me two things: worry less about rejection and get to the point of the call ASAP.

The following summer I was also at loose-ends and needed an internship and really didn't want to go back to the first place despite being asked.  Again I cold-called everyone in the local area and expanded by range out to a major mid-west city where I had relatives I could stay with.  This time I called about 80 firms.  I interviewed at a couple and took an internship with the first firm that offered.

I developed more skill at the cold call, got better at asking for the right people, got better at getting to the point, and further got over the anxiety of rejection.

Shortly after college I used cold-calls to land three jobs.  My first job I kept for two weeks before moving on to my second (2 years, 4 months) and then my third (currently at just over 10 years).  In my current position I make calls to code officials, building owners, architects, etc. on a daily basis.  Phone calls are a normal part of my job.  Being rejected or told ""no"" over the phone is something I deal with regularly.  It is not something many of my coworkers handle very well.

My company has been on a push to hire more female engineers and the big consequence of that push (since every engineering firm is on a similar push) is that female engineering students never have to make a cold-call.  They never have to learn how to hook the person on the other end, how to convince them the call is worth their time or how to bring the call to a conclusion.  I get to see every day how people who aren't accustomed to doing the pursuing handle it when they have to pursue something, even something as simple as an answer to a building code question from someone whose job is to answer that question.  

**Lessons Learned:**

When it comes time to get a job make cold calls.  The rejection isn't any fun but the calls themselves are excellent practice for handling rejection and learning how to sell yourself over the phone.  

Tips for making a good cold call: 
1. Research the target.  Determine what you have to offer them.
2. Figure out who you need to talk to and who your call is likely to land you with before you dial.  If you need a job you probably need to talk to either HR (if a large company) or ask for an executive or someone in charge of hiring (if a small company).
3. Figure out your sales pitch before you call.  Get the keywords (Name, Job wanted, etc.) in first.
4. Listen to the respondent.
5. Expand on what you can offer in the roll, cite experience you have.
6. Ask if you can get either an in-person interview or a phone interview with the right people."

I'm going on a work trip coming up in March where I might see an old friend. This person and I were very very close as friends in college. He was also undeniably the best friend of my then-partner. After that relationship ended, this friend and I sort of had a quiet, behind-the-scenes fling, on and off. 


Even wording it like that makes it seem more nuanced or romantic than it was. It was more than being fuck-buddies and also far less than being in any sort of definable relationship. Even though our peer group at the time was heavily polyamorous, inclined towards being romantically and sexually ""open,"" and I deeply wanted some kind of relationship at the time, there were other individuals we cared about whose emotions would've been too heavily tied to the situation. 


We crushed on each other for a while, made out fairly heavily a few times, slept in each others' beds, and were very emotionally close, but never overtly had ""sex"" together. We never intended to let it turn into a real romantic/sexual relationship or let it go on indefinitely due to the social circumstances at the time; it was more like we both just gave in to an emotional desire we both had in private and never told anyone else about it. I suppose because of that it feels like a secret that we share, whether or not it truly is (I confided to a few close friends about it, he may have as well, unclear) it inhabits that space in my mind. 


This happened on and off over the course of Fall &amp; Spring, and that next Summer we found ourselves in the same city for various internships and summer jobs. We never made out again and never spoke about it, and upon returning home were suddenly a lot less close as friends. For one reason or another that has always been a bit of a mystery to me, we drifted apart a lot that summer. I know he was emotionally busy with someone he was dating turbulently at the time, so I wasn't expecting sex, but our friendship also faded.


That was all a few years ago now, and we've been rebuilding our friendship and relationship since then. I'm very very fond of him as a friend, and quite happy in a new (monogamous) relationship. I've no interest in trying to rekindle anything romantic. But some part of me feels like addressing that this experience happened will help us to restrengthen the friendship we once had. Part of me wonders if he pulled away in fact because of those experiences, or if that was just circumstantial and coincidental with other things he was going through in his life at that time, and further circumstances that occurred wherein our living situations changed upon moving back home (I moved out of the dorm we'd both been living in). 


The biggest question is maybe ""What do you hope to gain from this conversation,"" and I guess it's just a clearing of the air. I feel like it's an elephant in the room when we do hang out one on one now. Part of me worries those feelings are still dormant, so there's some fear that they'll be resurfaced in me if they are discussed aloud and point-blank. But I could pretty easily choose to ignore them should that be the case. 


I want to be close again, and I don't want the fact that we made out a few times in college to get in the way of our friendship now. If anything, I want to connect over that fact- to clear the air, discuss it, have this shared secret, and to laugh at the fact that we used to be into each other. Maybe part of me also wants to confirm that these moments- which I'm happy to leave in the past but were precious and special and meaningful to me- meant something to him as well, and aren't memories that he's trying to forget, but a fond part of the story of our friendship that we both recall. 


I'm concerned that it might stir up some less pleasant feelings in him or turn the visit into an awkward one if it's something that I am not realizing he feels sore about in some way. 


Is this in-person visit a good time to bring it up? How best to do so? Anyone have any good litmus tests for figuring out if a potentially difficult conversation is worth having at all? 
  

I'm sure there's some generic heteronormative advice floating around along the lines of ""you can't be friends with exes and this is similar!"" and I'm sure there's wisdom to that. But I'm trying to make judgement calls based on specific situations rather than others' guesses at what ""usually happens with humans."" 



  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm going on a work trip where I will see an old friend. We made out a few times and almost had a thing, but decided not to act on it. We never addressed that it happened and I'd like to; it feels like an elephant in the room. Is it a good idea to bring it up during my visit?"

I'm graduating soon in electrical engineering and have done a good amount of internships and undergraduate research in engineering. I've worked with building automation, test engineering, undergraduate research in computer vision, and now have been a full-stack developer for the past 7 months for a local start-up.

I know what everyone is going to say, ""uh...remote software job!"" Well, I understand this, but there's two things I have to be completely real with myself on: 

  1. I only have been a developer for little over half a year. I don't feel like I'm nearly skilled enough to claim my place among the vast majority of developers (YET!). 

  2. Similar to the first point, I've come to see I just am not that amazing at programming. That is, I'm not a super star in software dev and realize I never will be. Not signing my career in dev away completely, just acknowledging where my strengths and weaknesses are is all.

That being said about my software job, what are the possible options I have given all my experience and knowledge (which, frankly, isn't much compared to those already working as digital nomads)? I would like to add that I'm decent at writing and found content creation to be a possibility, though I don't completely know enough about what fields involved this.

Also, and this is a little tangent, but I'm sure all of you asked yourselves this at one point. Career stability, did you ever find that the switch to being a digital nomad hindered it? Why or why not? I ask this due to the possibility of one day shifting away from being a digital nomad, if that were to ever happen.


Thanks everyone, I really do appreciate the advice. I wish you all the best in finding a fulfilling life. :)

5ue6q1,3,2017-02-16,Everything was going well with two friendly meet ups and then a yes to asking her out. After a few days I stop hearing from her. My friends and I are very confused. Would love any advice!,EmbraceComplexity,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/5ue6q1/everything_was_going_well_with_two_friendly_meet/,"I've asked several of my friends, mostly women, what to make of this situation I'm in with this girl, and they all have different opinions. I'm sure you're thinking ""dude she's just not into you if she doesn't text back,"" but it's a bit more complicated than that I think. 

I realize this is super long, but I will love you forever if you can give me any tiny piece of advice. It's kind of driving me crazy. There is a tl;dr if you want to read that and go back and look for details. Didn't know how else to write this. For better or worse, here's what happened:

It started on tinder when I super liked her (I know, eyeroll). She messaged me first and seemed to be very enthusiastic about meeting me and showing me around since I'm new in town. Even though I super liked her, I was still kind of unsure, and almost bailed when she told me to come visit her. But alas, I did. I met her at her sorority. She's 20, I'm 22, a recent college grad. 

She showed me around her university and we walked and talked for a while. We seemed to jive pretty well. We got back and we decided to go on a hike that we previously talked about. We thought it was close by, but it ended up being an hour drive, giving us plenty of time to talk. On the hike, I felt very much like she was attracted to me. I honestly wasn't sure if I liked her yet though. We drove back and by the time I dropped her off we had spent like 5-6 hours with each other. We obviously got along. Standing outside my car I totally could've kissed her. But again, I wasn't sure. I left her, and we agreed to hang out again. 

The next week we continued to text every day, pretty regularly. She was overly nice about everything. She read stuff I was working on in school (I write a lot). She even recommended me for an internship I just did an interview for. She also mentioned a movie she really wanted to see, so naturally I told her I could take her. It was actually a strange situation because the movie was playing at her university that weekend as well, and we talked about either going with her friends on campus or by ourselves. We went by ourselves and I paid for the tickets since she could've gone for free anyway. 

So I pick her up and we go to the movie. Things are going well. It was kind of uncomfortable not saying anything for two hours, but I survived. We finished and started talking about the movie. We were the last ones to leave the theater. Realizing I hadn't made any plans afterward I asked her if she was hungry or anything. She insisted on buying me dinner since I bought the tickets. 

So then we start wandering around the mall looking for a place to eat. And that's when the magic happens. I don't know why but I started liking her there. Looking into her eyes felt amazing. Conversation was seamless. We would get too caught up in talking and walking we could barely decide on a place to eat. We settled on a somewhat fancy Italian place, and we split a pizza as to not go too crazy. So we finish up and I drive her back (I made a few wrong turns partly because I'm new in town and partly because I was distracted talking to her. She didn't seem to mind). 

We get back and I realize, welp it's now or never. I park the car and before she has a chance to go I say something like ""listen I know the way we met is kind of silly, but I really like you and want to take you on a date if that's something you're interested in."" I don't remember exactly what she said, but she looked excited and said yes. So then we talked for like 15 minutes longer in the car. She had to get up early in the morning for a function, so she couldn't stay out too long. I wanted to kiss her so bad, but the way my seats are aligned it would have been very difficult. If I was smarter I could've asked her to walk her to the door or something. Regardless I was just very happy she said yes. I should've been more concrete about a day, our schedules didn't really line up. We said one of two days and that we'd figure it out. 

I got back that night to my place and we texted a few times before going to bed. Texted the next day regularly again, not about any details though. Monday I figure out I have a class cancelled on Thursday and offer to take her out then. Previously she said she was free that night. She says maybe, and after this she starts responding slower to my texts, still responding though. Naturally I did too since it was during the week. 

Thursday comes along and we're texting and she says she's actually busy. And not just that she's busy that night, but for like two more weeks. Two weeks seemed like a lot of time to wait for a date, but I felt like I didn't have much choice. I just said we'd do something once she has time. At this point a friend (female) of mine says to give her some space and stop texting her. So I wait two days and respond with a simple 👌🏻 after she said ok to going out when she's free. Didn't hear anything. So then three days later I just check in and see how she's doing. Still says she's busy, and says she's waiting till the 21st and ""all will be well."" She asks how I'm doing too. I ask what is on the 21st? And say I'm well and a little of what I'm doing. 

And that's it. Haven't heard from her since. That was Monday. It's Thursday morning now. It's the longest we've gone without talking. It is true that she does have a million things going on from talking to her before, but there's no way she wouldn't have time to send a text. She's made one Facebook post (although political) in the meantime (she also posted something on instagram briefly for VDay with her girlfriend and then deleted it--probably means nothing but strange). The problem is I really like her now, especially after not hearing from her. It's weird. Not sure what to do or where I went wrong. 

So my questions are: 

Is she just not interested?
Is there any chance she is legit busy and will still go out with me?
Is there anything I can do to fix the situation?
If not, where did I go wrong? Any obvious mistakes?
Or is this just a case of her just not being into me?
Did she just want to be friends? 

TL;DR: I super like a girl I tinder, we talk, meet up, I'm not sure about her. We are very friendly over text. We meet again, I grow to like her and ask her out. She says yes. Didn't kiss her. We couldn't nail down a date, but when we do eventually she ends up being busy. She says ""all will be well on the 21st,"" I ask what that means, and I haven't heard from her since (which was this past Monday).

5ufkb5,6,2017-02-16,Signal inversion on the DP83867CR,WonderJouster,AskElectronics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/5ufkb5/signal_inversion_on_the_dp83867cr/,"I'm trying to implement the TI DP83867CR GigE PHY on a custom board.

Long story short, the interface pins for my tab-up GigE jack are inverted with respect to the PHY (A+ lines up with D-). I would really prefer not to mount this PHY on the back of the board and there doesn't appear to be such a thing as a tab-down GigE jack.

In the docs for the DP83867CR it does mention a pin-swapping firmware setting, but some intern half-assed the page and it just says ""A-&gt;D"" and doesn't mention if the polarities are also flipped.

Can someone assuage my concerns here? Will GigE automagically sort out the polarity inversion? Anyone have experience that the the chip will do the polarity flip along with the pin swap?

Thanks for your time."
5uflno,1,2017-02-16,Is it true that my date just doesn't like texting/messaging or he's not that into me??,yilinssss,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5uflno/is_it_true_that_my_date_just_doesnt_like/,"First off huge thanks to anyone who would read my post;)

A little bit background about me&amp;my date:
I was born and raised in Asia(non native English speaker+new to western culture), 21this year, kind of introvert, looks 'cool' because of my cool tattoos and currently a full time film&amp;TV student; My boyfriend is Australian and a couple of years older than me, studying a different degree but in the same uni as me. 


I've been dating this guy since December 2016. He showed interest in me on a gather-together(at least thats what our teacher called it) dinner our teacher organised. We'd meet each other once a week for like 10mins as he would come to my classroom after my session ended to do his work since then, yet he never asked to add me on Facebook or any other social media that we could talk outside school time. 

One day I complained about how tough it was to carry the equipments for shooting a commercial without a car(I don't have a car yet since I'm new here), he immediately offered to help and gave me his number. He explained that he didn't like or even use any social media when I suggested we added each other on Fb. He claimed that he has a Facebook page but hadn't been on it in ages. 

We kept texting for almost a week (sounds like how people flirt two decades ago)until he downloaded whatsapp as I requested. He didn't know how to choose/change his dp or username, like when I asked him to get a dp he looked blank at me....okay I get it he was new to this modern messaging app.

A few things then came up, minor yet still upset me:
1, the first week was okay, he replies me normally within an hour, talking about random stuff and flirting; however I got his text once or twice a day recently, mainly asks me if I need a ride or something like that. 
I should mention that we slept on the third date. I went back home for Christmas for a month and during that time, he got an internship and was pretty busy, according to him. He started to reply me from frequently daily to once a day/two days. I finally got the guts to ask him what was it and let me know if he's seeing me like a friend with benefit or fuck body. He didnt answer straight away to my question of 'were you treating me seriously', instead he said he was happy to hear how I was back home and stuff. He also explained that he's slow at replying, he couldn't reply me at work and said sorry. 


2, He somehow managed to turn off the read receipts while he could not manage to choose his own display photo; i don't know why it bothers me but it just makes me feel uncomfortable. I reckon i just related this to him not replying me daily, like why can't you text me back if you've read my message? I don't text him insanely I swear, just 5-10 texts a day ask how is going and tell him how my day goes.


3, He never told me about his plans. I admit that it's my bad that I'm kinda needy, that I'm dependent, that i kinda build my life around him, and that's why this 'he never told me about his plan' thing an issue for me. I can't continue my daily plans without him telling me if he's staying the night or not, ect. 
There was once he told me that he'd bring to the supermarket ( I live in a rural area, public transport isn't that awesome and again, I don't have a car:(( I waited for the whole day at home without texting him since he explained that he doesn't like being on his phone a lot and stuff, and I was trying to improve a bit (to be less dependant)as he said he wouldn't reply me if he's busy. 
I finally texted him around 6, asked him if he's coming to pick me up as supermarket in my area closes at 7ish. He replied immediately, said he's at his uncle's place babysitting (that's 1h+ drive from my town).  I asked him several times if he coming to my place, I'd stay up to open the door for him if the answer was yes. He wasn't sure about when would his uncle I guess, so he said he'd know it later. I texted him both at 12am and 2am, yet not a single word of reply. the next day he told that he dozed off on the couch. I can't really blame on him for this but it makes me sad that he left me hanging for so long. 
Things like this happened a couple of times after, I was really trying to be less clingy but he seemed to expect too much independence from me. It's like I put my life on pause and don't continue to make any daily plans while he can do whatever he wants , that's not exactly fair to put me through.

he did this again today. It's yesterday, to be precise. Normally we'd meet up from Monday to Thursday, he'd sleep over on Monday &amp; Tuesday night, take me to dinner to just come cuddle me on Wednesday &amp; Thursday.
Well, it was Thursday again. I asked him if could tickle his belly(aka am I see you on Thursday) since Wednesday night, yet he replied. He had assignments due so, um, as part of the progress I shouldn't text him to gain attention right? Should just leave him alone till he finishes right ? 
Exactly what I did. For the whole day. Except one text of 'hey we meeting up?' at 6pm, the estimated time when he finishes class and gym; a call at 8pm, the end of the day to see what's going on. He didn't reply or pick up. 
Not. A. Word. 
Around 9 I finally got his text that says he couldn't today he's busy. I just kinda blown up. Gosh. You had the whole day to reply me that you can't spend 1h after class with me but you left me waiting for so long? 

Could anyone suggest me what to do? I don't know if it's a cultural difference thing , I'm all confused and depressed:((( I've been tearing up for the whole night and still don't have any clue. I replied him in a not that polite manner and he didn't text back after. I really like him and this not let me know about his plan thing freaked me out.
Again I AM CLINGY and INDEPENDENT but not replying people's texts for all day, sounds a little bit rude to me.

Due to different culture background, I have different understanding of ""dating""""boyfriend"" and all kinds of relationship related words/issues. Two people can be an official couple when they first started dating in my culture and there is always a 'line' or 'boundary' ----we tent to say 'let's be together as a couple!' when we START dating someone. We call the whole dating process and the thin onwards ""a relationship"". 
it's obviously 90%different from the western culture I know so far. I was wondering maybe he's just avoiding me and trying to cut me off but don't wanna be straightforward, like we are just dating, he won't put in effort in something casual.

PS: he gave me roses and my favourite chocolate on V day. Used to buy me my fave food randomly haha. (I miss him already but don't wanna apologise for my bad manner, yet)

Please hit me with heaps of advice! :'((("
5ufond,8,2017-02-16,Girl slowly stops texting me after I successfully asked her out. Should I give up?,EmbraceComplexity,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5ufond/girl_slowly_stops_texting_me_after_i_successfully/,"I'm sure you're thinking, ""Dude she's just not into you if she doesn't text back,"" but it's a bit more complicated than that I think. I've asked several of my friends, mostly women, what to make of this situation I'm in with this girl, and they all have different opinions. 

I realize this is super long, but I will love you forever if you can give me any tiny piece of advice. It's kind of driving me crazy. There is a tl;dr if you want to read that and go back and look for details. Didn't know how else to write this. For better or worse, here's what happened:

It started on tinder when I super liked her (I know, eyeroll). She messaged me first and seemed to be very enthusiastic about meeting me and showing me around since I'm new in town. Even though I super liked her, I was still kind of unsure, and almost bailed when she told me to come visit her. But alas, I did. I met her at her sorority. She's 20, I'm 22, a recent college grad. 

She showed me around her university and we walked and talked for a while. We seemed to jive pretty well. We got back and we decided to go on a hike that we previously talked about. We thought it was close by, but it ended up being an hour drive, giving us plenty of time to talk. On the hike, I felt very much like she was attracted to me. I honestly wasn't sure if I liked her yet though. We drove back and by the time I dropped her off we had spent like 5-6 hours with each other. We obviously got along. Standing outside my car I totally could've kissed her. But again, I wasn't sure. I left her, and we agreed to hang out again. 

The next week we continued to text every day, pretty regularly. She was overly nice about everything. She read stuff I was working on in school (I write a lot). She even recommended me for an internship I just did an interview for. She also mentioned a movie she really wanted to see, so naturally I told her I could take her. It was actually a strange situation because the movie was playing at her university that weekend as well, and we talked about either going with her friends on campus or by ourselves. We went by ourselves and I paid for the tickets since she could've gone for free anyway. 

So I pick her up and we go to the movie. Things are going well. It was kind of uncomfortable not saying anything for two hours, but I survived. We finished and started talking about the movie. We were the last ones to leave the theater. Realizing I hadn't made any plans afterward I asked her if she was hungry or anything. She insisted on buying me dinner since I bought the tickets. 

So then we start wandering around the mall looking for a place to eat. And that's when the magic happens. I don't know why but I started liking her there. Looking into her eyes felt amazing. Conversation was seamless. We would get too caught up in talking and walking we could barely decide on a place to eat. We settled on a somewhat fancy Italian place, and we split a pizza as to not go too crazy. So we finished up and I drive her back (I made a few wrong turns partly because I'm new in town and partly because I was distracted talking to her. She didn't seem to mind). 

We get back and I realize, welp it's now or never. I park the car and before she has a chance to go I say something like ""listen I know the way we met is kind of silly, but I really like you and want to take you on a date if that's something you're interested in."" I don't remember exactly what she said, but she looked excited and said yes. So then we talked for like 15 minutes longer in the car. She had to get up early in the morning for a function, so she couldn't stay out too long. I wanted to kiss her so bad, but the way my seats are aligned it would have been very difficult. If I was smarter I could've asked her to walk her to the door or something. Regardless I was just very happy she said yes. I should've been more concrete about a day, our schedules didn't really line up. We said one of two days and that we'd figure it out. 

I got back that night to my place and we texted a few times before going to bed. Texted the next day regularly again, not about any details though. Monday I figure out I have a class cancelled on Thursday and offer to take her out then. Previously she said she was free that night. She says maybe, and after this she starts responding slower to my texts, still responding though. Naturally I did too since it was during the week. 

Thursday comes along and we're texting and she says she's actually busy. And not just that she's busy that night, but for like two more weeks. Two weeks seemed like a lot of time to wait for a date, but I felt like I didn't have much choice. I just said we'd do something once she has time. At this point a friend (female) of mine says to give her some space and stop texting her. So I wait two days and respond with a simple 👌🏻 after she said ok to going out when she's free. Didn't hear anything. So then three days later I just check in and see how she's doing. Still says she's busy, and says she's waiting till the 21st and ""all will be well."" She asks how I'm doing too. I ask what is on the 21st? And say I'm well and a little of what I'm doing. 

And that's it. Haven't heard from her since. That was Monday. It's Thursday morning now. It's the longest we've gone without talking. It is true that she does have a million things going on from talking to her before, but there's no way she wouldn't have time to send a text. She's made one Facebook post (although political) in the meantime (she also posted something on instagram briefly for VDay with her girlfriend and then deleted it--probably means nothing but strange). The problem is I really like her now, especially after not hearing from her. It's weird. Not sure what to do or where I went wrong. 

So my questions are: 

Is she just not interested?
Is there any chance she is legit busy and will still go out with me?
Is there anything I can do to fix the situation?
If not, where did I go wrong? Any obvious mistakes?
Or is this just a case of her just not being into me?
Did she just want to be friends? 

TL;DR: I super like a girl I tinder, we talk, meet up, I'm not sure about her. We are very friendly over text. We meet again, I grow to like her and ask her out. She says yes. Didn't kiss her. We couldn't nail down a date, but when we do eventually she ends up being busy. She says ""all will be well on the 21st,"" I ask what that means, and I haven't heard from her since (which was this past Monday).

The interview was entirely behavioural (this was the second interview after HR), and during the interview they mentioned that I should be proud that I made it to the interview as they received a ton of applications, and whether I sent in my transcript or not. When I said I didn't because I just applied directly and not through school postings, they said I should send it in to them after the interview. During the interview, they mentioned worst mark in a course (which was already asked in the screening) and I told them I had one F (it is a rather important course in CS as it is a data structures and algorithms course that I am retaking currently) but I'm not ashamed to admit it as I had some personal issues. The interview went well, however it seemed to be that after I mentioned that part, they weren't too interested anymore as before I left the interview and asked about how this process will go, they mentioned because you've made it this far, even if the offer doesn't come through from us I'm sure you'll hear back from a lot of other companies. They were quite impressed with my work, however, so if not for my grades I think I had a good shot in getting that job.  They also mentioned that they currently only have one intern slot available but they possibly will get more and that would change things. I think I may have a chance for that second intern position, however it's not the company I want to work at the most and I am still awaiting to hear back from two other companies (one of which the interview went fairly well but I'm not certain that I'll get an offer as it is also a competitive company, and the other one I'm awaiting to hear back from after completing their challenge).. When I was about to leave the interview room, they did not ask for my transcript again nor give me an email to send my transcript to. They did take my email address though and I'm wondering if I should just email the HR that I was in contact with to still send my transcript in even though I don't think it'll help me get the job there because just seemed that they want to filter ones with better grades? Or should I just wait until they email me for transcripts, in case they're still interested? "
5ufqpc,5,2017-02-16,Can a Tcl script auto-generate compile order for Modelsim ?,Clerus,FPGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/5ufqpc/can_a_tcl_script_autogenerate_compile_order_for/,"Good evening engineers of reddit,

This might be somewhat off-topic but does concern FPGA designing tricks.

I have recently started my End-Of-Studies internship and, for the very first time, I am tackling a project which regroups quite a few vhdl files and interdependant packages (around 50).

Until then, I was content with simply having a sim.do file which contained a big vcom line that i filled with my sources in the right compile order determined using Modelsim GUI's ""Auto-Generate Compile-Order"" functionality. This can't really be used in this context and is a pain to modify.

There must be a better way as I can't believe engineers worldwide would all go through the pain of typing and ordering filenames without someone coming up with a better way around this problem.
Yet I have not found any script example that tackle this issue and I'm not proficient enough with Tcl to think of a solution.

Did anyone figure it out ?


Thank you for reading :)

5ufrj2,28,2017-02-16,Anecdotes from the Gulag and Soviet,Pherma95,HistoryAnecdotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/5ufrj2/anecdotes_from_the_gulag_and_soviet/,"All of these comes from Anne Applebaums Pulitzer winning book ""Gulag, a History"", a fantastic book filled with anecdotes to the brim.

My favorite anecdote is about a Hungarian weather forecaster on the radio. The Soviets saw potential in the radio and were extra curious about it. This was a few years before 1956 in which Hungary would revolt against the Soviet system, but tensions were still high between the nations.

The man walks into his office and sits down before his radio and begins to read the latest forecasts. It seemed to be a cold front approaching from the east, he did his job and reported it. Big mistake.

The KGB was listening to him and clearly understood the implication in what he said: Soviet, approaching from the east, is bad and cold weather - and the Hungarians better prepare themselves for them. They moved to arrest him the same night. A late night knock on the door and he was on his way to the Gulag (I think, she does not expand on his fate).

------------------------------

Another good one is [Nikolaj Starostin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Starostin), a footballer so good that he was recruited by football interested party members to create a hyper-team, Spartacus Moscow (Spartak Moscow). it just happened to become the chief rival of Dynamo Moscow, which in turn was a team run by the Secret Police Department, and CSKA Moscow, run by the Red Army. 
Even worse for poor Nikolaj was that the chief of the Secret Police, Lavrentiy Beria, had been humiliated in the 20ies in a match against Nikolaj. It just happened to turned out that Beria would become the chief over the Soviet Secret police. 

Off to the Gulag with him. 

He even said he was relieved to finally be arrested, he had been on high alert about it for a while, according to Applebaum. The tragedy of being too good.

-------------------

Then we also had the [Kengir Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kengir_uprising). Gulag interns rose up and took over their camp following the death of Stalin. They managed to take over the camp and while this sounds like the start of something out of Arkham Asylum, it actually became the complete opposite. It turned into a regular society (well, as regular a society can be within a prison)

The interns organized themselves, elected leaders, and began to strategize. They managed to construct a radio(!!!) and broadcast propaganda about their situation, their arrest and everything else that the government wanted to conceal.

During their brief 40 day liberation they wrote poetry, composed songs, arranged marriages between interns with an imprisoned Priest to legitimize the union.

Sadly, the Soviet tanks then rolled in and ended their brief freedom. Which might've been good, since they had no way to grow food.

------------------------

The last one I'll mention is about the *actual* criminals. Applebaum makes a difference between ""political"" and actual criminals. She writes a lot about the relations between the two classes but what I think makes the best anecdotes is the so called Thieves Law. An honor-system where upholding your promises was required. If you did not you were as good as dead, an outcast in the eyes of the dominant class in the prison.

Anne mentions two very appalling cases. The first one is about a prisoner who made a bet in an card-game. If he won he would get another piece of bread. If he lost, he would be branded with penis in the face, literally *branded*. He lost the wager and thus his face was pressed into a branding iron and was scarred for life.

Another anecdote was recorded a prisoner who would later write about his ordeals, Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko. He met a deaf-mute in his camp. It turned out that he was a normal criminal who had lost a wager. His bet was that he would not talk for three years if he lost - he lost. However, what makes his story so remarkable is that he lost the bet *in another Gulag*. He was still so terrified of the criminals control of the Gulags to break his vow because if he did, he would die a most horrible death.

That's all for today. I might write some more anecdotes from the book, some horrible ones about Women and their children maybe, in another day.

Hope you enjoyed!"

I'm currently in France doing an internship because of my university. It's been almost two months and I'm going back to my country in March.


Me, my SO and his best friend [20 M] (let's call him Tom) are from the the same university, except Tom and SO are childhood friends. I know Tom from university (for almost 4 years), we were always very close, always there for each other and stuff, so close in fact that in the beginning of our relationship my boyfriend would get jealous as a joke. But during the last 3-4 months I'm not as close with Tom anymore, I don't know why, nothing really happened.

Ok so here's what happened.
A week ago I found out through a friend, that Tom and his friend with benefits were trying to convince my boyfriend to find a girl to spend the night with and go somwhere for a weekend trip with them. At first, I didn't believe my friend, but then she sent me evidence in the form of screenshots. However, I didn't tell anything to my SO at the time.

Two days later, my SO and I got into a fight because he got jealous (I went to Monaco with my girl friend and two guy friends whom he doesn't know at all). So as we were fighting over that, he actually told about the whole weekend trip himself, he said 'I could have agreed and have cheated on you and you wouldn't even know but I didn't because I love you, and I would feel awful if I did something like that'.

He didn't go, I know that for sure because I saw photos from the trip on Tom's instagram, and that exact night I was skyping with my boyfriend, he was in his room.

It is a little ridiculous of him to compare my trip to Monaco with friends (nothing more) with cheating on me, but still, I see why he told that in the heat of the moment.
When we were arguing I brushed this whole cheating story off, because I wasn't really thinking straight and just wanted to end our fight. But now that I think of it, this is not ok and I need advice. 

What would you do/how would you react if you were me?
Should I talk to Tom, tell him that he is an awful friend. 
Should I talk to my boyfriend and tell him that I don't like what his best friend did and that I feel uncomfortable that he's friends with someone who wants to talk him into cheating on his girlfriend?

I'm so lost, I've never dealt with a problem like this. Please help me...

EDIT: I warned my bf about the Monaco trip beforehand and told him that if doesn't want me to go, I won't and he was fine with it, but then when I came back he got super mad.

Didn't hear anything. So then three days later I just check in and see how she's doing. Still says she's busy, and says she's waiting till the 21st and ""all will be well."" She asks how I'm doing too. I ask what is on the 21st? And say I'm well and a little of what I'm doing. 

And that's it. Haven't heard from her since. That was Monday. It's Thursday morning now. It's the longest we've gone without talking. It is true that she does have a million things going on from talking to her before, but there's no way she wouldn't have time to send a text. She's made one Facebook post (although political) in the meantime (she also posted something on instagram briefly for VDay with her girlfriend and then deleted it--probably means nothing but strange). The problem is I really like her now, especially after not hearing from her. It's weird. Not sure what to do or where I went wrong. 

So my questions are: 

Is she just not interested?
Is there any chance she is legit busy and will still go out with me?
Is there anything I can do to fix the situation?
If not, where did I go wrong? Any obvious mistakes?
Or is this just a case of her just not being into me?
Did she just want to be friends? 

TL;DR: I super like a girl I tinder, we talk, meet up, I'm not sure about her. We are very friendly over text. We meet again, I grow to like her and ask her out. She says yes. Didn't kiss her. We couldn't nail down a date, but when we do eventually she ends up being busy. She says ""all will be well on the 21st,"" I ask what that means, and I haven't heard from her since (which was this past Monday).

5ugol5,1,2017-02-16,Help: Where does SQL keep its tables?,tribbletron,SQLServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQLServer/comments/5ugol5/help_where_does_sql_keep_its_tables/,"Hello, this is my first time at this reddit. I'm a sysadmin intern. The only thing I know about SQL is that it's about databases and people can specialize in it cause it's so big.

An hour ago, my supervisor slipped me a note:

""dump of below tables in SQL server (save as csv):

[dbo].[FP_FILE_PROCESSING_ERROR]

[dbo].[DC_DOCUMENT]""

I figured looking for 2 files should be easy.

Things I Tried:

(1) I remote into our Windows Server, run a file search using variations of the file names, and find nothing.

(2) I Google ""where is dbo file sql"" and discovered I should look in D:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.SQL2012\MSSQL\DATA\ and I feel like I'm in the right place cause there's a ton of stuff in here, but I still can't find the files. I also learn that a dbo is NOT a file type. And that maybe what I'm really looking for are .mdf and .ldf files.

(3) I used Admin Tools to see if there's some kind of SQL management software installed. Nothing. 

(4) But in Admin Tools, I do see ODBC Data Sources 32 and 64-bit are installed. Which tells me SQL drivers are installed in this server. But I can't understand anything else in there so I don't touch anything.

(5) I run Get-Help sql in PowerShell and get as far as playing with Invoke-SQLcmd. Still no closer to finding out where the files are. 

My supervisor has no idea how to find the tables either. He just thought he'd give me a shot at it. An agency contracted to archive a ton of paperwork for us, had been asking him for these two files.

What should *I* do to begin to understand SQL? I want to know enough to be useful from the IT side.

I am a student in a Steel Design I course and my teacher is requiring that we use math software to write programs to solve problems. He will not let us use excel, stating that the industry is moving away from Excel and towards more sophisticated software. While I see the value in programming, I am not wholly convinced of his position on Excel. I work as an intern in a structural engineering office and all we use is Excel. So my question is, how often do you use other math software and do you think that the industry id moving away from Excel?"
5uif21,5,2017-02-16,A weird situation that's left me confused,3rdLevelRogue,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/5uif21/a_weird_situation_thats_left_me_confused/,"About two weeks ago, the professor at my college that does the recruiting for the actuarial and mathematical degree tracts informed me that a very prominent insurance company was looking for interns and potentially full-time employees and all I had to do with email my resume to someone. What made this situation even better was that I had met this someone several times at career fairs and had talked to her for a few hours about the company, her position, the job, and all that jazz. I wasn't too surprised when I got an email back that I'd be getting a preliminary phone interview in a day or so, though I was surprised since I'm what I would consider to be the most average actuarial student.

I schedule this phone thing, get the call that's supposed to be just a half-an-hour, but end up laughing, joking, and shooting the shit with the guy for over an hour. The guy hangs up after telling me that even though he has no control over in-person interviews, he's going to really recommend that I get to come in and meet with everyone. If I said that I was ecstatic, it'd be an understatement.

So, I get an email the next day, asking me for my availability over the course of the next week. I tell them that I absolutely cannot make it one of the 10 business days because I'm sitting for FM (2nd try) and after another day goes by, I'm emailed directions to one of the main offices, a collection of names of everyone I'll be meeting with and when, a list of several nearby hotels and motels to crash at if I don't feel like making a 3 hour drive home after the day is done, and everything seems peachy. An hour later, though, I get an email back that tells me that the interview will unfortunately have to be rescheduled, but no explanation or reasoning for it, even when I responded asking what had went wrong.

It's been 3 days, and neither the HR lady, my contact that I know, or phone interview guy have responded to any emails. A classmate of mine, whose name I recognized on the initial email about phone interview times, got the same treatment. We're both pretty much confused as to what has happened and why we suddenly got the silent treatment when we both were on our way to get an in-person interview.

Should I be worried? Is this typical and just occasionally happens?"
5uiy11,40,2017-02-16,My story: From Carnegie Mellon to Hell and Back,throwmywaybuddy,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5uiy11/my_story_from_carnegie_mellon_to_hell_and_back/,"I figured I would post this since I haven't ever been asked to share my story in NA meetings.

In undergrad, I managed to graduate with a 2.6GPA, but fortunately made a lot of connections/had internships. However, I would get adderall and xanax from friends, and this occasionally caused a lot of problems. I also used xanax to be more social at parties and life was good, or so it seemed. 

After graduating college, due to my good GRE scores and references, I got into the top IS management program at Carnegie Mellon University (in Pittsburgh). The first semester, I had shitty grades, but I was able to transfer to another program and retain my scholarship. In the second semester, while doing pretty well, someone there introduced me to the darknet. I still had the propensity for using Xanax, but was unable to find any in Pittsburgh. At that time I remember telling myself, this is where it all ends. By the way, this was around 2013-2014.

I also had an affliction for Adderall, which on the DNMs resulted in me ordering speed paste. Long story short, my drug use escalated, and in the stress of the graduate program, I began to take so much xanax that I did things such as:

1. I took a bus to another part of Pittsburgh, yet forgot that I took a bus (this was actually off of a gram of etizolam powder). I posted to Facebook that my car had been stolen. In the process of trying to find my car, I took my book bag, which contained my laptop, iPad, and phone, to a random restaurant and told them to hold it. I then left the restaurant, did God knows what for hours, then had the police take me home. I then returned the next day, cancelled my unlimited data plan with ATT, and bought an iPhone 6 on credit with Tmobile. Luckily, after a find my iPhone alert signaled a random restaurant, I went there and they still had my items, along with the story of how it got there. Thank God they didn’t find the weed that was in my bag. I then went down to my parking garage to find my car sitting with the trunk open.
2. Had sex with a girl who had herpes, unprotected. Fortunately I did not get herpes. Yes I continue to get tested regularly.
3. Cheated on GF multiple times.
4. Blacked out in CMU lecture hall, unhooking the presentation equipment at 5am and connecting my Xbox to play video games. Security came in to find me wrapped up in a blanket and slurring my speech. 
5. Told my classmates about the girl who had herpes (who was also a classmate). This was after I had suffered a breakdown in class and felt that my classmates were being mean to me. I would often be jacked up on speed and interrupt the class constantly. I can only imagine how this looked lol.
6. Masturbated so much that I got a staph infection under my left bicep.
7. Cut both feet due to walking into a picture frame on the floor after a night of speed binging and furious masturbation. This required many stitches.
8. Got fired from a job with a ride-sharing company due to being fucked up while behind the wheel.


Needless to say, I did not make the cutoff for GPA that semester, and was banished back to my homestate. Luckily, I had the resilience to try again and was accepted into a graduate program locally. I also had an assistantship which paid for my tuition but required me to look at violent death victims every day, which probably had an effect on me, but I am pretty morbidly curious. 

I did eventually get my Masters degree, after spending the summer at inpatient rehab and generally learning to live again. Before that, I suffered a major psychotic break which led to me losing my funding for the program though. I also suffered a 3 seizures in one day.

Now a days, I only have a vyvanse prescription, and I have put the other drugs down (including weed). I hope to continue to stay clean, and count my blessings.

Thanks for reading. This is only part of my story, but I guess it is the best part.

5ujb1q,7,2017-02-16,Software development for ENTPs. Hoping for some input from current and former developers.,mewanthoneycombnow,entp,https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/5ujb1q/software_development_for_entps_hoping_for_some/,"I'm a computer science major and trying to figure out my next move. I read through all the past threads on here about software development as a potential career for ENTPs. The data I have from MBTI suggests that systems and application programming are really of average attractiveness for ENTPs...meaning that ENTPs are not more or less well-represented in these occupations than would be expected given their prevalence in the general population.

I'm considering getting an internship in front-end dev and currently am building a web app with a team for one of my classes. Learning HTML/CSS/js. I confess that programming up till now has felt fairly tedious, demanding, and detail-oriented to me. Having to very methodically write down my code by hand to ensure no mistakes requires a high level of precision that seems somewhat opposed to the ENTP tendency for big picture thinking and overarching pattern recognition. 

I'd like to hear about your experiences past and current.

What do you think of software development (front-end, back-end, everything else) as a career? 

What are the best roles/niches that ENTPs can and should fill in the software world? (job role, company, industry, front-end/back-end, etc.)"
5ujnvg,121,2017-02-16,Co-intern became [f]wb [FM],[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/5ujnvg/cointern_became_fwb_fm/,"Sophomore year of college I finally landed an internship at a company close to work. As a biology internship I mainly spent my time either in a lab analyzing data, or some days we would be in offices entering new data.

The company hired 2 interns from my school and 3 from the other near by smaller school. The intern from my school was a girl named Kelsea that I had seen around campus before but never spoke to. Eventually we got along putting aside the different sororities we were in. The other three were one girl named Emily and two guys, Richard and Hunter.

Richard had that classic frat boy look with wave styled hair cut and constantly talked about partying. Hunter was the more quiet kid of guy that easily had a foot on Richard and looked like he played basketball. He was around 6'5 with toned but not huge arms and a shy look to his face. 

At first the three of us girls were attracted to Richard and competed for his attention. Hunter always tagged along in our conversations but always seemed more focused on the work. We had a texting group together so we could send each other jokes as well as make small talk during work to keep each other entertained.

About three weeks into the internship Hunter asked if anyone could pick him up for work the next day due to car trouble. Richard joked about having a cheap car, but Emily offered and brought him in. She couldn't give him a ride later that day so I said I had plenty of room in my car and could bring him home later that day.

We talked more that day about sports we both played (turns out he plays hockey not basketball) and different injuries we have had. He was a really nice guy and started to break out of his shy shell more.

Later that day I drove him home and we talked more about life. I offered to drive him the rest of the week since his car needed a new part. We continued growing closer and I started to become attracted to him more than Richard. Even though I am 5'3 and he towers over me like a skyscraper he made me feel safe with his height. 

At the end of the week all the interns went out for happy hour to conclude the hard weeks work. Hunter whispered to me saying that he would buy my drinks to make up for gas money earlier in the week. I took him up on his offer and ended up drinking a lot more than I had planned.

He ended up having to drive me home in my car, but was then faced with the dilemma of getting to his house. In my tipsy and frisky state I offered for him to come in and grab some food since it was still early in the evening. He accepted and walked me up to my apartment.

He offered to cook us both something to eat since I did not want to cook while in my current state of mind. He took off his dress shirt so it wouldn't get dirty revealing his muscular pecs underneath the thin fabric. I was starting to get turned on. The quiet yet polite man from work was in my house cooking for me in a sexy tight undershirt. 

I tried to help but his strong hands guided me to the table and sat me down. ""Sit here and relax Sarah"". I did as he said for all of about 1 minute before getting back up and wrapping my arms around him as he faced the stove. I moved my arms up and down his muscular frame until I ""accidentally"" brushed across his waist. 

He didn't stop me as I continued to move my hands around his body and feel my ay back down to his waist. I ran my hand over the cold metal belt buckle before feeling him become excited beneath his zipper. I massaged him through his pants as he grew bigger before he turned around and took me in his arms. Our kiss lingered as we felt each others bodies before his picked me up and sat me down on my table.

I pulled up on his shirt indicating I wanted it off. When he took it off it revealed a sculpted chest with muscles leading down to his now excited work pants. He unbuckled them and pulled them off leaving on his grey boxer briefs. I could see the outline of his cock as it desperately pushed against the material of his briefs.

He got not his knees and started unzipping my pencil skirt. I kicked off my flats as he pulled off my skirt. He kissed his way down my leg until I could feel his hot breath breathing through the thin fabric of my lace panties. He pulled them aside and slowly lowered his mouth onto my pussy. 

I spread my legs eagerly as he parted my lips with his tongue working his way slowly to my clit. He increased his speed slowly over what felt like a half an hour making me squirm and beg for him to fuck me. He stood without hesitation, pulled his cock through the fly of his briefs and teased me by rubbing his cock up and down my wet pussy.

I reached for his dick and pulled him closer begging him to put it in. When he entered I gasped for air not realizing his size. I slowly adjusted as he entered me and pushed in as far as he could go. He waited a minute then pulled out and started pumping into me slowly. 

He leaned down and kissed me as I bit his lip and moaned into his mouth. He fucked me slowly as I wrapped my legs around him and pulled him close. Just as I was about to cum we heard our boiling pot of water boil over the stove causing a mess. He pulled out, put in his pants and turned off the stove before my stove got ruined.

Although the moment was ruined, we laughed it off, cleaned up and went back to making dinner.

After dinner we got back to our original activity and he provided me with extra dessert :)"
5uk1if,2,2017-02-16,is my resume a hindrance? (and other pleas for advice),alecholic,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/5uk1if/is_my_resume_a_hindrance_and_other_pleas_for/,"I'm a recent grad who has spent over two months looking unsuccessfully for a job. The best luck I've had was a single interview for a job that ultimately threw up too many red flags for my comfort. I've gotten preliminary options from The Creative Group staffing agents and contacts from job fairs who dug my portfolio, and ultimately got nowhere. I realize that two months can be a slim amount of time for a job search, but it's long enough to have gotten me anxious that I'm doing it all wrong. Or worse, that I AM all wrong and my ""presentables"" are turning off potential employers.

I'm referring mainly to my [resume](https://alecrsdesign.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/resume_alec-stevenson1.pdf). While I feel it is well-designed (although please feel to rip it apart), I'm afraid that turn-offs are lurking within, in the vein of implying that I'm under-experienced, over-compensating, or maybe even under-committed. I'll go semi-chronologically:

1. **My best education seems irrelevant.** I've struggled with career options (and a little bit of until-recently-untreated depression). Even though I did grow up with some artistic talent, I decided in high school to pursue the ""practical"" route of an economics degree. And I did have a lot of interest in the subject (spurred on by a great high school teacher), but I realized too late in that the field was not for me. Instead of looking for work in the field I grasped around various small freelance gigs and wage jobs. So maybe it's just sitting on my resume like a one-ton hood ornament, looking impressive but signaling little more than that I'm wishy-washy with my life choices and quite a bit older than other fresh talent.

2. **My freelance experience is old and fleeting; my recent work experience is irrelevant.** The design work I did after getting my first degree was paid, but for acquaintances and mutual friends; workable for them but not quite portfolio-worthy. The jobs I worked in the interim were just ways to get by with flexible scheduling; I did some creative work at those jobs when possible, but not often.

3. **Yes, that Art Institute.** For-profit trade schools have spotty and suspect reputations for good reason. Now I might be guilty of under-researching a bit, but for the location and time frame it was actually a convenient option. And I will vouch for most of the instructors, who are working professionals and offered solid training and advice. Still, I'm afraid that maybe people are looking at this and going ""ugh, this guy's not legit."" Especially since it's an Associate's degree.

4. **Given the above, are my awards meaningless?** My work did impress the pants off the faculty, and I was considered among the top students. I even beat out bachelors students in my class for Best Portfolio (and they all did top-notch work, some I considered better than mine). But if employers don't think the school's any good, these accolades show a Big Fish in a Small Pond at best (and, at worst, fruit of a poisoned tree).

Of course, another possibility is that my [portfolio](https://alecrsdesign.com/) isn't cutting it; you can take a look and offer honest critique. Then there's the issue that I suffer from a decent amount of social anxiety and can sometimes be awkward in person. I might even be on the spectrum; I can freeze up during interactions with the slightest pressure riding on it. My instructors liked me but I had a hard time making friends and connections. I'm terrified of landing an interview with an awesome and hip design agency and then turning them off personally (All the agencies who profess a casual atmosphere and no-bullshit tone should be attractive, but they just say to me ""you're not cool enough to work here"").

If you've made it through the slog of this post, a) thanks and b) what can I do? Besides beefing up my portfolio with personal projects, which I'm working on. Should I restructure, tighten up or throw out my resume? Should I be more aggressive with my search, calling up each and every employer I apply to, or maybe even ship my resume and portfolio to companies that aren't even hiring? How do I build up good connections or even get internships now that I'm out of school? Do I look like I'm full of shit?

Any advice would be appreciated."
5uk42a,171,2017-02-16,"David Seaman is a Fraud, Ties to George Soros",roundhouse1776,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uk42a/david_seaman_is_a_fraud_ties_to_george_soros/,"If you don't know who David Seaman is, he's the self-appointed head spokesman of the Pizzagate movement. If you are a pizzagater, this association should make you very nervous, because David Seaman is a mentally unstable con man. Let's start with some background.

In 2007, Seaman began an internship with Jezebel. After only a few short months, he was so hated and reviled that Jezebel ran a hit piece on him, describing him as a ""self-promotional whore"" and then fired him. In the article, they publish a profile that Seaman had written about himself, which reveals the scary depths of his self-involved nature.

http://jezebel.com/270369/self-promotion-guru-david-seaman-totally-got-our-memo-shat-all-over-it

http://jezebel.com/274434/in-which-we-get-closure-with-self-promotional-whore-david-seaman

In 2008, Seaman wrote a book called, **Dirty Little Secrets of Buzz: How to Attract Massive Attention for Your Business, Your Product, or Yourself.** In this book, you can get advice such as ""Always be controversial and outrageous in everything you do"" and ""Enemies are more important than friends."" You'll also learn interesting tidbits such as how he loves Bill Maher and Michael Moore, and hates Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly. This seems to be very contradictory, seeing as how he claims to be such a huge Donald Trump supporter. He also refers to himself as a ""veteran promotional stunt planner,"" not a reporter or journalist. In the ""About the Author"" section, you'll find this info: **Seaman is the founder of Shutterline Interactive, a vehicle for rapidly deploying new publicity stunts.**

https://www.amazon.com/Dirty-Little-Secrets-Buzz-Attention/dp/1402213379

In August 2009, before the release of his book, Seaman claimed he would run naked through Times Square if his book didn't make the Top 100 list on Amazon. The book barely cracked the Top 200,000. He didn't follow through on the streaking promise. David Seaman has never met a promise that he didn't break.

http://www.adweek.com/digital/pewdiepies-downfall-shows-the-potential-dangers-of-social-influencer-marketing-for-brands/

Also in 2009, Seaman does an interview with Business Beat Live. In the interview he says, **""I would protest gravity if I thought it was going to get me buzz"".**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEA0CbVWU0

Seaman calls Joe Rogan a liar. He claims that Rogan promised him a role as a political contributor on his podcast, but never followed through. Rogan's producer, Brian Redban, implies in a tweet that Seaman is mentally unwell.

In the same article, he talks a little bit about he holds a grudge against his family because ""they didn't have my back when I needed it"". Knowing his history, he probably tried to con them, just like everyone else he's ever met.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-seaman/what-happened-to-bitcoin_b_11410280.html

If you are familiar with Seaman's Youtube channel, then you're aware that he is constantly shilling for Bitcoin and Goldmoney. Here's some info on Goldmoney:

""Goldmoney Inc has its headquarters located in Toronto Canada and in Saint Helier Jersey.[6] The company is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and has a market capitalization of $312 million as of February 27, 2016. GoldMoney Inc. investors and backers include Eric Sprott, Albert D. Friedberg, **George Soros,** Adam Fleming, and Canadian Banks Canaccord Genuity.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldMoney

Yes that's right, one of the principle investors in Goldmoney is none other than George Soros! David Seaman can not claim ignorance on this subject either, because **in an article on the Huffington Post he writes, ""The company is funded by a number of savvy financial elites including precious metals entrepreneur Eric Sprott and the legendary Soros family.""**

For a guy who claims to hate pedophilia crimes and Hillary Clinton and John Podesta so much, why is he so proud to be associated with George Soros?

**Also of note, Goldmoney paid for Seaman to attend this year's Super Bowl.**

    DavidSeaman recently won the #Supergold contest and got to go to the Super Bowl!

http://community.goldmoney.com/discussion/2581/david-seaman-bitgold-goldmoney

Seaman's constant praise of Bitcoin is also curious, considering in July of last year he had this to say about Bitcoin in another Huffington Post article:

""The trolls and narrowminded Bitcoin bagholders pushing Ethereum “Classic” on an unsuspecting public are not the ultimate reason I’m selling off much of my Bitcoin tonight - that’s just another indication to me that Bitcoin is in a weak position. Ultimately, however, my decision is grounded in economic self-interest. I see optimism and amazing ideas being built out in Ethereum, and I don’t see anything close to this level in Bitcoin at the moment. Shortly after I file this story, I’ll be selling off 80% of my personal Bitcoin holdings; or more accurately, converting them into Ether, on Coinbase.""

So he's bullish on Bitcoin, yet sold off 80% of his holdings? This guy just can't stop contradicting himself.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-seaman/ethereum-classic-another_b_11173314.html

In August of 2016, Seaman claims to have been fired from the Huffington Post for writing an article about Hillary's health. This is false, as he couldn't be fired, because he was never on the HuffPo payroll. He was a contributor and unpaid blogger and had his publishing rights revoked, he was not fired. **There is not a single person who has corroborated his claim that he was ""fired"" because of his Hillary article.** Judging by his employment history, it's just as likely he was ""fired"" for being a self-promoting asshole.

Let's move onto Pizzagate. Seaman started ""reporting"" on Pizzagate as early as November of last year. He owes the large following he has on Youtube and Twitter to the Pizzagate investigation, so you would think he would show some love for the hardworking Pizzagate investigators, right? WRONG. He's constantly taking credit for other peoples' work and has done exactly ZERO research on his own.

He has not evolved his coverage of Pizzagate one bit in over 3 months, it still consists mostly of ""Hillary is evil, lock her up"" ""Podesta is a pedophile, lock him up"". This guy is not a journalist, he's an anti-journalist.

There has been a lot of evidence discovered during the Pizzagate investigation, and there has also been a lot of stuff that has been proven to be fake. Seaman is constantly latching on to the most sensationalist, fake parts of Pizzagate and reporting it as fact and ignores all the valuable evidence that has been found. This has a huge negative effect on the credibility of Pizzagate.

He's repeatedly made claims that his life was in danger and ""they"" are out to get him. At one point he even claimed that 2 policemen were stationed outside his home for his protection. He claims to be so frightened for his life that he sleeps with a gun next to his bed. Of course, no one has ever been able to corroborate any of these claims.

Seaman has been an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, but just yesterday tweeted this: **Was @realDonaldTrump's election just a brilliant head fake to give the potbellied pedophiles in the Deep State another 4 years of survival?**

https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/831546919579119616

Today, he is back to being a Trump supporter and hashtagging MAGA on his tweets. He can't seem to keep his story straight for more than a day at a time.

He's repeatedly claimed that his work regarding Pizzagate is done and his place in the history books is secure, because the authorities are going to arrest everyone, and he won't speak about it anymore. Each of these claims has lasted about 5 minutes, until he starts talking about it again. In fact, he can't shut up about it, it's all he talks about.

A little over a week ago, Seaman went on an epic Twitter rant about Antarctica, Flat Earth theory, Mandela Effect, and aliens. This was an obvious attempt to lump Pizzagate in with fringe conspiracies. He then deleted his Twitter account. And then he reactivated his Twitter account. He then claimed Twitter deleted all his followers, except they didn't. This guy needs help.

He claims to have insider ""sources"". Every single time he's made a prediction based on his ""sources"", he's been wrong.

This past Sunday, February 12th, he sent out this tweet: **Pizzagate is real. I was told arrests by midnight or early tomorrow, if that is not so, my source's confidentiality might dry up. Oops!**

https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/830889197699526656

He was obviously trying to capitalize on the questionable claim by Youtuber Titus Frost, who made a video saying that child porn was found on Comet Ping Pong's website and that the police have been given all the evidence.

He was dead wrong, as usual. The next day, as people are questioning him and wondering if he will give up his source as he claims, he has another Twitter meltdown. **His evidence that there should have been arrests is ""Look at Tony Podesta's eyes"". That's some quality journalism there, David.** Constantly pressed to reveal his source, he says ""My source is Wikileaks.org"". Indicating that he has no source other than the Podesta emails that we've all read. He continues calling anyone who questions him shills, trolls, and David Brock employees for the rest of the day.

Later in the day, well past the timeline from his ""source"", he tweets a link to an article about the arrest of Jeffrey Sandusky. He claims this is a high level, high profile arrest and that his ""source"" was right all along.

https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/831233313478094848

During this same rant on February 13, he claims he was set up to be a fall guy, contradicting the later tweet that his ""source"" was right.

https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/831166795717423108

In this tweet, he throws the hardworking pizzagate researchers under the bus in an attempt to save his own credibility

https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/831167811363958784

If you've seen Seaman's YT videos, he's constantly talking about how Paypal and Youtube are out to get him by shutting off his income and trying to destory him financially. This of course leads to begging his fans for money via Patreon.

**He's on pace to make $55,000 per year from Patreon, which he claims goes toward ""legitimate production expenses.""**

In a tweet on 2/13/17, which is probably deleted because I can't find it, he claims he has $60,000 saved up and doesn't need money from his fans. So why are you constantly trying to get their money?

On February 14, in response to Hillary Clinton's Pizzagate tweet, he goes on yet another insane Twitter rant. He starts demanding justice and that people should take to the streets to protest. He sends crazy tweets directed at Hillary calling her evil bitch, a monster, a child rapist, and all sorts of other things. He calls for all the pedophiles to be hanged. Of course he provides no evidence for any of this like any sane Pizzagate investigator would do, he just screams about it like a lunatic.

He then starts tweeting falsities about Donald Trump, even though he claims to support him.

https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/831522338193575941

In this one, he claims Trump was planted by the Deep State to protect the pedophiles:

https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/831524560608440321

Go to his twitter page here: https://twitter.com/d_seaman to see all the ridiculous and demented things he is tweeting because frankly there are just too many to list. This is coming from a ""respected"" ""journalist"".

As you can see, all the information and evidence shows that David Seaman is clearly a fraudulent con man. He has been deceiving Pizzagate truthers from the very start, in an effort to boost his own fame and fortune. His intentions are not merely for personal gain either, he has been out to intentionally discredit Pizzagate by painting all investigators as unstable mentally ill lunatics. He has also had a massive negative influence on the credibility of Pizzagate, and he's reported it dishonestly and poorly the whole way and has repeatedly taken credit for other peoples' work.

This tweet, makes it abundantly clear what his agenda is. Someone asks him what he foresees for himself and he replies: **Worldwide fame, or an untimely death.**

https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/831331430433034240

If you are serious about Pizzagate and wanting to see the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes, you need to spread the word about the charlatan David Seaman, who claims to be on our side, but is clearly not.

**EDIT - DAVID SEAMAN RESPONSE VIDEO**

David Seaman made a response video to this post, when I posted it to voat last night. I encourage everyone who has read my post to watch it, to see firsthand how much of a liar and pathetic ""journalist"" Seaman is. His gullible followers ate it up as true to form he turned it around and pretends to be the victim.

Here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuJs3tBDKqI

-His posts on voat were deleted by a mod because he didn't follow the submission rules. He's completely lying about the photo ID stuff. The fact that he didn't have an account and doesn't even know the rules at the main pizzagate research forum goes to show just how much of a ""researcher"" he is.

-Claims that I'm accusing him of trying to sell his book. Complete and total lie, I never wrote or implied that a single time.

-Completely lies about the Super Bowl, no mention of Goldmoney."

^5:33 ^am, ^16 ^February ^2020, ^in *^Washington ^DC*

***

It's an unusually busy morning at [430 S. Capital Street](https://my.democrats.org/page/s/contact), with men and women alike scurrying down the halls in suits and dresses. One could only wonder why...

""I can't believe you got Carter in there"" one man said to another as they strode down the hall dodging and weaving the other hurried people in their way

""How'd you get him?"" he asked

""I promised him our support to get his [DLCC position](http://www.dlcc.org/)"" the other man answered

""Seriously?"" he questioned as he halted his movement

""Yes…?"" the other man answered ""Did I go over your head?"" he asked with a weary voice and slight cringe

""No,"" he cleared his throat ""Not at all, he was actually top of the list between me and the-""

""Oh thank god"" he gave a short sigh of relief ""I was worried I went over your head"" he said as a younger man in a grey suit walked up behind the paused men in the hall

The newcomer started to speak but before he could Shepard extended his hand and held his index finger up to silence him ""Yeah, you're fine, good job Wiles."" He moves his hand back to his side. ""Go in there and get the room ready I'll be in in a moment,"" he finished and turned to look at the newcomer as the other man left for the doors at the end of the hall

""What do you have Gils?"" he asked quickly

He takes a short breath ""We have confirmed that McConnell will be siding with Trump despite the ratings sir"" he said handing his report to Shepard 

He took a short three second look ""This is good"" he paused ""Really good work"" Shepard handed the papers back and looked him in the eyes. A short man Gils was, but not incompetent, his work and initiative more than made up for his less than average height

""Get me everything you can on those on his inner circle, his friends, reporters, writers, anyone who would follow that turtle"" he said in a rushed tone

Gils nodded as Shepard continued ""I want it on my desk in 24 hours, take 4 for lunch"" he said walking away

""I can do it in 12 without lunch!"" Gils shouted

Shepard does an about face and points with his index finger at Gils while still walking

Gils returns the favor for a second or two and walks down the other hall

Once out of view Shepard spins around towards the door and opens it.

The Men and Women patiently waiting on Shepard stand up with wide eyes, Shepard takes note and tells them to take their seats.

""Alright, is this everyone?"" he turns to Wiles the man who walked with him earlier, he gives a nod

""So, you already know what this is about, and you may have noticed the lack of interns and new people here, we're all veteran campaigners who worked with Obama, the Clintons, and Gore"" He put up a smirk ""Experienced campaigners"" he said

""What you do not know, is the fact that the Presidential Elections are the secondary objective of this campaign, our Primary objective, which we will pursue relentlessly, is the complete and utter destruction of the Republican Party"" he finished

The room has a wide array of looks ranging from laughing, to skepticism

""That said, we have outlined on the wall behind me..."" he motioned the slide operator ""Our plan for such a thing, this has been in the works for three years, it shoes every contingency every possible move and it's counter""

 The room now had a different but shared tone to it

""You've all been promised certain things unique to you, and should we succeed"" he paused, he wanted to remember the moment where absolute political dominance begins, he wanted to savor the moment where historians will look back and point to where the two party system was beginning to end.

""We will have achieved the greatest political victory in modern human history!""

There was whistling, clapping, and an abundance of excitement.

""Now let’s get to work""

5uk8nf,1,2017-02-16,Conflicted about what to do,dumb_engineer_studen,Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/5uk8nf/conflicted_about_what_to_do/,"This is a throwaway account.

I was accepted into the NUPOC program sometime ago. I haven't graduated from university yet so it's just the bi-annual physical tests for now. My security clearance is still being processed.

I told my recruiter and MEPS that I did not have any mental issues, and that I did not seek a counselor or psychiatrist.

I seem to have some sort of an undiagnosed mental issue though. At my engineering internships, I used it to my advantage by mentally running through multiple situations of something going wrong, and then taking actions to counteract that. Such as addressing safety issues, resolving logic conflicts in software code, and in general baby/idiot-proofing stuff to make it hard to cause an accident or at least have high fault-tolerance. I also saw through a phishing email once and reported it (although someone else in the company opened it and caused a massive malware incident on our network).

I had numerous praises and high recommendations at those internships and enjoyed working with the employees there. One manager said I was welcome to come back at anytime.

When it comes to personal relationships... it's a shitshow. I would assume the worst out of people and that they're out to cause harm. I would occasionally think that there's some sort of a conspiracy against me. I would often times take things personally, and if I don't quickly recognize that someone didn't mean to cause offense, I would start assuming things. And I find it hard to forgive people sometimes.

And the worst of all is that I don't trust my friends or family members with discussing those issues. In fact, something is telling me that someone is going to casually mention my issues to an interviewing investigator as my security clearance is still not complete, and that would blow up in my face.

I've been able to keep quiet, not let people know how I'm actually feeling and tried to find things to do to get my mind off of those thoughts, but after blowing up a friendship, I realized I may need help. Said friend even called me out on the ""taking things personally"". However, that means reporting an appointment with a counselor or psychiatrist to the Navy. And I've heard stories about people getting bent over by fraudulent enlistment.

I know this isn't going to end well if I don't figure out what to do. I don't want to end up becoming that crazy person, nor do I want to give up on the Navy.

EDIT: I suppose on the plus side, no nuclear reactors are going to blow up on my watch, assuming I didn't drive others around me insane..."
5uk9fl,57,2017-02-16,Newbie* 25F with 27M HUGE Valentines Day Fight. Is the issue a difference in personalities? Or am I just crazy?,Ameba4,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5uk9fl/newbie_25f_with_27m_huge_valentines_day_fight_is/,"


 My boyfriend of 4 years and i recently had a huge fight about him lying to me about watching porn regularly. It has come up before and I feel totally shitty for hating it. We used to have the most amazing kinky sex, and I felt so much intimacy, respect, and love.
... and then it all went to hell. 

He has a lot of issues with an addictive personality, depression, and motivation issues and I feel like the porn just has a dulling affect on him. He stopped for a while, and things were really happy in general, but then he started taking adderall and then starting watching porn again all the while failing out of school, unhappy, and angry.

We broke up, he moved out, and we got back together a few months later. He stopped the adderall and flashforward to now, he started doing lots of great things like working hard to graduate, an internship, working out. 

Our intimacy has not gotten back to where it was before. I feel like the trust is not there, because he has lied to me about so many things, and has (a times)issues managing his own personal issues when things get hard, blaming the day for why he has to take this or that substance or not do this or that. 

 I admit I'm an ""odd"" person. I am very into ethics, behavioral neuroscience, and spirituality and try to use them to ""parent myself"", because my parents were absent when I grew up. I am very empathetic, and struggled with depression, like him but now I am very into personal growth, and am motivated to be my best self. I am the kind of chick who will watch a documentary about minimalism and decide I want to give a bunch of crap away, or go vegan for 8 monthes because I can't make myself watch Earthlings and feel hypocritical. He is the kind of person who will go along with it because he loves me and all reaches an equilibrium. 

I feel like porn affects our intimacy, because I don't like how much he depends on the internet for entertainment. He doesn't make new friends and socialize, and it takes ME to get us out of the house. It's just not sexy to have a boyfriend who is married to his computer, and I don't feel the desire to please him like I used to when I felt him being mindful of his innerself and not just his career. The porn to me represents a host of issues for me, and I wonder if I am crazy for caring about it so much. I wonder if I would care about porn if I was with someone who didn't have those issues, or if maybe this is a sign I am immature. 

I decided to pull back and work on myself a little more, and make  myself happy till we figure it out but what am i missing Reddit?   



TLDR: Boyfriend watches porn, I don't like it because I am a sensitive hippie and he has addiction/motivation issues that affect the relationship, intimacy is crappy, relationships issues are confusing. 

Update: Bf used to watch twice a day and had ED issues. ED issues went away when he stopped watching regularly, and we had great intimacy. ED came back, and I am left very sad and feel like in the end he chooses the porn over me. If our sex was great and we could connect during intimacy, I would not be such a Nazi.

5ukg76,12,2017-02-17,Day 10(ish) Hardmode Report - This is the one,27Rench27,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5ukg76/day_10ish_hardmode_report_this_is_the_one/,"So long story short, been doing this PMO business for about six years now, PIED stopped me from enjoying women but the addiction was stronger every time, tried to stop, yada yada you know the drill.

Started texting pretty regularly with a good friend of mine who's going to be going on spring break with me and a couple other friends. I don't know what exactly it was, but something made me finally say ""fuck it, I'm done, it may be a thing with her and you better be fucking ready if it happens."" She's really attractive, our weird sides match perfectly, and all around I could see us dating if she didn't normally live three hours away. But she does, so SB may be my only chance to make a move and keep her interested in coming back.

Seriously guys, find something to fight **for**, it makes so much of a difference that I can't even begin to describe it. Instead of fighting against the addiction, fight for a girl or a situation. Also, *get busy*. I'm taking 18 hours at uni plus a couple hours a week volunteering, I have literally no time except when I eat and catch an episode online. Between this and the thought of my friend, I'm fuckin motivated.

As for the 'day 10(ish)', I'm not keeping track. I know the day we leave for SB will be day 43, and that's all that matters. Going full cold turkey, no unnatural hard-ons at all. And because I know what I'm fighting for, this honestly hasn't even been difficult (not even close to the 2-3 day max streaks I would normally do when I ""got serious"" about quitting).

Benefits: I feel generally more active. Getting average an hour less sleep per night has no impact on my ability to wake up or stay up through the day (I believe caffeine intake is the same [high af] though, so take this with some salt). I find it much easier to talk to people and hold conversations. Had an easy 45-minute interview for an internship this summer, two more coming next week. My dick and package both look much more ""solid"", I guess. Not the shriveled look they always had during PMO stints.

Side effects: I'm busy and tired as fuck, although the tired is now more physical than mental. Probably unrelated, but in the course of a week I've gotten an ear infection and then a gland inflammation (which actually feels like both glands now, fuck me). My brain doesn't know how to turn off anymore, I lay in bed for an hour or two mulling shit over before I finally fall asleep. Again, unknown relation to streak.

Keep it up, ya'll! Remember that every failure is just a lesson in triggers and what to avoid next time. Each day is a step forward, relapsing after a long streak does not reset the gains you've realized during said streak. My two cents: motivation is a necessity. Something to fight for is a hundred times more powerful than something to fight against.

Obligatory thanks to /u/TheeCole for being an all around awesome guy and talking me through some PIED-related worries early into this. I'll update again a few days before Spring Break!"
5ukq1n,1,2017-02-17,20F4M - Drunk fucks and office bets.,poutingpink,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5ukq1n/20f4m_drunk_fucks_and_office_bets/,"It was kinda weird being one of the only female interns at the tech company. Katrina should have been used to it by now. It was bad at university, but out in the real world... the gender disparity went from pronounced to comical. Everyone was very friendly, sure, but she'd never felt quite brave enough to attend the Friday night drinks...  

It was probably for the best. A 'fuck-pool' had started around the office, with bets climbing higher and higher as to who would fuck the busty, sweet young brunette. Some braver souls had placed more outlandish wagers, like that they could get video evidence, or double team her. They'd never say it to her face, of course, but the spreadsheet detailing how much would be paid out to who for doing what to her was... explicit.  

Well, the last day of her internship had arrived. She hoisted her satchel bag over one shoulder, the strap pulling tight between her deep cleavage. She took a half step towards the exit, was distracted momentarily by the sound of music and laughter from the staff lounge... and hesitated.  

She bit her full lower lip, battling herself internally. She was shy, sure. She could only hide behind her big goofy glasses so much before someone would inevitably talk to her any make her blush. But...  

Screw it. It was her last day. She owed it to herself to attend staff drinks at least, once, right?  

What was the worst that could happen?  "
5ulowx,2,2017-02-17,Emotionally abusive mother,paradiselost13,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/5ulowx/emotionally_abusive_mother/,"I'm a 20 years old, and I have been dealing with a more than dysfunctional relationship with my mother for the most part of 8 years now. I used to think it was a teenage phase and my mother's controlling personality would wane when I moved away to university, but that didn't happen unfortunately.
When I was 13 I got involved with 'emo' people and self-harm - I was a silly child, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with me, I was just immature and didn't fully understand what consequences it would have. When my family found out it was a tough year moving past it, my relationship with my mum drastically changed, and she became very controlling. I wasn't allowed to stay around friends' houses, and if they came over to stay we had to be downstairs in eyesight of my mum at all times, I had no mobile phone, all computers and other devices had passwords on which I was the only one in the family who was not allowed to know, when I used the computer it was strictly for school work and my mother had to sit in the room, if I was using the house phone to talk to a friend, my mother would often pick up the other receiver to listen in. I felt extremely isolated from everyone - my friends slowly stopped inviting me to things, or if they did I would tell them I wasn't allowed, I wouldn't even check. When I became 16, I was allowed a mobile phone, which I had to leave downstairs at night, and would be checked as when I woke up in the morning, texts which I had received overnight would be opened and read before I got my phone back. My mother did not like a particular circle of my friends, purely because of they were of a lower economic background to our family, and caused arguments and conflict with their parents on a number of occasions, leaving them in tears sometimes. We had a very up and down relationship - some weeks we were fine, then all of a sudden I would find out she had been going through my phone and seen me messaging a boy (that was usually her cause of argument) or something else she disagreed with, and would take away any liberties (seeing friends outside of school or my phone) as punishment, and constantly tell me I had broken her trust, even though I fully believed there was never any trust there in the first place.

I tried to get help from school. I had counselling during school twice. First time I didn't get anything from it because I wasn't willing to open up. Second time I had the most amazing counsellor, she really helped me understand my feelings and how to deal with them. Self harm became a real issue for me, but I managed to stop when I went to university. Once I went to the head of year, as my mum had started an argument with me over mock grades (practise exams) having been sent home which I got a B in (I was a straight A student in everything). I asked the teacher to call home and talk to my mum. He did that night, and I listened in to the conversation - he told my mum I was one of the brightest students and she had nothing to be concerned about as they at school certainly weren't. My mum came to me and told me she had gotten off the phone with the school and they had told her they were concerned about me and they would be calling me in for a chat. I was shocked. I knew then I was on my own.

University came, and I was filled with so much pent up anger and resentment of my relationship with my mum. First term was hard for me, I was still self harming and I had just started dating a guy I had met on a singing course who was going to Oxford who my mother adored, but I wasn't feeling it with him at all, and knew I had strong feelings for a guy I was in secondary school with, who was just starting university in London as well as me. I ended up breaking it off with the Oxford guy and started seeing this London guy, and my mum hated it. She hated him (she had a problem with how often I talked to him while I was at school, on one occasion printing off a copy of my mobile provider's call and text history to show me all the times she knew I was texting him), he wasn't going to as a good a university as my ex and she despised the idea of him. We have been together two and a half years now, he is doing excellently in his degree and in his internship he is doing this year, and him and I have proved to ourselves and to the people closest to us that we are very much happy and function well together. My mum has never met him and refuses to, refers to him as 'fuckface' and makes it clear at every possible opportunity to all of our family and her friends of her disagreement with our relationship. She has realised that I will not leave him to appease her, so she has taken to finding every other reason to find conflict with me now. From attacking me over my interests (I am a fan of wrestling and attend live music concerts regularly), my weight (I put on weight at university I admit, although am a size 12, eat as healthily as I can and am physical active), my grades (I am averaging a high 2:1 at university, I get a lot of first grades, but I study History at a very academically demanding university which is obviously very challenging. She has told me if I do not get a first she will not attend my graduation), among many many other things.

I don't go home very often as I can't stand being in her presence for long periods of time. Christmas, I had been home a day before she started making digs at me and causing arguments, I lost it at her and fought back (I try my best to avoid confrontation, which leads us to go for weeks on end not speaking). The day I left I vowed I was done and didn't want her in my life anymore, whether on good terms or otherwise. I was exhausted of it. She would send me links to random things on facebook and say things like, oh I thought you'd like this etc, and I would give a civil reply and nothing more, until a few weeks ago when I thought I'd give her another shot. But we are back to square one.

I am sorry for this being so long. I received an attacking text out of the blue last night and it's therefore on the forefront of my mind. It is my 21st birthday next month and I was going to bring some friends home from London to celebrate with my family. Now I'm questioning whether I even want to be in the same room as her. I don't know what to do. My father, my sister and her sister have told her on many occasions that her behaviour is irrational and she needs to stop her behaviour, but she will listen to no one. I am beyond resolving a relationship with her. Frankly, I never had a mother in an emotional sense, I always felt like nothing more than a trophy to her - she continuously tells me, as if I should care, that she can't talk to her friends about me because she's embarrassed. I am not perfect, and I am more than happy to admit to any faults when they are justified and put to me rationally. But I am a hardworking, ambitious person, who is able to maintain my academic work, financial situation, and relationships all to what I believe to be a good standard at the very least.

Does anyone have any advice for me?

Red lights and loud noises filled the communications room as people shuffled around with stacks of paper and phones to their ears. A skype call came in from the alien ambassador. The highest ranking Nasa official told the intern to put it up on the big screen, he gleefully did so.

""Greetings earthlings, my name is t'chuk k'vhar,"" he paused as he eyed up the room on his telecomms screen. ""I have come to pillage your world and exterminate its residents, surrender your arms and I shall make your death a swift one.""

""Sir,"" one of the staff shouted from across the room. The nasa official ignored it. ""Sir!"" He got angry and marched over to the voice.

""This is literally the worst moment for one your games johnson I..."" he got cut off by Johnson, something which may as well result in a death sentence.

""There is no life signs on the ships sir, well except for mr tchunka of course."" He gestured to the alien on the screen who looked confused and aggravated.

""What is the meaning of this interruption!?""

""Mr. K'vhar. It appears your life sign is the only one our long range scanners are detecting."" The nasa official was stood up straight brimming with new found confidence.

""Erm... well about that. We erm... we had to sacrifice most of our military for warp speed travel and well... I am the only one left,"" things suddenly felt very awkward. ""It was a harrowing loss and if you would please just surrender that would be great, its really lonely up here and well frankly I dont want this all to be in vain.""

""Stay put, we'll be taking your ships now."" The nasa official said, knowing the alien ambassador has nothing left to sacrifice for a journey home.

5umxah,1,2017-02-17,M4M/M4T/M4Futa - the Alpha Apocalypse,Subboytoy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5umxah/m4mm4tm4futa_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you. 

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people. 

I should be getting ready for work or school.  Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. *Holy fuck, its true!*

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha? 

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks: 

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured. 
 
 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug. 

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down. 

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg. 

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

5uo4zf,2,2017-02-17,[M4F] - Another Boring Day at the Office...,PerfectSavage,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5uo4zf/m4f_another_boring_day_at_the_office/,"The young man hurried out of the sleek elevator and down the hall to his office, hot cup of coffee in his hand while holding onto his briefcase. As he burst into the small office, he was greeted by a surprised squeak from his office mate. She was a young intern still taking college courses but, was eager to get some experience under her belt.

""Morning Rachel"" he said slightly out of breath, even though he was trim and fit. She never said anything, but Rachel secretly always tried to sneak glances at his form when he wasn't looking.

""Good morning, Dan"" she chirped cheerfully, quickly smoothing out her pencil skirt before swinging around in her office chair to face the man.

He had caught her doing that more and more recently; Always acting flustered and panicked when someone came into the door or when he got up for a break. She was always slightly red in her pale cheeks and very breathy. He shrugged it off for now and settled into his own desk. They sat back to back and worked in their own little room. It wasn't quite cramped, but it was snug. Both of them had large desks with their computers sitting on them and they would type and work from nine to five.

""You look nice today"" he said casually, trying to be polite before sitting down in his chair with his back facing the young dark haired woman. His computer hummed to life as he took another sip of hot coffee.

""Thanks"" Rachel said, biting her lip and slowly spinning around back to face her screen.

What Dan didn't know about his young office partner was that for the past few days, she had been doing some extra work on the side. Young, innocent looking Rachel had discovered the wide lewd world of camgirls. Girls who would sit in front of a webcam all day and perform depraved sexual acts for the denizens of the internet for tips. The sad truth was that most of them made more money than she did in a month. Of course she jumped at the chance. Student loans are no light burden, but she also had to work which meant most of her time spent ""camming"" was right there in the office with a co-worker right behind her. The perverts watching her little show paid good money to see her do naughty things right behind Dan's back.

Today was different though. She was nervous; her flat stomach was fluttering, her face was flushed and hot, and she was already rolling up the sleeves of her blouse and undoing a few buttons. Today was the day she decided to try a new kind of app that the cam sight was sponsoring. This app allowed a high tipper to take control of a vibrator for any number amount of minutes. This vibrator was behind her skirt, under her lacy red panties, and tucked away just on the other side of her smooth shaven pussy lips. The round little pill shaped toy was trapped snug between her pink fleshy folds waiting for the first person to take control.

It was hard not to get noticed, much harder than she had thought. Most of the people who got to control her toy would just blast it up on full power and force the poor office girl to bite down on her lip or cover her mouth to keep from letting her moans escape. Hour after hour she got hotter, more disheveled. Her skirt rode up more, revealing her thigh high stockings. More buttons on her blouse got undone and her raven black hair stuck to the sides of her face. She wasn't going to make it much longer and she knew it, but she was trapped in this office with a man and a webcam hidden under her desk to show off to the thousands watching. They could see her thighs clench and her knees buckle as the teasing little toy slowly drove her more and more insane with lust.

Behind her, Dan was all but clueless. That is, until she let a long shaky moan slip from her lips. For a split second her brain had gone numb and she forgot she was in an office so she just let it out, her eyes rolling in pleasure before popping wide open. She sat up straight, trembling and flushed, hoping Dan hadn't heard. He did though, and he slowly spun around in his chair and looked at the steaming hot brunette. 

""Rachel, are you alright"" he asked with genuine concern, thinking she was in some kind of pain.

""I...I'm fiIIINE"" she squeaked just as someone else took control her little toy. Her skirt was soaked. Her lace panties were soaked. Hell, even her leather chair was soaked with the juices oozing out of her swollen needy cunt. She couldn't let him know, but this new controller was more devious in that instead of blasting the toy on full power, they were giving her waves of pleasure which tickled her spasming walls at just the right frequency.

She hunched over her desk, gripping it with her fingers until her knuckles were white. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth and her glasses slid down the tip of her nose as she brought her knees together hard. She was going to cum and she couldn't stop herself. She trembled in her chair as her hungry cunt clenched around the vibrating toy again and again. Dan watched with a horrified look on his face as the young girl groaned and drooled on her chest as her breasts heaved and jiggled with her labored breathing.

""Rachel"" he asked, reaching out his hand to touch her small quivering shoulder. She didn't move away from his touch, but in her post-orgasmic bliss she let out a shaky breath and leaned into his touch, letting him get a view down her sweaty cleavage, her skirt bunched around her thighs, and the puddle of sticky pussy juices just now starting to drip off her leather chair onto the floor.

His mouth went dry and his breath deepened as he started to slowly massage the young lust drunk girl's arm and shoulder. 

Maybe today at the office would be more exciting than usual?"

5uoppd,3,2017-02-17,[HR] The Crows,DoYouWant_the_Cheese,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/5uoppd/hr_the_crows/,"Connor was walking into his night class when he first saw them.  It was bitter night in Pittsburgh, the wind was whipping Connor’s face and rain had been pouring for the past four hours.  Connor had an umbrella at the beginning of the trek from his dorm, but the wind had inverted his cheap Rite-Aid umbrella and left him to fend for himself.  He was passing by what looked like a normal tree when they took off.  Hundreds of crows launching off the tree’s branches and circling the Cathedral of Learning.  

Connor had read about the crows from an article in the Pitt News, but seeing it for the first time, he was jolted by the sheer amount of them.  Supposedly, the crows came to Pittsburgh every winter, craving the light of the city that shielded them from their natural predator, the owl.  The article said the roosting of the crows was an event to be marveled at, but all Connor could think of was the Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Connor believed in signs, and seeing hundreds of crows felt like a bad omen. The menacing sight of hundreds of crows flying around the gigantic Gothic building made Connor feel like he was walking into a villain’s lair. Maybe their leader was on the roof. Connor chuckled at the thought.

The wind picked up, and Connor swore he could hear shouting coming from above him.  He gazed in the sound’s direction, but he saw nothing but the crows, still circling the top of the 500 foot tall building.  Connor didn’t stay for long.  It was still raining and he was late for his psychology class.  He quickened his pace and entered the Cathedral.  He walked into his class soaking wet and found a seat near the back.  Connor wasn’t planning on paying attention to this lecture, he mostly browsed his laptop during this class, and generally didn’t care about psychology, he just needed the credit.  The professor waited until the time was exactly 6 o’clock and started his lecture.  
“Tonight the lecture is about the brain and neuroscience” the professor started. “Specifically, we’ll be discussing the amount of specialization that occurs within the brain.  In fact the brain is so specialized that an injury to one spot in the brain can cause impairment just in the functions that sector is responsible for.  To show this we’ll be watching a video about a man who injured his occiotemporal lobe, and gained the ability to do complex math equations he wasn’t capable of before the injury” said the professor. 

This caught Connor’s interest.  For the first time that semester he closed his laptop and paid attention.  The video was an interview of the man who the professor was talking about.  When the man was 23, he was mugged on his way home.  The muggers beat him up severely, but happened to hit him in his occiotemporal lobe, which controls information processing skills integral to math.  Ever since the beatdown, the man developed math skills far beyond his previous ability.  Even after the video finished, Connor actually listened to the entirety of the lecture for the first time that semester.  Usually, these night classes seemed to drag on forever, but this one was different, three hours slipped away and Connor was focused the whole time.

 When he left the Cathedral, the rain had stopped, but the crows were still there.  They were perched on a different tree now, but they managed to creep Connor out just as much as when they were flying.  The crows called out to each other, squawking and cawing back and forth.  Connor wondered what they were talking about.  Just then, a crow at the top of the tree let out a caw noticeably louder than the rest, and in unison, the birds peeled off of the tree and into the night.  Connor felt like that was a sufficient answer to his question and headed back to his dorm.

 Connor lived in the top floor of Tower B, one of three cylindrical dorm buildings at the center of campus.  Tower B was the tallest at 22 floors.  Connor got back to his room and immediately got ready for bed, even though it was only 9 o’clock.  As he was putting his head down, a single crow landed on the ledge outside of his window.  The crow looked at Connor curiously, cocking its head to the side and letting out an emphatic CAW.  Connor pulled his blinds shut, and went to sleep.

Connor slept through the night restlessly. He dreamed of the crows.  In his dream, Connor was observing himself, floating above his own head.  Connor stood in a barren field with nothing in sight except a tree, filled with the crows.  The crows were in single file along the branches, all of them staring directly at Connor.  They took turns speaking, each one cawing their orders.  Connor couldn’t understand what they were saying but he watched himself nod obediently after each one was done speaking.  When the last crow was done, they turned around in unison and flew away into the nothingness.  Connor began to squawk, louder and louder.  It went for minutes  Then he heard a voice.

“Dude are you gonna turn that off?” asked the voice. “DUDE!”
Connor woke up in a cold sweat.  He felt a hand his shoulder.

“Dude this alarm has been going off for like 10 minutes, turn it the fuck off!”
Connor opened his eyes to the sight of his roommate.

“Thank God, you’re awake,” said his roommate, more than a little annoyance in his voice.  “Now will you turn it off?”

“Yeah, sorry,” mumbled Connor.  He rolled over lazily and disabled the alarm on his phone.  Connor’s roommate grunted and climbed back into bed.  Connor pulled the blinds open to see if the crow was still there, but all he saw was an empty windowsill and another dreary day in Pittsburgh.  He checked his phone.  He had two hours until his class started.  He thought about going back to sleep, but he was afraid of seeing whatever it was that he saw in his dreams.  He decided to get some food in his stomach and shake off his dream.  He had been feeling stressed lately, but it had never caused him to have nightmares before.  
Connor thought more about the dream, how he watched himself understand the birds so clearly, but all he heard was their squawking.  He thought back to his professor's lecture, was there some way that damage to the brain could make him be able to communicate with the birds? What was he thinking?  It was almost the weekend.

Connor got dressed and decided to eat at his favorite restaurant for breakfast, the Porch, right across the street from the Cathedral.  He walked down Forbes, and passed the tree that the crows were in the night before, but today it was empty.  The day seemed suspiciously quiet to Connor, usually Oakland would be bustling at this time, but there was hardly anyone on the streets.  When he arrived at the Porch, there was nobody in line, even though there was usually a few minute wait.  Connor walked up to the window and the cashier seemed almost surprised to see him.  He ordered a breakfast sandwich and took a seat outside on the patio, facing the Cathedral.  The waiter brought him his food but said nothing.  The waiter lingered for a second, and then turned to Connor and spoke,

“No crows today,” he said plainly.

Connor looked at the waiter, taken back for a second, and responded meekly, “Thank God”

“You know, I’ve lived here for years, but it’s never felt like this before,” the waiter said, his gaze reaching beyond Connor.

“What do you mean, like there’s more of them this year?” Connor now studied the waiter’s face.  His face was wrinkled in what looked like deep thought, but something about the look in his eyes seemed empty.

“Not more, it’s just... different,” replied the waiter, sure of himself.  “Anyways, I have more customers to get to.” The life came back to the waiter’s eyes.  Connor looked around and suddenly the patio had filled up, when minutes before it had been empty.  Connor dug into his sandwich 9/10 times Connor’s problems were solved by getting something to eat.  One time he had convinced himself he had a terminal disease by reading Web MD on an empty stomach.  

Connor got halfway through the sandwich, but he couldn’t eat anymore.  His stomach grumbled, but he couldn’t force down another bite.  Connor sat at the table and tried to relax.  It looked overcast, but it was starting to clear up.  Connor felt the sun shining on his face, and closed his eyes, soaking it in.  Connor thought about the rest of his day.  Only two classes today. Maybe a light day and the weekend could relieve the stress.  Connor continued to bask in the light, but it kept getting brighter and hotter on Connor’s face.  Soon, Connor was breaking a sweat from the intensity of the sun.  

He opened his eyes and could hardly see.  All he could make out was the outline of the Cathedral and the table in front of him. Connor closes his eyes again and when he reopened them, a crow stood in front of him.  The crow stood on the left side of the table, where Connor’s fork once was.  On the other side of the table, Connor’s knife remained.  Connor opened his hand and scooped the bird into his palm.  Something about the crow didn’t feel right to Connor.  The bird was cold to the touch and deathly still.  Even when Connor rubbed his thumb across its body, the crow didn’t so much as flinch.  Connor slowly brought his hand to his face and examined the bird.  The bird looked at Connor for a second, curious, and for a moment, Connor could see his reflection in the bird’s eye. 

Then the bird struck.  Connor felt it scratching at his face.  He was still holding the bird, but he couldn’t force his hand away from his face, it was stuck.  He used his other hand to try to pry his hand away, but it was helpless.  Desperately, Connor grasped his knife in his other hand and began stabbing at the bird.  He stabbed wildly, with all his force, but the bird was impervious and unrelenting.  Suddenly, there was another hand coming from the light.  The hand wrestled the crow from Connor’s hand and threw it to the ground.  Connor felt blood rushing down his face and passed out in the chair.

Connor woke in a hospital bed.  There were bandages on the left side of Connor’s face, covering four parallel scratches reaching from just below his left eye, down to the middle of his cheek.  Connor looked around and studied his new surroundings.  To his left he saw a barred window, and to his right there was a large, heavy door.  Even in the seemingly secure room, Connor could not feel at ease.  Not as long as there are crows out there, Connor thought.  Just then, a doctor strolled into his bedroom, with his nose in a clipboard, seemingly unaware of Connor’s presence.

“Did you get the bird?” asked Connor.

The peered down at Connor briefly and scrunched his face, but returned his gaze back to the clipboard.

“Connor, are there any medications you take that I should know about?” replied the Doctor.

“Did you get the bird?” asked Connor again, this time a little slower, but no sense of agitation in his voice.

The doctor exhaled loudly and studied Connor’s heavily bandaged face.  He thought for a second and replied, “Connor, I think you ought to get some rest,”  With that, the doctor turned and left the room.

The doctor left Connor’s room feeling more confused than when he entered.  Somehow, even after 10 years, this job still found ways to surprise him.  A crazy person? That was nothing new.  But a seemingly normal 18 year old attacking himself with a fork over breakfast?  That was out of the ordinary.  But it wasn’t just this case that felt weird to the doctor, the past week had been a flurry of peculiar patients.  First there was the lady that pulled her hair out and fashioned it into a nest.  Then, there was the man who jumped out of his apartment's window, thinking he could fly, only to break both of his legs.  They say deaths come in three, maybe creepy things happen in threes too, thought the doctor.  The doctor didn’t have time to think about such things, there was work to be done.

The doctor walked towards the waiting room, and returned his gaze to his clipboard.  His next patient was an elderly man complaining of back pain.  As the doctor neared the waiting room he noted a peculiar silence.  He didn’t see any nurses, and the intern he sent to get his coffee was nowhere to be seen.   The doctor entered the waiting room, which was usually bustling at this time of day, but saw only one seat taken.  The doctor whipped around and tried to open the door he had entered, but it was locked.  The doctor dropped his clipboard, and began to feel light headed.  Before he lost consciousness, the last thing the doctor heard was a loud CAW.

5up37f,5,2017-02-17,Me [22 M/F] with my girlfriend [23 M/F] of six months fighting about lack of communication on Valentine's Day,PleaseNone,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5up37f/me_22_mf_with_my_girlfriend_23_mf_of_six_months/,"Background Info: My girlfriend and I met near the beginning of the September about two years ago, on her last year at the university. We met through a mutual friend (her roommate) who happened to be rushing for the same co-ed fraternity as I was. We were friends and clicked really really quickly, so much so that I was almost seeing my girlfriend and her roommate on the daily. After a while our mutual friend started to push for the idea of my girlfriend and me dating, but we were both pretty much unresponsive to the idea at the time. My reasoning was that I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and I was so happy to finally have friends and a support system that I didn't want to risk jeopardizing that by trying to get with any of my new friends, despite them both being very attractive in my opinion. My (now present) girlfriend at the time hooked up with another one of our mutual friends twice, although they did not have PIV sex. I knew something happened from one time finding them in bed together and she told me herself as well. Despite her roommate's efforts to push for us to be together nothing happened between us during most of the year. I ended up hooking up with our mutual friend a couple of times near the end of the year when we were both inebriated, but it was just physical.


It was not until the end of the year that my girlfriend and I hooked up at a party while inebriated and had sex. We continued hooking up every now and hand out and I really liked her but I made a stupid mistake. I would keep asking her what this was and how she felt about me but she would never give me a definitive answer so I thought maybe she didn't think it was that serious. Even though she gave the impression that she's not the type of girl to hook up with any guy, she did hook up with our mutual friend, and I thought she didn't want to get to serious seeing as how she lives 30 minutes away and her Sri Lanken parents would not approve of me. It's not any justification, but on a group trip, her roommate and I hooked up again while cleaning up after everyone had finished drinking. She found out from her roommate and basically told me she did not want to speak to me ever again and how she felt used as a fuck toy. I felt really bad, not only because I am fully responsible for that making that decision but because I was losing one of my best friends too. 

Eventually she ended up forgiving me and giving me a second shot and I asked her out after a couple of dates. I've since cut communication with our mutual friend that I hooked up with because my girlfriend was noticeably acting out against her now former best friend. I feel responsible for destroying that friendship too. We have a great relationship I think now and she's my best friend as I am hers. There have been some issues here and there, such as my usage of weed, which she knew about prior to going out with me, and my lack of communication skills when I'm visibly upset. I prefer to try and calm down before talking so I can avoid saying things out of anger that I might regret and she hates that. I admit it's a problem and I'm working on it, but at the same time I wish she would try to make an effort to really understand me when to differences and try to compromise. Some of our arguments come from her failure to be considerate such as her thinking it's funny to make jokes about having other boyfriends, which I told her it's not funny because I'm almost sure my last girlfriend cheated on me and would constantly try to make me look like the cheater/paranoid one. There was also an issue with her parents hating the fact that I was Mexican and said a plethora of racist things about me to her. She also initially thought I was lazy for not getting my license until I was 22. I told her that I couldn't afford to take driving lessons and that with both my brother and father using both cars all day I didn't see that much of a point. On top of that my father works so much he pretty much sleeps all day when he gets home so I had no one to teach me. I only mention this because it hurt me that she didn't even bother to ask why I waited so long but just assumed I was lazy; it wasn't until after I told her that she apologized.



Issue: My schedule for this quarter is typically as follows. On MWF I intern 20-30 minutes away from 10-2 and then I drive 30-60 (depending on traffic) to school to study and work out until 6 or 7 pm (depending on when my shift starts) and work until 10 pm where I rush home in 30 minutes and go pick up my mom after work and I don't get into bed until 11:15. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I'm in class all day and working and also picking up my mom after. I am so tired and try to keep up on my studies but also try to spend time with my girlfriend. I try to text her throughout the day and even ask for two days off a week at work to spend with her and I occasionally call her on the phone or FaceTime. I also try to meal prep and go to the gym to stay healthy. She will of course sometimes make comments about my lack of talking to her by saying ""oh I must have forgotten I have a girlfriend"" or something when I don't text her or reply to texts that are not really conversation starters like her replying ""oh yeah you do have nice handwriting"". 



So on Valentine's Day I told her I had two midterms and was awake by 5:30 am to move my car for street cleaning so I was in a annoyed mood and was rushing to do everything. I also had work later that day as well. While finishing my two midterms I would take an occasional break by browsing Facebook or Instagram. I didn't text her after her reply to my handwriting at around 6:00, not only because I thought that was it, but because I was in class. She texted me at around midnight saying goodnight in a manner that showed she was upset. I stayed up for a whole 30 hours that day to finish both my midterms. She told me the next day when I wish her good morning that she was upset and cried herself to sleep because she ""wanted to see how long it take to reply to her without her forcing me to have a conversation"" and it took all day. I texted her sparingly thought the day and I had class all day....despite me feeling like it wasn't a big deal I still apologized and asked her why she simply didn't just text me if she wanted to talk to me and she said I was trying to spin it on her. She ended up just ignoring me and saying how this was the saddest Valentine's Day she's had and this is the first time she's not single. I am so confused. I had even tried to take her indoor skydiving so we can actually sky dive in the future since it's on her bucket list. It was a two hour drive both ways and I have a huge fear of heights. I even paid for dinner and drinks and I thought I had made a significant effort to try and make up for the fact that I had class on Valentine's Day.

Anyway, my question is, can I get some perspective into how I can go about fixing this, or what I can do better next time? Or even just insight about this relationship would be appreciated.

Recently got accepted earlier this week as a transfer for Computer Science. My first acceptance and its pretty surreal (supposedly a lot of people get rejected for anything in the college of engineering where I go). While I haven't made a solid decision yet CSULB is definitely high on my list now. 

Given that I'm considering moving near campus, currently I'm living with my parents in Whittier. Normally whats a solid price range I should be looking for? I have a summer internship lined up that pays and some savings so I'll at least have something to live off of. Any areas I should avoid? 

Anything price-wise i should look for? Price range I think anything between $500-600 would be ideal but I'm pretty new to this so I really have no idea. 

edit: Also I forgot to add, currently I do not drive so more then likely I'll be taking transit to campus for the time being assuming I don't get a car before then. "

I recently got a paid internship in the career I was hoping for. Sounds great right? Then why am I so miserable? 

I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I wake up, go to work, spend all day sitting at a desk usually with nothing to do, come home, only have a few hours to do anything for myself (but have no motivation), go to bed, and wake up and do it all over again. That is not how I want to live the rest of my life and I don't get how the rest of the world is okay with that.

I'm exhausted...I've spent the majority of my life going to bed at 1:00 am and waking up at noon because that's just how my schedule has always worked out. And if I ever had to get up early I would take a nap in the afternoon. Now I wake up at 6:30 am because I have to drive an hour to work everyday and I get home too late to take a nap.

I've skipped 5 times since I started over a month ago. I am just so tired at 6:30 am and I have nothing to motivate me to get up and go to work. 

I currently live with my parents (I'm only 23 and can't afford my own place yet) and we get in fights at least once a week about me wanting to skip. They just make me feel guilty and like I'm a quitter. I feel like I can't tell anyone how hard of a time I'm having because everyone gets up and goes to work everyday, why would they have sympathy for me? But this is really taking a toll on me and as much as people say ""they understand, they've been through this too"", I don't think they really do understand. And if one more person tells me ""welcome to the real world"" I will go insane!

This all probably sounds ridiculous and maybe even lazy but I'm miserable and no one really seems to care.


*EDIT- I just want to clarify, I'm not suicidal over this. I'm just having a tough time and figured someone out there might understand."
5uqfsx,2,2017-02-17,La La Land Review,coffeelover96,CoffeesWritingCafe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeesWritingCafe/comments/5uqfsx/la_la_land_review/,"La La Land is a 2016 musical directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. 
This movie is everywhere right now. It has already swept the Golden Globes and it’s expected to make a pretty nice run at the Academy Awards. And to be honest, I can see why. This is a movie that I absolutely adored. From the opening number, Another Day Of Sun, to the closing song and dance, I was thoroughly entertained. I was taken an emotional ride that made me smile, laugh, frown, and cry. I haven’t seen a film that I emotionally connected to in theaters in quite some time, granted I don’t go very often. This still doesn’t take away from how I felt walking out of the theater.

A realistic character drama is framed through a Golden Age musical, which could be jarring to some viewers; I felt like it was a nice metaphor for how some people may view their aspirations, when their reality is much bleaker. It honestly reminded me of how depression works for many people; a face is put on for the outside world, but underneath is something very different. The music is also largely based upon jazz, which is a genre that I’ve always had an affinity for. I’m no aficionado, but I listen to it more than any other genre expect for 60’s rock. Every song stuck out to me, and I really like the songs that reoccurred throughout the movie and that helped to serve as a nice motif for the characters. The set pieces were amazing and I know I’ll watch all of them again many more times; currently I am driving to classes and work while listening to the soundtrack.

I was able to get behind both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling’s characters. The person fighting to make it in Hollywood is nothing new, but their acting and on screen chemistry made it feel refreshing. I bought their attraction to each other. It was almost a love at first sight type of romance, but their performances made me believe that the two characters just clicked and had an electricity about them. Some people may say that this doesn’t happen in real life, but I think those people are bitter prudes. (I’m only joking of course, but I do think they’re wrong.) I felt like I saw a lot of similarities between the characters and people I know, and myself. I won’t spoil anything yet, but I think there’s something here that many people can relate to. 

Overall I think this is a film that everyone should give at least one shot. There’s bound to be something they like.

**SPOILERS**

Getting into spoilers, I found that the relationship between Mia and Seb was a little bit like the relationship I share with my best friend. My friend has helped to push me towards my dream by being encouraging with their words, much like how Seb pushes Mia towards writing her play. Seb has big dreams of his own too, and he realizes that he’ll have to change himself some in order to make it work, a little bit to Mia’s chagrin. Again, this reminded me of my friend and I. They would like a position in a field in which your beliefs are something that matter and I very much believe that they can one day do it. Recently though, they had a chance to maybe get an internship at a place that has an opposite set of morals. While it may not agree with what they feel, it was a good opportunity and could have kick started them on a good path. However, I felt a little bit like they were selling out in order to have their dream. This is similar to how Mia feels when Seb joins a band that doesn’t play straight jazz like he’d truly want. But in the end, he still achieves his dream of opening up a club, and she achieves her dream of becoming an actress. And the two have a realization that the time they were together is what allowed them to blossom into the people they are. And it made me realize that I shouldn't feel that way about any decisions my friend makes. They're their own person and I should feel happy they are doing something that is good for them. 

And as for Seb and Mia. They pushed each other in the right direction, but the right direction was also away from one another. It didn’t work out. I feel this goes back to the structure of the songs that I mentioned earlier. In reality, they are apart and always will be. But in the dream world of the musical, everything worked out for the best; they are still together and have both achieved their dreams. 

I’m still not quite sure what message I was supposed to receive from the movie. I honestly was too emotionally impacted by the final scene to choose just one message that the film makers wanted me to get. This isn’t a detriment to the film in the slightest; it’s just my ineptitude.

5us7x8,0,2017-02-18,Trump's horrible 1st month in office told us that he'll not achieve anything that he promised to his followers at all his campaign stops.,ihatejoemcCarthy,POLITIC,https://www.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/5us7x8/trumps_horrible_1st_month_in_office_told_us_that/,"Yes, if Trump had any political experience he could see through the smoke on the mirror that his idea of making America great again is nothing but a fantasy. An Utopian dream.

It is never going to happen if he keeps on nagging about other people and keeps on assailing the press or trying to run this country without reading the constitution which clearly separates the power between the executive branch and the legislature and the judiciary branch.

His 77 minutes of rambling and rattling and almost cussing everybody, in a press conference the day before yesterday against the American citizens like us who didn't vote for him and don't show him any respects, was the sign of a failed dictator who just couldn't kill enough of his own citizens who rose up their heads against the butcher.

His attitude towards the press in general, except the Fox tv., which still doesn't want to stop licking his fat behind, tells us that the man is not going to follow any norms or customs that most of our great presidents followed in the past.

Sometimes many of our ex-presidents got mad at certain publications or television studios but they never ever lashed out on the media the way this current president is hell bent to do.

And this is in spite of the fact that the media's huge role in his campaign that gave him the presidency beside the helps from Moscow and the F.B.I. Director Mr. Comey.

The amount of free publicity, in the range of $2 billion that he got from the media who wrote all kind unsavory and salacious stories about Hillary campaign team's personal musings which was laid out in the open by Wikileaks,was totally unprecedented.

So it's really quite amazing that Trump would still keep his hatred towards all the media personalities including an innocent orthodox Jewish reporter called Jake Turx from Ami magazine who asked him a very simple question in the press conference about what is Mr. Trump going to do to stop the anti-Semitic attacks on all the Jewish organizations that has stepped up since his election.

Instead of giving him an honest reply Mr.Trump just cut him off showing total disrespect and never promised that he'd stop all these attacks immediately.

Go figure !

And while coming back to his 1st month's report card, his roll out of an 'executive order barring only the Muslims from 7 countries was totally illegal.

These 7 middle eastern and African countries were the nations with whom he currently has no business with.

 Neither will be in the future because most of those countries including Iran are under International assistance or poor as per Trump University's business models were where he taught his students how to look for business opportunities and how to reject the losers. 

But in this case of 'travel ban' he was the sore loser as he signed the E.O. prepared by a stupid 31 year old White House intern like employee called Stephen Miller who is nothing but a hack in all actual purposes.

Yes this E.O. was totally an ill thought out plan to bar innocent people from 7 Muslim majority countries who'd never done any harm to our country, rather we blew up their countries, especially the innocent country of Iraq in 2003, punishing them for what happened on 9/11 which was committed by the terrorists from all those countries not on the list because Trump has too many hotels and casinos and resorts already with many more in the pipeline.

So that brings us to the next question, that by not banning other Muslim countries where he has hotels and casinos like Saudi Arabia who was behind the worst loss of our citizens' lives on our soil, is Trump planning for another 9/11 type massacre to happen on our soil again so that he can start another major war like what Bush did ?

I think, he is."
5usopb,12,2017-02-18,I am a 27 year old felon with no job,Asadien,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5usopb/i_am_a_27_year_old_felon_with_no_job/,"I've noticed that I've become very fond of Reddit, and every night before bed I'm on the app reading interesting stories. So, I kind of want to post something personal and relative to my actual life for the first time. 

I'm having a terrible time in life at the moment, and I realize this particular thread(?) may not purposely fit here as a whole, but I feel that my problems will get a lot better if I could just provide for my son and girlfriend.

So, let's start off with a bit of backstory and a promise to make this tl;dr short as possible..

I live in a country setting in a small town in Virginia. I grew up with two younger brothers, two years apart, with me being the oldest. My mother was 15 and my father was 19 when I was born; consequently, my father was in a juvenile center when I was born. My mother never finished high school and my father dropped out. 

Obviously, two teenage parents, having their first child while essentially still being children will have its consequences. Two more sons following every two years made things more difficult. I was actually nearly aborted, but my mother bailed on it half way to the clinic.

*Fortunately, as with many young parents, my grandparents looked after me, more specifically my grandmother. She had a first grade education and lived off a disability check, while receiving help from my God father, a injured Korean War vet. He was a happy drunk. A genuine kind person that used to say I was born with a smile on my face. My grandmother met him when she bartended for a veteran bar in town. 

*My actual grand father helped too - my grandmothers divorced husband. He was a very well groomed man, and he lived in a sort of apartment complex for elderly people. They put him at the entrance of the complex because he was that badass that would probably take care of things if shit got out of hand or if someone tried to break in. I never became very close with him.

*When I was 12 years old my grandmother met another man that happened to be a retired Air Force veteran. He had lost his wife to cancer a few years back, so they met and started dating. At this point I'm spending weekends with my grandmother as my dad was injured in a vehicle accident and was able to purchase a small home with the settlement.

This is when, as I can recall, life hit hard, and was the turning point of what I am today. My parents were addicted to drugs and had made some terrible decisions that would lead us to a conversation with something along the lines of ""mommy and daddy won't be coming home for a while.""

These three men I listed above along with my grandmother helped us survive, and remain a family. My brothers and I were almost lost to orphanage homes. My grandmother was raised in one her entire childhood where the guardians used it as an income for their selfish need. She was also raped throughout her early years as she was adopted by people with bad intentions. You can only imagine how zealous she fought for us.

The pillar of our support begins to break, as my three father figures begin to consecutively pass away, and within one year life becomes harder. My parents had got out and went back; mom just for another year, but I won't see my father again until I'm 20. Im 13 years old with two younger brothers living with my grandmother that has a $700 monthly income.

My mother comes back home and tried her best to stabilize, but she is an addict and life with her is hell. We are very poor. So poor that for the last two weeks of every month we would go hungry. I had good friends with great parents, so I was welcome to stay the night with them because I was well mannered. I would strategize what friends I would stay with that weekend to eat because I survived off school lunch and breakfast, so weekends were tough without that free meal.

Flash forward five years and I'm 18 years old. Two women trying to raise a man. An out of control young man that is very angry with the world. I smoked a lot of weed and I had no concept of reality or how the world works. I mean I had no idea what consequences I'd face as an adult, but I'd soon realize.

I have had various run ins with police in my teenage years, and have resented the police, community, and general world for having taken my father from us. I felt that the world had torn my family apart and I had taken blow after blow head on. I had so much pride. I had been through so much - that I developed this horrible mind frame. I was obsessed with negative energy. I loved chaos. I loved tragedies in my life. I would stay awake at night dreaming of the ones I loved dying in front of me, and how it would awaken a new layer of this numb shell. I was 18 years old in high school looking at everyone. Observing everyone. I knew that not even the teachers had experienced what I'd been through. I felt so detached that I dropped out three months before graduation.

Ethics and morals are just some far off concept that I've never heard of. I withdraw in myself waiting for the next horrible thing to happen - naturally preparing myself for it, so when it happens I won't be phased in the slightest. You wouldn't be able to tell anything would affect me, and I handled myself so well so that people couldn't see my vulnerable insides. 

Throughout my teenage years I relied on girlfriends and the internet to cope. Oh, and the internet back in the mid 2000's with no parental advisory can be problematic. Obsessions with Everquest, Runescape, World of Warcraft and porn didn't help anything.

I turn 19. I get a job with a company where I embezzle from. I go to trail, I lose. I'm a convicted felon at 19 years old. I get on probation and before you know it my dad is getting close to coming home. I haven't seen him since I was 13 years old during a visit at the local jail before he was shipped off to prison. I remember that day. My brothers and I crying as I watch my father cry for the first time in my life. 

Flash forward 5 years. I'm 24. Dad came home and went back to do another 6 years in less than 20 months. He was home for my 20th birthday and he wasn't there for my 21st. I met a girl the summer of my 21st birthday. The woman I'm with now in my life. We went to high school together and I love her, but I'm a damaged person and we try our best to make it work. We break up and get back together, and I finally make a smart move by enrolling in a community college for an associates in Web Programming. I love it. I'm learning Visual Basic and the fundamentals with future courses in C# and C+ and java. I'd also be starting somewhere as an intern. 

I'm hired as work-study aid, and I'm selling currency on path of exile during its open beta release back during Jan. 2013 while I'm being paid to edit Microsoft office documents in the engineering lab after class lets out. I have a friend that sits beside me in amazement at how great I am at multitasking sell orders on my self made website, and how good I am at buying and reselling virtual currency in a video game, and how I use other platforms like d2jsp to exploit price differentials in the market to my advantage. I make around $3500 in three days, and I fancy myself as being this brilliant RMT businessman. 

Three months later I'm nearing the completion of my first college semester and I find out my girlfriend is pregnant. Two days later I'm also indicted for drug charges that a confidential informant took part in during the September and November months prior to me starting college in January. I'm going to be a father, my college education is over, and I'm going to be spending 12 months in jail and another 12 months in a military detention camp. Oh, did I forget to mention my girlfriends father is a circuit judge?

Life after being indicted was hell. Here I am, the kid that grew up mentally preparing himself for tragedy being struck with a nice one. If took nearly 14 months before I was sentenced. I was there for my son to be born, and just after him being born, I accept a plea bargain and walked into court in early 2014 for my fate. I remember hearing my mother and girlfriend cry, and I remember how it was just another formality to everyone else there. This was just another day at the office. I remember how time stopped and how dead I felt being there. 

I also remember how it felt looking at my son from inside the jail visitation booth. The same jail I visited my father at when I was 13, and that memory I'll never forget of him began to remind me of how crazy everything is I'm that moment. I saw myself there looking at my father just to have it twist to me being on his side of the glass with everyone on the opposite side. I remember my first day in jail, and I remember thinking I have another 700 days of this?

Let's skip to March 2016. I'm a free man after 23 months of some crazy fucking shit. I could write a book about jail and my experiences. I went in jail at 24 years old 5'9 and 160 lbs and now I'm 210 lbs. I come home to my girlfriend pregnant by someone preemptively trying to kill relationship, but I have my son to worry about and I love her as well. June 2016 I watch the woman I love birth another mans son. I don't know how to feel. 

August 2016 her father sells us a 2000 sq ft home for 20k. 20k out of a 40k mortgage we take out. We get a HVAC system put in, new carpet, and fresh paint every where, we stretch 20k out pretty far and we have a lovely home. Feb 2017 I still don't have a job and I'm writing this crazy ass post that was suppose to be about personal finance but seems more like a biography / therapy session. 

My girlfriend is starting to hate me, and I feel like I have no credence when speaking to her or her family. She stays gone every weekend because I'm useless and she's starting to feel indifferent. I've been turned down by coke, Pepsi, Sykes, dish, Taco Bell, and Comcast this year so far. I don't feel like a man. I don't feel like a real person. I love my son and I'm ashamed of being a father. I'm not afraid to teach myself to code again, to catch up and relearn new languages but I have no idea how to invest my time or anything. I'm fucking lost. I don't want to lose my son or my lover. 


Felonies: embezzlement and 5 accounts of distribution of imitation of a controlled substances.

All my job experience is 3 months or less. 

I'm going to sleep, maybe there's another subreddit to post this in rather than finance?

Need some help.,ImAK93,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5ussmc/needadvice_this_is_my_problem_need_some_help/,"Firstly, some backstory about my career. I am 23 yrs old and pursuing a professional accounting course which is considered as one of the difficult courses in the country. I passed the first two levels and completed my internship and have failed my finals thrice. Though its considered normal in this course, I am really frustrated.

Now I am going to my problem that is not letting me study. After getting my results, I decided I am going to appear group wise (instead of the whole thing) and pass those subjects. The reason I failed was that I was not able to bear the burden of all 8 subjects. I am sad that I had to waste a year to realize this.

I am great planner and I made my timetable. But while studying, instead of distractions like T.V, computer, internet etc., I have internal distractions i.e my own thoughts. I have negative thoughts about myself, I think about those people who have already qualified and get depressed. I also worry about my future and whether my dreams/goals will come true, whether I am going to experience success ever in my life? Because of all these thoughts I am losing the zeal to study and the cycle continues.

I am familiar with all the study techniques and syllabus, so that is not a problem. My problem is to deal with internal distractions. Once I deal with those thoughts, I will be very efficient in studying. I know I can study extremely well as I have passed the first two levels.

Please give me some suggestions to battle this problem.
Thank You!

*****
&gt; PISCATAWAY - Rutgers University has issued a formal apology after banning students from a job fair for wearing blue suits, colored shirts, brown shoes or other attire that violated a strict new dress code for the event.

&gt; The controversy started Feb. 10 when several students who arrived at a career fair for the Rutgers Business School were turned away, according to The Daily Targum, the university&amp;#039;s student newspaper.

&gt; Students were told they could return if they changed clothes, but some owned only one suit or lived too far away to drive home and make it back in time, the Targum&amp;#039;s report said.

&gt; &amp;quot;We regret that the actions at last week&amp;#039;s career fair adversely affected some of our students and cast a shadow over the success we have achieved in helping our students secure more meaningful internships and jobs,&amp;quot;.

&gt; Rutgers will help students contact recruiters they were banned from meeting and work one revising the dress code, Lei said.

&gt; In previous years, Rutgers students failed to present themselves well at the event, the university told the student newspaper.

Was there some hints about something that happened during the summer and caused Wes death kind of like the butterfly effect ? (Not Mahoney's death but a little shift in the frail balance of the K5's life that caused this downward spiral)

Let's think about it...


We see Laurel going to Mexico was it true ? Did she met Frank? 


Then Asher being broken ... and Annalise refusal to help him (so why he is so thrust worthy with Ak?)


Michaela almost arrested for DUI ... 


Wes... well being Wes (but then we've learned that he got an internship... with whom? Where?!)


Oliver is nowhere .... (even if Connor talks about him)


Connor sunbathing on the roof while reading Giovanni's room and most of all deflecting Annalise's phonecalls (why!? And why was she calling him in the first place? I can see her reach out to Wes but why Connor?)


I know that at the moment Pete and the other didn't know who was dead but was there something shady behind those flashback that could point to some upcoming problem for the K5?!

When I got to college my freshman year I started hanging out with my current group of friends and my bf was one of them. At this point he was still dating his ex and had been for three years. This was his second year at college and she was living across the country so it was long distance. I thought he was cute and we got along really well but I never once even thought of him as more than a friend because I knew he was in a serious relationship. About half way through the second semester of my freshman year I hear that they broke up but that it was a long time coming (I later found out she was cheating on him). I felt bad for him so I started hanging out with him more and only three weeks later we started dating. I was extremely worried for a long time that I was a rebound but he constantly assured me that I wasn't. 

But this is where the problems starts. He had an internship far away over this past summer and since I only got to see him once the whole summer I started to get pretty insecure about our relationship. Instead of talking to him about it, which I later did, I decided for some reason to go look at his ex's twitter page and boy was that a mistake. Apparently she had recently found out about us and literally spent two months tweeting 10 times a day about how awful he was for cheating on her with me (which didn't happen, but honestly I can see why she thinks that) and how pathetic I am. It slowed down but she still tweeted about us at least twice a week for a very long time. Even a month ago she was still posting things about us. She clearly has issues of her own but for some reason I can't stop looking at it and every time I do it puts me in a not great mood because not only do I hate anyone thinking that I have done something wrong, I also don't like the idea that she still clearly has feelings for him. Rationally I know I can fix all of this by just not looking at her social media but I'm addicted to it now I think. I have told my boyfriend that I look at her page every so often and how it makes me feel but he doesn't know the extent of it. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions on ways I can stop and get over all of this? 

TL;DR: My bf's ex keeps posting things about me and my bf and I can't stop looking at it. "
5uu31f,17,2017-02-18,First date from OKC and rant.,BigMackWitSauce,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/5uu31f/first_date_from_okc_and_rant/,"So I've been using OKC and also joined this sub about a month ago. On Thursday I had my first date from this site. I came up with a great opener and it felt like I hit it off with this girl right away. She was hesitant to meet up so we talked for almost three weeks everyday and seemed to get along great and almost always had flowing conversations. 

So we finally meet up and again I thought things went great, we talked for nearly three hours and it felt like it would have gone on longer than that if o didn't have to go pick someone up. We even arranged a second date and she seemed enthusiastic about it. 

Anyway today I got a message from her basically saying that she wasn't interested and I'm honestly feeling really down about it. I had never talked to someone for so long before I met them, and I hadn't even sent out or responded to any OKC messages for two weeks because I felt so confident about this. 

So now I've just been feeling shitty about everything and how a lot of things in my life are. I recently moved and don't have any friends, I've barely ever had any real friends in my life and now only one of them even ever texts me now that I'm gone. I've only been on 5 dates in my life, all of them from online and I've never had a second date. My only relationship I've ever had was set up by my friends and the girl had also never been in a relationship so it almost felt like our friends saying let's put our two most pathetic friends together because we feel sorry for them. 

It's just tough not to have the mentality that the more people get to know you the better they're going to like you, and this girl knew me significantly better from talking for so long compared to every other date so to have that mentality challenged really hurts. It just makes me wonder what people don't like about me, I know it's not just my looks because I've never had a lot of close friends either, and I've never been considered anyone's best friend either, or had people really go out of the way to want to hang out with me, I've always been the one going out of my way for others. 

I've never been truly successful at anything in my life, graduating college always felt like something that was inevitable, and I didn't put in any effort and am left feeling more like a failure from it. I mean I had a decent GPA but I think I would have wanted like a 3.8 to 4.0 to feel like I really successfully applied myself. I'm now job hunting with no practical experience under my belt, and i performed poorly at the few jobs and internships that I did do. I didn't get to know any of my professors very well at all to ask for letters of recommendation for grad school. I didn't join any organizations or become part of anything. I was in Psi Chi but I never even heard about a single meeting. 

I'm sorry for the rant, I'm just feeling frustrated with how things are going. "
5uu710,164,2017-02-18,I'm falling for a black man.,vikingbubbles,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5uu710/im_falling_for_a_black_man/,"I haven't known him for very long, honestly. He actually liked my sister before we got together. But I know he is a good man. He has a kind heart and he cares so deeply for me. I've never felt so beautiful and confident than I have with him. I am happy.

I wanted to share this happiness with my parents. I'm a 21-year-old Asian girl, living at home, while I go to university. While I have an internship and make a little bit of my own money, they are my financial support. They pay for my education, my car, and are helping me take a trip this summer to New York for another internship I got.

I knew it would be a risk telling them. Growing up, I would hear the snide comments about the black woman using food stamps in front of us in the grocery line. I would watch them turn off the TV when a show like Sister, Sister or That's So Raven came on. They were small things. But it's 2017. I thought maybe times were different.

Last night, I came home a little too late after seeing him. It was my fault. When we began to argue, I spilled my heart out to them. Only to have it broken in return.

My father threatened to take my car away. He said he would help me pack and bag and get out. He said he would rather die than have ""monkey"" grandchild. My mother cried, saying this was her ""greatest fear."" I sobbed and begged them to give him a chance, like how they did with my sister's Mexican boyfriend. They said that there was no chance that they would change their mind.

It was 2 am by the time I got into bed. It wasn't until 4 am I stopped crying to go to the bathroom and throw up. At 6 am, my anxiety kicked in and I had a panic attack. My head spin and I couldn't breathe. It's currently 1 pm as I write this and the weather is beautiful outside. But I still cry knowing that I was raised by such racist and discriminatory people.

I could continue to be with him. Move out, get a better paying job, finish school on my own. But this isn't a movie. Life doesn't work like that. I can't completely turn my life upside-down for a guy that I've been dating for two months. 

I could continue on with him, in secret. Cut the amount of time I spend with him. Only see him during the day. Make ourselves miserable. He deserves more than that. He deserves more than this situation.

I could end things with him. Focus on the amazing opportunities that are ahead of me. Hope that we meet again later in life once I'm on my own. But like I said, this isn't a movie. And it would feel so wrong to let my parents win. To let them continue this lifestyle full of hatred.

I didn't hesitate for a second when I decided I wanted to be with him. His curly hair, his dark skin, his insanely adorable smile with thick lips. He loves to make people laugh. We constantly joke about superheroes and stupid memes. He's so passionate about history and people. I could listen to him talk for hours. The way he holds me and calls me baby girl. I could melt in his arms. 

I've never been so sure about being with someone before. And I'm so scared that I won't be able to."
5uujvg,7,2017-02-18,"""Learn by Doing""?",danielhamg,CalPoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/5uujvg/learn_by_doing/,"Hi! I recently got into Cal Poly (CompSci major) and I'm super excited because it's the first school I got into!! So most of the other schools I applied to are UCs and they don't come out until waaaay later, but I still took some time since yesterday to take a closer look at their curriculum and culture.  
Something that obviously sticks out about Cal Poly is this whole ""learn by doing"" motto, and so basically my question is, what exactly does that mean? This question kind of sounds dumb but I'm actually confused in a way because I assumed most schools have that general philosophy. Like don't the UCs have research opportunities or hook you up with internships? But since it's the most common thing that pops up when someone googles up Cal Poly-related terms, what exactly makes that phrase unique to this school? Or, am I looking at this from the wrong angle?
Thanks!!"

Last call for alcohol. Last call for your freedom of speech. Drink up. Happy hour is now enforced by law. Don't forget our house special, it's called an Obama screwdriver. It's got one part coca cola, two parts arabic person, and a jigger of formaldehyde from the jar with Scalia's brain in it we got in the back storeroom. Happy trails to you. Happy trails to you 🐸

I am Emperor Donald Trump, born again with fascist cravings. Still, you made me president. Human rights will soon go away, I am now your Shah today. now I command all of you. now you're going to pray in school. I'll make sure everyone's Christian too, shooby doo wop

Ku Klux Klan will control you, still you think it's natural!! n*gger knockin' for the master race, still  you wear the frog pins. you! closed your eyes, can't happen here, Vladimir Putin on a horse is near. ISIS won't come back you say. Join the army or you will pay!! America first! America first!

Yeah, that's it. Just relax. 
Have another drink (not coca cola), few more pretzels, little more InfoWars. Turn on those New England Patriots on your TV. Lock your doors. Close your mind. It's too late for a warning. Welcome to 2017. are you ready for the **third world war**?!? You too will meet the secret police!! they'll draft you and they'll deport your muslim wife 

You'll go quitely to boot camp, they'l shoot you dead, make you a man! Don't you worry, it's for a cause: feeding Ivanka's clothing line. DIIIE on our brand new poison gas, CCCP or Steve Bannonstan!! Making money for President Trump, and all the friends of President Trump!! America first!!!! **AMERICA FIRST**

Its so small. ButI couldnt fit my 10 inch through it. Jk ban me



I hope he comes for me first. He better come with lots of ammo because I have a few AR15s and friends waiting. Been trolling him forever hoping he would. He's just too crazy though, he's too far gone in his own bubble and loves that Russian money he's getting... Since he's a coward as well, he won't do shit.
I mean just look at what he's doing right now. His whole speech is designed to convince the crazies in his audience to fight. To convince his audience that critics of trump are ""traitors"". To convince his audience that they should be ""ready to die."" These are orders from Russia... Mark my words.... For 3 weeks now Alex has been preparing people to fight. He's been instilling people with fears of ""WW3"" as his Russian bosses have told him to.
Remember, even in that one subreddit, they've been discussing ""civil war"" and ""arming themselves"". These people are fucking insane terrorists and everyone here should also be ready because the Russian overlords are sending a message: THEY KNOW the jig is up. They KNOW that their puppet won't last. They know all this. This is why they are in ""prepare the audience for a fight"" mode.
Like any terrorist, Alex is fearmongering and asking people for loyalty and preparing people to fight. That's how insane he is. He is a terrorist. And what any patriot in any military branch will say about terrorists is: we're prepared to send them to where they want to go.

OJ Is an Idiot

So this is going out to my boy, OJ
Who's on trial again (wow)
And once again — did not do it
I made a song about it, OJ, love ya

OJ didn't do it
He did it hypothetically
Genetically, he's guilty
But technically he's not

He's the Vick of '94
NAACP knew
Well, I mean, if OJ had done it...
The glove would have fit, too

But it didn't — he's acquitted
He's just black and strong
And if you... do that long enough (huh)
You'll always be wrong (oh!)

OJ, why do you keep doing this?
OJ, why do you try?
(Why, OJ? Why, OJ?)
OJ, do the Silvermans a favour
And please go and die
'Cause you murdered innocents 
And got away. But you couldn't just 
Sit down another day. 
You're an idiot, idiot, idiot

Don't let nobody 
Out this room right here
Motherfucker's name is OJ
And the pain is near!

So you gonna take my shit?
Then you gonna sell it? 
(Wait a minute, no, OJ)
You gonna take my shit?
And you gonna sell it? 
(Nah, man!)

Motherfucker, I'mma knife you like Freddie
Baby, could get much worse
Hit you like Mike Turner
Put your dumb ass in a hearse

I'm gon go rock you, sock you
Baby, robot battle
I wouldn't bring a gun
That's just silly

OJ, why do you keep doing this?
OJ, why do you try?
(Why, OJ? Why, OJ?)
OJ, do the Silvermans a favour
And please go and die
'Cause you murdered innocents 
And got away. But you couldn't just 
Sit down another day. 
You're an idiot, idiot, idiot

I dunno, I just watched an Amy Schumer episode without cringing. In fact, I found her much more charming than Rob Schneider in his show, and also much more charming than I would have expected despite your post. And she confronts, without apologizing, how her own material is considered offensive and, perhaps even worse than that, not representative enough of lesbianism.
Why do you hate white people?

have you ever seen diane keaton's vajamjam in stereoscopic 3D vision while guy pearce plays your dick like a fiddle? download the brand new NUDE CELEBS FOR FREE oculus rift attachment! let me real quick. explain what that is, the oculus rift is a virtual reality machine that plugs into a thing called a computer which is what your grandkids have to use every time you force them to post for you on this rotten, festering asshole of a facebook page. don't get this virtual reality mistaken for the ALTERNATE reality that you all have found yourselves trapped in where you think it's okay to be complete racist slobs publicly announcing your antiquated fears and superstitions. hey i got an idea how about i just solve all your racism right now. 

Hey guys heard there were some misunderstandings about Syrian refugees in here and would love to clear it up, thank you in advance for questions. 

Hey been a Trump supporter for a year now. I never really understood politics but all I know is Donald Trump speaks from his heart and doesn't let no agenda get in his way. That man tells it like it is and he's gonna make this country great again. This countrys gone to shit in a shit bucket. never trust in no politician to get nothin done except Donald J Trump because he's God's chosen man for the job. I been unemployed ever since the Jiffy Lube up the street caught fire and I dunno how I'mma feed my two daughters who are the lights of my life. Trump's gonna fix that! I'm terrified of refugees and immigrants floodin into this country with their rape mouths and drug satchels, tryin to kick me outta my home to make room for more ghettos and Trump's gonna fix that too. I may not like black people but I don't see how that makes mearacist. I know some good ones who I get along with because they don't throw it in my face. Gays gettin married? Well I could go either way on that one because I don't see why we should be tellin people what to do with their own assholes but if vice presidential candidate Mike Pence wants to ban homosexuality aint no shit off my shirt. I been duped my whole life into thinkin one way or another and it's just refreshing to see a strong man up there on the podium, absolutely 100 percent not trying to dupe me in anyway no sir He means everything he says. Hell he means what he says so much that hell even take back what he says sometimes just so he can say the original thing again later and remind everyone that's what he meant in the first place. His son Eric looks like he mighta gotten caught up in a paint mixer as a baby but that's probably his mother's fault. Lord knows you're allowed a couple whammies when it comes to havin kids. Although my daughters ar perfect. When will the lying crooked media stop trying to shove false truths down everyones throats and why does the public believe all this crap? I been watching Fox news for years now and I'll tell ya they are directly responsible for all the knowledge and lack of paranoia bouncing around in my head. Obama's the worst president we ever had, Jews run the media, and if Hillary Clinton wins well never have another chance at ever getting a presidential candidate we like EVER AGAIN. Especially not in 4 years when there's another election. Also I don't want no woman tellin me what to do. 

Hey MAGAI Wow had no idea you were with us Trump supporters! Man l always thought Dilbert was the dumbest fucking comic out there. Just basically not funny at all and kind of a waste of everyone's time. I'll tell ya, you could throw a dog off a bridge onto concrete and the impact stain would be more enjoyable to look at than anything you've ever put to paper. You also kinda look like someone who's left some kids behind in shallow graves in the woods. Not that you have, but that's certainly the vibe you give off. Anyway l take it all back now that know you're with the greatest political movement since Sarah Palin opened the door for low functioning adults who want to run for office. How many women have told you to leave them alone for you to get this fucking furious over a goddamn soap commercial? Maybe if you stopped writing Dilbert you could get yourself a date Idon't even think a Trump victory could get women's self esteem low enough to touch you in any way other than a shove that means ""stop"" and ""no"" But hey, don't worry you're just an old lonely man who came out of seclusion to let everyone know that not only did you create Dilbert, which sucks, but you also back Trump, which personally l think is awesome but I also drank a melted tire once because my cousin promised me a kiss. lost a lot of brain cells on that dare, but not as many as the first time I tried to read dilbert. Alright fuck you dude please cancel Dilbert. 

Typical brainwashed ignorant. Hillary is being exposed real hard by Wikileaks, Project Veritas Action &amp; Anonymous. The facts are out there and still you people only care about the same scandals of Donald Trump aired by the bias mainstream media

Hey guys Salvia here. Just wanted to apologize for that anti racism video that pissed you all off so much. It's just that when you say stupid racist shit, it makes you look like a bunch of stupid racists. And I don't like racists, not as much as you don't like minorities but that's besides the point somehow. Anyway l stumped upon this video when my grandpa emailed it to me. He loves this shit but he's 92 and he's got the weirdest balls you've ever seen in your life. The ball on the right looks like it's trying to escape his body, and his left ball is crescent shaped and muscular. You ever see a ballsack with muscles? Fuckin crazy. Anyway why am l here? Oh right, you guys had shitty parents who fucked you up for life and now you hate jews and black people. There's a special FEMA camp in Kansas for people like you but I'd rather you all just go back to the country you came from, which by the way on a long enough timeline of human history would be Africa. chhHOOOOOOO CHOOO 

Oh god that girl is fuckin hot. I could probably jerk it just to her
Edit: okay guys just finished jerking. What I did was printed out this meme and started jerkin it while thinking about dirty things I would do to her like suckin them tiittays makin her squirm and moan meanwhile she put a hand down my pants giving me a handjob so in response I take those glasses off and shove her face in my crotch so she gives me a bj it's probably real fuckin good just suckin it hard no teeth just them lips yeah she looks like she's Mexican so the interracial thing turns me on cuz it's kinda taboo so I take off all her clothes and she's naked then I put my dick in her brown pussy no condom just fucking hard hArd hard so much she's crying from the pleasure it was at this point I came on the printed out meme

You just tell 'em a compliment, you know — you do the 'introduce yourself' thing; I mean, look, guys, it doesn't really matter what you say to these brainless creatures, okay. They're practically— they're barely human, okay — you can tell 'em anything and they're gonna let you shove your junk in their hole. They don't deserve our respect; only men deserve our respect— why aren't we fucking men by the way? Men are the only people I respect; I wanna fuck dudes. I'm gay and I wanna fuck dudes. Why do you wonder why I overcompensate all the time and fuck women all the time? I'm obsessed with it, I don't even have any emotional reaction— it doesn't mean anything, man, at this point. I just shove my balls up girls' buttholes, dude; that's what I get off on. But a guy's dick... Aw, that's beautiful, dude... I love to suck dick. I mean, that's an emotional response, man. Men have souls — they know, you know, I bond with my bros, I just love being with my bros. Man, I'd love to fucking kiss a dude on the lips, dawg! But hey, that's another tutorial for another day.

Do me a favour, Sarah — okay, look; I've got junk and I'm here to slam it in your fucking hole, okay, bitch? So, if you could do me a favour and just appreciate that I'm here talking to you, and you owe me something. Okay, I came over to fucking shove my shit in your fucking shithole, and your baby shithole, okay? You could at least act like you wanna talk to me, okay? Please. Please, do you know who I am? I have fucked ten thousand women, okay? You should be happy that I'm trying to give you gonorrhea and Hepatitis A through Z and possibly AIDS, okay? Super AIDS, at that. I have fucked women with AIDS; do you know what happens when you fuck someone with AIDS? You get super AIDS — I've got super super AIDS, bitch. So unless you don't want me to fucking stick my fucking infested junk in your fucking traphole, you better start showing me some love, and appreciate that I'm here trying to fuck you.

Now i know what you're thinking, do [those nips](http://www.i.imgur.com/6N5bzfH.png) come off? And yes they do, they pop right off like little sticky back salamis. Anyway as a trump supporter, i sure have to put up with a lot of bullshit. All i have to do is say im voting for trump and suddenly ive got a gaggle of angry SWJs home from their remedial classes calling me a sexist and telling me that im ignoring some pussy grabbing bullshit that i don't think he even got in trouble for? I mean come on the other chick lies to the fbi and has a nazi kkk cuck kissing her. I would have to be the biggest fucking idiot in the goddamn world to change my mind about who I'm voting for. Look, I know he might have grabbed a bunch of pussies, and he might have a wig, and his skin is pocked with artificial solar panels to keep his robotic legs powered, and he practices voodoo or whatever the fuck, but really even if all that is true, he's still better than Crooked Hillary. Because Hillary Clinton is a baby woman in a big suit and the people voting for her would vote for a wheelbarrow as long as it had a note on it that said ""im not trump"". But back to those nips can you believe these things aren't permanent? would love to get some more pictures of nips that pop off hit my username and gimme some stuff to JO to tonight when I'm celebrating our trump victory with a big glass of baby blood. 

YEAH FUCK THESE CORRUPT ASSHOLES I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY ""OH THEY RE MYEH THEY'RE NOT ALL BAD"" ""EWWHH MY DADS A COP HES A GREAT MAN"" WELL YOUR DAD BEATS UP BLACK DUDES AND SHOOTS DOGS FUCK COPS

The financing of film made by Armenians . Film history is full of lies. Facts are different. Directed by Terry George, He has damaged the credibility of the Hotel Rwanda movie. 

Armenians together with the Russian army, the massacres committed in the Ottoman Empire Armenians treason), 600 thousand Ottoman civilians killed were not included in the film Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were rich people. The only reason for the betrayal is orthodox alliance with the Russians. Armenians of the world with the greatest betrayal; (together with the Russian army); tried to invade the Ottoman Empire. Film history lies, love trilogy and bat man, a complete freak. Turkey, in other Turkish states, 400 million Turks; this film was found disgusting. All over the world people have to understand Turkey is very strong. World countries if they want to see the power of the Turks, we show them .

5uv9zk,1,2017-02-18,"Me [26 M] with my girlfriend [20 F] for 1 and a half years, are fighting everyday and the circrumstances are forcing me to move out of my current place.",troubledsoul12321,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5uv9zk/me_26_m_with_my_girlfriend_20_f_for_1_and_a_half/,"soo ive been with this girl for a year and a half now. Dont get me wrong- i love her to death. she has the capability to be very sweet, and caring when shes in a good mood.

But when shes in a mad mood (which is whenever she is hungry and hasnt had sugar in her) she is fowl. or when she gets sweaty. she has the meanest attitude problem. even sometimes when shes sober- she lashes out at me so im forced to smoke weed to be with her. She has self esteem issues (shes kinda chubby and thinks shes super fat) and its really tiring to always compliment her looks. (even we theyre lies sometimes) I cant even go out to the beach with her because she says ""im too fat"". What frustrates me the most is that she hates herself for it and complains about it but does absolutely nothing to fix it. I watch her engulf sugary starbucks drinks almost every day. If its not that- its a doughnut- or a cinimon bun- or a cookie. I get SICK of seeing her eat so much sugar everyday. If i ate as much sugar as her, i would probably die of a diabetic coma. She has cellulite and a belly but she isnt obese. She still has a nice figure and potential to be really attractive. right now i try not to look at the fat and i look past the fat as best as posible. It angers me that she cant really keep up with me in physical excercise but try to love her anyway because sometimes she does try. 

I always hang out with her everyday and everytime i have free time- i dedicate it to her. 24/7 im texting/drving/taking her on dates/spending time with her. Sometimes i am tired from work and i just want to go home and shower. She gets mad at me and manipulates me to stay when i tell her im too tired and i want to go home she threatens to break up with me because i wont hang out with her so i end up hanging out with her with us fighting the whole time cuz im too tired to be in a good mood. 

but i still try to love her and over look all the negative qualities because i am afraid of breaking her heart. at the same time though im doing her a favor if i do because im only going to lead her on or be unhappy together for the rest of my life.

 There are glimpses of hope here and there- for example me moving out of my dads place into my brothers grandmas place because of the conflicts shes has with my family. the whole reason we started fighting a lot more is because we are forced to hang out outside of my house. now im forced to choose sides between moving out for my girlfriend so we have a place to hang out (its cheaper and closer to school too) or staying at my dads place because its familiar and feels like home.

 both places are cheap though, my dads being 300 including a phone line vs 100 at my other grandmas house. I see the upsides but there are so many risky things about it. what if im not a good fit there, what if something happends and im forced to move again. what if my girlfriend ends up getting into a fight with my other grandma and i cant stay there anymore. 

it seems im doing all this shit for her- sarcrificing time in studies- time for work- time to do shit for myself- to see her and spend time with her. im even doing this move for her when i dont even want to move in the first place. i love living here- its on the BEACH.

its not like its not mutual either- she does mention breaking up and not ever talking to me again on a daily basis. Its not healthy for me to hear that she doesnt want to be with me everyday even though i suck it up and still try for her. im done, i dont want to do it anymore but it tears me apart on the inside because ive grown so attatched to her.

everytime i convince myself i shold break up with her, i think about her smile or the way she looks at me when she cares or the way she comforts me and gives me affection. I think about all the time we spent together and how it wouldve all gone to waste. I think about all the money and weed i spent with her. I think about how we believe were gonna be together forever. We told ourselves that we are meant for each other and that were soul mates and that we'll never leave each other and we'd grow old together and get married and be together forever. 

I miss her right now as im typing this and i miss her and us everyday even when were sometimes together. i miss what we used to be before all this drama happened. I dont know if im strong enough to move out for her. 

My dad isnt the best dad in the world- and part of the reason is to get away from his emotional abusiveness. My girlfriend thinks its because of him that im so depressed everyday. My girlfriend thinks very little of my dad and it hurts me to hear her talk shit about him. even tho my dad and i have our differences- and i vent to her about him alot - he is still my dad. 

im not sure what the problem is, is it my dad? is the problem her? or is it me? I dont want to move- its very stressful for me to move. i have one semester off to think about this and establish an income to pay for school and fix my personal life. Im either faced with moving out in my grandmas place for cheaper rent and it will probably fix my girlfriend and i's relationship because we'll have a place to study/hangout. Or i can stay at my dads place- break up with her- focus on myself for 6 months and then get ready for school again next semester. 

Being single at university sounds really fun though and i reallly want to do it but im afraid of the ""what if shes the one"" and the ""oh my god i miss her so much"" honestly i need to work on myself i and i probably shouldnt be in a relationship at all.

Im thinking of breaking up with her over the phone tonight cuz i cant do it in person. 

Or if i choose to stay- and wimp out- i wont ever know what it wouldve been like to date other women and ill be married to her eventually and live the rest of my life with her. Ill end up moving in with my granmda and spending everyday with my girlfriend like i do right now.

Im not even sure if that would work because I feel like shes the reason i didnt do so good last semester and that i stopped showing up to my internship (major no) 
  
a part of me thinks i could work it out- and learn to see her everyday yet still work and find time to come home and relax if i only moved into my grandmas place which is closer to her house. 

Part of me wants to see other people. I want someone whose confident in herself. I want someone who is physically able to keep up with me on hikes and even sex. I want someone who doesnt emotionally abuse me when she doesnt get her way. 

Why am i such a pushover for her? I think its because im whipped. 
I need to unwhip myself- not destroy the relationship i have with my dad- get back into surfing- and do good at school 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Im torn between taking sides with my dad or my girlfriend. The resulting decision will determine where I live and how I will go to school. "

First, I would like to re-iterate how awesome East India Officer's Club is.  I have gone back to this blend more often than any of the other smokes from the mail call. I may switch it up with Cult Blood Red as the aromatic in my rotation to keep me from getting burned out on either.   
  
On to the new things..  
  
* **Quick Hits**  
  
C'est La Vie French Vanilla Pouch: an even smoke but no trace of vanilla, the Drexel pouch was a better vanilla smoke  
   
John Bull Pouch: its English in a Pouch, good smoke, but Peterson Wild Atlantic is better    
  
  
* **Orlik Mellow Mixture**  
  
Ad Copy: *Mellow Mixture combines wonderful bright Virginias with two distinctly different black Cavendishes and a touch of toasted Burley. The unique chocolate and caramel topping adds an enjoyable aroma, and just enough sweetness to be noticeable but not dominant.*  
  
This isn't a bad smoke and it is indeed mellow. However, it had a sourness to it as well. I didn't enjoy the tin note, room note, or flavor and reading the reviews it seems like quite a few people agree.  Maybe the flavors just don't agree with my palate, but that sour funk was a real show stopper.  
  
Luckily, the tin was an upsell offer from P&amp;C so I didn't shell out much for it. Here is the real benchmark, **""is this tin better than Captain Black White as a mellow aromatic?"". No.**  
  
You don't want to pay a tin price for something that doesn't beat Lane's drug store label.  
  
  
* **Hearth &amp; Home Marquee WhiteKnight**  
 
**I aborted the first bowl of this I tried**. I'm not sure if it was the time of day or if the tobacco needed to off-gas from being tinned or what, but I had a quick unpleasant aborted smoke.  
  
Fast forward to this afternoon at my favorite smoking lounge. I kicked back with White Knight and a diet Root beer.  
  
It was **incensual**.  The incense-like flavor and room note were amazing.  
  
In writing this I had to go re-read Russ's notes on it:  
  
&gt; When I released Hearth &amp; Home Marquee WhiteKnight, the customer feedback was very positive, so I feel that the effort was worth it. WhiteKnight utilizes the same types of tobaccos that went into B.S.O.S.M. - bright Virginias, magnificent Orientals, especially the ""Queen of Tobaccos"", Yenidje, and rich, smoky Latakia. There's an incense-like aroma to WhiteKnight that immediately recalls my old favorite, and there's a crispness to the flavor that's unlike most Latakia blends. It also has a short, clean finish that makes it a good choice to pair up with your favorite beverage.
&gt; 
&gt; Russ
&gt;   
  
I had it with a diet root beer and it was good with that. I'm not sure that was the beverage he had in mind. It really turned some heads in the smoking lounge due to the room note. **It self-advertises**. As he said in his note, it is indeed crisp and has a clean finish. I went right from this to more Officer's Club and didn't have Latakia aftertaste dominating that second smoke.  
  
I am not a huge orientals guy. I'm an English/lite-English/aromatic guy. However, White Knight will remain in my stash for when I get a craving for that rich incensual experience.  
  
**White Knight isn't smoked, it is experienced. I think that says much.**   
  
TL;DR:  
Officer's Club: still awesome, like warm soft boobs in your face  
C'est La Vie: Vanilla? Non! Non!  
John Bull: good, but doesn't escape the shadow of Wild Atlantic as the pouch English default  
Orlik Mellow: back to the drawing board, or stop letting the interns mix the dressing  
WhiteKnight: permanently staying in my chest of smokes, oriental sex magic  "
5uwg38,3,2017-02-18,"FSU, UM, or Stetson?",nastyfemale,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/5uwg38/fsu_um_or_stetson/,"Hi everyone. I know I've previously asked a similar question with the added issue of going out of state. I appreciated everyone's responses and it helped me to come to the decision that staying in state would be most beneficial to me.

That said, I'm now torn between three schools -- FSU, UM and Stetson. (Except UF which I'm still waiting to hear back from and if by some miracle I get in, I'd accept in a hot minute.) I'm sure I know the answer deep down, but it helps to talk it out. If you have ANY insight, please let me know!

My goal is immigration law. I'm not interested in Big Law. Small to Medium is fine, or government-related is good too.

**FSU ($20k/yr tuition)**
1. Higher ranking (50).
2. Good assortment of interesting/relevant course offerings.
3. A lot of great (advertised) externships and clinics.
4. Location at the state capitol provides access to government opportunities.
5. I submitted my scholarship/fin. aid. app but haven't heard back yet.

**UM ($48k/yr tuition)**
1. $26k/yr scholarship (2.5 GPA req).
2. Possibility of commuting from my parents or in-laws house. 
3. Course offerings and relevant (advertised) externships/clinics are a little more limited. 
4. In the heart of immigration issues, so plenty of internships I could get on my own.

**Stetson ($40k/yr tuition)**
1. $29k/yr scholarship (2.25 GPA req).
2. I like what they have to offer for courses and clinics. 
3. Tampa/St. Pete is a big city so getting internships on my own shouldn't be terrible.
4. They have a social advocacy program I'm very interested in.

5uwgw2,6,2017-02-18,The Lone Patient,Creepomaniac,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/5uwgw2/the_lone_patient/,"I lifted my head from Hard Times; relieving my head from all the plenteous description of the Victorian Age and looked at my fellow-traveler sitting opposite to me. I could tell from her face that she was eager to start a conversation.


She was a stout woman with a jovial face with a dark skin tone and during the time of Eid, it was no surprise that she was also on her way to her village home like the rest of us. She was the one who was first to start.


“If you don’t mind may I know where your village home is?” she asked as she smiled cordially.


It was no surprise. Bangladeshis are always curious upon which village one originates so I returned humbly, “Mysensingh, miss”


“Oh, Mashaa Allah… I am from Tangail. So what do you do?”


“I am an intern at Dhaka Medical College”


“Oh, Mashaa Allah… Mashaa Allah, that is so great to hear. You are such an erudite girl. Mashaa Allah”


I remained silent as I clearly felt the reddish hue congregating on my cheeks.


“My boy is still doing his HSC. He did not want to come as he always feels sick due to this stressful journey during Eid.”


I returned her a nod of understanding. The train crackled on its track.


“All these recent political instabilities ruining this country, I simply don’t know what will become of this country. Say, do you mind sharing with me one of your Medical College experiences?”


I looked at all the people around me; clearly it wasn’t the most ideal places to recount to my past experiences especially when you can literally smell the sweat and hear the pants of people around you.


“Don’t be shy. It will obviously kill some time of our long journey.”


I did not want to disappoint her in her festive mood so I began my tale.


It happened during the first days of last summer. A sudden outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases overtook the capacity of all the wards of our Medical College. It was delirious with people spread in every corners of the hospital floors crying out of pain.


That very day, a middle aged man appeared out of nowhere limping in the Hospital. He was grasping his stomach firmly signifying that he had a severe stomach ache. He seemed to look like an educated man so somehow out of a lot of hustle I managed to provide him a bed. Initially we thought that he was suffering from diarrhea as most of our patients but that was not the case. Every now and then he was murmuring gibberish which barely made any sense until I found out what he was trying to say. His words were, “I’m going to die, destroy the lab”.


The nurses on duty did not pay any heed to this man, who called himself Prof. Ahmed. When I appeared, he opened his eyelids widely and then began dragging my wrist. I shrieked but then mastering up my courage I tried to comprehend what my patient wanted to say.         


“Please call Tina and tell her to destroy my lab at Tejturi” he told me with his voice shaking heavily.


“I don’t understand sir. What do you mean?”


“I give you her number and tell her my message, she will understand. Please, this is a matter of saving humanity from a terrible fate.”


Feeling completely dumbfounded, I took Tina’s number from him. When I called her, she just confirmed her name and as I just mentioned his specific instruction she instantly cut my call before I could ask her any further queries. Feeling more perplexed than ever, I returned to my patient and assured him that I did as he wanted me to do. He seemed to have relaxed a bit but after some moment, he started talking once more. “Thank you, I just want to mention to you that in my lab I have actually invented a new pill containing nanobots which can disintegrate the human body for good. I accidently got exposed to these nanobots and my body is going to disintegrate after midnight”


I was shocked, without thinking I asked, “What do you mean sir? Is it really possible?”


He just answered, “Very possible”, as he shut his eyelids.


I knew, I no longer wanted to speak of this matter. I returned home but the Professors words did not allow me to drowse for even a single fraction of the night. When I returned to my workplace, I discovered my gone!


I searched every corners of the hospital. I asked all the nurses and guards but none of them remembered seeing him at the Hospital. It was as if he had disappeared into thin year. Or did he really disintegrate? To this day I still don’t know the answer.


That is not all. on 10th of April, there was a fire at a chemical shop at Tejturi Bazar which led to the death of around eleven people, I am not so sure about the figure. This news was covered in all forms of the media but the police could not fathom the true reason behind this awful tragedy. I have a gut feeling that perhaps Tina was somehow engaged in the outbreak of this fire at Tejturi. This incident is by far the most awing incident of my Medical life and I really don’t expect that I will ever experience such happening in my entire life.


I finished my tale and without even looking I could bet at least twenty eyes were popping out right at me. There was a moment of silence until I went into breaking it myself. “I hope this story was able to kill your time Aunty.”


“Yes, it surely did my child” answered my fellow passenger in a quivering tone.


Note: This story is based on the Tejturi Bazar tragedy which took place on the 10th of April 2014. For more information please read this news:  http://bd.thedailystar.net/tears-anger-fill-hospital-air-19754. Although this is a work of fiction the fire outbreak which had occurred at Tejturi Bazar was actually true.

*ching chong chong... Fwooooosh...*

""Breaking news coming to us right now, by way of a bombshell interview set to be published in tomorrow's New York Times. Actress Emma Watson, who many know from the popular Harry Potter series of films reportedly announcing - and this is a direct quote - 'I will, at the end of this year, star in a pornographic film.' She continues, 'I desire to have sex with a hot guy with a great... Just read it? On air? OK... A great cock,' before expanding 'I hope that my film will serve as an example to other women all over the world to enjoy life and enjoy their bodies.'

""To discuss this matter, first, I'm joined by our intern Derek Monroe. Thank you for joining me Derek, I know this might be a little unconventional, but I'm told by my producer that your workstation desktop image is, in fact, a photo of Ms Watson.""

""That is correct.""

""And how are you reacting to this news?""

""Well, expect to see very little of me in the office come December, for starters.""

""Gross, Derek.""

""Don't judge. That's exactly what she is expecting, and maybe it's a genuine thrill for her, maybe it's a political statement - hell, you could argue that it's all a piece of performance art - but ...imagine how many orgasms she has inspired in just the past year...""

""I'd rather not - what's your point.""

""Don't be a prude. My point is, she's already given so much, attained such a elite status in our sex obsessed pop culture, this is a natural next step, and frankly, I think she's going to be a pioneer. I would expect to see maybe a Vanessa Hudgens or even a Jennifer Lawrence follow suit within a year.""

""An interesting take, I suppose. Thank you Derek. Next up... ohjususchrist.. Founder, CEO and creative director of the largest porn production company on the East Coast, Greystone Films, Adrian Greystone. Good evening.""

""A pleasure.""

""Now, some viewers might be wondering about the financial implications of something like this. Could you provide any insight on that, Mr Greystone? Has your company reached out to Ms Watson?""

""Frankly, we have no intention to do so, though we do wish Ms Watson all the best of success in her undertaking.""

""Greystone Films has no interest in a potential project opportunity here?""

""None from a financial standpoint. This is going to be a fruitless endeavor for anyone hoping to get rich off of it. I promise you, no matter how it is produced or distributed, that film is going to be pirated more than the final season of Game of Thrones after being locked in a wooden chest and carried across the ocean by a crew of scurvy-addled men with various missing limbs and a penchant for unnatural relationships with parrots.""

""Thank you for that insight, Mr Greystone. Finally we have two writers for 'Ms Mysandry,' one of the Internet's top sites for feminist discourse, Alicia Holmes and Madison Drake. Thanks to you both.""

""Thank you for having us.""

""Now, how does Ms. Watson's announcement resonate with you and your readership?""

""Well, if I might answer first, many of us are shocked and appalled to be living in a culture where Ms. Watson no doubt feels compelled by society to expose her most intimate self for commercial consumption, and to have that be celebrated across the media as a triumph of self-determination and ownership of one's sexuality. It's disgusting, really, and every man in the country who is looking forward to this rape-by-proxy should be ashamed of themselves, if not held criminally liable for what this woman is no doubt going to endure.""

""What? Do we write for the same website? This is absolutely a triumph for women across the globe. For far too long, legitimate sex work has been stigmatized and forced into the shadows, and now, we may finally have a proper champion to bring this forward and out of the dark and acknowledge that there should be no shame or stigma in directly addressing the needs, desires and fantasies of every person.""

""You're a bad feminist.""

""You're a bad feminist.""

""No! You're a bad feminist!""

""Fuck you!""

""Only if we can put it on the site!""

""Aaaaargghhhh!""

""Let go of..."" *Beeeeeeeeeeeeeep*

""Well, lots of various takes on this subject, and I promise we will have much more to say about this over the course of the next few months. Coming up after the break, correspondent Mark McCoy investigates the hotbed of amateur pornography produced on popular internet discussion board Reddit. ....Really? He got paid for that? No wonder his office door was locked all week. Jesus."""

It's been a while since my last check-in so I figured I would stop in to say hello. Being sober has felt like second-nature to me lately, but I'm aware of the dangers of complacency and wanted to re-confirm my dedication to sobriety tonight. 

Sobriety has been good to me lately, now that I'm (mostly) out of the weeds with the early days of emotional processing and heavy cravings. 

Getting sober helped me re-prioritize my financial fitness in a really good way, which has led me to aggressively paying off my car loan, cutting it down from a 5-year repayment plan to just under 2. It should be fully paid off by August. Yass!

Graduate school has been going really well, too. It's almost like I can actually concentrate on what I'm reading and retain what I've learned, now that I'm not pairing my studies with a huge glass of box wine (or three). I've also got an internship all lined up for myself: I'm going to be a counseling intern at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. Funny how things work out. 

Oh, yeah, and I'm moving in March! I've been living with family for the past year, but finally made the decision that I am ready to move back out on my own and be an almost-real adult again. I even bought a new mattress for myself for the occasion, since sleep is one of those now-wonderful pleasures I get to enjoy much more as a sober person. I'm super excited. 

Anyway, glad to be here with you all. I really want to encourage all of you struggling with sobriety, especially those of you newer to the lifestyle, to give it your all, and to never give up even if you mess up. It's worth it. 

I won't drink with you all tonight. Cheers (with fizzy water, of course) to /r/SD!

5ux6n3,5,2017-02-19,I've been lying to my family about having finished college.,itsme_eloise,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5ux6n3/ive_been_lying_to_my_family_about_having_finished/,"I walked in commencement three years ago with a couple of summer classes left to take and one language class I was planning to take online. I finished my summer classes but never took the language course. I had run out of financial aid. I wasn't focused during a few years and after a bad breakup (God, I hate that I was one of those girls. I feel so weak for having been weak. Continuing to be weak), I skipped a lot of class and ended up failing all my courses that semester. That was the first major fuck-up of my adult life and the memory of having to call my parents and tell them I had to repay back all the loans from that semester because essentially I wasn't in class and having to take a semester off and re-apply to the school because my gpa was so low. That phone call is a big part of why I've kept this a secret for so long. 

It took me five and a half years to not-graduate because of undiagnosed depression and fucking around not being focused on school and paying more attention to internships in a field that's not helping me get jobs (public relations and communications is worthless). After I left school I've been looking for work and coping with undiagnosed depression. I finally got help and medication this year, but I'm going on my third year being unemployed because no one wants to hire an English major with an unfinished degree with a huge gap in work experience and internships that make her overqualified for entry-level front desk positions. I can't even get a fucking secretary job. My parents and siblings have been supporting me, which weighs on me like a millstone. I hate feeling like a burden. Any extra money I had after paying back loans and paying for groceries went to other things like internet or gas. I feel like such a colossal fuckup for never saving the three or four hundred needed for one goddamn community college class that I should have taken that would have prevented all this. 

My mom keeps asking me for my diploma so she can get it framed with the rest of my siblings'. I keep telling her it's with my college stuff and try to change the subject. I'm having a bit of a panic attack because every now and then the fact that I've been avoiding me for years confronts me and doesn't let me go - I'm a college dropout. I never got my diploma. I could have avoided all the stress and anxiety and wasted time and money if I didn't make one stupid fucking mistake three years ago.

My family is not violent or abusive. They wouldn't cut me out of their lives. But before college, I was the golden girl in high school. I was on academic teams and in theater and precocious and smart and a good kid. No one in my family has fucked up on this level, lying for years to everyone to cover such a stupid fucking mistake. My mom got her BA and her master's in five years. My siblings both graduated with academic honors. I thought that would be me too. 

I can't dodge my mom's questions forever, especially since my younger siblings are starting to finish their education. I'm afraid of what they'll say. I'm afraid of how it'll change how they'll see me. I already know that the siblings I live with are being worn down by my unemployment and depression (one sibling knows I'm on meds, the other one who has paid for most of me through these years doesn't). Tonight I emailed an academic advisor explaining my situation to see if there's anything that I can do (even though my academic catalog has probably expired; I don't know what that means for whether or not my credits are still in tact for applying for graduation now). I missed a text from my mom earlier asking me about my diploma and even though the text was sent hours ago and she's asleep, I was absolutely paralyzed with panic and fear. I have to talk to her soon about picking a healthcare plan (another fucking burden I'm going to need my family to help me pay for) and I'm so so afraid that she's going to ask me about my diploma again. I know I have to move forward but I'm afraid that my family will never trust or respect me again if and when I tell them. "

Rocket League played 100 hours in short burts of 2 hour game sessions, play it every few days. Battlefield 1 played 100 hours and then stopped, went back once.

With more and more games coming out I tend to play games less and less hours before quitting and trying something new. I now hope to find a game I can play which will keep me busy but whom I can stop playing and come back to in a day or a week.


- My first1 requirement would be for the game not to get boring after a while but I know that depends hugely on the player. So take that one with a grain of salt.
For instance I got bored pretty quick in WoW but have played other repetitive games for a long time and still play them; Hearthstone

- Easy to get into but higher skill roof preferred. I think alot of games nowadays already have the aspect of a high skill cap level/skill roof.

- Sadly I dont have much time, my internship started and I play sports. So something I can jump and out of would in quick gaming sessions be a pro.

- I'm a student so low on money but I will pay for a good game.  Bought Battlefield, Overwatch and such full price and loved them.

- I'm looking to play a game in the fantasy genre as I have got and played enough fps, Overwatch, CSGO, Battlefield 1.

- I would like for it to have progression. New weapons, characters and such. I love to grow into a certain character and really make it my own.

I looked at games which I played or watched online:

- Eternal: not really fittting in my requirements at the moment and quite hard to get into.

- Heroes of the Storm: Fun and easy to jump into but did feel a bit empty. You cant buy items or whatsoever ( I know this is meant to be this way)

- Diablo 3 and Path of Excile: I felt kept back to start playing these games. I started but don't want to put in 50+ hours and then discover I dont like them. And they aren't really multiplayer.

A game which I liked and jump into every so often is Rocket League. It has a high skill level and keeps me entertained when I play it.

**TLDR** 

- Not repetitive, boring quickly.

5uyavz,14,2017-02-19,Older guy from work,boom876,RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/5uyavz/older_guy_from_work/,"Hey everyone!

So a bit about myself: I'm turning 23 in a couple of months, have my degree already and I'm now an intern in a company till April (for context reasons, in the country I live in, it's not as common to immediately get hired after an internship, but it's still a company, I would eventually love to work for in the future). I'm attractive, I have my friends and hobbies and I also feel confident personality-wise. All in all, I think I have a pretty good head on my shoulders for my age and I don't really have a problem getting guys attention, but I must admit that in the past few years, I had been really concentrated on my studies and on bettering myself, so there hasn't been much going on relationship-wise.

To get to the point finally, there's an older ('older', as in his early 40s--&gt;red flag nr.1) guy at work (red flag nr.2), with whom from the first moment we saw eachother, there was this instant attraction. And from then on (it's been a couple of months), he always finds excuses to come by my office (he works in another building in the company and also another department) and also started sitting at 'our' department's table at lunch. At first I didn't have a problem, b/c I thought he just wanted the attention of a 20-y.o. and wouldn't pursue anything, but then he started coming closer and I was always just nice, but nothing too much, b/c the whole situation freaked me out at first. Then, he came up to me and introduced himself one day, just out of the blue and he always stares at me, smiles at me across the room or the cafeteria and finds excuses to talk to me, but I avoid the whole thing.

The thing is, I would never even think about doing anything about it, a) b/c of the age gap and b)b/c we work at the same place. I don't know why, but the age -from an attraction standpoint- doesn't bother me at all anymore and I find him really, really attractive and I can't stop thinking about him. My only thoughts regarding the age gap, is that I immediately think, that the only thing he is interested in, is sex with a 20-something year old and nothing else and would never take me seriously. But then I think, that this could ofc be the case, but it's always in my hands to decide -after getting to know him- if our expectations match and if not, go our separate ways. In this situation, b/c we work in the same place, if anything were to happen, it would go extremely slow anyway and I would make it clear from the start.

So I decided I can start acting normal and at least talk to him at work and see where it goes from there and if it goes anywhere at all. My problem is, I am so so shy around him and I'm not like that normally, even with guys I like, I'm really outgoing. But, I feel so pressured to act mature and be interesting and not act 'too young' for him, which I know isn't the case, b/c I have talked 100 of times with older people and was always able to hold the conversation. I should also note, that I'm like that with most older people at work, b/c I feel like I need to make a good impression now that I'm interning there and I get really self-conscious when I have a conversation. So this behaviour isn't exclusive to him, it's just a little more when I'm around him. My 'biggest fear' is that he'll start talking to me at the lunch table and you know, I'll also have an audience and not just him to answer to.
Please tell me 1)if you think, that the only thing an older guy would want from someone younger is sex
2)what I can do, to get over this anxiety, that I have, when it comes to talking to him. I mean even if nothing happens or even if i.e. I were to get to know him and not like him at all, I don't like, that I feel so scared of doing something so normal, like talking to someone...It's not aligned with my personality at all. I know it's all in my head, but if you have any tips, please help me.
3)also if you have any tips about older guys in general.

Thanks a lot and sorry for the wall of text!"
5uyhn2,71,2017-02-19,I feel overwhelmed by the responsibilities of life,TheOldEskimo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5uyhn2/i_feel_overwhelmed_by_the_responsibilities_of_life/,"I'm currently finishing up my final semester of university studying computer science and systems.

I am so worried that I am going to fail during my final semester.

It's a miracle I've made it this far and mostly only do to the kindness and assistance of others.

I had an internship this summer that I found to be overwhelming and incredibly stressful and difficult for me.

To be honest, I absolutely hate computer science and engineering and I wish I had never gone to college and just worked in a Sprint store or something. At this point, it'd take forever to pay off my loans that way though if I quit now.

I hate so much having a problem that I cannot solve and yet MUST solve. It puts me in this place of constant anxiety and panic at all times.

I hate school and I always have. I hate work and I always will.

All I want to do is sleep.

But I have to work. If I don't, I won't survive. I hate this life. 

Most of my time is spent working and doing things I hate because I must.

If I don't work I won't have a place to live and I won't have access to the things that I do like.

I just don't want a part of any of this. Fuck my parents for having me -- I wish I wasn't born. 

Living is hell -- all we do is compete and work with the threat of replacement constantly looming overhead.

That's all my life is ever going to be.

Work work and more work followed by eventual retirement (if I'm lucky) at which point in time health issues will worsen and I'll eventually die statistically probably a painful death.

And then I'll be gone. What was the god damn point in the first place?

Just let me skip to the end.

But no -- it's not that simple -- the thought of suicide launches my brain into full on instinct animal mode and I am overcome by fear.

There's the chance it'd fail and only make my life worse too.

Fuck this. Fuck being here. Fuck being alive. Fuck consciousness and being human.

People are idiots you know that? ""Oh, let's have kids. It'll be great"" they say. 

""Let's just sign em' up for a life of constant work, stress, and competition"" (along with tons of inconvenience piled high and some significant losses thrown in there to boot).

God damn it do I wish I was never born. Have for years. This life is fucking bullshit.

People (including myself) are selfish, delusional, irrational, and hypocrites.

People fucking suck. Life fucking sucks.

Get me the hell out of here.

What really gets me are these religious ""pro-life"" people.

Abortion is a kindness you dumbass.

I'm writing a book, called Encore, that I'm releasing every Wednesday, chapter by chapter. In it, the 25-year old protagonist discovers that he's living each day twice - and he does what anyone in his shoes would do: he plays the lottery.

I'm only going to be posting an excerpt of it here, as it's pretty much what *I* would do if I won the lottery. In the past chapter, Leo goes to collect his winnings and spends a whole day understanding the difficulties in investing and protecting his winnings. In this chapter, Leo decides to buy a Ferrari and have a crazy day with his best friend Cedric. Here's an extract if you're interested! There's also the link to the full chapter (and the ones before it) below!

&gt;""Sorry,"" said the vendor, looking me up and down for the second time since I had approached him, ""We don't offer test drives.""

&gt;""I don't want a test drive,"" I ignored the fact that he hadn't called me *sir*, ""I want to buy this one.""

&gt;It was 10 a.m. on Thursday, April 26th, Day A, and I had decided that today I would buy a Ferrari. The huge purchase would disappear when I woke up the next morning, but in the meantime I planned to have a lot of fun.

&gt;I had called in sick on Tuesday, driven to Marseille, and opened an account with Crédit Suisse's private bank. As soon as I had flashed the Lotto check, they had rolled out the red carpet, and a few hours later I had left with a new bankcard, a new account with 1 million euros cash on it, and another million that was in the process of being invested. I had stopped by Orange Telecom's closest shop, and paid for the latest iPhone by card, no contract, and driven home.

&gt;The following day was Wednesday, Day A, so I had bought as many apps as I could, tried them out, and made a mental list of the ones I should buy again when they disappeared from my phone on Day B. Just for the kick of it, I had spent around 16,000 euros on Clash of Clans to max out my village in a little under an hour. It had made the game absolutely pointless, but it did keep me busy for a while. I had also went online to look for a new laptop to buy on a Day B, as the one that BNP had provided me with was an HP that would overheat so much I had become genuinely worried that it might explode.

&gt;I had ended up choosing an Alienware, the elite of gaming computers, and looked at what it would cost me if I selected the most expensive options for each category: the latest 8GB graphics card, a bigger battery, 64 GB of RAM, a 4 TB hard drive... I added on all of the accessories for good measure: a Bluetooth controller, headphones, and a backpack. I couldn't bring myself to buy Microsoft Office Suite though; I had been using pirated versions for my entire life, and saw no reason to change now. The total came out to a little over 4,000 euros. I had blinked a couple of times when I saw that the price was pretty much equivalent to two months of my salary. *What the hell, I'll buy it anyways.*

&gt;When I had woken up on Wednesday Day B I had decided that I should go to work. If Rule 2 was to live hidden, I had to keep up appearances. Weirdly enough, I had also been looking forward to it. It had felt like I was returning after a long vacation. Which was actually pretty accurate. Although I had technically missed only two days of work, the combination of the weekend and the Day A/B dynamic meant I had just had 9 days off.

&gt;That early enthusiasm had lasted me all of half an hour. I had immediately become absolutely and utterly bored. It had just been hard to focus on spreadsheets analyzing consumer data when I all I could think about were the things I would do with the 1 million euros sitting on my bank account. As usual, I had lunch with Thierry and we talked about his daughter, Alina. The day before, she had proudly proclaimed to her parents that she had three boyfriends but cared for none of them. She was four years old. I had told him she would break an untold number of hearts by the time she was 18, and he had protectively answered that he would probably break just as many heads.

&gt;After three more hours of Excel work, I had had enough. I knew that with the Day A/Day B dynamic, my job was sure to become more interesting with time. The Alicante meeting had shown me that with the right advantage, I was going to skyrocket through the ranks. But that would take time, and that time was mind-numbingly dull.

&gt;That only needed to be on Day Bs though. Unless there was something important like the Alicante meeting, I didn't even have to come in to work on Day As. Better yet, I decided, I was going to make Day As the complete opposite of Day Bs. Since nothing I did on Day As counted, I could go absolutely crazy and do everything I had always dreamed of. And in the meantime, I would just have to diligently focus on my career during Day Bs. I would be getting the best of both worlds. Work harder, play harder. I got back to work, although I did allocate the last hour to online shopping and a little research for the following day. 

&gt;This reasoning was what brought me to the difficult discussion I was currently having at the Ferrari showroom off the highway of Le Cannet. The vendor had seen me park my beat-up car up front, and had been looking at me suspiciously ever since I had walked in and begun to look at the cars on show. I was certain that if I even tried to touch one, he would jump in to stop me.

&gt;""Buy one?"" he sneered, ""Do you even know how much a Ferrari costs?""

&gt;I was relishing his attitude. I had chosen my outfit to create this exact situation. With my jeans, black t-shirt with a Pokeball logo, and scuffed black leather shoes that I had gotten three years ago at a discount store for my first internship, I didn't look like I had a penny to my name. I wanted this vendor to judge me, to look down upon me, and then to have to swallow his pride when I drove out with the Ferrari. This was my small revenge on a lifetime of being looked down upon.

&gt;That being said, he was right: I had no idea how much a Ferrari actually cost.

&gt;""What's the price of this one?"" I pointed at the one I had selected. I didn't understand much about luxury cars, or cars in general for that matter, but this one was low to the ground, had a retractable roof, and just looked absolutely beautiful. The curves were almost sexual, the hood wide and muscular. It was as graceful as it was powerful. It looked just like the ones I had seen in front of the Casino while visiting Monaco, or cruising down the main avenue in Cannes with that deep, low rumble. I wanted it.

&gt;""This one is the Ferrari 488 GTB *sir*,"" said the vendor, emphasizing the *sir* to show complete condescension, ""And it costs over 300,000 euros.""

&gt;""OK,"" I deliberately marked a pause and pretended to hesitate, ""I'll take it.""

&gt;The vendor, who had already started to walk away, stopped dead in his tracks. I looked at his nametag.

&gt;""Guillaume, please tell me: if I pay cash, can I drive away with it today?"" 

&gt;Guillaume looked completely bewildered, and I was struggling not to laugh. I managed to keep my expression serious long enough for him to eventually decide that I was. He still looked unconvinced, but gestured towards the small office section at the back of the massive white open-space in which the Ferraris were showcased.

&gt;""If you'll come with me sir.""

&gt;I followed him inside to an office filled with framed pictures of Ferrari's history: the original Scuderia Ferrari factory in black and white, Schumacher and Raikonnen holding up F1 trophies, and various Ferrari models I didn't recognize. I held back a chuckle at how similar the decoration was to the Formula 1-themed pizzeria we usually went to with Cedric and Hanaa.

&gt;Behind a wide stainless steel desk sat a middle-aged man wearing a white hemp shirt with the first three buttons opened, revealing a hairy chest and a thick golden chain necklace. He was so tan his skin looked like worn leather, and his hair was black with hints of grey on the sides. *Guillaume's manager*, I thought.

&gt;When I entered, he was nodding as Guillaume whispered into his ear, clearly describing our earlier exchange. I took a seat on the other side of the desk.

&gt;""How will you be paying sir?"" asked the manager, ""Just so you know, we don't accept checks.""

&gt;The fact that the manager didn't believe me either just made me enjoy the moment even more.

&gt;""Cash. I mean, card. Guillaume told me it would be slightly over 300,000 euros?"" I asked.

&gt;""Umm... yes,"" the manager hesitated, still uncertain whether this was genuine, ""Let me draw up the paperwork. Could I have your ID?""

&gt;I handed him my ID card and waited. The total ended up being 345,218 euros, including insurance for a year. I didn't need the insurance, but I merely nodded my assent without skipping a beat. 
&gt;After a few dozen signatures, Guillaume brought in a POS machine.

&gt;""Well, as soon as the payment clears she's yours,"" said the manager, taking the bankcard I handed him and inserting it into the machine.

&gt;""And I can drive away with her immediately?"" I asked, unconsciously mimicking his use of the female pronoun.

&gt;""Yes, absolutely,"" He handed me the POS machine.

&gt;I typed in my 4-digit code and waited. It beeped.

&gt;*Transaction denied.*

&gt;Guillaume rolled his eyes and the manager stared me down. 

&gt;""Sorry,"" I said, blushing, ""It's a new card, I must have entered the PIN wrong.""

&gt;I carefully typed in the PIN a second time. It beeped. *Transaction denied*, it read.

&gt;""Sir,"" growled the manager, ""I do not take kindly to people wasting my time.""

&gt;""Wait, wait,"" I held up a hand, ""This has to be a mistake. Let me call my banker.""

&gt;This wasn't at all going according to plan. I pulled out my phone and searched for my most recent contact: Mr. Lefievre CS Banque Privée. As the line rang I started to panic. *Did I imagine all of this? Did the lottery check not clear? Maybe my bank had invested more than the 1 million euros I asked for?*

&gt;""*Bonjour* Mr. Melikian,"" said Lefievre as he picked up, ""How may I help you today?""

&gt;""*Bonjour* Mr. Lefievre,"" I answered, ""I'm having a bit of a problem. I'm trying to buy a car and my card keeps reading 'Transaction denied'.""

&gt;Both the manager and Guillaume were scowling at me for wasting their time. I grimaced in way of apology. I could hear my banker type away on his computer through the phone.

&gt;""Ah I see your problem Mr. Melikian. We have a payment limit of 5,000 euros per day on your card. Would you like me to increase it?""

&gt;That explained it. I had forgotten that bank cards had daily caps on how much money one could withdraw or spend through POSes. To be fair, my meager salary meant that I hadn't ever encountered this particular problem before.

&gt;""Yes please,"" I answered.

&gt;""What would you like me to raise it to?"" he asked.

&gt;""The total amount of my current balance, please,"" I said, ""Thank you.""

&gt;""All of it?""

&gt;""Yes please.""

&gt;""Alright, please hold"" he said, and after an interminable minute of enduring the cold stares of both Ferrari salesmen, I heard him come back on the line, ""It's done Mr. Melikian. Anything else I can help you with today?""

&gt;""No, that will be all, thank you.""

&gt;I handed the POS back to the manager. ""Can we try again?"" I asked.

&gt;Still dubious, he typed in the amount and almost threw the machine down in front of me. 

&gt;""I'm warning you sir,"" he said as I typed in my code, ""If the payment doesn't clear I will have to ask you to leave or I'll need to call security to escort you out of the building.""

&gt;The POS machine beeped. *Payment accepted.* As it started to whirl and click, printing out the receipt, I turned to the manager who was staring blankly at the machine, stunned. I gave him a wide cocky grin. 

&gt;""Will security also help escort my car out?""

It is a 3 month training in Florida, than another 3 months of training in France, and after that, I have a 6 months internship in a one Michelin star restaurant, in France.

And I was wondering what you guys think of this and if you know anything about this school.

5uzk7a,1,2017-02-19,[M4F] - Discovered in the Office,PerfectSavage,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5uzk7a/m4f_discovered_in_the_office/,"The young man hurried out of the sleek elevator and down the hall to his office, hot cup of coffee in his hand while holding onto his briefcase. As he burst into the small office, he was greeted by a surprised squeak from his office mate. She was a young intern still taking college courses but, was eager to get some experience under her belt.

""Morning Rachel"" he said slightly out of breath, even though he was trim and fit. She never said anything, but Rachel secretly always tried to sneak glances at his form when he wasn't looking.

""Good morning, Dan"" she chirped cheerfully, quickly smoothing out her pencil skirt before swinging around in her office chair to face the man. He had caught her doing that more and more recently; Always acting flustered and panicked when someone came into the door or when he got up for a break. She was always slightly red in her pale cheeks and very breathy. He shrugged it off for now and settled into his own desk. They sat back to back and worked in their own little room. It wasn't quite cramped, but it was snug. Both of them had large desks with their computers sitting on them and they would type and work from nine to five.

""You look nice today"" he said casually, trying to be polite before sitting down in his chair with his back facing the young dark haired woman. His computer hummed to life as he took another sip of hot coffee.

""Thanks"" Rachel said, biting her lip as she smiled, slowly spinning around back to face her screen.

What Dan didn't know about his young office partner was that for the past few days, she had been doing some extra work on the side. Young, innocent looking Rachel had discovered the wide lewd world of camgirls. Girls who would sit in front of a webcam all day and perform depraved sexual acts for the denizens of the internet for tips. The sad truth was that most of them made more money than she did in a month. Of course she jumped at the chance. Student loans are no light burden, but she also had to work which meant most of her time spent ""camming"" was right there in the office with a co-worker right behind her. The perverts watching her little show paid good money to see her do naughty things right behind Dan's back.

Today was different though. She was nervous; her flat stomach was fluttering, her face was flushed and hot, and she was already rolling up the sleeves of her blouse and undoing a few buttons. Today was the day she decided to try a new kind of app that the cam sight was sponsoring. This app allowed a high tipper to take control of a vibrator for any number amount of minutes. This vibrator was behind her skirt, under her lacy red panties, and tucked away just on the other side of her smooth shaven pussy lips. The round little pill shaped toy was trapped snug between her pink fleshy folds waiting for the first person to take control.

It was hard not to get noticed, much harder than she had thought. Most of the people who got to control her toy would just blast it up on full power and force the poor office girl to bite down on her lip or cover her mouth to keep from letting her moans escape. Hour after hour she got hotter, more disheveled. Her skirt rode up more, revealing her thigh high stockings. More buttons on her blouse got undone and her raven black hair stuck to the sides of her face. She wasn't going to make it much longer and she knew it, but she was trapped in this office with a man and a webcam hidden under her desk to show off to the thousands watching. They could see her thighs clench and her knees buckle as the teasing little toy slowly drove her more and more insane with lust.

Behind her, Dan was all but clueless. That is, until she let a long shaky moan slip from her lips. For a split second her brain had gone numb and she forgot she was in an office so she just let it out, her eyes rolling in pleasure before popping wide open. She sat up straight, trembling and flushed, hoping Dan hadn't heard. He did though, and he slowly spun around in his chair and looked at the steaming hot brunette.

""Rachel, are you alright"" he asked with genuine concern, thinking she was in some kind of agony which wasn't far from the truth.

""I...I'm fiIIINE"" she squeaked just as someone else took control her little toy. 

Her skirt was soaked. Her lace panties were soaked. Hell, even her leather chair was soaked with the juices oozing out of her swollen needy cunt. She couldn't let him know, but this new controller was more devious in that instead of blasting the toy on full power, they were giving her waves of pleasure which tickled her spasming walls at just the right frequency.

She hunched over her desk, gripping it with her fingers until her knuckles were white. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth and her glasses slid down the tip of her nose as she brought her knees together hard. She was going to cum and she couldn't stop herself. She trembled in her chair as her hungry cunt clenched around the vibrating toy again and again. Dan watched with a horrified look on his face as the young girl groaned and drooled on her chest as her breasts heaved and jiggled with her labored breathing.

""Rachel"" he asked, reaching out his hand to touch her small quivering shoulder. She didn't move away from his touch, but in her post-orgasmic bliss she let out a shaky breath and leaned into his touch, letting him get a view down her sweaty cleavage, her skirt bunched around her thighs, and the puddle of sticky pussy juices just now starting to drip off her leather chair onto the floor.

His mouth went dry and his breath deepened as he started to slowly massage the young lust drunk girl's arm and shoulder, his large gentle hand rubbing the thin fabric of her blouse of her damp smooth skin underneath. The still quivering girl had no mind to resist his comforting touch. She folded herself against his hand, relaxing in his palms as his other hand slid along her opposite arm. She was so ready to give herself over to anyone just for the tingling running up and down her spine the feel of a strong firm hand gave her. But the viewers had no mercy; another tipper assumed control and soon that little vibe was twitching away violently inside her gooey hole. She gasped and pushed herself into Dan's hands, urging him to keep touching her.

Maybe today at the office would be more exciting than usual?

I'm an intern at an OEM in the automotive industry (department Value Stream Management and SC-Design). My boss has recently given me the task to find use-cases for iPads in SCM. The idea is to find easy-to-implement solutions with our old ipads without applying any additional software. I've already made up my mind and found some use cases like:

- creating a quality feedback loop between supplier and OEM with the iMessages (e.g. send fotos of flawed parts directly to the supplier. One ipad beeing at the OEM's assembly line and one at the supplier's plant) advantage: very short and direct way of communication, rather than escalating the info about the flawed parts up the hierarchy.

- using the calender app for recurring events like maintanance of machines, or training of operators

- store videos on the tablet showing new operators how certain processes work. Advantage: shorter training periods of new operators

These were only a few so if you are interested, I'm happy to share some more ideas.
My first goal is to create a pool of use-cases from which my boss and me are going to pick a few and try to implement them as a pilot.

We're still in the brainstorming phase. That's why I took this to reddit to get a few more ideas for use-cases from you guys. :)"

I just got a provisional accepted to CSULB and SJSU both MIS major.

I need help deciding which school to attend. I like the fact that sjsu is in the heart of Silicon Valley but cost of living is crazy high and I would be in huge debt after I graduate. I like CSULB because it's in SoCal. And the cost of living isn't as high as SJSU.

My question is which program is better and also have better job placements. Does CSULB help with internships and job placement after graduation?

5v04om,2,2017-02-19,Recruiting Timeline Dilemma,dobed,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5v04om/recruiting_timeline_dilemma/,"Hello r/accounting,

You have a wonderful sub here, and your support for everyone is great to see. I have started to read up on some guides and already feel more prepared for my career.

Some long winded pre-text about my situation: 

I am currently a junior year Finance student at a Big 4 targeted Chicago school, and I've realized the following:

1) breaking into finance is extremely difficult 

2) my school's program is terrible in terms of industry standards

3) I may not even like the subject and people in it. Its predictive nature gives me a sense of uneasiness, and overall, I feel very cynical towards the industry. 

I've done extremely well in my beginning and intermediate accounting courses. I was just never interested and bought into the Gordon Gecko mentality that finance is more attractive. However, accounting’s procedural nature made me calm. I like the idea of its stability and clear cut career paths. On the other hand, to say you’re in finance is to say you’re in science. It’s too broad for someone like me who needs to have clear defined goals. 

Long story short, I’ve decided to pick up a double major in Accounting/Finance. Now my quandary lies within when I should finish school. 

Choice 1)
I can take five classes a quarter (one more than my usual workload) until graduation and be CPA eligible in June 2018. However if that’s the case, that means I must apply for FT positions in Autumn 2017. I will also be killing myself trying balance everything out, and there is no guarantee there won’t be scheduling conflicts between the required courses to graduate. 

I will be the first to admit that I have messed up the first two years of college. I was disproportionately focused on a 4.0 and neglected ECs/networking. I have some mediocre internships but nothing extravagant. Therefore, I feel extremely unprepared to interview for full time positions at the Big 4, and I do not want to burn any bridges before even starting.

Choice 2)
I can stay an extra quarter or two, usually take 4 classes, maybe take five classes once or twice and be CPA eligible December 2018 or March 2019. I am honestly leaning more towards this route. This would allow me to network from now until Autumn 2017 in hopes of securing winter 2018 Big 4 internship as well as picking up other internships along the way. In addition to that, I will have a lesser course load and possibly keep up my 4.0 (i know this isn’t as great an achievement these days, but at this point, it’s a personal achievement). The extra costs of the quarter or two are not ideal, but I have no loans right now. So I would take out a loan to cover those two quarters, and pay them off immediately with first year salary.

So choice 1 or choice 2 r/accounting?

**tl;dr**
Junior year finance student who JUST decided to DM in finance/accounting. 
1) Should I aim to apply for FT positions in Autumn 2017 despite not feeling prepared and having no accounting network? 
2) Stay an extra quarter, take the time to network, score a big 4 internship in 2017 recruiting season, and then apply for FT in autumn 2018?

I am ready to do everything I can to succeed in the Big 4. This career path feels like a breath of fresh air compared to the generality of finance. I won't procrastinate around anymore seeing what I need to do to be successful."

Here is my response,

That article didn't say much of anything.  Like it says, people in classified meetings aren't supposed to talk.  All week the GOP has been talking about targeting the leaks.

In that letter he is specifically targeting the leakers and if warrants were issued.  Flynn was a private citizen at the time and his 4th amendment rights may have been violated.  This could be huge if they find out Obama ordered the tap.  The question is if some FISA court approved a warrant.

The deep state/shadow government is trying to get Trump impeached and at the very least trying to plant as many neocons that they can in his administration.

""There was a powerful group of very high-ranking STATE officials that some referred to as 'The 7th Floor Group' or 'The Shadow Government.'

This past 3 years have been the most difficult and hardest time of my time, thus far (lets hope the days and life get better).



I pursued a BSc in Geology Starting in 2010 and Graduated in 2014. The goal was to become a geologist.  I focused on Mineral exploration and mining in my undergraduate. However, in 2013 commodity prices of precious and base metals have been on steady decline and investment has declined here in Canada by about 75-80%. I watched companies go from coming to our school and snatching up students in 2012 and when it was my turn in 2013 it essentially completely came to a halt for geo's - opportunities for internships disappeared.

I moved back to my province in Alberta after graduation in 2014 and pursued an MSc in petroleum geoscience/exploration and after 6 months of starting the program the price of oil has collapsed and we have entered one of the worst oil downturns in history and has now extended for over 2.5 years with little recovery in sight.  

I have $63,000 in student loans on the premise of gaining employment as a geologist but now I am working as a labourer for a construction company trying to remain positive for economic recovery in my sector.  I have been fighting some heavy depression for the last 2 years but I am doing my best to keep my head up, saving as much money as I can and trying to pay off my student loans. My dreams &amp; ambitions have been killed by economic circumstance - I am trying my best to survive and remain positive but I find life soo difficult right now. I've lost ambition to date, go out and I find it very difficult to find any aspect of life positive.  I am essentially just living to survive. Everyday is a chore and its making me go mad trying to crack ""how do I get a job as a geologist - it makes me go mad in my head'. My cousin has offered tremendous support during this time. Thank you for a best friend (cousin) and other friends or id probably have commited suicide.

During this time my older brother has not contacted me at all. He doesn't text, he doesn't call. He knows the situation but never picks up the phone to call and just ask ""hey how you doin, hang in there things will get better""  He travels up to the city where I am currently living and he calls my cousins, sister and Mother (visiting from her home city) to meet for dinner but doesn't bother to contact me.

His wedding is coming up. He mailed my invitation to my cousin's address rather than texting me and asking for mine to mail it directly to me.

I do not want to go and support him. This has been the most difficult time of my life and he has offered zero support. If he isn't there during my most difficult time, Why do I want to be there for him one of his best days? Obviously my other family members are pushing for me to go so we can have a 'strong family' yet they dont push him offer support and build a relationship with me during the last 2 years of hell.

Advice: Should I support him and why? I can't seem to find a yes inside of me,.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**:  Hit by economic recession. Battling with depression and career underemployment. Older Brother offers no support or even effort of relationship during this time.  I was sent an invitation to his wedding (mailed to my cousins house). I don't want to go to his wedding."

I am a college senior, graduating in a couple months. I am starting to get serious about planning out my future/current finances. I have been working an internship full time, and have saved a bit of money, and have saved the extra money they give you through financial aid.

The issue is, I have 27k+ in student loans personally, and I have 40k+ through parent plus loans. I have created some plans to pay the 27k back within ten years, based off of my starting salary. For the parent plus, I have asked my parents to set up a autodraft from my account, and creating a payment plan based off of their income, not refinancing.

do you think this is a good idea? Or what? for income, I'll be starting around 60-65k. Also, do you guys think I would prioritize loans or savings? i think i have budgeted out 1000 to one and 500 to another, per month. I initially planned throwing a big chunk of the 13k-14k I have saved toward the loans, and then paying 1k toward loans every month.

I am hoping for some real advice, as my parents are not good with money so, here we are."

I am a 20 year old male who was very active in highschool, playing 3 varsity sports. During the summer before my first semester at college, I tore my the ACL and both meniscus skateboarding. Due to the timing of the injury, I waited until the following winter break to have the surgery so it would not disrupt my schoolwork. Through tireless rehab, I was finally given the green light to participate in all sports again this January, 13 months after the initial surgery. All was well for a month, as I returned to doing some of the activities I love doing the most such as skiing and basketball.

A couple weeks ago, I stepped awkwardly in a basketball game and felt a loud cracking sensation in the same knee followed by immediate pain. I feared the worst: I had retorn my ACL. However, after getting my MRI results back, it was discovered that the sensation I felt was a large chunk of cartilage being ripped from my femur. My surgeon told me I needed to have surgery to remove the loose piece of cartilage. During the same procedure, he would also perform a thing called microfracture surgery, which involves drilling small holes in the bottom of the femur to allow bone marrow to seep into the knee to induce new cartilage growth. Post surgery would involve 6 weeks on crutches and a minimum of 4 months before running. He also explained to me that due to the nature of the injury, I can expect arthritis in my knee as early as my 30's, as well as multiple more surgeries down the line.

This whole thing feels like a nightmare I can't wake up from. I thought I was done with all this when being cleared to resume activities. I can no longer do the things that I love the most and I am watching my friends happily enjoying their lives, with nothing holding them back, while I'm stuck doing rehab for nearly 2 years. In order to maintain good grades I am going to have to push the surgery back until summer, meaning I will spend the bulk of my summer crutching around places instead of enjoying the beautiful weather. I feel like I am missing out on a huge part of my life because of these injuries that no young adult should have to deal with. I have to literally put my life on hold to deal with it. No summer job, no internships. The one month of health was just a tease for an athletic lifestyle that is in the past.

So my question is: People(especially young adults) with multiple knee surgeries and extensive rehab, how did you get through it?"
5v1olj,2,2017-02-19,[NeedAdvice] I Don’t Know How To Live Up To My Potential.,kns89,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5v1olj/needadvice_i_dont_know_how_to_live_up_to_my/,"TL;DR at the end

Growing up, all through college and internships, I was an over-achiever.  I worked hard, didn’t procrastinate, and never really failed at anything I put my mind to.  That’s not to say I was perfect— I have always been extremely introverted, I suck at sports and despite working hard and doing well at everything I tried, I was never the **best** or the **smartest** or the **coolest**. But I was always happy with who I was and I had visions of doing something big and important.

I’m nearly 7 years out of college and my ten year high school reunion is this year and I don’t even want to go because of how far off I am from where I want to be.

I started my first job out of college and was healthy and excited and then it all just vanished.  Maybe six months after starting work?  I grew depressed, anxious, apathetic and unable to remember conversations I had even just the day before. I was convinced that I just hated my job. And to be honest, it really wasn’t the right job for me from the start.  I worked in a closely knit team but because of who I was becoming, I was kind of the outcast.  It didn’t help that I was stuck in a department where everyone’s jobs overlapped except mine.  I was just kind of in the same space. I should note, here, that my work always got done. I just could have done **sooo** much more.  I would sit in my office with tears in my eyes and mentally beg myself to just do **something** that day.  Anything!  Send a few emails. Edit that document. But I couldn’t.  And that probably sounds ridiculous.  It felt ridiculous to me.  It was like my whole self was stuck in a cage inside my body and no matter how much I yelled and screamed for action, action wouldn’t come.  On top of that, from the beginning, despite outwardly getting along fine, my boss never liked me. It was because the kind of work I was doing was the kind of work that she was good at.  She couldn’t have sat down and done anyone else’s job in the department… but she could have done mine.  She was always so impressed with everyone else, but I was never good enough (even before things went downhill). She actually admitted this to a mutual friend a couple of years ago and expressed regret.

It is truly a wonder I didn’t get fired. Sure, I was getting the work done and the work was fine… but like I said, I was capable of so much more and had **sooo** many unproductive hours. 

My uncle owns a very successful small business in our area and  while I was still at my other job, he asked to meet with me to talk about social media.  I reviewed what his current social media manager had done and made some suggestions.  I didn’t really expect anything else, but I walked out of the meeting with the offer to manage the social media for his business.  I did both jobs for four months then jumped ship from my full-time office job into this new freelance position (which is what I’m still doing).  I worked from home.  I worked in my pajamas.  It was heaven.  Except I was still depressed, still fatigued, still gaining weight, still not me.  I was a year and a half into this job (my current job) before I found out that I have an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis.  

The autoimmune disease ruined my metabolism and took me from being a healthy, very pretty girl to this 230 pound woman who can hardly stand to look at herself in the mirror.  It’s worth noting that I am working on that.  I’ve lost a handful pounds and have met with a dietician and I think I’m on the right track.  But, last week, I found myself crying because I have SO far to go to get back to where I was.  It feels impossibly far.  And I think what sucks the most is that I didn’t gain all of this weight because I ate everything in sight. I went from being a runner to someone who was too fatigued to exercise and when I did force myself to do it, my stamina was pathetic (I remember being out of breath and unable to continue, just climbing the stairs of playground equipment with my niece).  And as it was all happening, I’d see the number on the scale rise and it was like that number didn’t mean anything.  I was so out of it didn’t even register that it was something I should be concerned about. The only reason I think I stopped gaining weight was because I got a puppy the year I was diagnosed.  I walk him for 45 minutes twice a day and I think, as silly as it sounds, he’s kind of saved my life. It didn’t matter how tired I was.  It didn’t matter how much I didn’t want to— I had to take care of him and he keeps me moving every day.

It’s taken away pretty much all my self-confidence.  And in it’s place, I developed anxiety.  Anxiety about seeing people who knew me before I gained all this weight.  Anxiety about work.  Anxiety about people potentially judging me.

Anyway, the reason I decided to post is because I’m just now in a place where I think I feel ok. And I realize I have to make some changes.  I’ve spent (roughly) the last five years unable to do “more”.  But now I think I am finally able and I have to figure out how to do it. 

I think what makes it all so hard is that I am a perfectionist.  I always have been… especially with regard to my actual person.  So to not be able to reach these goals that I feel like I should be able to reach… it’s not only me struggling, but I see it as me failing.  Every day that I’m overweight, I’m not living up to my potential.  Every day that I only do the bare minimum is a mark of me failing.  It piles up.

I am going into my third year of managing social media for businesses and I have also been helping small businesses with SEO. My uncle actually funnels me a lot of business through a consulting program he has.  Again, I’ve never not done my work. It’s not like I’m cheating anyone out of their money. I’ve always done the things I have to do, but I could do so much more.  And I want to do more.  The problem now is that I’ve spent so long only really doing what I need to do to get by that it’s become a habit. It’s like everything I want to accomplish is behind a glass wall— I can see it, I just can’t seem to reach it.

If anyone somehow had any advice, I’d take it happily!

TL;DR: Was an overachiever growing up but spent the last 5 years rundown by autoimmunity and am just now in a place where I am able to work back to my former level of achievement."
5v1rp2,14,2017-02-19,Artificial Intelligence Career Advice,doxpara,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/5v1rp2/artificial_intelligence_career_advice/,"So I recently completely rebooted my life after a few years of massive existential crisis, depression, and nihilism. That was 4 months ago, and at that time I determined my existential purpose in life to be to do everything I can to move the field of artificial intelligence towards general AI. There's a bunch of reasons I want to do this and it's giving me a lot of value and meaning in my life, but that's irrelevant to this thread. I am currently enrolled in university and am majoring in Computer Engineering. I chose this major because it would give me a lot of knowledge in both the hardware and software aspects of computer systems and I think it's overall pretty flexible. At least that's what I've been told. I was attending college before I got all suicidal and nihilistic, but that degree was completely unrelated to STEM. Luckily though, all the credits from the year I spent at my old school transferred to general education credits at my new school. My goal is to graduate as quickly possible by taking the absolute maximum load of classes I can every semester and then moving to Silicon Valley. I want to eventually get a Masters in Artificial Intelligence. I doubt I'd be admitted to a really good grad school straight out of undergrad because I don't think I will have had enough time in 2-3 years to get any amount of impressive professional or academic achievements in the field. Stanford is rated having the best AI program in the world but, again, I doubt they'll let me in without some experience in the field. There's no doubt in my mind that I will be able to handle it: I want nothing more than to learn everything I can about computers and creating unsupervised intelligence within them. I've never been more driven towards anything in my life and, unlike any time previously in my life, I'm putting everything I have in to academics right now. So maybe I could get into grad school right out of undergraduate, but that leads to my actual question.

My question is, what can I do between now and graduating that will make me as attractive as possible to future employers and graduate schools? I took some programming classes back in high school and would like to reteach myself some programming languages because all of my classes this semester are low-level math and science classes like Calc I and Chem I. I'm doing really well in them but frustrated that I'm not able to take dedicated computer classes yet: what language should I learn in my free time? I'm going to the first meeting of a brand new engineering club/organization that's starting at my school tomorrow. What else can I do? What books could I be reading? What kind of job or internship could I try to get around where I live now that would give me the best work experience? Any advice or insight is appreciated."

Now I have to figure out 1) how to enroll for April and 2) what I'm going to do for work since I'll have to quit my 9-5 to accommodate the class load. Kind of freaking out.""

""It was a quiet one today because the boyfriend and I have been skint for a couple of weeks, but we both get paid tomorrow so we're doing valentine's a day early and we're off to a Mexican restaurant tomorrow evening! Fajitas and cocktails! I can't sleep now because I'm too excited, I've been excited all day haha.

""Today was the first day I did not tell my girlfriend good morning in nearly two years. We recently decided to go on a break, while we decided mutually it's what would be best, it still tears me apart. I made all my appearances and put on a smile and trudged through the day, but I just feel empty, almost lost. I do not know what to do, getting back together is not a viable option currently because we have some near irreconcilable problems. However neither of us feel breaking up is a good option since we both deeply care for each other. I know many people will not end up reading this but I feel I needed somewhere to get this off my chest. I may update later if we come to a resolve.

""After the worst sleep I've ever had (which is pretty incredible since I usually wake up 6 times a night regardless) I woke up, and the very first notification I had was an offer letter to a university across the world. The first few seconds were just over-the-top excitement, which instantly turned into a full on panic attack because I realised I wouldn't see my favourite human for a few months. I texted to tell her I wasn't going to go, and why, and she said it wasn't a good enough reason and said some really great things about jumping out of my comfort zone. I wanted her to tell me she was happy I was staying, but it went the opposite way, and after being super fucking bummed for an hour or so, I submitted my acceptance. I'm excited. I've been wanting to do this for the past decade, and after getting sober I realised there was never going to be a ""right time"" to do it, and applied, never thinking I would get in.
Got a bunch of necessary stuff done, made a budget, submitted for accommodations, and got all my laundry and cleaning done.
Had to go to work at 6, it was super dead, and I got cut at 9:30, and now I'm packing to head out to the mountains for the night tomorrow.
All in all a pretty up-and-down day, but I'm happy I'm here, and I'm happy to be sober.""

'Today was great. Yesterday I was sure I had lost two close friends. Then I told my best friend, who is also in this social circle, that we were fighting. She told everyone to shut up and apologize because we're all way too close to be fighting like that. We all listened to her and now we're all friends again.
Also, my case load pretty much doubled. Money should start rolling in pretty soon.'

""Kinda boring but nice.
Psych, nothing happened.
English, group presentation, teacher didn't have to do shit lol. Smart woman.
Played runescape 2007 for like 2 hours, and am playing more now. going for 70 agility to finally be able to clear the taverley pipe without a potion.
Dad brought my spine xrays to his chiropractor today, and apparently, I have an underdeveloped vertebra in my spine (l5 s1 for those curious.) It's caused my spine to sort of arc out and back in, in my form of scoliosis.
Adding onto this, my right side of my body has always been much stronger than my left and I never knew why; apparently, my body is trying to compensate for the bias to my left side's balance due to my spine by making my right side more muscular. Pretty interesting. I gotta exercise my left side somehow to rebalance it, if anyone has any ideas.
Veggie dumplings and sausage with onion for dinner. Pretty good. Least it ain't 70% carbs :P""

5v24qt,1,2017-02-19,29 [T4M] Raleigh - Kind of a work-a-holic CG artist who loves space sims. Looking for a copilot.,IReach4theFrontier,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/5v24qt/29_t4m_raleigh_kind_of_a_workaholic_cg_artist_who/,"Hello, transgirl here.

I have the big three currently in terms of space sims. Elite: Dangerous, No Man's Sky, and I backed Star Citizen way back in early 2013. I've also played freelancer, Darkstar, and freespace 1 &amp; 2.

Aside from that, I spend most of my time working, either on personal projects or actual work related stuff. I like my work and enjoy doing it with people I care about.

Currently I am in the process of developing my own game which is kind of a spacesim but not really. More like Star Fox perhaps in how simple it is, and I'm starting an internship soon as I just recently graduated my bachelors this past December.

Anyways, that's what is relevant to my life right now. How about you?

5v2eat,1,2017-02-19,[Probability] Probability of getting a summer internship,Dirte_Joe,MathHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MathHelp/comments/5v2eat/probability_probability_of_getting_a_summer/,"Here is a Probability problem that I am having trouble with.

Problem:

A student applies for a summer internship at 5 different companies. Given the student's previous work experience and grades, there is a 40% chance of getting an internship offer at any company. Getting a job offer at 1 company does not affect getting an offer from another company. What is the probability this student will receive 1 or more offers (round your answer to 3 decimal places)?

What I have tried so far:

It states that there is a 40% chance of getting a job at each company. It also asks what is the probability of getting a job at 1 or more companies. The way I interpret this is ""what is the probability of getting at least one job."" So, we have the probability of getting 1 job, 2 jobs, 3 jobs, 4 jobs, or 5 jobs. So, 

1 job = (0.4)^1 = 0.4

2 jobs = (0.4)^2 = 0.16

3 jobs = (0.4)^3 = 0.064

4 jobs = (0.4)^4 = 0.0256

5 jobs = (0.4)^5 = 0.01024

Since we have the possibility of getting 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 4 OR 5 jobs, we would need to add these together. So, it would be

0.4 + 0.16 + 0.064 + 0.0256 + 0.01024 = 0.65984 or 65.984%.

Is what I have here correct? If not, could someone point me in the right direction? Thank you in advance for the help."

5v2nk4,2,2017-02-19,Me [21M] and my girlfriend [21F] of 4 years are fighting about what to do after I graduate college... how do I rectify this and find a solution?,RDubz75,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5v2nk4/me_21m_and_my_girlfriend_21f_of_4_years_are/,"So we met midway through senior year of high school while attending separate schools about 40 mins away. That Fall we went to college and I could only get scholarships to a school 150mi away.

I'm nearing the end of my 4th year in college after switching majors and am severely behind and eager to get out and work already.

I will have ~85-90 credits when this semester is over and so I would have 2 semesters left. But the Computer Science dept. at my school is frustratingly lacking in relevant courses and so I want to work this fall at an internship, maybe close to home, maybe an hour away because the co. I'm talking to is located there.

So I'm looking at: working 150mi for a summer internship and coming home on weekends, it was all I could get. Hopefully working close enough in the fall to either live with her or come home on the weekends. Doing a spring semester at school. A summer internship at god knows where, and graduating in the fall.

Here's the main problem. We live in Central New York, not exactly a bustling hub for software engineers and web developers. My earning potential will be much higher than her current $41k salary, but I can't work in my home area if there are no jobs.

There is a good chance I'll be able to make 1.5x to 2x her salary as a registered nurse, but the issue is I have to look in big cities like NYC/Boston/San Francisco to find promising work. Either that or I have to take the first job I'm offered out of college before the 6 month student loan grace period hits me like a train.

Understandably, this is very aggravating for her. We've been waiting a long time to be together, but my hardships here at school have put that on hold. And now I'm in a career path where we will probably have to move together or I'm going to end up at a tech company somewhere outside regular driving distance.

The idea of me getting a job anywhere where my industry exists is unacceptable to her, and looking for a job in Central New York means probably no job at all.

When I ask her why she won't just come with me and find a job at a hospital near where I get a job, she asks why she should be expected to move and gets angry because I can't promise her that we'll live together after I graduate. When in reality we can live together, but while there are hospitals all over the country, tech companies only exist in certain places and I would make enough money in software to support us both while she's between jobs.

I come home whenever I can and have even skipped classes to appease her. It's almost impossible to get homework done when visiting her and she needs a 1-2 hour phone call every night during my prime homework hours because she misses me, but still it's never enough for her because we don't live together.

What can I do to fix this and plan for the future post-graduation?
  
  ---   
  **TL;DR:** Girlfriend is a nurse and wants me to live with her after graduation in an area I have little chance of getting a reputable job in my field. Yet she refuses to move with me if I'm offered a job in my field, even though statistically I'm likely to make 1.5x to double her salary and she can find work easier than me. This is a real problem for us, having been away from each other for most of our relationship and only visiting during breaks and summers. How to make this work?"
5v2zm1,4,2017-02-20,Feeling incompetent at my internship,wedonttalkanymore1,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/5v2zm1/feeling_incompetent_at_my_internship/,"I just finished my 2nd year of Chemical Engineering and am doing an internship at a well known oil company. How it works is that it is an 8 month term, and for the first 4 months you are there an intern that has been there for 4 months trains you. Then that intern leaves, and I am now training the new intern. This is my 3rd work term. 

The new person that I am training has already been at this company previously. Her last 3 internships have been at this company (so she's already been at the company for 12 months total). She was friends with a lot of the people in my department already. 

So the job is some design work for facilities but also some work that no one else wants to do in engineering aka paperwork that we have to fill out for the company that regulates our facilities. 

So basically I was taught from the previous intern how to fill this stuff out and do some of the deliverables required. I have been teaching the new person how to do some of this, but sometimes she questions how I am teaching her and asks one of her friends that is in charge of this paperwork stuff (in some cases I have been wrong, and it's made me feel really bad). I never questioned what the previous intern taught me and just did what she told me and assumed it was right. 
Also when she asks me how to do stuff sometimes I don't know; I only did it once or twice and do not remember. I think this is normal as I am not familiar but I just feel bad because then she has to go ask someone else.

It just seems like she is better at communicating and better at the job than me. But she is also alot older than me and has more experience (she's a 4th year, and is 6 years older than me. She already has a bachelor's degree in Chemistry). I didn't even think to question some of the things that we were doing, but she is and it turns out some of it is wrong so she is improving the process..


Am I being too hard on myself? I am trying my best to learn from this but I can't help but let this eat me up inside. I just feel horrible. I got a good evaluation from my supervisor at the end of my 4 months, but that was before she came.

I want to strive for the best internships possible but this is making me think I don't deserve it. "

5v32gu,7,2017-02-20,Seeking opinions on whether to invite co-worker,Weddinthrowavay,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/5v32gu/seeking_opinions_on_whether_to_invite_coworker/,"Hello weddit! It's finally time to push wedding planning into full throttle so thank you for your help and opinions! Using a throwaway so that I won't be identified in the real world.

I am seeking advice on whether to invite someone I really...don't want to invite. 

I work with a team that is part of a larger department. I am close enough with other department members that I can invite some folks but not others without any strange feelings, I think. My team, however, is very close knit as we spend our entire work week together very separately from the rest of the department. We often eat together and spend hours during downtime talking to one another as friends.

On the team, I have about seven co-workers, two assistant managers, and one manager. The guy, who we will call Chad, is the only one I have any distaste toward.  

Initially, I had every intention of inviting the whole team. However, as time went on, Chad became more and more difficult to work with and tolerate. The nature of the job demands we all get along, and for the most part, we do. I'll try and make this as concise as I can, so I apologize if it's too drawn out. 

Reasons I don't want to invite him: not only is he overtly, over-the-line lazy at work, but his laziness has gotten to a point that others are becoming annoyed by the lack of help they're getting and the extra workload they're taking on for him. It's a bit ridiculous at this point. On a personal level, I consider him to be an antithesis of everything I strive to be. He is ignorant, forceful, shallow, sneaky, self-serving, egotistical, sometimes belligerent, scandalous, and lacks ethical responsibility. Simply put, he is the show ""Jersey Shore"" as a person.

I think most people will want examples, so I will provide a couple. 

1) Once when walking with a couple of us, he observed a scantily clad young lady and remarked, ""and they wonder why they get raped."" 

2) at a work-related function, he approached an intern and grabbed her by the arm since he (married) was having an affair with her and was upset at seeing her socialize with another employee. 

3) has consumed liquor during work hours despite strict rules to the contrary 

I also have nowhere to really seat him. Out of the co-workers I consider to be friends and am closest to, they all feel a similar way about Chad.

If I invited him, even if I sat him with my distant relatives, he would find a way to burden the folks I know don't appreciate his presence. He isn't very aware how annoying his presence is. The wedding would turn into just another time that my co-workers/friends must play diplomat and grit their teeth, when what I really want them to do is be themselves and enjoy the company of each other without work-related politics or stress.

Reasons to invite him: I'm inviting everyone else on the team because I actually like them. They're people I would want celebrating and important to me. I don't want to so openly exclude one person and then have it affect any hostility toward me or to be so open in my distaste when it becomes obvious from not inviting only Chad. 

I'm looking for a bit of guidance here. I've been given advice mostly along the lines of ""nah, it's your wedding, invite who you want"" or ""invite him and seat him very far away."" There's a chance he could RSVP no, but there's a greater chance he will RSVP yes.

Tl;Dr: Chad is a repugnant co-worker and personality. I am inviting literally everyone else, though, because I get along with everyone. Other co-workers would not miss him.

Thanks so much in advance, guys, invites are going out soon and I would love the advice!

5v422e,3,2017-02-20,Emotionally abusive mother,paradiselost13,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/5v422e/emotionally_abusive_mother/,"I'm a 20 years old, and I have been dealing with a more than dysfunctional relationship with my mother for the most part of 8 years now. I used to think it was a teenage phase and my mother's controlling personality would wane when I moved away to university, but that didn't happen unfortunately. When I was 13 I got involved with 'emo' people and self-harm - I was a silly child, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with me, I was just immature and didn't fully understand what consequences it would have. When my family found out it was a tough year moving past it, my relationship with my mum drastically changed, and she became very controlling. I wasn't allowed to stay around friends' houses, and if they came over to stay we had to be downstairs in eyesight of my mum at all times, I had no mobile phone, all computers and other devices had passwords on which I was the only one in the family who was not allowed to know, when I used the computer it was strictly for school work and my mother had to sit in the room, if I was using the house phone to talk to a friend, my mother would often pick up the other receiver to listen in. I felt extremely isolated from everyone - my friends slowly stopped inviting me to things, or if they did I would tell them I wasn't allowed, I wouldn't even check. When I became 16, I was allowed a mobile phone, which I had to leave downstairs at night, and would be checked as when I woke up in the morning, texts which I had received overnight would be opened and read before I got my phone back. My mother did not like a particular circle of my friends, purely because of they were of a lower economic background to our family, and caused arguments and conflict with their parents on a number of occasions, leaving them in tears sometimes. We had a very up and down relationship - some weeks we were fine, then all of a sudden I would find out she had been going through my phone and seen me messaging a boy (that was usually her cause of argument) or something else she disagreed with, and would take away any liberties (seeing friends outside of school or my phone) as punishment, and constantly tell me I had broken her trust, even though I fully believed there was never any trust there in the first place.

I tried to get help from school. I had counselling during school twice. First time I didn't get anything from it because I wasn't willing to open up. Second time I had the most amazing counsellor, she really helped me understand my feelings and how to deal with them. Self harm became a real issue for me, but I managed to stop when I went to university. Once I went to the head of year, as my mum had started an argument with me over mock grades (practise exams) having been sent home which I got a B in (I was a straight A student in everything). I asked the teacher to call home and talk to my mum. He did that night, and I listened in to the conversation - he told my mum I was one of the brightest students and she had nothing to be concerned about as they at school certainly weren't. My mum came to me and told me she had gotten off the phone with the school and they had told her they were concerned about me and they would be calling me in for a chat. I was shocked. I knew then I was on my own.

University came, and I was filled with so much pent up anger and resentment of my relationship with my mum. First term was hard for me, I was still self harming and I had just started dating a guy I had met on a singing course who was going to Oxford who my mother adored, but I wasn't feeling it with him at all, and knew I had strong feelings for a guy I was in secondary school with, who was just starting university in London as well as me. I ended up breaking it off with the Oxford guy and started seeing this London guy, and my mum hated it. She hated him (she had a problem with how often I talked to him while I was at school, on one occasion printing off a copy of my mobile provider's call and text history to show me all the times she knew I was texting him), he wasn't going to as a good a university as my ex and she despised the idea of him. We have been together two and a half years now, he is doing excellently in his degree and in his internship he is doing this year, and him and I have proved to ourselves and to the people closest to us that we are very much happy and function well together. My mum has never met him and refuses to, refers to him as 'fuckface' and makes it clear at every possible opportunity to all of our family and her friends of her disagreement with our relationship. She has realised that I will not leave him to appease her, so she has taken to finding every other reason to find conflict with me now. From attacking me over my interests (I am a fan of wrestling and attend live music concerts regularly), my weight (I put on weight at university I admit, although am a size 12, eat as healthily as I can and am physical active), my grades (I am averaging a high 2:1 at university, I get a lot of first grades, but I study History at a very academically demanding university which is obviously very challenging. She has told me if I do not get a first she will not attend my graduation), among many many other things.

I don't go home very often as I can't stand being in her presence for long periods of time. Christmas, I had been home a day before she started making digs at me and causing arguments, I lost it at her and fought back (I try my best to avoid confrontation, which leads us to go for weeks on end not speaking). The day I left I vowed I was done and didn't want her in my life anymore, whether on good terms or otherwise. I was exhausted of it. She would send me links to random things on facebook and say things like, oh I thought you'd like this etc, and I would give a civil reply and nothing more, until a few weeks ago when I thought I'd give her another shot. But we are back to square one.

It is my 21st birthday next month and I was going to bring some friends home from London to celebrate with my family. Now I'm questioning whether I even want to be in the same room as her. I don't know what to do. My father, my sister and her sister have told her on many occasions that her behaviour is irrational and she needs to stop her behaviour, but she will listen to no one. I am beyond resolving a relationship with her. Frankly, I never had a mother in an emotional sense, I always felt like nothing more than a trophy to her - she continuously tells me, as if I should care, that she can't talk to her friends about me because she's embarrassed. I am not perfect, and I am more than happy to admit to any faults when they are justified and put to me rationally. But I am a hardworking, ambitious person, who is able to maintain my academic work, financial situation, and relationships all to what I believe to be a good standard at the very least.

I used to think it was a teenage phase and my mother's controlling personality would wane when I moved away to university, but that didn't happen unfortunately. When I was 13 I got involved with 'emo' people and self-harm - I was a silly child, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with me, I was just immature and didn't fully understand what consequences it would have. When my family found out it was a tough year moving past it, my relationship with my mum drastically changed, and she became very controlling. I wasn't allowed to stay around friends' houses, and if they came over to stay we had to be downstairs in eyesight of my mum at all times, I had no mobile phone, all computers and other devices had passwords on which I was the only one in the family who was not allowed to know, when I used the computer it was strictly for school work and my mother had to sit in the room, if I was using the house phone to talk to a friend, my mother would often pick up the other receiver to listen in. I felt extremely isolated from everyone - my friends slowly stopped inviting me to things, or if they did I would tell them I wasn't allowed, I wouldn't even check.

I am currently on my first internship and I'll have enough money to buy one by the end and still have saved a few grand. However, being in Canada, this will cost me around 3000 CAD (maybe even a bit more). I really don't NEED all the power on the laptop and I have a good desktop already. I'm literally buying this laptop cause I do like having the option of gaming, I think it looks great, and just because I want one. But, thinking about spending 3000 as opposed to 1000 seems like a huge jump and I feel shitty about it. Should I? Money is not the issue, just the feeling associated with it. I'm also worried that I'll get like a defective model or whatever (ofc this is not really a point worth stressing over). As far as for work, I work in statistics and might move into machine learning etc so there is some value in having a machine with a great GPU. Anyway, so I guess I don't have a specific question, but just how you guys feel about spending so much money on a laptop and whether it was worth it for you. Also, I don't want the stealth (just too small, and can't play games). Thanks for reading. "

1) The big number one, EC's.  Despite adcoms saying to do what we are passionate about, what they really mean is to do what you are passionate about on top of research, clinical work, non-clinical volunteering, and leadership activities.  What that really boils down to is doing a wide variety of work that is of mediocre quality.  


While the undergrad who is applying to grad school might be working on a very cool research project and learning directly from the PI, the premed is doing the equivalent of one RT-PCR and one western blot each week.


While the guy who was an EMT in high school is studying to be a paramedic, the premed is volunteering in an ER 3 hours a week swiping right on tinder and refilling cabinets and answering phones.


While your good friend took a part in establishing one of the largest clubs on campus, the premed is president of 5 clubs and is running the organizations into the ground due to their leadership.

While the finance kids are pursuing banking internships and the CS people are pursuing well-paying tech internships, premeds are often doing EC's that do not pay, if at all.  In fact, where I live, premeds in gap years cannot find paying work doing research.  


Finally, since lots of premed EC's do not pay.  Becoming premed can be difficult for middle class students and poorer students.

How to deal with a religious, hypocritical, hover-parent?",hawkeye315,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5v5j6s/parent_issue_me_21_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for quite a while. I have made the decision that I am planning on marrying her. We have one more step in our relationship that we agreed we should do to make sure we are compatible. We want to live together for at least a year before getting engaged in order to make sure we don't have any huge problems.

**Background on college:**

I go to school for electrical engineering. I have around a 3.5 GPA and am generally good with studying/hw. I am confident this will stay the same if we move in together because we are fairly independent people. I can't take living with my current 3 roommates anymore. While they are nice people, they are the messiest people I have ever met. I have a meal plan because they all shop at Costco, so there is absolutely 0 room in the refrigerator or freezer for any of my food. I was able to get myself 2 small cupboards and 1 drawer in the kitchen (about 10% of the total cabinet space). I also end up doing about 75% of  the dishes because they rarely clean up after themselves. Even though I only eat there 2 days a week, I still have to do the majority of chores for my own sanity and to have clean dishes on the 2 days I do eat there. Needless to say, I am going crazy. I am not a neat-freak, but I like to have &lt;20 dishes and 50 pieces of silverware scattered around at any given time. All my friends are already full on roommates too, so switching isn't an option.

My gf's parents got divorced after she was born and my parents absolutely despised each other and fought constantly until my dad's death. We both don't want the same thing to happen to us. I am in college for EE currently and we want to move in for fall semester while she works. We currently live 3.5 hours away. While I had a co-op (Engineering 7 month internship), she would come down many weekends and stay with me.

**Financial:**

I have plenty of money saved up from working summers, not spending much, and my co-op. I have enough for at least 2 semesters of living, food, tuition, and everything I would need.

My grandpa was a mechanical engineer who had enough money to set up a college fund for my sister and I. This fund can only be spent on college expenses that go directly to the college (I'm in on-campus apartments right now.) There is enough in there to finish out the next year and a half I have left and then some. It is in my name, but my mom is a co-owner of it. My uncle also has the same thing for me and my sister (he never married), and that has some money left too. He owns that one. 

**The Issues:**

My GF's  mom is ok with us living together. Neither me, nor my girlfriend are very religious (she is Christian, but she has very progressive views, and I am agnostic). Her mom's reasoning is that it may be against her belief's, but our lives are our own. (My girlfriend doesn't want to live with her mom anymore though because she treats my GF like complete shit, but she can't afford to move out on her own yet). On the other hand, my mom is the hypocritical type of zealot. She never ever goes to church or practices her supposed Christian views, but she sure as hell imposes them on everyone else. 

I mentioned us moving in together to my mom in passing over winter break while we were at a restaurant. She almost started yelling at me right there. I asked why she didn't want me to. Her response was to threaten to cut me off from my grandpa's and uncle's college funds set up for me (She hasn't helped with college at all besides paying for my cell phone). I can't take out subsidized loans because she makes too much money and lists me as a dependent. I let it go because I didn't want to cause an argument or scene in the restaurant. She quickly changed the subject and never discussed it again. She never liked my girlfriend because she has a fair amount of piercings in her ears, and she didn't go to college for more than 2 years.

**The Dilemma:**

I am going home for spring break in march. I need to know if I am moving in with my GF by mid-April or so for our current apartment. I need to talk to her during spring break. Hopefully I can discuss the facts with her, and show her that my grades won't suffer, and it won't interfere with college at all. To do that, I need her to actually listen to me. Last time I tried to ask her to hear me out about something important, she interrupted me consistently throughout it to argue with me. That will just lead to a fight if it happens this time. How can I attempt to deal with her? I might go insane if I have to live with my roommates for another year and a half (and my GF might if she has to live with her emotionally abusive mother for another year or so).

  ---   

  **tl;dr**: My mother has control on part of my college fund, refuses to listen to reason when discussing important things, and doesn't want my girlfriend and I to move in together. She is threatening to make me live in poverty if I go against her. How do I have a rational discussion with her about it?"

Down With Anti-Muslim Ban!

Trump Escalates Obama’s War on Immigrants

No Deportations! For Full Citizenship Rights for All Immigrants!

Tens of thousands of people across the country have rallied at airports and on the streets to protest Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim ban of immigrants and refugees. The president’s executive order barring citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 90 days, and banning Syrian refugees indefinitely, came on the heels of his order to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico and hiring 15,000 more border guards and immigration cops. There is indeed plenty to fear and to protest as Trump and his advisers, most prominently the poison pen of “white nationalist” reaction, Steve Bannon, roll out their viciously racist agenda. But beware the Democratic Party, which has been the central force organizing the protests, as its politicians now shed crocodile tears!

Trump is emboldening the forces of anti-immigrant terror, from the border police to racist vigilantes and outright fascists. But his policies are simply a more grotesque expression—unvarnished by pious “humanitarian” rhetoric—of those of his Democratic Party predecessors, including Barack Obama. A wall with Mexico? There already are 700 miles of wall, begun under Bill Clinton’s administration. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama boasted of “putting more boots on the Southern border than any time in our history” by adding 20,000 more border police. While Obama claims he “fundamentally disagrees” with Trump’s ban, his administration deported more people than any other in U.S. history. Others languish in detention center hellholes. Notably, the Democratic “grassroots” organizations that are mobilizing thousands against Trump’s ban were not so motivated to protest Obama’s war on immigrants.

The countries targeted by Trump’s Muslim ban include those named in the Obama administration’s 2015 Terrorist Travel Prevention Act, which passed Congress with barely a burp of protest. Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are among the countries devastated by U.S. imperialism’s wars, occupations, drone strikes and other military assaults. Hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions more displaced as desperate refugees. Iran and Sudan have been subjected to punishing sanctions, further impoverishing, if not outright starving, countless people.

Madeleine Albright now proclaims that she would register as a Muslim to protest Trump’s edict. Her hypocrisy is as mindboggling as it is revolting. In 1996, as Bill Clinton’s UN ambassador, this war criminal justified the starvation blockade of Iraq that had killed half a million Iraqi children as “worth it.” An article in Black Agenda Report (1 February) fittingly recommended that Albright “register as an Iraqi toddler in 1995.”

Over 1,000 diplomats, spies and operatives of the State Department—the architects and defenders of U.S. imperialist terror—have signed a petition decrying Trump’s Muslim ban as a violation of “core American values of nondiscrimination.” Several of President Obama’s former officials, including his secretary of state John Kerry, his national security advisor Susan Rice and his CIA director and later secretary of defense Leon Panetta, issued a declaration denouncing the Muslim ban, claiming that it “undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer.” What has a section of the bourgeoisie, the “deep state” and the Democratic Party officialdom worried is that the recklessness of the Trump administration is shredding the cover of “democracy” under which U.S. imperialism seeks to hide its crimes against workers and the oppressed around the globe. It also threatens to unravel America’s relations with its fellow imperialist plunderers in Europe, as well as the plundered in the neocolonial world.

As we go to press, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is considering an appeal by the Trump administration to overturn a February 3 ruling by a federal judge that blocked the anti-Muslim ban. Whatever the decision, further litigation is likely, and the case could make its way to the Supreme Court. In seeking to overturn the February 3 ruling, the government argued that the president has “the unreviewable authority” to suspend admission to the U.S. for any group of people. This is an ominous assertion of the imperial presidency that is at the core of American bourgeois democracy. At the same time, we have no illusions that the courts—another wing of the capitalist state—can act in the interests of working people and the oppressed.

There should be militant, mass protest against Trump’s anti-Muslim ban and in defense of immigrant rights. But the starting point has to be opposition to U.S. imperialism and its political parties—Democrats as well as Republicans—not looking to the good graces of the perpetrators of imperialist war.

Against all wings of the capitalist class, we fight for the integrity, solidarity and fighting capacity of our class, the working class. That means winning the multiracial labor movement to the fight for full citizenship rights for everyone who has made it to this country—against deportations, anti-immigrant roundups and detention centers. The unions need to organize the unorganized, including bringing undocumented workers into the unions with full rights and protections.

The social power of labor must be mobilized in defense of immigrants. A tiny glimmer of what is needed was seen in the one-hour strike by the New York Taxi Workers’ Alliance at JFK airport against the anti-Muslim ban. A much more powerful demonstration would be job actions by airport or transit workers. But standing in the way of flexing some real labor muscle in this fight are the AFL-CIO tops, many of whom raise protectionist cries to “save American jobs.” Such chauvinist appeals fan the flames of racist reaction against foreign-born workers. Echoing this “America first” refrain, Trump gained the support of a layer of mainly white workers whose jobs, unions and ability to survive have been under relentless attack.

Such are the bitter fruits of the trade-union bureaucracy’s subordination of workers’ interests to the profitability of American capitalism. After AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka met with Trump on January 13, he enthused over his “very honest and productive conversation” with this predatory billionaire. Even those union tops who oppose Trump’s ban repeat his justification for it and extol America’s supposed “values.” A statement by United Auto Workers president Dennis Williams grotesquely declared: “We must protect national security while remaining true to the very values that have made us a great nation.”

If the unions are to be instruments of struggle against the bosses, they must break the shackles chaining them to the capitalist parties. The red-white-and-blue bureaucrats must be ousted in a fight for a class-struggle leadership whose banner will be the red flag of working-class internationalism! Such a leadership will politically arm the workers for some hard-fought battles against the capitalist exploiters and will lay the basis for forging a multiracial workers party that will fight for a socialist revolution to uproot the whole system of wage slavery, black oppression, anti-immigrant reaction and imperialist war.

Break with the Democrats!

When immigrant rights protests erupted against the George W. Bush regime in 2006-07, they were quickly co-opted by the Democratic Party as it sought to retake the White House. This perspective was clearly captured by the dominant slogan, “Today we march, tomorrow we vote!” Today, we have the spectacle of the Democrats posturing as defenders of immigrant rights. And the reformist left is helping them sell that lie. In an editorial titled “The People Versus the President” (socialistworker.org, 1 February), the International Socialist Organization (ISO) insipidly argues:

“Trump’s all-out assault could lead to greater opposition from the hitherto meek leaders of the Republican and Democratic Parties—in part because Trump is racing full steam ahead with a program that doesn’t have the support of the majority of the capitalist class, but more importantly, because the wave of popular discontent is pressuring them to act.”

The entire framework of the ISO is to act as a pressure group on the capitalist Democratic Party and the racist capitalist order it represents. Its coverage of the protests disappears the central role played by Democrats in organizing them, all the better to keep activists chained to that party. Previously, when several Democratic politicians announced that they would not attend Trump’s inauguration, the ISO gushed: “It’s nice to see our country’s official opposition party actually engaging in some opposition after most Democrats spent the first weeks after the election pledging to find ways to collaborate with Trump” (socialistworker.org, 20 January).

Socialist Alternative is even more blatant in embracing the Democratic Party. It pledges that its supporters “will work alongside progressive Democrats around clear demands to mobilize people into action,” adding the caveat: “But we will not limit our program, strategy or tactics to what is acceptable to the corporate Democrats” (socialistalternative.org, 31 January). Thus, they admit that they aim to be acceptable to the “progressive Democrats,” who are no less committed than their “corporate” counterparts (or the Republicans) to the exploitative and oppressive capitalist system.

In response to Trump’s anti-Muslim edict, Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a rabid Zionist who has voted to approve several of Trump’s government nominees, including Secretary of Defense James “Mad Dog” Mattis, now declaims: “Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon.” The whole history of capitalist America, which was founded on the genocide of American Indians and enriched by the brutal toil of black slaves, is a refutation of Schumer’s cynical statement. Immigrants have been brought in at times to provide the cheap labor and raw muscle power for the country’s factories, mines and farms. Whipping up racial and ethnic hatreds to keep its wage slaves divided, America’s rulers have a long history of mass deportations and exclusion of the foreign-born.

Among the first to be targeted were Chinese workers who had been employed as virtual slaves in building the railroads and working in the mines on the West Coast. Playing on “yellow peril” racism to distract from growing unemployment and declining wages, Congress, with the full support of the labor misleaders of the time, passed the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, barring Chinese people from entering the U.S. or acquiring citizenship.

During World War I, Democratic Party president and arch-segregationist Woodrow Wilson signed the 1917 Espionage Act, whose first targets were labor agitators, opponents of U.S. entry into the war, anarchists and leftists, thousands of whom were imprisoned. In the 1919-20 Palmer raids, launched in fearful reaction to the Russian Revolution, 10,000 suspected Communists, syndicalists and other immigrants were rounded up, and more than 1,000 deported.

During the Great Depression, more than 500,000 Mexicans, mostly migrant farm workers, were rounded up and deported. Two decades later, in 1954, a militarized dragnet called “Operation Wetback” imprisoned and expelled over a million Mexican farm workers.

Amid the Second World War, the icon of Democratic Party liberalism, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, issued an executive order to intern U.S. residents of Japanese descent, the majority of them American citizens, in concentration camps. At the same time, desperate Jewish refugees trying to escape the Nazi Holocaust were mostly kept out. In one infamous example, the ship MS St. Louis, carrying over 900 Jews, was turned away from U.S. ports. Many of the passengers would later die in Hitler’s concentration camps. After the war, in contrast, Nazi war criminals were welcomed into the U.S. to serve in U.S. imperialism’s Cold War against the Soviet Union.

Conjuring up a “foreign enemy” has long served America’s rulers in ratcheting up their machinery of state repression against the working class, black people, immigrants and any perceived opponent of capitalist class rule. Since the 9/11 attacks, U.S. imperialism has been waging a bipartisan “war on terror,” which was further ramped up by the Obama administration. Today, this arsenal of repression is in the hands of Donald Trump, who has unquestionably upped the voltage of racist reaction. Among his most loyal supporters are the border guards and I.C.E. agents, whose organizations backed his candidacy, as did the Fraternal Order of Police. The guns of the capitalist state are loaded, and they are aimed not only against immigrants, but also against black people, as every black person in this country already knows only too well.

An example of what’s needed to fight back was the 9 February 2002 labor-centered Oakland demonstration that declared: “Anti-Terrorist Laws Target Immigrants, Blacks, Labor—No to the USA-Patriot Act and the Maritime Security Act!” and “Down With the Anti-Immigrant Witchhunt!” Initiated by the Bay Area Labor Black League for Social Defense, which is fraternally allied with the Spartacist League, and Partisan Defense Committee, the protest drew some 300 people and had as its core black longshore members of International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 10, which endorsed the rally. They were joined by other unionists, Latino day laborers, Asian and Near Eastern immigrants, college and high school students and the revolutionary Marxists of the Spartacist League.

Workers of the World Unite!

Many Democrats, joined by reformists like the ISO and Socialist Alternative, are now promoting “sanctuary cities” (where local cops have discretion to not check immigration status) as an answer to the anti-immigrant drive. It is downright delusional to believe that local agents of the capitalist state will establish oases of refuge for immigrants. The cops who gun down black and minority youth with impunity will not protect immigrants from the Feds. When politicians like Rahm Emanuel, the labor-hating, cop-loving Democratic mayor of Chicago, declare their cities “sanctuaries,” it is to refurbish their own image. Notwithstanding Los Angeles’s “sanctuary” status, more than 22,000 immigrants were deported from that city between 2012 and 2015.

For the fight for immigrant rights to go forward, it must be linked to the struggle against black oppression, which is fundamental to American capitalism. We seek to win native-born and immigrant workers to the struggle for black freedom; at the same time, we aim to win black workers to the fight for immigrant rights. It is only through united class struggle and the intervention of a revolutionary Marxist party that the divisions fomented by the rulers can be overcome.

Against the demagogy of the capitalist rulers and the politicians of both capitalist parties, we reiterate the closing lines of the Communist Manifesto: “The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!” As we underlined during the 2006 immigrant rights protests in “How the Fake Left Amnesties the Democrats” (WV No. 873, 7 July 2006):

“We do not seek to tinker with the system, looking for an alternative immigration policy. We will support such reforms as are offered. But, our bottom line is that we will worry about the ebbs and flows of the world economy when the proletariat under revolutionary leadership runs it. We are not responsible for, nor do we seek to advise, the bourgeoisie on its immigration or other policies. We seek to organize the social power of the proletariat to smash this system and establish proletarian rule.”

Hello again! A few of you voiced some concern regarding my GF and the intern, I explained the situation in a comment but I might as well post it here too 

""Thanks for your concern! However they have already spoken about it and the intern has gotten a transfer to another department and has a new mentor/instructor now and my GF has been assigned to mentor a new person. 
They still work for the same company but in different buildings however these buildings are in close proximity to each other (he's now going to do more physical labor instead of being a desk jockey so he's doing something he enjoys more). 
So now my GF has no work ties with him, apart from working for the same company, since he has a new boss etc. They do still meet up after clocking out to exchange pleasantries though :)""

For the sake of the story and making it easier for me to write I'm going to keep calling him The Intern.

Alright so to the story, which is going to be much shorter than the previous one, sorry! For a few weeks my GF has been giving the intern handjobs and blowjobs when they've clocked out, however she hasn't escalated it until last friday. 
And for those who asked, she only kisses me since she feels like kissing is a sign of love and affection and she doesn't love the intern, she just wants his dick.


So on a semi-daily basis I've received snaps and videos from my GF when she's blowing the intern however last friday was a little diferent.
I was getting ready to pick her up from work and texted her to let her know that I'm about to leave.

[\[Chat\]](http://i.imgur.com/F8pVZKP.png)

Not long after that conversation I got a phone call from my GF. At first I thought something had happened since it's pretty hard to talk with a dick in your mouth however I was met with something rather pleasant.

[\[Part of the phone call :)\]](https://soundgasm.net/u/845645643/GF-Phone-call)

After this very lovely phone call, I got the stream of snaps and videos of her head bouncing up and down in his lap with his left hand just resting on her head. 
She pushed her head into his lap and let out some cute gagging sounds before slowly moving back up until his cock popped out of her mouth with a loud pop.
She turns towards the phone, and the intern's face, and says ""I want all of your cum in my mouth, don't get any on my face or clothes"".
She then pushes her head down on his cock and starts bobbing up and down while using her right hand to play with his balls until he starts to grunt and under his breath mutters ""I'm going to cum"".
She stops bobbing her head and locks her lips around the tip of his cock. She stayed like this for around 30 seconds and then sat back up and tilted her head backward, let out an audible gulp and then a 'ahhhh'.
About an hour later she comes home with Chinese food and a bottle of wine. 10/10 Friday would do again!

If you have any questions feel free to ask :) Oh and one more thing! Thanks for the cumtributes we’ve gotten, my GF loves them! If you want to do a cock or cum tribute just PM me! :)"

5v6zn8,1,2017-02-20,M4A - Trap me in my cheating wife's head,dangerboner,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5v6zn8/m4a_trap_me_in_my_cheating_wifes_head/,"My name is Paul, I'm 31 and I married my childhood sweetheart, Chloe when we were both too young. Now we live together, have boring jobs, and, well... she's changed. She's no-longer that innocent, sweet little thing I married. In fact, she now goes to work [looking like this](http://imgur.com/a/SUbBi) every day. Call me slow, but I just started to suspect she might be cheating on me. I pretty much know it, I just don't trust her anymore, but I have no proof!

That's why I came to visit you. People say you're a dodgy, conniving hypnotist, that you pretty much deal in black magic and that you're not to be trusted, but paranoia got the better of me and now I'm here, asking for your help. I need to know the truth for sure, I need that proof!

I lay back on your couch, as instructed, close my eyes and inhale as I follow your instructions. When I open my eyes, I'm not in the same place. I'm not even in the same body anymore. I'm a passenger, trapped in Chloe's mind!

I see her naked body in the mirror as the shower runs behind us. I hear her thoughts, I know what she's thinking. The sensation of being in a body I'm not controlling makes me uncomfortable, along with the unfamiliar feeling of breasts as she touches them, of there being nothing hanging between my legs, and being a few inches shorter.

The warmth of the water on her back feels soothing, and the feeling of her fingers massaging her thick long hair start to relax me/her/us. That's when I hear her private monologue and thoughts. Naughty thoughts. Thoughts about that guy in the office she flirts with. Thoughts about that hot new intern kid, ""but no - he's too young - someone might find out, he might brag?"".

The bubbles landing on her crotch give a tingling sensation I've never felt before, which intensifies once her fingers gently start to rub her clit. Cold glass of the shower wall on her bare ass cheeks, I feel her pinching at her own nipple. She closes her eyes and I see mental images, of a muscled, shirtless male torso unbuttoning his jean fly, letting them fall and revealing a frighteningly long, thick, hard shaft.

Her breathing gets heavier and I'm feeling her getting this urge, totally foreign to me, for some reason she really needs something in...

And then she does it. Two fingers slide into her pussy causing me to moan aloud and wake back on your couch.

Chuckling to yourself, you prepare to send me back. ""Thought that was tough, hmmm? We're only just getting started here...""

My eyes close again. Where will you send me next?

***

I'm hoping you can take the role of the hypnotist, and perhaps other characters that you introduce by sending me off to relive Chloe's naughtiest experiences through her body and mind. I'll be playing as her, or rather as myself living through her, like the above!

You could land me in the intense, sexual build up, where she's being seduced, or doing the seducing. Or maybe I'll witness her hitting on that guy? Or perhaps just join the action as her bra hits the ground, or she's already bent over the desk and there's nothing to be done but wait those few painful seconds for her to receive the inevitable? Or anything else you can think of that will leave me helplessly facing the music!

I don't like extreme stuff, like scat, piss, vomit, excessive violence, but I'm otherwise pretty flexible.

I noticed a post on here recently of someone talking about his struggle finding a job with a Physics degree, and most people thought the problem was the fact that he needed to improve on his interviewing skills. Nevertheless, this got me thinking about something I've wanted to ask someone before, and I thought I'd post here and see what people think.

I'm currently a Junior pursuing a Statistical Practice B.A. at the university I attend. I've had a job for about 2 years now at a sports data company monitoring betting markets and managing scouts. To summarize: I don't do any sort of data analysis, but I do work in high stress situations, and I'm constantly communicating with other colleagues around the world regarding scouts and information I'm gathering. 

I'm really interested in a Data Analytics route, but I feel like my GPA (~2.7) isn't good enough for an internship as a Data Analyst somewhere based off of the postings I've seen. I'm a pretty much screwed or is there something someone can recommend to increase my odds of finding something after I graduate? 

Thanks!"

The first round of experiment consisted on the quantification of multiple compounds on a matrix by targeted-mass spectrometry and to test what quantity of matrix was enough/the best suited for their quantification.  
[Here](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=990983tableurresults.png) u can have a look at the results i've organized in columns with from left to right : concentrations calculated, quantity of matter (1=50 mg; 2=100 mg; 3=200 mg), the compounds identified [1;17], the duplicates (1;2) and the replicates (1;2).  So i've been trying to identify :  
1) if there is any difference (Ho : µ1=µ2=µ3) with the starting quantity  
2) what is the best for the quantification.  
After some work on minitab, i can't decide which statistical approach is the best suited to give me the answer.

Oh, and it takes place in a regular old office instead of some medieval fantasy world.",KellyMcSizequeen,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5v7wkc/25_f4a_sorta_like_dungeons_dragons_except/,"Fun fact: When I first learned about D&amp;D, I mistakenly thought that RPG stood for ""Roll Playing Game"" which is why they needed so many dice. For rolling!

Regardless, I've recently learned a little more about D&amp;D (never played, though, so I'm still pretty uninformed) and thought it would be fun to turn it into a sex adventure! I've posted before about my interests in world-building, and thought this might be a good setup.

I'm not entirely sure that the actual stories (interactions between characters) need to be dice-based, but it might be fun if we introduced some dice-related randomness to our character creation process. I thought it might be fun to use the headquarters of some small company as the backdrop for our adventures. Only 10-20 employees, all in their 20s or 30s.

My proposal: we create names and personalities for all of the characters who work at the company. Once we have a set that we like, we start assigning their sexual characteristics randomly (penis size, breast size, sexual appetite, sexual competency, anything you want!) and then we can either pick our favorite characters to RP or the two of us can collectively control all of the characters and see how the story unfolds.

Just to warn you, I'm fairly geeky. Maybe not when it comes to D&amp;D, but definitely comes to math. I want a realistic distribution rather than just giving every guy a big cock (or even worse, giving our favorite guy a massive cock and the other characters small ones). I'm still trying to figure out the rules, but here are a few examples.

------------------------

Penis length: Roll 4 dice. Throw out the two lowest dice, and keep the two highest dice. Add them together, subtract 2, this is your penis length in inches.

Penis girth: Roll 2 dice. Add them together, divide by 2, add 2, this is your penis circumference in inches.

Penis length (flaccid): Roll 1 die. This is your flaccid penis length. (NOTE it's possible to have a shrinker if your flaccid penis is longer than your erect length! Be prepared to explore how that might affect sexual encounters!)

Breast size: Roll 2 dice. [2,3,4] = A cup, [5,6] = B cup, [7,8] = C cup, [9,10] D cup, [11,12] DD cup

Breast appearance: Roll 1 die. [1] = -2, [2] = -1, [3, 4] = 0, [5] = +1, [6] = +2. This is how many cup sizes bigger your breasts look in your work attire. Negative is smaller, and the minimum cup size is A. 

Breast firmness: Roll 1 die. [1] = floppy, [2, 3, 4] = normal, [5] = perky, [6] = so full and round that they look fake despite being real.

Breast Examples:

* Size roll = 9, Appearance roll = 1 --&gt; Size = D, Appearance = -2, so her Ds will look like Bs when she's dressed for work.

* Size roll = 5, Appearance roll = 1 --&gt; Size = B, Appearance = -2, her As will look like As because your cup size can't drop below A.
* Size roll = 7, Appearance roll = 6 --&gt; Size = C, Appearance = +2,
her Cs will look like DDs.

Butt size/firmness: Roll 1 die. [1] = Ironing board, [2,3] = Normal, [4,5] = Shapely and attractive, [6] = Nicki Minaj.

Sexual experience: Roll 1 die. (Spectrum) 1 is a virgin &lt;--&gt; 6 was probably in a fraternity/sorority.

Sexual skill: Roll 1 die. (Spectrum) 1 is a virgin &lt;--&gt; 6 should be writing a sex advice column.

Sexual appetite: Roll 1 die. [1] = Monthly, [2,3] = Weekly, [4,5,6] = Daily. This is how often the character wants (needs?) sex.

-----------------------------

Obviously, I'm still trying to figure this out. We don't need to do include all of these measurements and I'm certainly open to adding other traits/measurements. But first things first! Let's come up with our theoretical company and the people who work there. Once we come up with their office backstories, we can start discovering their sexual side and figure out how they all interact!

Character backstories don't need to be too intense. For example:

* [Lianna](http://i.imgur.com/rTWEjh6.jpg) is in charge of product design. She's always been an overachiever and joined the company immediately after graduating from a prestigious university.

* [Joel](http://i.imgur.com/Vuo7Wna.jpg) does all of the coding. He's likable and competent, but has a tendency to show up late or take long lunch breaks. 

* [Ali](http://i.imgur.com/ySv6cwj.jpg) is a sophomore at the local college and is working part-time as a marketing intern to earn credits for her business degree. She's not afraid to work hard for what she wants... it's just that she's never actually needed to work hard before because everybody is so enamored/intimidated by her!"

Unfortunately I wasn't accepted to that position, however I wanted to know what kind of projects I could work on in case that sort of question gets asked again. I completed an internship at a non-profit in December, and my two current internships are at another non-profit and a museum, and all of my internships have been in Development. The only use of Excel that my internships involved were updating already existing Master Lists with new or renewing donor information, so I'm not sure what kind of projects I could do.

I used to think it was a teenage phase and my mother's controlling personality would wane when I moved away to university, but that didn't happen unfortunately. When I was 13 I got involved with 'emo' people and self-harm - I was a silly child, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with me, I was just immature and didn't fully understand what consequences it would have. When my family found out it was a tough year moving past it, my relationship with my mum drastically changed, and she became very controlling. I wasn't allowed to stay around friends' houses, and if they came over to stay we had to be downstairs in eyesight of my mum at all times, I had no mobile phone, all computers and other devices had passwords on which I was the only one in the family who was not allowed to know, when I used the computer it was strictly for school work and my mother had to sit in the room, if I was using the house phone to talk to a friend, my mother would often pick up the other receiver to listen in. I felt extremely isolated from everyone - my friends slowly stopped inviting me to things, or if they did I would tell them I wasn't allowed, I wouldn't even check. When I became 16, I was allowed a mobile phone, which I had to leave downstairs at night, and would be checked as when I woke up in the morning, texts which I had received overnight would be opened and read before I got my phone back. My mother did not like a particular circle of my friends, purely because of they were of a lower economic background to our family, and caused arguments and conflict with their parents on a number of occasions, leaving them in tears sometimes. We had a very up and down relationship - some weeks we were fine, then all of a sudden I would find out she had been going through my phone and seen me messaging a boy (that was usually her cause of argument) or something else she disagreed with, and would take away any liberties (seeing friends outside of school or my phone) as punishment, and constantly tell me I had broken her trust, even though I fully believed there was never any trust there in the first place.
I tried to get help from school. I had counselling during school twice. First time I didn't get anything from it because I wasn't willing to open up. Second time I had the most amazing counsellor, she really helped me understand my feelings and how to deal with them. Self harm became a real issue for me, but I managed to stop when I went to university. Once I went to the head of year, as my mum had started an argument with me over mock grades (practise exams) having been sent home which I got a B in (I was a straight A student in everything). I asked the teacher to call home and talk to my mum. He did that night, and I listened in to the conversation - he told my mum I was one of the brightest students and she had nothing to be concerned about as they at school certainly weren't. My mum came to me and told me she had gotten off the phone with the school and they had told her they were concerned about me and they would be calling me in for a chat. I was shocked. I knew then I was on my own.
University came, and I was filled with so much pent up anger and resentment of my relationship with my mum. First term was hard for me, I was still self harming and I had just started dating a guy I had met on a singing course who was going to Oxford who my mother adored, but I wasn't feeling it with him at all, and knew I had strong feelings for a guy I was in secondary school with, who was just starting university in London as well as me. I ended up breaking it off with the Oxford guy and started seeing this London guy, and my mum hated it. She hated him (she had a problem with how often I talked to him while I was at school, on one occasion printing off a copy of my mobile provider's call and text history to show me all the times she knew I was texting him), he wasn't going to as a good a university as my ex and she despised the idea of him. We have been together two and a half years now, he is doing excellently in his degree and in his internship he is doing this year, and him and I have proved to ourselves and to the people closest to us that we are very much happy and function well together. My mum has never met him and refuses to, refers to him as 'fuckface' and makes it clear at every possible opportunity to all of our family and her friends of her disagreement with our relationship. She has realised that I will not leave him to appease her, so she has taken to finding every other reason to find conflict with me now. From attacking me over my interests (I am a fan of wrestling and attend live music concerts regularly), my weight (I put on weight at university I admit, although am a size 12, eat as healthily as I can and am physical active), my grades (I am averaging a high 2:1 at university, I get a lot of first grades, but I study History at a very academically demanding university which is obviously very challenging. She has told me if I do not get a first she will not attend my graduation), among many many other things.
I don't go home very often as I can't stand being in her presence for long periods of time. Christmas, I had been home a day before she started making digs at me and causing arguments, I lost it at her and fought back (I try my best to avoid confrontation, which leads us to go for weeks on end not speaking). The day I left I vowed I was done and didn't want her in my life anymore, whether on good terms or otherwise. I was exhausted of it. She would send me links to random things on facebook and say things like, oh I thought you'd like this etc, and I would give a civil reply and nothing more, until a few weeks ago when I thought I'd give her another shot. But we are back to square one.
It is my 21st birthday next month and I was going to bring some friends home from London to celebrate with my family. Now I'm questioning whether I even want to be in the same room as her. I don't know what to do. My father, my sister and her sister have told her on many occasions that her behaviour is irrational and she needs to stop her behaviour, but she will listen to no one. I am beyond resolving a relationship with her. Frankly, I never had a mother in an emotional sense, I always felt like nothing more than a trophy to her - she continuously tells me, as if I should care, that she can't talk to her friends about me because she's embarrassed. I am not perfect, and I am more than happy to admit to any faults when they are justified and put to me rationally. But I am a hardworking, ambitious person, who is able to maintain my academic work, financial situation, and relationships all to what I believe to be a good standard at the very least.
Does anyone have any advice for me?"
5vbb00,3,2017-02-21,I applied for a loan and got declined. I still want to buy so what do I do now?,binterryan76,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5vbb00/i_applied_for_a_loan_and_got_declined_i_still/,"So I was trying to get pre-approved for a home loan so I filled out the loan application process online and after several days of gathering the necessary documents I was declined. I received a statement of credit denial, termination or change which stated that I had:

* insufficient number of credit references provided.
* limited credit experience.
* income insufficient for amount of credit requested. ($140,000)
* Excessive obligations in relation to income.

my FICO credit score was 766 at the time of application.

I thought the bank told me how much I was pre-approved for and the number I gave them was just a ballpark number. I thought if I requested too much they would just pre-approve me for less.

I think the main thing against me is that I only rented for a short period of time (8 months) about a year ago and have lived with my parents since then and haven't had any major bills to develop a credit/payment history. I do have a credit card I have been paying off each month but it is only about 6 months old currently. I also have student loans but they aren't required to be paid off until i graduate so I haven't started paying them off yet. I could start making monthly payments anyway though so I can give them payment history. Is there anything else I can do to develop a history quick? Would a credit builder loan help? Would a second credit card help (assuming I pay it off every month)?

I still want a house though and I would like to move into a house in early November at the latest so I feel like I don't have enough time to build a history. Perhaps I am young and stupid and I just started too late to develop a history. 

Edits: 
Yes, I am in school but will be graduating in may. I have an Internship that pays well and i can almost work full time since i only have 9 credit hours.
current income: 40,000 /year. technically a little less than full time.
income starting in May: 58,000 /year.
current student debt: 13,500. I could pay all of this off but I wouldn't have as much of a down payment.
I have $17,000 saved currently. so would it be best to pay it all off and just save everything for the next few months? I have enough income that waiting could make a big difference in the amount of money that I have saved especially since I don't have a lot of expenses because I am currently living with my parents.

I do have a signed contract for after graduation. I am going to be in this city for at least three years since my fiance has PT school here so I think buying is still the best option for me. I really don't like the idea of renting since it feels like I'm just throwing money away.

Above I said that I requested a $140,000 loan but I could probably go as low as $110,000

any suggestions?

thanks for all the replies so far!"

Last year 120 students were hand picked out of 30 000 applicants and this year we are taking 200. It is a tuition free course in the field of Software Engineering and manages to be completely free thanks to our corporate sponsors. Due to this you are also guaranteed work opportunities with some of South Africa's biggest and best companies including our founding sponsors: BBD, FNB and Derivco and others such as Alan Grey, Rand Merchant Bank, Standard Bank, Britehouse, Nandos and many more.

You don't need a matric to apply and neither will past qualifications help you as students are picked based on aptitude. The only requirements to get in are that you pass the 2 logic games on our website, and if you make it through that you will be invited to a bootcamp. The bootcamp is a grueling month full of intense programming challenges and is the final barrier of entry, if after the bootcamp we think you have what it takes - you're in. 16 months of studies and 8 months of internships later and you'll be fully employed at one of our sponsor companies.

The course is trying to break the mold of typical university structures as we have no teachers, no lectures, and as I said earlier no fees. If you're passionate about programming anything from simple programs to complex artificial intelligences and big websites, and you think you have what it takes, we have what you're looking for.

I'm currently a second year student so I can answer most questions that you have, any that I can't answer can be directed to [our facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/wethinkcode/) so if you have any questions, ask away."

- when I cut/dyed my hair, she got angry and told me that I was just doing it because I knew she liked my hair long and light blonde

- when I was in the car with nmom edad and gcsister, turned around and clearly said ""well GC can do ANYTHING that SHE puts her mind to"" with that emphasis

- told me that she wanted to pay for gc to see a foreign country. Paused to look at me and said ""were thinking an internship for you.""

- told me as I mentioned in my last post ""well, when you get older you know birthdays should be really about the mother."" When I said I was spending mine with my wonderful LDR boyfriend

- insisted while shopping as a teen that I was a larger jeans size than I was

- when I told her how proud I was that I'd saved my allowance at ten and had $50 she asked to borrow all of it, and then was annoyed when I said no, telling me 'I'll pay it back'

- lightly smacked/tapped at my arm out of anger/annoyance once

- I actually cannot remember the last time she hugged me tightly

- when confronted on the above, just said 'well I don't remember doing any of that' and left the room

- has never apologized to me

- constantly said growing up what a negative and unpleasant person I was

- when I asked my dad how to do something with insurance, came stomping out of bedroom and yelled ""I KNOW YOU THINK IM WORTHLESS, BUT ACTUALLY I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS TOO""

Edad bonus:

- when I told him I was suicidal, he uncomfortably joked 'if you try to commit suicide I'll kill you!' And never mentioned it again 

I'm hesitant to use the word abuse because I do have some good memories of growing up and never wanted for anything, went on vacations, they help out with my car insurance still (despite me wanting to put the car in my name) but I think that's still... not normal?

I’ll start off by telling you about my background, feel free to skip to the **tl;dr** if you don’t want to hear about it. Also I'm not 100% if this belongs here.

During college I got lucky enough to get and internship with a corporation, it was good money and it looked like it had a pretty good job perceptive after graduation. The first thing they asked me during my interview for the internship was “have you ever used command line?” I answered truthfully saying “very little”, my one college professor made us use all command line for windows. Then the second question they asked was “Would you like to learn command line?”, to which I replayed “YES!”. LINUX had always intrigued me and at this point in my life I had no idea what I wanted to do as a “career”, I just wanted it to be computer related.

Well to find out they wanted someone fresh out of college to learn AIX, all of the other members of the team were 45+ years old (and each one had at least 10+ years with AIX/Iseries/other *nix)  and I think they we’re looking to getting some young talent in there to learn from them. Well after that summer and pretty much being self-taught and doing cross training with my team members I was offered a full time position after I graduated. I worked part time my last semester and then was hired fulltime the week after I graduated.

Well it’s been 5.5 years now since I was hired full time. I’ve never had any “formal” training with AIX just figuring out/troubleshooting problems when they occurred, asking my colleagues and opening tickets with IBM. 

My one colleague is about 75/25 between AIX and Linux (mostly Oracle Unbreakable and Redhat), we have a very small percentage of Linux compared to our AIX. I’d say 95% AIX and 5% Linux. Well just recently my manager has asked me if I would like to get more into the Linux side of things. He said in the next 1-3 years our Linux footprint might quadruple. So he said he’d like to send me to some training for “Linux in general.” 

**TL;DR** Is there any good online or in class Linux training that you could recommend? Price isn’t really a problem because our team gets a certain % of money each year for “continuous training”. Like a 4-5 day bootcamp (I’d rather be in a class room, and free mini-vacation) or a 1-2 month online class? I have 5.5 years of AIX/UNIX experience so I don’t think I would need a “beginner, beginner
 class, but I would like to be able to start with a soil foundation and work my way up. Any insight would be helpful!

5vdk0r,4,2017-02-21,Michigan to San Diego Trip,Cool_Story_Bra,roadtrip,https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/5vdk0r/michigan_to_san_diego_trip/,"I've got an internship in San Diego this summer, and I'm driving out there the first week of May. I'm also driving back to Northern Michigan after, around the first week of August. That means I've got the opportunity to do two awesome roadtrips this summer. 

The way I and Google Maps see it, the quickest route is down through Wisconsin, through Iowa and Nebraska, across Colorado, south and west through Utah, through Vegas and into SoCal. 

The first half of this drive, basically up till Denver, sucks. I've done it ~6 times, roundtrip, because my family likes to go skiing in Colorado. The second half look better, but still not that great. It could be improved a bit by detouring to the Grand Canyon instead of Las Vegas, because I'm more of an outdoorsy type, in fact I plan to try and bring a tent and hammock to sleep outside as much as possible. Route 1 about 34 hours in original form, about 37 with the Grand Canyon (Route 1A).

Being unimpressed with that route, I looked into some alternatives. Route 2 is the southwest tour. This would go down Wisconsin, to Chicago, St. Louis, OKC, Albuquerque, Phoenix,  San Diego.  This route interests me because the only part of it I've driven before is to Chicago, and I've never seen any of the Southwest. Id also expect it to have a bit nicer weather in May than Route 1. Time here is 36 Hours, or 38 if you replace Phoenix with Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. For a few hours more, better weather (one less night in a hotel?) I like this a lot.

Route 3 I'll probably save for the route home. It would be SD, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, then up to Yellowstone National Park, through Montana, North Dakota, Minneapolis, then home. This one is 40 hours, and I'd likely want to spend more time at Yellowstone than any stop on the other routes.  That's more time than I'd really have on the way out, which is basically capped at 6 days. The route home can probably be about 8 days. 


So now that youve read through my ramblings, I'd like some feedback. Am I missing some other real good route? Advice on places to stop, eat, camp, etc? I like beer, but there's plenty of that in San Diego so I don't feel the need to do breweries on the road trip. 

I'll likely have a buddy with me for both trips, planning on bringing tent, sleeping bag, etc. for camping gear. Considering full on frame pack, as I might want to do overnight hikes in Southern California. 

Thanks for any input!

5vdmm5,13,2017-02-21,I Might Have Falsely Claimed Rape and Ruined My Relationship,FlyingDutchmanSock,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/5vdmm5/i_might_have_falsely_claimed_rape_and_ruined_my/,"[Remorse]

I have been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now. We moved in together probably too fast due to a quickly deteriorating relationship between her and her mother. She had just turned 18 and we'd only known each other for probably 3 months before living together, I really was in love with her.  I am an intern at a pretty large company and getting towards the end of college, this is her first year because she took a  year off. 

It went really well for a long time but she began to complain that our sex life was dwindling. I should preface this by saying she was a victim of sexual assault when she was very young by a baby sitter (single mother) and was somewhat absorbed by self harm. Once we'd started dating she hadn't done it once and that made me really proud that I could help. It went really well for a long time but she began to complain that our sex life was dwindling. We went from doing it multiple times a day to doing it once or twice a week, sometimes less. I figured that this was just the result of living together and a long term relationship, but she had grilled me in the past whether I still found her attractive. Of course I still find her attractive and love her really quite a lot. I will admit that often when we did have sex my performance really wasn't great duration wise and I really didn't know why. Maybe because I didn't want to be doing it at that time, maybe it was just something I needed to work on that I just wasn't. Yesterday she was grilling me more than usual, we both left for class and I had dinner with my new boss and coworkers and she had work. We just set up our new bed and she called me out for dodging the question of why our sex life was not what it used to be. Honestly it's because I know I wasn't performing up to her needs and I really loathed myself for it. The conversation went into an awkward silence after her asking why I'm still not comfortable to talk about it. 

I had been doing a lot of thinking and there was a time at our last apartment that we both got drunk, she more than I as she is a tiny lightweight. I was just about asleep and she had gotten on top of me and started having sex. At first I didn't say much, but I definitely didn't really want to, but then she really did something I didn't want. I remember saying something but giving up and decided to wait for it to be over.  She told me she wanted me to finish inside of her and I said no (she's not on birth control). She kind of wrapped herself around me and made me finish inside her. 

I really really did not like that, I am very paranoid of an unintended pregnancy and I really didn't like being forced to do that. the day after she wanted to talk about what happened to make sure it was okay. I played it off thinking it would best persevere our relationship and I would just work through it. I had worked through a serious bout of depression on my own I figured this would be easier. and for the most part I'd done just that.  Last night after I had been grilled for our sex life diminishing I really felt pressured to give her a reason so I told her about the time at the old apartment as to a reason why I might not have had my mojo for a while. She took it really hard. She began bawling and made herself physically sick and threw up. She can't even look at me. She thinks exactly what happened to her when she was young is what she did to me. I really don't feel that way, I felt pressured to say something and that's what came out.

She said she's probably not coming over tonight and has to think over our relationship. This isn't what I wanted, eventhing else was going so well just 2 days ago and now I'm not sure we will continue. Typing this at work - I can barley hold myself together."

First - I posted this in the general subreddit /r/whiskey because this neither represents only Scotch, only Irish nor the criteria for /r/worldwhisky - and I will only crosspost it in /r/whiskyporn - if this would be an acceptable post for one of the other subreddits, feel free to x-post it there.

**If you aren't interested in my background stories**, just scroll down to the **LIST OF WHISKIES + THOUGHTS**

**So, let's start with the fun** - I started drinking and enjoying Whisky in late 2015 after I had always had a slight interest in it (my dad drinks Whisky from time to time), but before that I never really got into drinking undiluted spirits. Back then, the slight smokiness of Red Label piqued my interest, and I went from there, slowly trying drams in bars and finally buying my first bottle (Glenfarclas 10 Yo, review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4knql3/review_2_glenfarclas_10_years/)) in January 2016. I knew I was gone when I got a second, Glenfarclas Springs ([review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4av2bx/1st_review_glenfarclas_springs_legend_of_speyside/) here) just a few weeks later.

I quickly considered it a hobby and a passion, when a neat opportunity came along - for University, had I had take half a year abroad, and I heard about a paid internship in Dublin, Ireland - so I took it, looking forward to enjoying the Whiskey culture there.

As in Germany, you can almost only get top shelf Scotch (I had only had Connemara Peated as an Irish whiskey before I left to Dublin), I was really looking forward to learn about the Whiskey  from the smaller of the two British Isles - and I did.

I quickly realised that most bars had a wide selection of quality whisky, and those specialised in it were plenty. I visited Teeling Distillery and spent an awful lot of time in the Dingle Whiskey Bar in the heart of Dublin. I always tried to order something new, so there were very few drams that I had twice or more times. At the Dingle Bar, I took part in two whiskey tasting nights with Fionnan O'Connor, a whiskey writer and former Diageo Brand Ambassador - just a great chap and very enjoyable evenings.

When my stay came to an end, I took a detour to Edinburgh, Scotland before returning home, to indulge in my interest even more. There, I continued the crusade, visited many pubs with Scotch on their shelves and took the tours at the Scotch Whisky Experience, dropped by in Cadenheads and visited the Glenkinchie Distillery.

**LIST OF WHISKIES + THOUGHTS**

**So, here are now the Whiskies that I tried, first the standouts or remarkable ones (not necessarily a list of my ""favourite"" drams I had, but those that gave me the most new insight about whisky in general), and then a full list**

During the last 6 months, I tried 64 new whiskies, 23 of those Irish, two American, and one Japanese - the rest was Scotch. I quickly realised that really great whisky can come from other places than Scotland and also from distilleries other than the household traditional names.

The standouts in this category were the **Redbreast 15 year old Single Pot Still** - simply an incredibly good whiskey, not lacking in any category, and absolutely recommended for everybody. Then the **Palace Bar 12 year old Port cask**, a whiskey I tried in the, you guess it - Palace Bar pub in Dublin. This is one of the few whiskeys left of the old tradition that many pubs have their own matured whisky, which you can basically only get there. Another candidate would be the **Redbreast Lustau Edition**, a NAS (and probably quite young) whiskey with a very strong sherry influence, that gave me confidence in trying these new, as marketing-crap-appearing releases. Two more mentions have to be the **Teeling Single Grain** and **Kilbeggan 8 year old Single Grain**, two very tasty expressions that taught me not to dismiss everything as crap that isn't a Single Malt whisky.

An honorable mention is the **Dingle Single Malt**, the first and very new own Whiskey expression of the Dingle Distillery - it's a super young whiskey (probably less than four years of maturation) that helped me learn a lot about the influence of maturation and casks on a dram. And last but not least, there's the good old **Green Spot** and **Yellow Spot**, two very high quality stable whiskeys from Ireland.

Then next we move on to drams that showed me that really good whisky can come from any place in the world - **Nikka From the barrel** is just an incredibly good Japanese Whisky that exceeded my expectations. Then I also tried two US American whiskeys, **Eagle Rare 10 year old Bourbon** which will be on the list to purchase before the warm summer nights hit Germany - really pleasant, sweet, easy-drinking stuff! And **Rittenhouse Rye 100 Proof**, the first non-Barley Whiskey I had, and such a different beast compared to ""grain"" (in the case of Teeling for example, Corn) whiskeys! Over the course of these months, I learned a lot about how the used grain, mashbill, production process and casks influence and change the outcome, and there is still so much more to learn and experience!

Now it was time to leave Dublin, and I flew over to Edinburgh, to indulge in the product of the titan of whisky countries. Scotch will still remain my favorite, just because of the selection and variety it offers.

I was finally able to try the more ""special"" stuff - I had the **Glenkinchie Limited Edition distillery only bottling**, the first independent bottling I tried was the **Aultmore 14 Yo ( 2000-2014) by Gordon &amp; MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice**, which also was one of the first whiskies that just tasted very different to most OBs and show me a slight flaw as in being too oaky for my tastes. Then I finally tried an **Octomore 6.1**, which is an experience in and of itself, which also showed me that I have no problems drinking the super-peaty stuff, the **Whisky Galore! 7 Year old**, a kind of bottling that you just don't get in Germany with it's goofy presentation, the **Ardbeg Uigeadail** that I just had to try after being around the /r/scotch subreddit, and which DID live up to my expectations, the **Lagavulin 8 Year old** which became one of my favorites, giving me a lesson how little high age statements mean for the quality of a spirit, and finally the **Glenfarclas 25 year old** which taught me exactly the opposite. This is also still the oldest whisky I have tried so far.

My favorite from the whole trip though, is a **17 year old Cragganmore** that I got from Cadenheads, a small Cask Ends bottle that was finished for a good three years in Sherry Casks, and will reign supreme as my absolute best purchase I have done so far. This stuff is lovely, and it begs the question why the extra sherry maturation of most distilleries OBs is so much shorter. The mix of strong bourbon AND sherry influences is just incredible.

5ve8z0,1,2017-02-21,Am I being a d*ck? Or is she the abuser in our relationship? M[26],19UniqueUsername91,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ve8z0/am_i_being_a_dck_or_is_she_the_abuser_in_our/,"So, this might end up being a long post, I'm sorry. 

I've been dating this girl for 1.5 years. We met at the university and hit it off just great. She was very attractive, witty, funny, understanding and we were in general very much on the same wavelength in terms of interests, attitudes to different things in life and so on. It seemed almost too good to be true. Before we met she had just dumped her previous boyfriend and didn't want to rush into a new relationship just then, which I was understanding of and decided to let things develop as they would. We kept hooking up without commitments for about 6 months and everything was great. It wasn't just sex, we spent a lot of time together doing many things, went to parties, restaurants, studied together and so on. It was almost like a relationship, with the only exception that we didn't call each other bf or gf and never committed to being exclusive, although in fact we were. After the initial 6 months things started to get more serious and at some point we just kind of accepted that we are in a relationship. 

Some more time passed by, around 2 months, and around then I started noticing first signs of trouble. It is weird to say, but we actually had our first fight only around 6 months into the relationship. It was something study-related and in general not worthy of a fight, but that was the moment when I noticed, that despite her sweetness she could be quite authoritarian about wanting things being done her way. In that particular situation we were working on a school project together and she just wouldn't accept any of my suggestions that contradicted her opinion. It wouldn't be a big deal for me, but what I found troubling is that even faced with absolute, 100% valid argument that my suggestions were better in some aspects (even recognized by other group members) she seemed to not be able to being herself to admit that she was wrong and would still insist on her opinions. I let it go back then, but this behavior stuck in my mind. 

When the studies finished we had to spend four months apart working internships in two different cities. As I didn't have the money to travel and her family didn't mind covering her expenses, she ended up visiting me about once every three weeks. I told her repeatedly that I'm sorry about her having to do this but she said she didn't mind. However after three of such visits she started blaming me for not making the effort to visit her, although she knew perfectly well that I just didn't have the funds to travel. At some point she blew up at me saying that it seemed to her I don't care enough about her. Which is ridiculous because I helped and supported her in so many things - helped her to find that internship in the first place, helped her arrange her paperwork, helped her to deal with administrative stuff in the country we live (we are both foreigners but I have a longer exoerience living here and speak the language and she doesn't) on innumerable occasions, helped her organize her moving (actually completely took care of it) and never said no to almost any of her requests. 

On her birthday I went an extra mile and organized a dinner at a very nice place (had to sacrifice my quality of life for the next two weeks to afford it) and bought her an expensive gift. She was genuinely happy and thanked me sincerely but again after a while started telling me that it seems like I don't care about her. Around that time I also started telling her that she herself is not perfect either but I somehow managed to accept her flaws. But she just would blindly argue against everything I said and wouldn't recognize ANY of her flaws. 

So it continued for the last several months and at some point we had a major fight again where she told me many hurtful things, implying again that I was abusing her and didn't care about her and suggesting that she is thinking about ending the relationship. This made me shut down, I stopped arguing with her and just became more distant because what she said made me doubt whether she really meant it before when she said she loved me. She understood that she went overboard and apologized and admitted her fault ( I think it was actually the first time during our whole relationship). I forgave her but the negative aftertaste remained. Shortly after that we moved back in together. And the problems seemed to have subsided for a while until recently I made a suggestion that since she feels comfortable to tell me to change myself in so many ways, I should also be comfortable telling her to start taking better care of her body (she gained some weight lately). A horrible blow-up ensued, she called me all kinds of names, telling me that I'm a horrible person but refusing to see how many things she told me before were very hurtful to me too. And she would not stop shouting and demanding that I apologize. I had to do that just to calm her down although I felt treated unfairly, just like so many times during similar arguments with her before. Now, as I see that our relationship is less than in a perfect shape I'm trying to understand if she is actually right and I am really that horrible to her and fail to see it or if my intuition is right which is telling me that she just cares about her needs being met, loves the things that I do for her but not ME as a person, and reacts defensively every time I'm trying to get my needs met.

Sorry for the long post but I'm genuinely unsure of what to make of this situation and would appreciate an opinion from outside. If you need any additional info that might help to clarify this, please feel free to ask.

*TL;DR* Met a girl 1.5 years ago. First 6 months were hookups withough commitment. Became bf and gf afterwards. She started being very authoritative, telling me to change myself, only rarely accepting my opinions and never recognizing her own faults. Despite me doing A LOT for her, she tells me that I abuse her and don't care about her (which is not true). I made a bold move telling her that she needed to take better care of her body (she is telling me to change myself in multiple ways, can't I tell her the same?). She blew up at me and made me apologize.

I am genuinely at a loss and would like some outside perspective."

I'm about to graduate from college with a bachelor of computer science in about 3 months. I've waited a long time for this, but there's a problem. I learned quite a while ago that it would take more than good grades (which I have) to get a decent job in my field. Unfortunately, I haven't done a whole lot of what I needed to do, and I think it might be too late now.

As they say, ""it's the hands you shake, not the grades you make."" Networking, unfortunately, is probably more important than any knowledge I actually accrued in school. Given that I'm here in this subreddit, it probably goes without saying that networking is not my strong suit. I've put myself out there before -- going to career fairs, emailing recruiters personally, asking my bosses for help, etc -- but I've only been met with minor success at best, i.e., a few calls/emails back saying they prefer to have someone now as opposed to my graduation date.

More importantly than networking, I have very little experience outside the classroom. I spearheaded the development of a small database application in a team of four (class project) and am currently in a large group for a software engineering project (also a class project). I'm not even sure if those count as ""real"" experience since they were in the classroom. I've also been kicking myself pretty hard since last summer. After a particularly brutal semester, I decided to take it easy that summer. It might have been the last chance I would ever get to take advantage of the summer, after all. The thing is that I could have gotten an internship. I didn't even try. Now it's too late to even get one now that I graduate in a couple of months.

Of course, all of this leaves me in a bad spot, and I really only have myself to blame. In my defense, I take a full course load, work hard for the grades I get, and work part time to cover most of my expenses. Between work and school, I probably average about 70 - 80 hours of work a week. I know it's not an excuse, but I just wish I had more time. Now I fear I'll have all the time in the world living without a job in my shitty car. 

I fear it was all for nothing. I worked really hard, but I should have looked past such a hectic schedule and tried for an internship, put more effort into a personal project, something. I guess I'll just keep pushing my resume out there and see what happens. "

I am enrolled in one of the top 5 universities in chemical engineering program and my GPA is 3.80. I have been involved in research for three semesters and have moderate extracurricular activities. So far I've only heard back from one company for an interview and it was exxon mobil. Unfortunately, I did not get an offer. I've gone to all career fairs and submitted 80+ applications online past year, but have heard no response or gotten bunch of rejection letters. I'm starting to believe there is something massively wrong... Could it be that my GPA is high and I'm involved in research that companies think I'm more likely to go to grad school? Not so sure if this is a factor in picking interns but it's getting more and more frustrating over time and I am gradually losing motivation to keep up my GPA.

Any advice would help and thank you in advance."

I have lots of things that keep me busy with school and work and stuff but i still miss him. Anyways, essentially my work has an office in the same city he's in and I asked if I could be transferred for four months and they said that I probably could. The only issue is that I won't be able to take summer class which I really wanted to do so I could finish my degree faster. So should I suck it up and deal with him gone for four months or maybe have an adventure and spend four months in this other city. And by the way, this other city is beautiful and we visited it a few months back and were dying to come back. I dont know if its too early to drop everything and live with him. 
Thanks in advance for any advice. And lastly, If I decide to stay where I am, what kind of advice would you offer me to maintain the relationship.

It was a very short internship, and towards the end I ended up contributing some money into a Vanguard Retirement Account. I was notified that this account (with around $60) will be closing, and I was left with some options. 

* Rollover to Vanguard IRA
* Rollover to another type of Vanguard Retirement Plan
* Rollover to IRA with another provider 
* Withdraw cash 

I would prefer to not withdraw the cash at the moment and keep the money in the account. I spoke with KeyBank and they told me that there would be a $125 fee to rollover to an account with them. Is rolling the account over to a Vanguard IRA my best bet?

The reason I wanted to roll it over to KeyBank was because I will be interning with them this summer and thought that I could contribute to that account over the course of the internship. If I did roll the account over to the Vanguard IRA, could I continue contributing to that IRA while interning at KeyBank?"

Now, I'm not sure how much of this is environmental stuff and how much is the drug. About me: I'm about to graduate from grad school and the job search is terrifying me. I thought a guy I had been dating for a couple months were going well and he randomly dumped me (I also had a very strange dream about him that freaked me out while one this drug). I get anxiety at my internship, in general already. 

Sometimes I have a hard time going to class, but usually I can muscle through it. Today though, for several hours I felt like I was on the verge of a mental breakdown. I've only had one panic attack, and it wasn't that, but I felt like I couldn't get out of my bed, and my mind just kept spinning, and I kept feeling like I wanted to die just to end the torment. I did eventually throw up and I felt a little better, but I still ended up skipping class today, and I ended up just now emailing my supervisors at my internship faking sick because I don't feel like I can go in tomorrow because I'm so scared I'm going to go into full-panic mode. 

So is this normal? Will it last? Should I stop taking it? I started taking it because my life is so stressful right now and I needed to do something to help me get through it (plus I've always been anxious). But I literally feel like I can't do anything except watch episodes of crazy ex-girlfriend in bed, and even that doesn't help as much as it normally does, and I need to be functional. "

5vg99b,1,2017-02-21,"Tell me everything I need to know about getting a car, please!",thirdfavoriteword,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5vg99b/tell_me_everything_i_need_to_know_about_getting_a/,"I'm about to graduate college, and I need a car. I have kind of a strange family situation that I should explain first, though. In high school, I wasn't *allowed* to get my driver's license. Once I got to college, I tried to get my dad to teach me how to drive every summer when I was home, but it never really went anywhere. I go to college in a very rural town, and in my state people with driver's permits can only practice driving with people who are 21 or older. Since all of my friends are more or less the same age as me, I only ended up getting my license last summer at age 21. Because I haven't had a car, my job opportunities have been very limited. The town I live in  is so rural that my only job options were too far away for me to walk to (theres no public transit infrastructure, no sidewalks, no streetlights), and student employment is limited to people eligible for federal assistance. Basically, I don't have a ton of money saved up. I have about $3,000 saved from summer jobs, birthday money, and money saved from my allowance. My parents partially pay for school, and the rest of the cost is covered by student loans and scholarships. Despite not having a ton of work experience, I've completed several internships and am heavily involved in student leadership. I've worked really hard over these four years to distinguish myself, and I'm ready to go out on my own, start a career and be self sufficient. However, I know I can't afford a car without help. I'm going to have to ask for assistance from my parents, but every time I bring it up I get shut down. My dad seems to be content to not think about the issue at all, and my mom keeps hinting that she'd like me to live at home so she could *drive me to and from work every day*. I'm 22 and I need to figure out a way to support myself so I don't have to rely on my parents anymore. I'm grateful they've supported me throughout my education, and I know lots of people have to go it alone. However, without a car, I won't be able to put that education to use. If I don't have a car, I can't get a job. If I don't get a job, I won't be able to be financially independent, and based on my experiences with my parents in the past, part of me feels like they're content to keep me at this stage.

Anyway, I want to know all of my options. I want to be able to approach my parents from a knowledgable place and to present them with as many scenarios as possible so they can't brush me off. Both of my parents work, and we're approximately upper middle class. They made it a rule to never talk about money when I was a kid, so I couldn't tell you what either of my parents make. My parents have always leased cars, except my mother's current car, which she purchased in cash she got after my grandfather died. I obviously want to keep my car payments as low as possible, so I've been looking at used cars. In the long term the most important thing for me is keeping the monthly payment low at this point in my life, so while I understand the argument that leasing cars isn't a great investment, for the next few years I think that's a reasonable option for me. 

However, I have been working with an idea for a while that would involve purchasing a used car. I was thinking that my parents could take out a car loan. They'd purchase a used car, and be reimbursed in monthly payments that would eventually pay them back in full for the loan, including the interest it accumulates. The payments would be spread over 56 months, or four and a half years. I actually have a sister who is in the same boat as me. Not allowed to drive in high school, very restricted by my parents. She has no money. She's graduating high school when I graduate college. My plan is for me to contribute a bit of my savings to the downpayment on the loan, and then to pay my parents in monthly installments for two years. Then I'd give the car to my sister, and she'd pay my parents for 2.5 years, roughly equalizing our investments. This gives her two years to find a job (she'll likely go to a more urban college and have wider employment opportunities), and she'd pay off the car about 6 months after graduating college. Once the car is paid off, my parents have the option of selling it and keeping the money, my sister selling it and keeping the money, or my sister keeping the car. I like this idea because it doesn't feel like charity, but an investment that they can either use for themselves or pass along to my sister. The only problem: I don't really understand how to get a car loan, how to calculate the interest on it, or know what kind of downsides taking one out might have for my parents other than the initial investment.

Anyway, this is kind of open ended. Can anyone help me understand better how get a car inexpensively? Does my idea sound feasible? Are there any concepts I should know about before I approach my parents again? I want to emphasize that I really do understand that it's not the worst thing in the world to be supported by my parents, but at this point in my life I want to start taking care of myself, and every time I make moves to do so my parents try to keep me from doing so.

I just graduated university in the USA in economics. However, I did an internship with an IT company that has an office in Prague and they offered me an employee card If I wanted to go and live in Prague. I just have a few questions about Prague if you don't mind me asking. 

My job will be a desktop support position working in Karlin, Prague 8. 

My salary will be 52,000 CZK gross per month with a 13th salary. According to some information I've looked up online this is much higher than the median wage in Prague, however many people on this subreddit have said it's really not that great of a salary to live on. I'm not sure what is reality. 

My company subsidizes an apartment for me. So for example the first 2 months in Prague will be free for me and then afterwords I will pay 12,000 czk a month for a 3+1 (120m2) apartment near the Zelivskeho metro. I've walked around the area on google maps and it doesn't seem like there is much going on out there. Should I stick with this flat or try to find something else?

My company offers free Czech lessons but I've heard the language can be a bit tricky. I already speak German, Spanish and English but I don't think any of these languages will help me out with czech. So foreigners living in Prague how long did it take you to become conversational in Czech? I know it's different for everybody but I'm just curious regardless. 


Otherwise, I can't wait to make the move. Prague seems like a great city. "

It was kind of jarring since I haven't spoken to or heard from this cousin in about 12 years. I've heard about his progress over the years but I've always been too ashamed to go apologize to him. So here's the story.

His name is Chris. He was always kind of different. He liked different music, spoke differently, had different interests, had poor social skills and I could go on. He was just kind of odd to us as kids. He did spend a lot of time around our grandparents and old people so maybe that was why.

Because of his different personality traits, he dealt with a lot of bullying in school for his entire life. Chris never showed any emotion, though. He was quiet to begin with but looking back I notice that when he got upset he just totally shut down. It's hard to tell how bad he was hurt because he just went silent.

Anyway, after Jr high he moved to a new district and went to highschool with me. I was a junior and I was pretty popular in high school. I was also massively insecure in my own right. He came to school with me because he had always looked up to me, we got along like brothers at home, and I said I'd look out for him and introduce him to my friends and help him make friends. But I was immature and selfish back then. I admit I treated him differently at home vs in public. I made him the butt of the joke.

Chris was getting shit on from the day he got there because of me and it was constant and came from everybody. Everyone knew me and liked me and since I picked on Chris, they did too. I can't stress enough how bad it was. It got worse because Chris'mom made him play on the football team. From what I heard he was just a punching bag for them. Not physically, but they made his life hell.

Again, no one noticed how much Chris was hurting because he was so quiet. 

The last day I was around Chris was a day where he rode home from school with me and one of my friends. My friend immediately started dumping on Chris. Chris must have reached his limit at this point because he actually started to get visibly upset and yell and curse back. 

My friend eventually stopped the car in the middle of the road and made Chris get out. I'm ashamed of this moment. I remember Chris looking at me for help and I didn't say a word. Chris got out and started walking.

My friend and I drove to my house and sat outside waiting for Chris to walk home. He never came, or so we thought. He was actually sitting in the backyard and my house was small enough that he could hear us talking shit about him..he just sat back there and listened. 

He stayed until my mom came home and started yelling at me asking where he was. He let me get yelled at for a while and then came in and said he was sitting in the backyard. Again, Chris got shit on by my mom for ""playing games"". That's not her fault, though as she was honestly concerned for his well being. 

That night, Chris tried to kill himself by slitting his wrists. Thankfully my mom heard him crying in the kitchen.

Long story short he left my school and was in the hospital for a while. He told his mom and therapist about what had been happening and I just never heard from him again. 

Now the kid is a doctor. I realize I really have no right to be in his life, but I do want to apologize to him. 

Tl;dr- I helped bully my cousin to the point of suicide. Now, 12 years later, he's doing well for himself. He's a full fledged doctor. Hes helping people and, from what i hear, happy. I want to Apologize to him. What is the best way to do this?"
5vigbb,0,2017-02-22,Will a ~3.2 overall GPA hold me back from getting an internship?,R3d_Anonymous,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/5vigbb/will_a_32_overall_gpa_hold_me_back_from_getting/,"It looks like that's around the overall GPA I will be at after completing my freshman year.  I'll be looking for internships in the fall.  

First of all, I'm not an Actuarial Science major, but a Statistics one.  The reason it's on the lower side is first semester I had trouble adjusting and fell into depression and then overall I've been having to take a lot of classes in my weakest areas.  I've also been getting sick a lot which got me behind in classes a lot as well so I've often been stuck playing catch-up.  I expect to graduate with a higher GPA in the end, but at the end of this year it won't be quite that high.

I passed Exam P in July 2016, sitting for FM in April, and if I pass that, I'm planning on sitting for MFE in July and C in October.

I'll also be taking the TIA technical skills course over the summer so I have the necessary computer skills.

At the moment, although I'm a freshman, my expected graduation date is May 2019, although if I fail to get an internship in summer of 2018, I'll stay another semester to have an additional summer to get one (in summer of 2019).  I know I want to go CAS-side and once I'm done with preliminary exams, I plan to start taking the CAS ones - MAS-I, 5, and 6.  

The question is will a GPA that is at least 3.0 but lower than 3.5 make it substantially difficult to obtain an internship?"
5vij4t,8,2017-02-22,It all comes down to progression and time.,UKhadenough,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5vij4t/it_all_comes_down_to_progression_and_time/,"Its been downhill since 20 years old when the channeling of being a child, teenager and adolescent comes to an end. 

Im 25 this year and the last 5 years I cant really see any real progress in my life. 

It starts back in school - I was one of the fortunate guys who had friends, I wasnt unpopular, and up until university I was sucessful throughout. 


I would be top at spelling in my class aged 10, I always was praised for my hard work and commitment in secondary school &amp; I have qualifications up to level 5 BTEC. 

I struggled to get a job in my field and when I did land the job of my dreams - the company had me on as an intern (unpaid) for over a year before the company folded. 

I spent a few months looking for alike career paths with little sucess. I would apply &amp; fail. In 4 months I was invited to two interviews and both told me that the job would not be suitable for my skills or experience &amp; or a better candidate came along.

I took up careers advice and I consolidated my CV to one page with just the important information on. 


I started my own business last year, the excitement got the better of me and now im working a gardening business. I work on my own and find myself lonely most days. The work is physical and most evenings I just want to lay in bed and watch telly. 

The money can be great, but over winter the work dried up and I ended up spending the maority of what I had earned in the previous 7/8 months - just to get by. 

The tax year is coming up and now that im self employed, once self assesment is completed - I may have to pay tax which right now im not sure I can afford to pay. - Let alone car insurane, rent, work insurance, tools and consumables and somewhere my non existent social life has to be squeezed into the equasion. 

Im 25 this year and ive no real experience or references to back me up. I feel like time is fast passing - how will I ever get a career with progression if I cant get my foot in the door now? It seems like theres always someone younger and better than me who will beat me.


I still live at home with my aging parents and it can be a struggle. Im constantly met with comments like, when are you going to get going? Are you planning on living here forever? As well as constant comparisons as to when he was 23 - he was in his flat, self sufficient and about to marry my mum, working offshore. 


I dont have too many friends and I do an awful job of staying in touch with them sometimes. A lot of the time it feels like im watching them progress whilst im stuck. Careers, girlfriends, married, travelling, building life memories and alike. Its hard to watch. + With them having good jobs = money which = options because we live in a monetised society right? The same can be applied to having a partner, your own space &amp; more options. 


Im crap with relationships. I cant say ive ever had a girlfriend. not a real one anyway. I did some random hookups and eventually it made me feel worse. - seedy, knowing nothing about them, literally treating them like a piece of meat. 

I put my life on a plate on serious dating websites and I take the time to read peoples bio's and send them a personalised message. Not one reply. 

I watch people have relationships with great people, fuck up relationships, then watch said person get into the next fling or relationship like its nothing. - Its effortless for these people. I envy those.




I dont know where im going wrong in life, I try and try and try. How long am I suppose to try for? Its not just one thing either, everything is a vicious circle. 5 years since I came out of a channeled life and I feel like ive not progressed in the slightest. I wake up feeling heavier each day, I cry most days &amp; im stuck. I cant change this situation because it either costs money, or a new job or finding someone who cares and respects &amp; wants me to be their priority... 5 years and ive failed every hurdle along the way.

Time is ticking too. I want to travel, I want a family, I want so so much but I cant get started. Its frustrating and I hate what is happening to me.




Just give me a chance. I can prove that im worth something.

5vj6ld,4,2017-02-22,Looking for some advice for a delicate situation,lacenerentola,blogsnark,https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/5vj6ld/looking_for_some_advice_for_a_delicate_situation/,"Hi all, I have a bit of a dilemma and am not quite sure what to do.

About four years ago I worked with a very predatory man who repeatedly hit on me and the other young women in our office in a very aggressive way. The higher-ups had vaguely known what was going on for a few years, but he was kind of the star of the show and they turned a blind eye to it because no one had ever made a formal complaint. This coworker's advances made me very very uncomfortable, but I was in a relationship and so I felt more secure in turning them down. However, he began to harass an intern I was supervising who was only 21 (he was in his late thirties) and I felt like I had to do something to protect her. So I made a formal complaint against him. I was treated very dismissively when I told my supervisors and my intern left at the end of the summer with nothing really moving forward to discipline him, and I left the job about a year later because of this and general unhappiness there.

Soon after I was left, he was asked to resign, because he had been very aggressively hitting on a woman at a part-time position he had and it had made its way back to our organization. He was fired from the part-time job and this was the impetus to my former boss asking me to resign. Unfortunately, my former boss gave him a letter of recommendation, because my boss hated conflict and didn't know how to properly deal with it. I was upset when I found out, but I thought it was over and just tried to let it go.

Fast forward to today--I decided to go back to grad school and am researching programs. I would like to stay where I live, and the top program in the area and the one I would most like to go to, surprise surprise, is where this old coworker now works as an adjunct. I'm assuming he got the job on the basis of the letter of recommendation, and that the school does not know about him being fired from the other job. I am worried about two things--one, the fact that he now constantly has access to young women and is in a position of power over them, and more selfishly, what would happen if I were to attend this school. His actions have shown that he is basically unhinged and incapable of hearing no. I worry for the safety of his current students and I worry about my safety as someone who he knows vaguely had something to do with him being forced out. This is my dream program, and I don't want to not go out of fear, but I also don't want to just let this go because it seems so grossly unfair. I also don't want to make it into some huge investigation-type deal. Is there anything I can or should do? I've been thinking about calling the school's Title IX office, but I'm not sure if just making an anonymous complaint would get them to do anything. I feel at a loss of what to do.

Any advice would be very much appreciated."

I just relapsed after 4 1/2 weeks. I did NOFAP for the very first time after fapping 2-4 times a day.

I think positive reinforcement is important in the long run. You create new habits like NOFAP and r/coldshowers ( 3 1/2 weeks yay :D) not because you hate yourself it is because you love yourself. If you keep putting down yourself every time you fail it will be more likely to fall back to your own habits.

Despite failure I look back on my time positively. I became waaaay more confident. I noticed it the way I walk always with chest up. I talked to both girls and guys more easily. I was super productive working my ass off both in the library and in the gym. I got an important internship that a month ago I could only dream of, I'm repping out 3 plates of squats 4 plates of deadlifts again (all those late night squat sessions lol).

I will continue NOFAP and this time even go longer.

One of the concers that I have with NOFAP is that hard mode after a while is really exhausting and stressing. My first 3 1/2 weeks were just awesome. The last week was really getting awful and brutal. I am during my finals week and just could not cope with all the mental stress and physical urges that I had and finally relapsed. Somebody noticed this too while being on hard mode?

So a quick summary: 

While not working full-time as an Adwords advertiser, I also intern with a company that helps further the careers of artists and musicians. Essentially we help our clients by giving them the tools they need to succeed (access to press, networking capabilities, other artists to collab with, social media, etc). 

I've been brought on in order to work with our paid/sponsored content in order to grow our YouTube page. Currently, we have so much content but no real strategy as to how to get it in front of people. The YouTube page is pretty filled up too in terms of content, but they're just videos that haven't been revisited since the first upload &amp; publishing of them. The most advertising these content pieces got were a couple of social media posts on Instagram: after that - nothing. 

So really...What do I do with all of this content? I was thinking of funneling bigger content pieces and uploading those series to Facebook &amp; sponsoring videos based on the content in them, but then that doesn't help grow our YouTube efforts. 

There are basic things I found that I can do to our current content pieces such as optimize the tags and descriptions, but I'm really lost as to what I should do in terms of racking up views &amp; building a healthy Youtube ecosystem. 

Any suggestions? Also thanks everyone in advance. "
5vkrjq,5,2017-02-22,"After losing my family, I have nobody left to live for and I feel too tired to continue",MelancholyDrifting,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5vkrjq/after_losing_my_family_i_have_nobody_left_to_live/,"I think I want to die but I don’t even know if that’s what I want or not; I don’t even know what I want. I’ve spent the past eight years, over a third of my life, repressing my very existence. After coming out as gay, my mother would banish me to my room if I talked to the dog in a doggy voice. She would banish me to my room if I sat a certain way, if I talked a certain way, if I used charismatic hand gestures … anything remotely feminine, anything remotely gay. I had to go to a psychologist and pretend to turn straight or my mother would kick me out of the family. I had to repress everything about me, while being bullied in school, having nowhere to feel safe, nowhere to become me. My teenage years, the years I was supposed to grow and develop as a person, were the years I was punished whenever I acted like me (even such a minor, instinctual thing as sitting with one leg over the other – like a “girl”).

I have spent these past eight years running scared, and then last May things started to change. I spent three months without contact with my family (they knew I had gone to a gay event so didn’t want my evil influence around my 11 year old and 15 year old brother and sister). But, even when I was away from the family, I still had a lot of their crazy behavior to deal with.

At first everything seemed grand. I finally was able to breathe. I was living with a friend who I trusted; I had a place where I could finally be me. I was a more likable person, I was freer. I was making friends who actually wanted to hang out with me. It felt good. 

But then, in mid-July, my twin who is now a religious homophobic fanatic started texting me, saying that missionaries had seen me and my friends outside the cinema, outside the restaurant, outside the park, crossing the road … He kept taking tabs on everything I did, and I ended up feeling paranoid. I did not know who these missionaries were but, given that they knew my twin, they could identify me and they seemed to be seeing me everywhere. It got to such a point where I was afraid of walking home on my own, because if the missionaries saw me on my own, they might attack (my twin said that they thought that it was good that the Orlando shooting had happened), and I knew I wouldn’t be strong enough to escape being beaten up. 

On top of this paranoia, I felt sadness of not being able to see my younger siblings and guilt of not being able to tell them why. And my dad was charging me €200 a week for the family summer house even though I wasn’t living there and I was tied to an unpaid internship. I was losing money by being alive.

I also had reconnected with my biological family after seven years but soon realized why the contact had ended in the first place (they were violent and alcoholic: which is why I grew up in foster care). So this caused conflicted sorts of stress. 

On top of this, I had a crush on a guy who I did not want to know about it because, even if he would turn out to be gay, I was not in the right mental space for a possible relationship – but his female friend kept on pushing and pushing at me to reveal the truth. And, on top of all that, it was the first time in seven years that I could breathe, so it was the first time I could pause and see just how damaging my life had been, and in addition I had to catch up on an adolescent’s worth of personal development in the space of about three months.

So of course none of that was easy, but I did feel freer. Away from my family, I could be me. I knew what it felt like to be happy again. I decided, without telling them, that my time as part of the family was over. 

But I decided I would be a good brother and go to my sister’s birthday at home in September. And my little brother’s birthday in October. Then, in November, my mother’s sister died. I had only seen the sister twice in my life so didn’t really know her but she was my mother’s sister – I wanted to be there to support mum. I had to put aside all the feelings I was feeling, I had to suffer the continued oppression, because sometimes there are just bigger things to think about. My mum had lost her sister. I needed to support her. But I shouldn’t have stayed. Yet, then it was Christmas and I needed to be there for my younger siblings.

Now, I am doing an international exchange in a foreign country. I jumped at the opportunity to do it because I knew it meant prolonged time away from my family – without the risk of bumping into missionaries. The guy I had had a crush on had convinced me to pick his city as the place to do it, and when I sent in the email to do the international exchange I didn’t realise I had a crush on the guy, so by the time I found out it was too late.

Yet, when the guy messaged me the week before I was to fly out to the new city, and when we then met up, things were awkward. I was feeling guilty about having pushed him away when his friend kept on trying to get me to admit to having a crush. And I was in a deeply insecure place having just come out of months of repression with my family. So, the day we met up, things didn’t go very well. I pretended everything was okay and life was perfect but he could tell … I wasn’t opening up to him.

So he messaged saying the friendship was over and that’s when I realised I needed to make some changes in my own life. I needed to become freer, to have a clear mind, to live my life – not my parents’.

I told my mum everything and said that, unless she can accept me for who I am and not for who she wants me to be, that unless she can do that, then I’m no longer part of the family. Her next message was entirely unrelated – as though she thought, by ignoring the message I had sent, I would somehow forget about it. Three weeks later, the family keep trying to ring and text but for now I’m sticking my ground. I need to be me – and it feels great. I feel free.

However, it scares me. Part of me thinks I should stay with my family for my siblings’ sake – my sister’s finding the family so hard to handle that she’s actually started cutting herself; and my younger brother will soon be a teenager and it’s the teenage years when things go wrong. I feel like I need to be there for them; yet at the same time, I need to be me.

I can’t go back to that place. It was a foster-family that turned sour.

But that leaves me in a weird place, where I am completely free to live my life – yet it is only “my” life. I don’t have anyone to stay alive for. And I don’t know if I have the energy to stay alive. It’s been a very hard eight years, over a third of my life stuck in this darkness. I’m tired. I just want to fall asleep and never wake back up. I don’t know what to do.

TLDR: I don't have a family anymore and am conflicted about whether or not I have the energy to stay alive."
5vkzr5,624,2017-02-22,It's a roommate story...,XtrCrrclrActvty,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/5vkzr5/its_a_roommate_story/,"**TLDR:** I moved in with three girls, two of which were assholes who antagonized me. The assholes antagonized me and stole my stuff, so I removed all of the furniture from the apartment.
----

I'm writing this in a separate reddit account because my regular account has some affiliation with the university I attended, and I can't remember if one of the people involved has a reddit account.

For my last year and a half of college, I moved in with three other girls, none of which I knew prior (1-year lease). This would be my third set of roommates in the same apartment, as every year I roomed with seniors who would graduate. In general I'm pretty relaxed, and it takes a lot to bother me. I have two rules: 1) Don't be passive aggressive. I can't fix a problem if I don't know what it is, and if you're not going to say anything about it, I will assume it's not a big deal. 2) Don't steal my stuff. Enough said.

Well, fall semester starts. My roommates are fine at first. One of them is involved in a lot of extra curricular activities so I never really saw her. The other two - we'll call them Bitch1 and Bitch2 - slowly become closer to each other. They'd go out and party a lot, stay in party a lot - you get the idea. It was cool though, we had different interests and different personalities, and I don't expect to be friends with everyone I meet. Plus, if I needed a quiet place to study I could just go over to my boyfriend's apartment or find a place on campus. No big deal.

I was very involved in student organizations. I was president of a small women's engineering org that was respected in our department, and I sat on two department advisory councils. During really busy weeks, I would leave my dirty dishes next to the sink so that I could wash them later without impeding other people's ability to use the sink. I also tried to minimize the amount of dishes I used during these times. I'd usually get to them after a day or two. After two consecutively terrible weeks, I came home to find a meme above the sink about ""everyone"" cleaning their dishes. I roll my eyes and do my dishes. I walk over to Bitch1 and say, ""Hey, I know you probably didn't mean to be passive aggressive, but the note you left above the sink makes it appear that way. If I do something that bothers you, let me know and I'll see what I can do to make everyone happy."" She denied that the note was directed at me, claiming that she just thought it was ""funny"". Whatever, maybe she did just think it was funny. Benefit of the doubt.

As the semester progressed, I found more and more notes of a similar fashion.

I had a really difficult semester. A week before my birthday, we had to put my dog down, because she had stopped eating and was essentially starving to death. Then about halfway through the semester, I passed out, hit my head, and got a concussion. I had to take the rest of the semester off, so I was pretty much sitting around the apartment all day. I was really out of it and having trouble remembering to do some things that I would normally do implicitly. At one point, I took a shower and forgot to clean the hair out of the tub (girls shed like crazy) before laying down to take a nap. I woke up a couple of hours later to three notes telling me to clean my hair out of the tub. I was used to the passive aggressiveness by now, and had previously just done what the notes said, because Bitch1 and Bitch2 made it clear that they weren't going to be adults about anything. But for whatever reason I reacted strongly to this. I cleaned up the tub, and confronted Bitch1 who was in the living room doing homework. I told her that if there was an issue she needed to say something, because from now on, I wasn't going to listen to any note that she posted around the apartment.

I took down the notes and threw them in the trash. The next day I found one of the notes pinned to the wall in the common area. This is where they posted things that related to inside jokes between them. It was juvenile humor, but again, it usually wasn't hurting me, so I didn't bother reacting. This time I was pissed. I shouldn't have reacted to the note. That's what made them want to post it.

One of the things that was posted to the wall was an exam that Bitch1 had scored a 100% on that semester. I had a friend who was in the same class come over who recognized the exam, and said that she saw Bitch1 with a copy of the exam before the actual exam. In other words, she cheated, proudly. (Actually, most of the students in her major knew that she cheated on everything. It's what she was known for.)

One of the other things that was posted to the wall was a shirt, which looked awfully like one I had in my closet. I went through my clothes and couldn't find it. The one pinned to the wall was my shirt. Bitch1 and Bitch2 had gone through my stuff.

I started to worry that they had stolen other things, so I looked through their things. I found three of my dresses and a blazer that I use for interviews hanging in Bitch1's closet. In addition, a coat that my mom had gotten me for my birthday, that I hadn't worn yet, was nowhere to be found.

At this point, I am livid, concussed, and verging on tears from shear frustration at my situation. I take my things and put them back in my closet. Eventually, I calmed down. From then on, I started regularly checking to make sure none of my stuff was missing. I just had to get through another semester.

After that initial incident, Bitch1 and Bitch2 began completely ignoring me. They would exchange glances whenever I walked into a room. Even though I knew I didn't matter that they didn't like me, it started to get to me.

The next semester, I was doing twice the coursework to catch up and still maintaining my extracurricular activities. It was really hard and I was so stressed out. I ended up resigning as president of my club halfway through the semester, because it was just too much work. I was miserable, and my boyfriend of six years started stopping by the apartment more to check up on me.

I never asked my roommates if it was okay for him to come over. After all, Bitch1 and Bitch2 would throw parties without telling me or invite strangers over for hookups (no judgment, do whatchya wanna do). I didn't think it would matter. Oh, how wrong I was.

Apparently the only thing that a boyfriend and girlfriend do is screw. I wish I would have known that because during his visits, my boyfriend sat around and listened to me complain about my workload and the roommates who kept stealing my shit (he is the most patient, wonderful person I know).

The day after Bitch1 and Bitch2 threw a party, I came home (I had spent the night at my boyfriend's) to find a nasty note that contained a phrase similar to ""XtrCrrclrActvty, hop off your boyfriend's dick and clean your hair out of the tub.""

I left the note where I found it. I didn't want them to know that I had read it. I got a few things and headed to campus to do some work. When I returned later, there was a note on my door that was much longer than anything Bitch1 and Bitch2 had ever written before. It was an apology from Bitch2's friend, saying that she wrote it while she was drunk and that she understands that I am probably a descent person, she just got caught up in Bitch2's angry rant at the party. I actually cried a little because, this was the first time that anyone had apologized to me for the shitty behavior of Bitch2 or Bitch1, or even acknowledged that they might be shitty people. (Of course my friends knew they were shitty, because I complained a lot. They are also wonderful.)

Later, Bitch2's friend found me and apologized in person. She was very sincere. Then Bitch2 herself came in and apologized, by which I mean she stated that even though all of what she told her friends was true (*what the hell does ""all"" mean?*), she should have had the foresight to throw the note out before I saw it. Also, if my boyfriend could not come over that would be great. That's. Not. An. Apology. Bitch.

At some point I threw a party for one of my friends who was turning 21 at our apartment. I let all of my roommates know, because I didn't want any of them to be surprised if they came home to a bunch of strangers. At one point during the party, one of my friends and I left the crowd to have a serious conversation. We went into my room (shared room with Bitch2) and locked the door so we wouldn't be disturbed. Five minutes into the conversation, Bitch2 is pounding on the door yelling that *her* room should never be locked. (I would like to take a moment to say that there were many times that she had locked me out of *our* room for various reasons, though not for the reason of having a ""gentleman"" caller, for which I wish she would have locked the door.) I get up, open the door, and she starts yelling at me about whatever her rationale for being angry at a locked door was. I let her finish, then she stormed off.

I started staying over at my boyfriend's place from then on. I didn't feel comfortable in my own apartment that I had lived in for three years. I was so angry, but I knew what I was going to do.

The thing about living in an apartment for three years is that you accumulate a lot of stuff. My previous roommates had left me a lot of things. For example, all of the silverware, bowls, dishes, cups, pots, pans, tupperware, the printer, floor lamps, television, television stand, apple tv (we didn't have cable), trash cans, chairs, the kitchen table, the couch - pretty much all of the furniture and tools that they used on a regular basis belonged to me.

It was my turn to be passive aggressive.

I waited for a weekend where Bitch1 and Bitch2 were out of the apartment. Then, with the help of my boyfriend, my mom, and a couple of friends, I loaded everything in the apartment into a UHaul and left.

This happened about halfway through the semester. I felt kind of bad for inconveniencing the third roommate (not Bitch1 or Bitch2), but she was hardly around anyway. The best part of it was that Bitch1 and Bitch2 didn't have internships and had to live there over the summer.

I also had one of my friends report Bitch1 for breach of academic integrity policy. I don't think anything came of it, but just the fact that she was under higher scrutiny for the rest of her time at university thanks to my awesome advisor to whom she was reported, makes me very happy.

I did not return to the apartment for my last semester, and instead moved in with my boyfriend :)

**Fun Extra**
Bitch1 was also my vice president in the student org for a semester. A quick summary:  She was both incompetent and ignorant of her incompetence to the point where it was causing problems for the organization. Using the rules in our constitution, I held elections in what would have been her second semester as vice president in order to replace her. Then she threw a temper tantrum in front of the new officer board. But that's a story for another day."
5vl1vh,2,2017-02-22,"[M4F] Olympus Corporation: Department of ""Internal"" Affairs",MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5vl1vh/m4f_olympus_corporation_department_of_internal/,"Some of you may have read my previous prompts, and a select few of you glorious nutcases even upvoted them. Thank you for that, but now I'm back! There's a reason the signs say ""Don't Feed the Bears.""

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds.

Of course, there are also parties for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box.

Before Obama left office, he designated Bears Ears Buttes as a national monument. 

Nearby Bryce Canyon sent out a tweet that had a blank map space labeled Bears Ears, saying they've been waiting for that day.

Chaffetz, as chairman of the House Oversight Committee launched an official investigation to see whether or not Bryce Canyon had advanced notice as to what Obama was planning. 

Bryce Canyon denies that they did, and says that an intern had just heard a news story and they had an open slot anyway that could be used by another one if Bears Ears wasn't designated.

So, some questions:

What wrongdoing is Chaffetz implying here? What rule or law was broken? Even if the Obama administration did leak something to Bryce Canyon, what would that mean? "

You all have a different view on things and in a way seem like the father figure that a lot of young men, including myself, didn't have growing up so I'd like y'all's advice if you're willing.


**Situation:**

I'm currently about 24 credit hours from graduating in Computer Science. (9 hours if I pass all my classes this semester) Sounds great, except it's not. I bullshitted my way through, had depression since day 1, barely studied, rarely networked, didn't do any internships, etc. Basically failed college. My excuse is never really loving the subject. I have next to no interest in it. The only reason I chose it was because I was told by parents to go to college(If I could go back I'd do a trade), I'm pretty decent with tech(but honestly millenials all are..), and I heard it recommended a lot. Anyways this current semester I'm getting hit hard with depression. I can't even tell you how much classes I've skipped, how much assignments I've turned in literally 1 minute before it's due date, how much studying I haven't done, and how much poor grades I've gotten. If I can't push myself to do those things, how can I expect to 
graduate? 

Honestly the #1 thing I'd love to do would be to just drop out. However I've been told how stupid of an idea that is many times. *But is it really, when my job prospects are potentially nil because of how I've performed?* Another reason why it's dumb is because I legitimately don't know what I'd do otherwise, I have no serious interests, and don't want to be 30 years old still 'finding myself'.  And I'm not sure I'd be happy losing freedom for 4/6 years by taking a military contract.

**Notes:**

- Pretty sure the reason I'm depressed is because I'm in CS/college. So taking meds won't do anything.

- The program isn't hard. Everything makes sense if I actually take the time to look at it. I just don't study(was one of those unchallenged high gpa kids in grade school, fucked me up probably), but if I did I'd probably have like a 3.5+gpa. Currently have 2.5. Right now I'd rather stare at a blank wall then open a textbook or even login to my school account.

So any words of wisdom?

 I can go into more detail if needed."
5vlvd2,7,2017-02-22,I (20F) am not sure if I want to take my long term boyfriend (20M) with me when I transfer schools and move across country.,gatewayrabbit,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5vlvd2/i_20f_am_not_sure_if_i_want_to_take_my_long_term/,"You guys are awesome and have helped me out in the past. I would appreciate some help with this situation. 


I have been dating ""Ben"" for nearly 3 years, collectively. We went our separate ways in high school after 2 years or so, mainly due to our maturity gap. I was ready to start college and internships, and all he wanted to do was play video games, lay around, etc. After a year and a half of no contact, we met up again and got to know more about each other. We had both grown and matured, and our chemistry was better than ever. Nearly ten months later, I am not so sure if this is what I still want. 


I am currently finishing my AA degree and minor, and intend to transfer to an out of state school. I have worked my butt off to make great grades and stand out as an applicant so I am accepted by this fairly competitive school on the West Coast. 

We discussed the fact in the beginning that I will be moving across the country this June, and he was going to come with me. Now I'm not so sure if I want him to. He kinda moved in my apartment after around 4 months and it was great for the most part. When my lease was up, I moved in with my mother so I could spend time with her (and save money) before I moved. Ben came with me. This is where I felt like our ""honeymoon"" stage ended and our problems began. 

Problem 1)        Ben does not work everyday of the week so I usually will ask him to do chores on those days while I'm at school and my mother is at work. He usually sits and plays video games on those days. I ask only two things: take out the trash if its full or do the dishes. Usually I come home to neither of them done, and he gets upset if I ask that he do them in a timely manner. My mother and I do laundry and pick up the house. I cook for both of them since I enjoy it, so when he doesn't do a few simple tasks when I ask it makes me feel underappreciated. This bothers me. 


Problem 2)         Our fights. It will start out civil, then he starts to raise his voice and gaslight me. He also curses at me and gets in my face and accuses me of saying/doing things to him that I haven't done. Or twisting my words where the fight is all my fault. He rips every argument I have apart. I break down and start crying with frustration and he will continue his rant until he decides Its over. He often tells me I need to ""toughen up"" when he calls me names and I get upset. Last week he called me a ""little piece of shit"". To be fair, I have called him an ""asshole"" or ""ass"" before, usually when he is being a jerk about doing chores. When he decides were done fighting, then will say hes sorry, and force me to give him a hug. I usually cant leave the room unless I hug him and act OK. If I push it, that sets him off again into how I'm sabotaging the relationship. It makes me feel awful. He also does the whole "" well if I did ""x"" to YOU, then you would have done ""x"" to me"" thing to justify his actions. 


Problem 3)       He acts like he trusts me, but doesn't. Part of completing my undergrad degree is a junior or senior level seminar class that is basically a study abroad opportunity for a month. He has already told me that he wants to go with me, even though I don't want him to. Plus, isn't it a bit weird to have your SO come with you? PLUS the school wouldn't be able to make accommodations for him, since he will not be a student there, so he would have to come up with the money. 


Problem 4)       Money. I have spent the past four years saving up for my transfer university. I have just enough right now to afford an apartment, the deposit, and the trip up there. He only started working this past year and doesn't have a lot saved up. I get it. But he flat out told me that I would have to fund everything, and he would help where he could. That scares me. I'm scared that we'll get to Seattle (the city im moving to) and I will have to cover everything until he finds a job. Which leads me to...


Problem 5)       He has expressed his desire to go to college, but hasn't done anything else about it. He hasn't looked at many in the area we are moving to, and he told me he wants to work until I get my B.S so he can support us. He has expressed that he would one day like to go into herpetology, which I think is awesome. But, he also told me there are ""no schools in WA state"" that offer a herp. degree. The only one that offers it is in Texas. He expects me to move with him to Texas when he decides hes ready to go to school, regardless of where I am in my education, or in my career. I understand that he is moving for me, but I plan on going to graduate school and working towards a PhD, and I don't want to lose career opportunities if I move. 


Problem 6)        He stopped hanging out with his friends, and doesn't like me to hang out with friends without him. This means that I am nearly the only person he hangs out with anymore, and he always wants me attention unless he is playing his video games. 


Problem 7)        He can be patronizing. He acts like he knows more than me, all of the time, about everything. He is very intelligent, but there are simply things that I know about and he doesn't. When there is a time that I know more about something than he does, he acts like a jerk. Hell, I've worked since I was 14, paid my taxes, bought a car, rented my own apartment and gone to college. He has done none of those things, so when he argues with me over how much we should pay for an apartment in Seattle, it ticks me off. I feel like its really a lack of respect. 


Problem 8)       He believes that every problem we have will magically go away when we are ""finally by ourselves"" when we move. I have argued this, saying that with less money, more stress, and no family to go to will not be any easier. That argument was shut down too. 


Problem 10)       He behaves around my friends, but afterwards is a jerk. We have a mutual friend that has become basically like family. His name is Jeff, hes gay, and he is my absolute best friend in the whole world. He is like my brother, and treats me nicer than most of my family. When he is with us, Ben suddenly becomes the almost-perfect gentleman, helping me cook and do whatever around the house. Once he leaves though, its like all of that was fake. 


Last Problem)     Jeff has asked if he could take the car trip with us to Seattle to help us move. I would love for him to come. He is staying in-state so we will be days drive away from each other and I would love for him to spend the road trip with me. Plus, he is older than Ben and I and has experience moving to and navigating a large city. I haven't asked Ben yet if he could come because I fear the fight that would ensue afterwards. He is going to say that the move is a ""we"" thing, and I fear he will put me in a position where I will have to choose between the two. 


I apologize for the all the text, I kept writing one problem and then another would come up.  I am no saint either, so of course some of the problems are my fault. Sometimes I'm snarky with responses, or I have an attitude. My father died suddenly this past October, and sometimes the stress and grief eats me up and can leave me emotionally unavailable. He can be kind, compassionate, charming, and sweet when he wants to be, but I feel those times are becoming less and less. I'm tired of feeling like his mother and underappreciated. Today he is sick, so I know he will automatically be in a grumpy mood and I will have to tip toe around him. I only wrote the bad about him, and for that I am partly doing him injustice. He does give me money to help with groceries in the house and gas, and he does support my career field and he can make me happy. He loves me and I know that he wants to have a future with me, but I know these problems will get worse once we move. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm tired of my live in boyfriends attitude, fighting tactics, unwillingness to help around the house, disrespect, and the general feeling that im not appreciated. Im moving across the country this June and I am not sure if I want to take him with me when I start the new university. Should I try to talk to him about these issues or just let him go? I just hate the feeling of hurting him and being alone in a big city. "

I've been gazing at the opportunity to work at HubSpot for a while now.
In college, though I did well in classes and excelled in marketing, I didn't have the sense to make friends or climb up the food chain. I'm 24 now, with my colleagues leaving me in the dust - I made no friends, was a part of no clubs, and barely had an internship of merit. However, I am confident in my abilities and know that I'd be a great addition to their team.

But that's not how things work.

I've applied to hundreds of jobs. Written hundreds of custom cover letters. I've never gotten anything...not even an interview, let alone a job. Now I've come to accept it's all about who you know. The challenge here is knowing people.

HubSpot is around the corner from where I live and has a nice open-air lounge area where people chill. I'm wondering if it's totally nuts, or a good idea, to go in during downtime and just walk up to someone who seems friendly/not busy, and simply ask them about working at HubSpot, what they look for in candidates, what their day-to-day is like. It like, sounds sketchy? But I also feel like if I approached the right person it would be totally fine. It's not like I sneak past security... the area I'm talking about, one can just walk right in. Also I'm a nice professional looking young woman so it's not like I'm trying to do anything fishy...

I'm just... all out of ideas.

Money: 
-I have a friend that has a lease there that he won't be using so I can live there for free/very cheap. Im still on the hook for my rent in my college town either way.
-The pay is pretty much the same across all the jobs I applied for. The company seems to be what I might want to do long term with my degree.

I was born and raised in the USA, but my parents come from a southern-European country, where being ""mentally ill"" is not something that's acknowledged. When I was 12, I started seeing a counselor in school who helped me out a lot. After that, I was in therapy for quite some time. The only reason that my parents took me was because my school had reached out to them, but they always opposed. There was even a point in time where my dad offered me money to stop going to therapy.

I was doing better once I got to high school. I had been chubby, but dropped 70lbs. Unfortunately, I developed an eating disorder in the process of losing weight. In the late winter of 2014, something very traumatizing happened to me. I do not want to talk about it on here, but it was very bad, and it quickly affected me. I stopped working out, started eating more, and eventually, over the course of 3 years, gained 130lbs. Those were also the worst years of my life. 

My dad is worse than my mom. He does not believe in depression or feeling anxious. He believes that we create our suffering, and that we control how we feel. My mom believes the same thing, pretty much. 

Aside from a few years ago, I have never felt as depressed and anxious as I do now. I don't want to do anything. I just want to lock myself away in my room. I hate talking to people. The only person that I socialize with is my boyfriend. He is the only person that makes me happy. Aside from that, I feel like my brain weighs a thousand tons. I don't feel empty or sad, I just feel.. I don't know. Unmotivated. Useless. Worthless. 

The problem is that my parents don't understand any of this. Their love is conditional, in the sense that they're only happy with me when I'm being productive. If they see that I'm not, they never talk to me; never try to understand what might be happening. They've tried to help me by making me do things that I eventually stop doing because of depression, and then tell me that I'm a fuck-up. When I try to explain being mentally ill to my dad, he starts to get very angry and tells me that I'm an idiot and seem to think I know what's better for me than he does.

My dad actually just told me that I'm a fat loser who stays at home and does nothing. He thinks that I'm making up all of my symptoms because I can go visit my boyfriend, but I can't manage to go to my internship 5 days a week. I am an intern working with a family friend in the city. It's really hard for me to go because of the commute. It drains me so much and no one believes me. Everyone just thinks that I'm lazy and the fact that I'm fat doesn't help. When I was skinny, I used to skip school a lot because of depression, and no one called me lazy.

I don't know what to do anymore. I haven't gone to my internship in 2 weeks. My dad pays for my car and my phone. I need both of those things. I have been looking for a job, but I can't find one and I don't feel like I could keep up with one. I applied to college and I'm waiting for a response. 

This is a lot of text. I'm sorry. I just feel lost and helpless. I've never felt like cutting off my parents from my life, but I realize that I am the most calm when I am away from them. I understand that they don't want to enable me, and I don't want to enable myself either, but I need help and I'm never going to get it from them. 

I found a therapist, I'm supposed to be meeting with her on Friday, but I don't have enough money to commute to her office so I might have to cancel. I've already tried to end my life twice and I won't try again because it never works. I don't know how angsty this post sounds, or if anyone is going to read this, but if you have, thank you.

I'm trying so hard to lose weight and to do all of these things, but I feel like I'm going to collapse.

5vnnqx,15,2017-02-22,Taking my life back,reubeushagrid,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5vnnqx/taking_my_life_back/,"Hi r/leaves, I've been lurking on this sub for a while now, first time posting, so bear with me. This sub has been so great for motivation lately . I Just wanted to share my experiences and journey with smoking and attempting to quit. I apologize in advance for this long wall of text. 

 I first started smoking weed during my freshman year of college at 18, and have been a chronic user since. I am 23 now. In high school, I was a straight A student, a part of multiple sports teams, clubs, plays, you name it. I had gotten into every college I applied to and was on the quick path to success. Once I started experimenting with weed (and other recreational drugs) as a freshman, my success had halted. I stopped going to class, stopped sleeping regularly, became extremely depressed, anxious, and stuck in a downward spiral, since I would continue to smoke to avoid these feelings and the daunting reality that I was failing out.

 After my freshman year away I transferred home to community college to start fresh. For a short while, I would only smoke on weekends and seemed to have my smoking under control. I never quit or stopped completely though. I managed to do fairly well in the rest of undergrad while smoking regularly and maintained the facade to my family and school friends that I was doing much better than I was. 

This past September, I had started a masters program in my dream career field at an extremely competitive and internationally ranked university. getting accepted to the program at all was a huge shock and accomplishment to me, but in a way I felt like I was able to cheat the system, still smoking weed while being ""successful"" academically and on my way to a great career. I  used weed for reasons many of you have, to avoid my responsibilities and forget all my anxieties. I found myself back into the cycle of avoiding looming deadlines and homework by getting high, and before I knew it I was going out and smoking and vaping every single night when I was supposed to be studying, writing papers, and preparing for my internship. I didn't even enjoy feeling high anymore, it would put me in my head and make me feel down on myself for being a failure and spending all my time and money getting high instead of being productive. But I kept doing it anyway, I was addicted. A midterm essay deadline came and went, and I just didn't do it, I kept putting it off or telling myself I would get high then do it. I knew I was lying to myself. My old habits were back in full force, consuming my life. I would go to work high, smoke in between classes and thought no one would notice. Here I was at a university people would kill to be at, in my dream field, and I was blowing it. I was letting weed take control of my entire life, yet again.

 I somehow managed to get my shit together at the end of the semester and the professor agreed to accept my midterm late and gave me a grade for the course, allowing me to continue on with the program. I can even begin to explain how lucky I got. I felt like a fraud. I'm in a masters program in the mental health/human services field nonetheless and I couldn't even take care of myself. In the day, I was an intern helping people with their problems and at night I couldn't even confront my own. My main friend who I would smoke with daily moved away in January, and although I miss them, this is what helped me to stay on track and be serious about stopping. In the month of February I have only smoked twice, and although it's not completely out of my system and I have caved twice, I already feel so much more clearheaded and driven.

 After smoking daily for so long, I feel like a new person even after this short break. I bought a planner and have organized out my semester. Nights I spent driving around with my friend getting high are now spent with at home with my family and studying for school. I am determined to stop letting this drug control my life once and for all! This sub really does help to inspire me to stay on track and keep me in check when I feel like breaking down. Sorry for my long winded rant/story, I feel like I've been living a double life for so long and needed to get it all out there. "
5vo59l,116,2017-02-22,Currently stuck in hiring limbo because of the stupid polygraph,AnExpertInTheField,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/5vo59l/currently_stuck_in_hiring_limbo_because_of_the/,"So I'm brand new, not only to this subreddit but also to reddit in general so please feel free to point me in the right direction if I've posted this in the wrong subreddit. So let me give a little background. I am currently a college student studying for a degree in computer science. I applied for a summer internship with several companies including a couple government agencies. So the only one I heard back from with positive news was a government agency which you may know from the recent Oliver Stone biopic about a guy who used to work there. (I don't want to explicitly mention the name but I think you can figure it out) They have offered me a conditional job offer. So the ""condition"" is that I pass all of their background investigations. So I had to meet with a guy who took down the names of many of my friends and I had to fill out a huge long form that included every place I've lived the past ten years, any foreign countries I've ever visited, and a lot of other information that basically tells them my entire life story. I completely understand the process so far because when working for the US Government they want to make sure that no one has interests counter to that of the US. So I go through all of that and then I get an email saying I need to schedule a trip up to D.C. for my ""processing"". So I schedule my trip and travel up and in the morning of the first day they do these psychological tests, basically to make sure that I am not a threat to myself or anyone around me. Then in the afternoon I go in for my polygraph. The guy is super nice; he tells me all the questions that were going to be on the test and as he went through and explained each question he asked if I had any problems with any of the questions. Now these questions are all about whether I have any secret foreign contacts or if I've ever committed any major crimes and so I tell him that nothing is bothering me because none of these question are applicable to my life. We go through the testing an he leaves and returns with my results. He said that one of the questions about foreign contacts is bothering so they will reschedule me for another polygraph the next morning. So I come back the next morning and I have a new examiner. The guy seems nice at first but as we begin the test he starts asking me about what was bothering me during the test yesterday and I truthfully respond ""Nothing."" He continues to pressure me and every time I go to say something before I even have a chance to open my mouth he would start shaking his head no; and when I would finish talking he would something to the effect of ""That's not possible. You're lying."" We went back and forth for nearly half an hour before I finally had tears start to form in my eyes. He asked me why I was upset and I said ""Because I'm telling you everything possible and you're accusing me of lying."" This continued for nearly two hours; maybe the worst two hours of my life. Finally he left and came back and said that I had not passed the test. As I was leaving he said that if they wanted me to redo the test they would contact me to reschedule, otherwise they would contact me to drop the offer. So I've been waiting on the sweet release that would come with at least knowing which it is but I grow angrier by the day because I might miss out on an internship because some stupid outdated pseudo-scientific machine said that I was lying when I know for a fact that I wasn't lying. Sorry for this long rant.

tl;dr super angry because the pseudo-scientific polygraph machine might stop me from getting an internship."
5vo6si,451,2017-02-22,"To those who say, ""I came here to see exciting, positive, wonderful, stories about going your own way, and all I see are complaints and negativity.""",DigitalScetis,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/5vo6si/to_those_who_say_i_came_here_to_see_exciting/,"Assuming you *really do* want to see this positive life-affirming advice, self-empowerment stuff, and aren't just saying it to *troll* us, just how do you think anyone gets to that place?

There are tremendous success stories here, great bits of advice, positive affirmations of MGTOW to other MGTOW, and good news of success.  All through this subreddit.  But in order to find these things, you have to first understand what this subreddit is about, and how we go about getting you to where you want to be.

This sub, r/MGTOW, isn't some phony, PR-designed sales pitch to show you the wonderful life you will have if you just take the redpill and go your own way.  If that's what you are looking for, a sales pitch to convince you that we hold the secret to your unlocked potential, a perfectly polished façade that shares stories about bungie jumping, selfie moments, loads of cash, bikini-clad pumps and dumps on beaches, retirements by 40, and all of that crap, go to the PUAs on r/TheRedPill.  They'll give you all the ""positivity"" you want, and it's just as easy as ""up your game bro,"" with a rote list of things you need to do (""lift bro,"" ""STEM bro,"" ""neg, bro,"" ""antifragile bro,"" etc.).  In fact, they are *so into* positivity there, if you even *dare* suggest--even hint--that something is wrong, you'll get called out (""That's not how an alpha talks, bro,"" ""read *Gorilla Mindset* bro,"" ""that's how betas talk, bro"").

If you are a man who needs to be sold on an idea by the number of happy, successful, testimonials made on the idea's behalf, then I am sorry to say that r/MGTOW might not be the sub for you, and that going your own way might not be what you are looking for.  Full stop.  If you don't like the ""negativity"" or the ""hate about women"" or the ""bitterness"" or ""bitching about dating and marriage,"" then I don't think you realize what is going on in here, and why it's *necessary* here.

When you say ""I don't understand how MGTOW is good for men, because all I see are negative threads and complaints about women,"" you are saying something akin to ""I don't understand how this hospital is good for health, because all I see are diseases and injuries here.""

This is a *hospital* for the male spirit.  It is NOT a *hospice* for the male spirit, designed to make you comfortable, like r/ForeverAlone.  Nor is it a *plastic surgeon* for the male spirit, designed to form you into the shape that you aren't, to get you the things you think you ought to be getting, like r/TheRedPill.

This is a *hospital*, a place to heal you and send you on your way.  As such, it is a place where you will see ugly things.  You will see savage illnesses here.  You will see disgusting things here.  And you will see painful things here.  And if you go through the treatment, *you too* might become one of those disgusting things, those savage things, those ugly things.

But those of us who have been around the hospital for awhile, and even some bright young interns who are studying hard, we became *physicians* of the male soul, and you can see the work we do in the threads.  Some of our methods of healing you are, themselves, sickening, disgusting, cruel, and perhaps sad; they involve toxic substances and are unfit to do in environments outside of here.  But they are *necessary* if we are to get you on your way, *your own way*, so you can live your male life in good health from here on forward.  Perhaps you will want to practice here as well, but it is often an unrewarding experience, to be honest.

It's unrewarding for the same reasons psychiatry is unrewarding, or law is unrewarding: we only ever see our patients when they are at their *lowest point*.  When we get them to a state where they can *be* these positive, successful, life affirming and adventuresome people, they aren't here.  They are out in the world going their own ways, without the illness of gynocentric-induced disease weighing them down.  They are free to be the men they *are*, which may differ significantly from the man they *thought they wanted to be*.

See, we aren't in the business of *selling you* on why you should go your own way.  We can't do it, because it is about going *your* own way, not the way of whatever *you think your own way ought to go*.  We can't promise you success, or popularity, or loads of pussy, or any of that.  We can't, because *we don't know you*, and not only that, we aren't even sure if *you know yourself*.

But if it's one thing I know about this sub, r/MGTOW, we have little patience for PR, positivity cults, idealistic notions, or BS.  We are into the *reality* of the situation, knee deep in the bones and guts of it all, and it ain't pretty.  It doesn't always even have a good outcome.

But at the end of the day, we save lives.  And if we get called a bunch of bad names, and cast as a bunch of negative people, posting negative things, so be it.  Because the work we do here is work that needs to be done."
5vohr4,2,2017-02-23,[NEWS][ROLEPLAY] Literacy for the Rural Citizenry,brantman19,ModernPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernPowers/comments/5vohr4/newsroleplay_literacy_for_the_rural_citizenry/,"Fred Matiang'I looked over the education reports from 2020. He had one of the best statistics sheets to show the President comparing 2020 to 2021. 2% increase in literacy rate in ages 15-24 to 93%. An increase of 1% of 83% literacy rate across the entire population. 91% of children 18 and younger had access to primary education while 86% had access to secondary education. By all characteristics, Kenya’s education system had turned around the bend and was well on it’s way towards to full literacy among the entire population with every child receiving full education from the age of 5 to 18. But, this was only the silver lining as the President would ask the hardest question to answer of the Secretary of Education: How can we increase it to 100? Matiang’I had to answer that or it would be better not to even see the President.  
Mantiag’I gathered some of his interns. Bright young minds who could provide a different perspective than the elderly Secretary of Education. Two perspectatives: young and old to decide the education initiative for the next 10 years. Mantiag’I shared his report with the interns before speaking.  
&gt;”As you three can see, we are at a very successful rate of increase. In 10 years, we will hit 100% literacy or close enough that it would make little difference. The problem set before us is that President Kenyatta is going to request how we can take our more than adequately sized education budget to turn that 100% in less than 5 years. We need a 5-year plan to appease him. At my age, I cannot hope to know the newest and latest ways to achieve that so I have called you three in to assist. So any ideas?”  
  
The interns looked at each other and over the reports in front of them. Finally, one of the two girls, Kelsie, spoke up.  
&gt;”Sir, by the look of the reports, it appears that roughly 40% of rural children do not have easy access to schools. Some don’t have a school within 40 miles of them and thus do not attend. That would be a good place to start.”  
  
Matiang’I jotted it down.  
&gt;”Yes that might be worth a closer look in. We seem to be missing about 14% of all children due to rural schools being too few and far between. Any other ideas?”  
  
The only male intern, Richard, took a turn.  
&gt;”Sir, many adults are unable to compensate for the time they missed due to a lack of school availability or regulation. Perhaps we should look into a required adult education program to shore up their reading skills and promote pro-education beliefs so they might pass it on to younger generations?”  
  
Matiang’I again jotted it down before speaking.  
&gt;”Not a bad idea Richard. That might require some funding for teacher overtime for a short time but that will pay off in the long run. Amanda, do you have anything?”  
  
Amanda thought for a minute.  
&gt;”There is but one idea but that would require an increase in industry.”  
  
Matiang’I couldn’t see the connection between education and industry and pressed her.  
&gt;”Amanda. I am afraid that I don’t see the connection there can you explain?”  
  
Amanda realized she was deep in it now and had to proceed.  
&gt;”Lately, video education services has taken an increase. Utilizing wide spread internet usage, student in developed nations are teleconferencing into classes and this is helping cut down on teacher resources. If we had the industry in telecommunications, we could pursue this route. It would take a long time but perhaps it might work towards a long term solution.”  
  
Matiang’I definitely got it then.  
&gt;”So internet education? I knew there was a reason to bring you three in on this. I can’t promise anything on that one but maybe I can help put our budget into the development of such an industry as we finish our rural schools. I think I have enough to take away now. Hopefully you will all hear about this in the news.”  
  
With that, Matiang’I dismissed the interns and started calling for a chauffeur to take him to the State House to meet with President Kenyatta.  
  
_____  
*Kenya Broadcasting Company*  
&gt;President Kenyatta announced a new 5-year plan for education advancement this afternoon. In his announcement, he stated that 500 new schools will be built in the rural areas of the nation for roughly $500 million over the course of the next 5 years. Furthermore, a required literacy night school program will begin in July 2021. This 6-week program is expected to provide the basic education denied the adult population by Kenyan education practices from pre-2005.  
We do not know what else lies in the future at this time but it is apparent that President Kenyatta is shooting for full literacy within 5 years.  
  
_____  
February 2020  
A new 5-year education program has begun in Kenya. 500 new schools will be built in the rural areas of the country over the next 5 years for $500 million. Also an adult literacy program will begin during this time as well.

Working in the ESA has been one of my life goals for quite a long time. I am 22, finishing a major in Computer Science but I already have two years of experience working as a Software Engineer (16 months as an intern and 6 months as a professional).

I received some offers for research internships in Madrid and Cologne but the money they offer is not nearly enough to sustain oneself. I wanted to apply for the YGT but the minimum requirement is having a Master, and, if possible, I want to avoid studying a Master (I believe that the best way to learn is to do so by doing).

So here is my question, what was your level of studies when you first applied to the ESA? Do you think it is possible to get in without a Masters degree?

Thanks in advance."

I've been going to college for ten years, and there's a lot of bad reasons why that's still a thing; especially since I don't have a Bachelors to speak of. I'm in a new school right now and will be completing my first year (with probably two more to go plus summer school). 

I've been living off of financial aid like a fucking idiot because I wasted the first six years of financial aid on nothing. I was a young kid and did not know what to do. I goofed around, failed several years and stopped showing up for some of them.

I've learned my lesson, I'm not here to fix my mistakes, I'm here to ask for advice on what to do next.

I'm quite sure this is my last semester for receiving financial aid, and I'm not surprised in the least. Although on the other hand, I have applied for financial aid again. I'm dead broke all of the time, but here's where I'm trying to change things: I go to school full time, I'm constantly applying for internships (hopefully paid ones), and trying to stay as far away from the garbage food industry jobs I've been tied down to for the past ten years. Most of those jobs could give a rats ass about what you do outside of them, and I've often let them control me because rent has always prevailed as a more important task than school itself.

This obviously sucks, but I've quit my job and have some money in the bank and have been trying to figure out what to do with that. 

Now what I will be discussing next, I need no advice on what I'm getting into other than what I should be doing with the money.... I'm sorry to put it bluntly but this is to try and figure out quickly what it is I should be doing with the money I have now. 

First off, I have about $4,850 in the bank right now, and March's rent is going to be $850. I have no real source of income besides the coins and other crap I sell on eBay; it doesn't come in very often, and I'll also be getting $1000 in cash once we sell my girlfriends home (I helped her flip it). On the other hand, we're having more people move in during March and April, and rent will be reduced to $500 a month which is much more reasonable. And I also have other bills to pay as well...

My roommate and I were thinking of opening up a retail store on Etsy, Redbubble, Designbyhumans, Shopify, and eBay as well to sell some product that we design (I.e. Buttons, shirts, patches, and lapel pins; all of which are somewhat affordable to buy in mass quantity). Our designs are also intelligent, thoughtful, and humorous in many ways. The trouble is starting it, and the fact that we're both scared shirtless of that aspect that we could fail.

So I'm sort of wondering if there isn't some better way of me trying to do something with the money I have now. I don't want to waste it, but I believe it's a decent amount of change that could help me actually do something with so that I don't have to watch it wither away. I know there's no magical solution, but I'm wondering if there are any options I haven't explored just yet. 

I'm willing to hear whatever it is you guys got. I apologize in advance for any grammatical or punctuation mistakes I may have made and can't wait to see what you folks have to say. Please be gentle... if not I guess this is the internet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "

I currently work in computers doing technical and software support but want to get more skills as my first degree was in an unrelated field. I was thinking Computer science as I have a family member doing it who enjoys it, and while I do like working with software, I also enjoy building projects and working on things as well and would like to learn more about. 

I was thinking of Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, And Computer engineering. 


For those of you in hr major, so you work with a mix of hardware and software


Any of you do any internships in the area, and if so were they hardware and software or more so one than the other?



For graduates, did you get a masters or stop with the BS?


What would you recommend?


Thanks all for any help possible. "
5vqbg1,2,2017-02-23,"From the moment he was carved from his mother’s stone, Gor the Ogre lived to paint...",Chinaroos,Chinaroos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chinaroos/comments/5vqbg1/from_the_moment_he_was_carved_from_his_mothers/,"From the moment he was carved from his mother’s stone, Gor the Ogre lived to paint. Inside his bones ran deep veins of imagination that once mined—an appropriate metaphor as ogres are comprised mainly of rock—could be smelted into gifts of wonder. 

That an ogre had such glowing desires to paint was itself a wonder. Even as a pebblish child he delighted in turning crushed ochre and rust-rock from his mothers’s stone pantry into frescoes of the  soaring Chiateg mountain peaks just over the horizon of his mother's cave.  By the age of six, the walls in his mother’s modest two story detached cave were covered in slates depicting bright electrum forests and crashing seas of quartz. For years he was the artist, and his mother the proud patron. Every drawing and painting hung proudly on the walls of her cave, and she took a duchess’s pride in every piece. 

“How beautiful!” she would say, clapping her worn-smooth hands in delight. “My little genius will be painting in the Crystal City someday!”.

No matter how many times she said it, his eyes would twinkle and his tiny chest would puff with importance. The Crystal City! To be a painter living spiraling crystal monolith floating in its thick purplish bath of space and gas would be a dream come true. 

I’m sad to say that Gor woke up from that dream, and the end of those dreams started with his mother’s headaches. 

When Gor was around nine years old the headaches began, and they did not go away. They started as occasional tiredness (and who wouldn’t be tired raising an ogre by herself?), that quickly turned into a daily gauntlet of grinding, sawing pain. Eventually, simply rising up out of bed to make breakfast needed to be counted as a victory. Gor did not learn this until he was older, but sadly he was born in one of those families in which choices need to be made between doctor visits and meals for a week.

All little Gor knew was that his mother was ill, and resolved to cheer her up with his master work—a picture of their happy cave etched in crimson and amber. He paid for the expensive amber with his own salary. For days he ground crimson cinnabar and even figured how to dissolve amber into a golden-syrup resin. He did not realize that he his mother stirred less and less, and eventually forgot that he had not eaten for hours.

It was finished. Gor brought the painting to his mother’s room. 

“Mom! Look what I made! It’s a picture of us! See?” 

He shook her gently. 

She did not stir.

""Mom?”

Gor shook harder. He screamed louder. He dropped his masterpiece on the bedroom floor to shake her, and flakes of amber chipped away from the sun. 

Igneous meningitis—that was the name of her killer. Of course, Gor was too young to understand what that meant. What cruelty it would be to explain that sometimes when an ogre is very sick their crystalline brains can expand like bubbles of magma, pushing against the walls of their skull and…well…

I’m sure you can understand why a young ogre who just lost his mother wasn’t told any of that. 

So Gor left his mother’s cave to live with his father-a gaunt, grim faced ogre with all the charm of a windpocked cliff-who saw Gor’s expression of grief as a waste of perfectly good rock. Rocks were meant for building walls to keep the humans out. Rocks were meant for grinding human skulls to paste right through their stupid tin hats. What spoiled luxury was this where an ogre—his own son no less—could waste precious stone in such a way?

 “Is this what you’re going to do all day?” said his father one day upon seeing his son immersed in an unformed amethyst sunset. 

“Yes’r,” half-said Gor.

“Why don’t you do somethin’ useful for a change,” said his father, “instead of spendin’ all your time scribblin’ like that”

“I’m not scribbling,” said Gor matter-of-factly. “I’m painting a picture of the Crystal City.” 

His father’s eyes flashed. Something in his belly went hot and sick. This was no way for an ogre to speak to the rock that brought him to life. That wasn't how his father raised him, and he sure as the Devil's Dirt wasn’t going to stand for talk like that. He snatched up Gor’s vision with springtrap speed. Crack! Crash! The slate dashed against the cave wall and blasted apart into pieces. 

Gor screamed. Betrayl! Fury! He whipped into a froth of tiny feet and fits, which only made his father angrier. Got found his tantrum stopped as he was lifted up by the the dust of his chin. 

“You. Little. Flint!” snarled his father , showing teeth that were brushed far too little and had begun to flake. “No ogre speaks to me like that. Not in my cave. Not ever!”

Gor’s eyes flooded with fear. “Get off me!” he shouted. 

“No ogre speaks to me that way,” said his father, repeating himself in some kind of furious meditation. “And no ogre from my stones is going to waste his solid years on this idiocy!”

“It’s not a waste!” shouted Gor, every crystal in his body shaking. “You’re a waste! Mom said s—” 

Crack. Gor’s vision went white. He flew backward and slammed against the cave wall. The white background of his eyes was replaced slowly with dozens of blinking stars, and the dark giant which stood behind them. 

So the painting stopped.
    
The day was locked away amongst in the prison where all bad memories are tossed away, and the two never spoke of it again. You may hate Gor’s father, as did Gor for a time. But in truth nobody would hate that day as much as Gor’s father hated himself. Long afterwards Gor’s father sometimes would awake in the deep hours of the morning, his bed slab soaked in sweat, the evil memory dripping like stinking pitch in his throat. 

Years passed and the boy ogre who once painted became a man. Gor left his father’s cave to study Arcane Symbology in the Crystal City—the very city he once painted as a boy

Yet as all young men discover, the gleam of the city does not carry the stink of it’s streets. And they did stink. The Crystal was far too crowded, the food far too bland, and rent enormously expensive. As weeks passed into months, and the months into years, the weight of life in the city began to take its toll on Gor’s body. He became paunchy and often sick; as the weeks went on he noticed his face drooping lower and lower until the sad visage of his father’s face began to carve itself from the rock of his own. 
    
Such is the path of many in the Crystal City, and Gor's path led him in time to Toadwater-Cooper Arcane Scriptures Publishing House Co Ltd, a company that produced magic scrolls for adventurers. Gor knew nothing about magic or adventuring, but luckily the science of magic sigils and signs was almost like a technical kind of magic painting, and so he did well. Not great, but well. 
	
Years passed. He blinked and he was a junior assistant manager. Blinked again and he had become a assistant manager, the droop of his father’s tusks having long become permanent. He was tasked with asssiting the owner and manager of Toadwater-Cooper, Jim Magnusson IV, and he had tasked him with giving a tour of the company for their newest batch of intenrs. Two dozen young men and women of a dozen species, their eyes all bright with forced enthusiasm and fueled by the fear of remaining unemployed forever.
	
""Congratulations on beginning your exciting career at Toadwater-Cooper Publishing,"" said Gor. This was the start of the welcome speech said so many times that his mouth practically made its sounds of their own accord. ”We are very excited for you to begin your career with us in the fast-paced world of scrolls and scroll services.”
	
The interns gazed on Gor with polite, nervous interest. 
	
“Scrolls are different from your average spell,” continued Gor stifling a yawn. “As you know, we provide a reliable supply of scrolls and scroll accessories to adventurers across all known space and time at competitive prices.”
	
The interns suppressed a wince. They knew what “competitive” meant, and it meant cheap. Their pay-scale was also described as ‘competitive’, which in reality meant they would be living six to an apartment and making choices about whether to pay rent or buy work supplies. 
	
The tour progressed into the Scribing Floor—a long and narrow hall filled with quiet cubicles and the wizards who scribbled their life away within. They stopped at an occupied cubicle to see a ‘master’ at work. Pouji the ’Master Scribe’ was a human wizard who looked to weigh nearly three hundred pounds, and quite possibly weighed much more. Each movement of his quill was powered by a strangled, exhausted gurgle of breath, scratching symbols into a nervously thin scroll paper.
	
“What are you working on there, Pouji?” said Gor. 
	
Pouji set down his quill, aware that he was now being watched by twenty pairs of eyes. 
	
“I’m just…uh…” he scratched the back of his head, jowls quivering with the force. “It’s…it’s a healing scroll.”  
	
“Oh,” said Gor. “Mind uh…mind telling us what kind a healing scroll?”
	
Pouji looked at Gor. Then at the interns. “It’s a…um…it’s a Scroll of Minor Healing. Not very complicated but uh…you know…” 

*Please stop looking at me. You know what kind of scroll it is. I make the same thing every day. Just go away and leave me alone.*  
	
Gor recognized the symbols. Chicken scratch glyphs that looked like old scars—the beginnings of one of the cheapest Scroll of Minor Healing a scribe could make. A scroll of that quality could not even stitch together a broken cuticle. If the cheap bastard using it was lucky, he maybe would have few pimples cleared up in a few hours.  
	
Maybe.
	
But Gor had to show the interns. They were the future after all, as he heard thousands of times before. 
	
“Say Pouji,” said Gor putting on his best attempt at a manager’s voice, “Why don’t you show us how you start a new scroll? Show us how it’s done.”
	
With a trembling hand and a retching cough, Pouji laid his unfinished scroll on a pile of unfinished scrolls that soon would become a small tower. Then a large tower in a few days. He reached into the empty parchment pile and was about to begin when a flash of pink light snapped in his face. Pouji jumped. The tower of unfinished scrolls fell, sending papers flying around the desk in a whirlwind of unfinished work. A small scrap of paper materialised in the pink light. 
	
“That’s a message from our manager, Mr. Magnusson.” said Gor. He gave the interns a weary look, becoming painfully aware of his drooping jaws. “You’ll get used to it,”
	
Pouji looked at the paper, which held a single line of blocky script. 
	
&gt;MEETING ROOM IN 15 MINUTES. 
	
Gor sighed and pinched his nose. Why today?
	
“OK everyone,” said Gor as he turned around to face a wall of bored teenagers. “We’ll pick up the tour in an hour. Go to the break room and take a look at the Employee’s Handbook. If you’ve read it already, read it again. Trust me there’s probably something that you missed.”
	
The interns shuffled away silently. Notes puffed into the laps of other wizards down the hall at once. Mild swears and “HUFFS!” fanned through the office like a wave, followed by the shuffling of chairs and gentle muttering of wizards interrupted. 
	
“Great another bloody meeting,” said one wizard. 
	
“I was just in the middle of a Scroll of Inhablational Fortitube! Do you know how long it took me to make that?!”
	
“Yes, like ten minutes. Don’t complain. Magnusson’s stupid note somehow found its way into my ink pouch and now I have to apply for another one.”
	
Slowly and with great pains to spend as much time as possible, the wizards shuffled in to the bare and barren office which for now was serving as a meeting room. 
	
I know you must be upset. These are not the characteristics of wizards! Wizards are wondrous. Wizards are mysterious. Their offices should be filled with candles and dripping wax from magical fires that never burn. The walls should be covered in sigils and flowing ancient scripts set aglow in the light of dreams. Yet instead we see this sad, cold picture of tired people in droopy hats carrying cups of stinking, watery coffee; bleary eyes shuffling around the overly bright, ghastly and garish offices illuminating every crease and crack in tired faces.
	
Tough. 
	
The wizards filed into the meeting room, shuffling to find spots as far away from their coworkers as possible. Gor made his way to the front of the room, making sure that everyone was there. As he counted heads and hats, Pouji squeezed into the room, belching like a sick hippo in between sips of his horrid coffee. 
	
He found himself a seat near the door. A few wizards near him politely but quickly moved their chairs away from his. 
	
Fifteen minutes after everyone had settled in, Mr. Magnusson appeared with a pop and a flash. 
	
For someone with the name “Magnusson”, he was far too short. Barely standing four feet tall, he nevertheless carried the look of someone who dedicated a career doing everything he could to make up for it. He stood upon three inch heeled shoes that stretched his ankles an additional two inches. His robe was loud. His tie was loud. His voice was extremely loud, owing to some enchantments and potions that he jealously kept locked away in his desk. 
	
“Looks like everyone’s here, so I’m just going to get right to it,” he said. A few unfortunate people sitting close to him flinched as his voice boomed across the table, but did their best to flinch as professionally as possible. “I’ve had a look at our numbers for the last fiscal quarter.”
	
Magnusson scanned the room, looking for the right place to drop the hammer they all knew would come. “Those numbers? They suck. They suck harder than a basilisk sucks eggs, and if any of you soft-faces know what a basilisk even is, you have to suck pretty hard to beat a basilisk. 	

His gaze swept across the room. “Anyone have any ideas why that is?”
	
Nobody did. A few wizards found a spot at the carpet to stare at. This was not good. “What Jim is saying,” began Gor, “is that for this quarter just aren't hitting the numbers of some of our competitors.” 
	
“Gor? Gor?” Magnusson lifted up his hand, “let’s take a look at those numbers before you decide to sugarcoat what I have to say. Kay?” He waved his hand. Squiggles began to form in the air, twisted and whorling about like smoke serpents until they formed a snaking line graph. 
	
“See this line here?” said Magnusson as he pointed to a blue train of smoke that zipped up to the ceiling. “That’s Obscurahaus. This line represents the number of healing scrolls sold in the past fiscal year. Take a good look at it. See how it’s very happily wafting up and away out of our ceiling?” Magnusson’s hands fluttered the smoke on its journey upwards, his voice singing with venom. 
	
They saw. Despite their best attempts not to. A feline looking witch near the door cast silent spells under the table to change the color of her nails. Pouji buried his eyes in his coffee. 
	
“Now let’s look at our line. Where is it?” said Magnusson. “Where could Toadwater-Cooper be be on this lovely little graph?” 
	
A thin yellow line of smoke trailed its way far and shamefully below Obscurahaus. 
	
“That’s us.” said Magnusson, a grim smile drawing its way across his beard. “I gotta tell you, I’m not happy about that. And you shouldn’t be happy either.” Magnusson scanned the room, his face curled into a deep snarl. “Toadwater-Cooper has been etching scrolls and sigils for nearly five hundred years and we have never…NEVER trailed so far below in healing scroll output.”
	
Never. That word his the assembled wizards like a brick in the face. A magically enhanced brick powered by nearly NGP50 in potions alone.
	
Magnusson held up a meaty, compact fist. “Healing,” he said lifting up a bejeweled little finger. “Attributes. Transport. Shielding. Four classes. It’s not complicated. It’s barely even magic. Those four classes are our bread and butter, and the table is looking pretty goddamned empty right now.” 
	
He scanned the room. “Questions?”
	
Silence. 
	
Magnusson nodded. “Good. Because there’s gonna be some changes”  
	
He snapped his hands. There was a smell of burning pine and a bright flash of purple light, followed by a horrific buzz that ate its way through your bones. The light blinked away and was replaced by a large dolly on which stood brass orb, roughly the size of a large watermelon. Gor picked up the orb with one hand, and placed it gently on the table for all to see. The orb itself perfectly smooth, save for a cream-colored rectangle just above its center which could fit comfortably the palm of an average wizard’s hand. A long, thin opening opening a few centimeters underneath gave the device a blank expression. It gave Gor the strong impression of an an unfortunate brass cyclops born with a few extra chromosomes. 
	
The wizards peered at the thing. Hushed whispers began to make their way around the conference room. What could it be? Was it a golem? It couldn’t be, golems were far too clumsy to learn the subtle arts of scroll making. And it it was a golem, where were the arms and legs?
	
“This, you jackals, is the future.” said Magnusson.
	
Gor paused, and looked over to Magnusson. His eyes bore down on the gathered wizards with icy ferocity. Magnusson must have noticed because he swung his glance over to Gor. Get on with it. 
	
“It’s called ScrollScribblr,” said Gor. “We did a study on how long it takes for most of you to write a basic scroll,” said Gor. “There are about twenty full time wizards making scrolls for us right now, working about forty hours a week”. 
	
Some of the wizards shifted restlessly in their chairs.
	
“For a basic healing scroll,” continued Gor, “we can produce about three scrolls an hour, or about one scroll every twenty minutes.” 
	
“If we’re lucky,” said Magnusson. His icicle stare locked on to Pouji, who had his coffee mug in one hand and had from somewhere produced a partially eaten breakfast bun. “Pudgy over there produces about one scroll an hour if he’s not scarfing something down his throat. Isn’t that right, Pudgy?”
	
Pudgy stopped in mid sip. Slowly he set his cup down, his face turning the color of bright shame. The wizards sitting next to him did their best to avoid looking at anyone in particular. “I…i-it’s Pouji,” he said to nobody. 
	
“The ScrollScribblr,” continued Gor pretending he didn’t hear anything, “can produce the same scroll in only two minutes, reducing the time it makes to makes the same scroll by over 90%. This tool will increase efficiency and—“
	
“It’ll make us some damn gold is what it’s gonna do,” said Magnusson. 
	
“Yes sir,” said Gor, “but—“
	
“But nothing, Gor. Don’t interrupted me when I’m speaking.” said Magnusson. Veins began to bulge in his forehead. “I’m gonna tell you all quite plainly,” We have tried everything to get results out of you rabbits. We’ve sent you on retreats. We’ve had workshops. Team building exercises. Awards ceremonies. And STILL it takes twenty minutes—TWENTY MINUTES—to make ONE. GODDAMN. SCROLL.”
	
Bam. Bam. BAM. Each word was like a hammer in the ribs. The room seemed to move back a few inches. Soft sobs began to well up from someone at the table, although nobody gathered would dare turn their head to look. Not now. 
	
Magnusson stifled a smile and fixed himself. “Toadwater-Cooper’s shareholders have had it with you animals. They wanted to dispel the whole vision and find better wizards outside the Crystal. But—” he raised a hand, his gesture of authority “—I fought for you. Got you all one last chance. One. Chance. This ScrollSlabber—“
	
Gor raised a meek and respectful finger. “ScrollScribblr, sir”
	
“ScrollWhatever-er” snapped Magnusson, “is that chance. And a word to the wise. Take that chance. Take that chance or pulling rabbits out of your hat is the only way you’ll eat in this town again. Got it?”
	
They did. 
	
Morning sunshine blended its way into the afternoon purple, and the gathered wizards of Toadwater-Cooper did nothing that day save for studying their own brass watermelons helpfully provided by Toadwater-Cooper. Of course there was no manual for the bloody thing. No training sessions, no information slabs. 
	
While the wizards did that, Magnusson had taken Gor aside, waving him over with one of his ringed fingers. They made their way to Magnusson’s office. Magnusson walked slowly, and Gor did his best to stay behind him.  
	
“You’re mopey. Stop it” said Magnusson. 
	
“Stop what” said Gor. 
	
“Don’t play dumb with me,” said Magnusson, “When you’re mopey your face droops like an old rocksack. Cut it out.” 
	
Gor stopped walking. “Jim. You crossed a line today.”
	
Magnusson stopped. He turned around to find an ogre staring him directly in the eyes. For a moment it didn’t matter that he was the boss. It didn’t matter that he had favorable employment laws and a weak economy to stand on. Magnusson was faced with an ogre, nearly three times his height, looking at him directly in the eyes. 
	
“I get that times are tough, Jim. I do. But what could insulting Pouji like that possibly achieve? These wizards are working for you, they don’t deserve—“
	
Magnusson blinked. “Deserve?” 
	
Now it was Gor’s turn to feel afraid. Something about that word made Magnusson’s eyes burn. A note of silence hung between them, broken only by the soft sweepings of magic broom minding its own business.
	
“Question for you, Gor. Your family has owned a small scroll-making company for years. And years before that. In fact nobody remembers a time when you didn’t have that company.”
	
“Jim, I didn’t mean to—“
	
“Just a second,” said Magnusson raising finger. His jaw became steel trap tight. “Now your father-to whom this company WAS his family-gets sick. He begins to forget things. Forgets meetings, forgets his clients…soon he can’t even remember his children’s names. Or his own name for that matter.”
	
Gor chewed his lip on a tusk.
	
“So the time comes,” said Magnusson, “when the company needs to pass on. You don’t want it. You wanted to start your own adventuring company. You’ve been training for it for years. You’ve got the helmets, the axes, the maps…everything you might need to get out from this floating hunk of rock. All of a sudden your relatives come to you with puppy eyes”
	
“‘It’s your father’s legacy’,” said Magnusson waggling his fingers for effect. “‘What about the family’ they say. Your brother’s sends sympathy cards from his shiny new fortress, but does he show his face? No. Your sister? She hasn’t spoken to anyone in years. So guess what! For all the pouting and moaning, nobody’s going to help you and all your dreams are dead.”
	
 “Jim I—“
	
“And then,” said Magnusson, laughing without an ounce of mirth, “after you do the right thing, and everyone’s finished patting you on the back, you find out that this company has been losing money for years. YEARS. Because as your father got sicker, and sicker, the more he just wanted the people he saw as his family to be happy.”
	
Family. Magnusson said the word like it was dunked in bile. Gor suddenly felt like he had swallowed an eggplant
	
“And on top of all of that, on top of ALL OF THAT” said Magnusson, his voice raised and hoarse, “you find out that for years, the people your father saw as his family were taking advantage of him! FOR YEARS! Showing up to work late! Working whenever they felt like working. Pouji has barley written his own name because ‘Ol’ Magnusson’ just wanted you to do your best. And if your best involved taking two hour naps in the break-room? WELL THAT’S OK, GOR! THAT’S OK BECAUSE HE’S DOING HIS BEST!”
	
The halls carried the ghosts of Magnusson’s voice down the hall. If anyone had heard, nobody acknowledged it. Magnusson rubbed his face, nearly out of breath. His face was read and stained with sweat.  
	
“So tell me, Gor. Did I get what I deserve? Do any of us get what we deserve?!”
	
Gor had no answer. Only a sudden urge to reach down and clasp this man on his shoulder, a man who barley gave him the time of day unless it was work related. “Jim…” he said, “if it helps…I understand”. 
	
With a snort, Magnusson brushed away Gor’s hand. “I don’t pretend to know the lives of the people that work for me, Gor. Don’t pretend you know mine.”
	
Magnusson walked away, tearing little chunks from the side of his beard as he went. Gor watched him go, a haze creeping upon over his mind like a stinking coal fog. 
	
Pouji did not return to work the next day. Or the day after that. None of his coworkers noticed, or if they did it was less important than learning how to work the ScrollScribblr which now sat on their desks in lieu of parchment. After a few days Magnusson curtly made an announcement that Pouji had decided to leave the company and would not be returning. A few interns made dark jokes of whales jumping off Crystal into the Unknowable Below. When Magnusson heard, he promptly had them dismissed. 
	
Gor walked by, pretending to be a manager, when he passed Pouji’s now empty cubicle. He felt himself sitting down at his chair, the ScrollScribblr sitting on his desk already beginning to collect a fine layer of dust. 
	
Gor gently pushed the orb out of the way and picked up a loose square of parchment. He reached for a quill, and dipped it into the ink pouch. Slowly, his hands began to draw circles, outlining the shape of a cave. In the background of the cave. In half-dried ink, the peaks of Chiateg Mountains were born again from the well of his memories. 
	
A passing intern stopped by, and saw that Pouji’s desk was occupied. “Hey you must be the new—oh, Mr. Gor! What kind of a scroll is that? It’s beautiful! I didn’t know you could do that!”
	
Gor did not turn. The quill flashed across the scroll. The scroll’s cave appeared to glow from inside. A sun seemed to shine over his mountains. Tears began to well in his eyes, and his drooping face slowly curled into the beginnings of a smile. "
5vrdt7,2,2017-02-23,[SP] S-5 P.O.L.A file,AdventureHunters2013,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/5vrdt7/sp_s5_pola_file/,"Titled: the Deathly Artist Girl
Submitted By: Agent 62, Alan Voss
Types: Human, Curse, Art
Date Submitted: 1/17/[REDACTED]
Status: Unsecured/2   (UPDATE) Deceased

The Girl was confiscated from AAC (Academy for Abnormal Children), and taken into POLA custody in a raid on a AAC facility.

The Girl, is an extremely good painter, especially for their age, 11.
Whenever the girl is asked to paint a portrait of any person, as long as she can hear their name and have a picture of the person, she will paint them.

Whenever she paints the portrait of the person, she will paint a death scene, in which the subject will have died in some way.
(noted, it's unknown if she realizes that this is an abnormal thing to do, farther research required.)
Once the painting is done, and the person requesting the painting has seen the painting, the person that was painted as dying in the scene will die as the painting displays within 24 hours.
(noted, it appears that the Girl is unaware of her abilities, restricted from continuing research.)

Upon taking the Girl into POLA custody, the Girl's parents had to be silenced, do to them being aware of her capabilities.
The Girl was assigned to be under the supervision of Dr. Albert, an intern at the time.

Dr. Albert was given permissions to experiment with the Girl's abilities by the [REDACTED] of [REDACTED].

Dr. Albert conducted the experiments as follows:

Subject requested a painting of his face, once the Girl learned his name and had acquired a picture of them sleeping (without their knowledge), she painted a picture of him (finishing 3 days after requested.) but with blood flowing from his eyes, nose, mouth and ears.
The Subject came back whenever she finished the painting, excited to see the painting.
Subject was frightened from painting and left quickly, however, there was a radiation leak from the Irradiated Girl (see appropriate file for more information) causing him to have blood coming from each of his orifices until he succumbed to his radiation poisoning.

Subject selected was a Rogue Agent, without his knowledge.
Girl was given photo of him sleeping and his name.
Girl painted a picture of him playing a guitar and him as an old man who died from cardiac arrest while playing his guitar.
(noted, she was not informed that he played the guitar, farther research required.)
Subject was mailed painting, upon receiving painting, he did not recognize the older version of himself, and later was found dead as in the painting.

Subject's information was given to the Girl, and she painted a picture of him bursting into flames.
Upon seeing the painting, the Subject burst into flames, suspected to be due to spontaneous combustion.
(noted, upon seeing this, it appears that the Girl is beginning to understand why it happened.)

(UPDATE)
Dr. Albert went rogue and locked himself and the Girl inside her containment unit, holding her at gunpoint and warning Agents that approached the door that if they opened it, it would be the death of the Girl.

He told the Girl he wanted one last experiment, and instructed her to draw herself.
However, the Girl knew what he was up to and began to paint herself, but also painted Dr. Albert into the painting, as she had seen him sleeping in the observatory chair before.

They were locked in the room for 2 and a half days.
Whenever she finished her painting, she turned it around to show him.
It was a painting of her laying on the floor next to a painting, with a bullet hole in her head, and Dr. Albert was splayed out on the floor, with blood seeping out of the many bullet wounds he had covering his body.

This startled Dr. Albert and he shot her in the head and she fell out on the floor, dropping her painting next to her.
The Agents waiting outside the containment cell burst down the door and starting firing upon Dr. Albert, who procured many bullet wounds before falling to the floor, limp and lifeless.

I was reeling from a horrendous breakup and she had just gotten with a new boyfriend. We started talking and seeing more of each other, then one night we were watching a movie and having a few drinks and jumped each other (she was still dating the other guy at this point).

Well, she dumped him within 12 hours and we've been seeing each other ever since. Not steadily, I might add: I have broken up with her 3 times, citing my need for space and time, which was true, but we always ended up back together after a week or two. The last time that happened was in July 2016, so it's been seven months now that we've been steady and I really enjoy our time together.

Between rehearsals, sharing a few classes, and living close by, we are able to see each other fairly frequently (at least once a day). We are very much in love, have sex like rabbits, and share lots of friends, both from the theater department and elsewhere. We go out and have active social lives (both together and separately). I'm a fairly active stoner and while she doesn't smoke, she not only accepts but appreciates that I do (the high sex is fantastic for her, she says, and I make funny comments while high).

Here's the problem: we're both graduating at the end of the semester. I have an engineering job far away from the university, and she's going to Africa to study abroad over the summer (2017) and (possibly, she hasn't heard back from the company) has an 8-month internship teaching English to kids in France. I've been trying to think about whether we should stay together after graduation, and we've talked about it at length (with many tears on both sides). I have weighed the pros and cons (as I can see them)...

Pros: I love her lots. She speaks French, and we both have dreams of living in France some day. We both love literature. We make each other laugh, and we feel safe and comfortable with each other like I've never experienced before. We both love dogs.

Cons: I'm moving to a new city, where I know nobody, and haven't been single for more than a month in the past 3 years. Part of me wonders if I can make it on my own, and I like the feeling of independence that being alone gives me.

Reddit, what should I do? I don't want to cling to a college relationship because I'm scared of new things or loneliness, but I also don't want to throw an amazing girl to the side and miss out on what could be a great future. What do I do?
  
---   
tl;dr: Girlfriend and I are graduating from college, should we stay together?

EDIT: We've decided to break up come summer, and if she's back in the states at any time and wants to see me, she'll know where to find me. But I'm not counting on it and will work on moving on. Thank you for all your kind words and advice!"
5vrxes,1,2017-02-23,[US] May I please get some advice from you guys?,throwmefaraway1188,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5vrxes/us_may_i_please_get_some_advice_from_you_guys/,"I want to preface this by saying that it's a long post, but I'm not really sure where else to turn..so if I can have a few minutes of your time, I would appreciate it immensely.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm currently in my last semester of grad school for a MAcy and preparing to sit for the CPA, but my only experience consists of:  
&amp;nbsp;  
* Working in a small, family business for the past ten years; giving me trivial accounting experience  
&amp;nbsp;  
* A three-month internship for a regional company in another state, which focused on preparing reports for the CFO, capital budgeting, investment analysis, etc.  

&amp;nbsp;  
Business got pretty tough for my family a few years back, so we had to cut a lot of people and I had to pick up a lot more hours. This made it incredibly difficult to do well in school; as such, my GPA has always hovered around 3.0. I told myself grad school would be different, but it's the same situation.  
&amp;nbsp;  

As for the internship, my uncle worked for a PE firm and they placed him as CFO of an acquisition, so he picked me up to help me out in my summer before grad school. He's now a partner at the firm, so he can't place me anywhere being this inexperienced; but has offered to pass my resumé around once I graduate and get certified.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Recently, my wife and I decided to split, so I feel like I'm at a crossroads: the internship made me decide I like finance a lot more than the accounting side of things. While I've always been on the path to audit, it's only because I feel like it has more opportunities than tax, which is the area of accounting that comes most naturally to me. I've also always wanted to get into law and have begun to fantasize about doing that now that I'm single again; however, I'm quickly approaching 30 and am aware of the commitment/current-job-market for new law grads.  
&amp;nbsp;  
At this point, I can't/haven't been able to land a real internship because of my GPA and that scares the hell out of me because I'm going to be looking for a job in a few months. Although I want to move into finance, my advisor suggested MAcy&gt;MBA since it would give me the ability to earn my CPA and keep my BBA in Accounting from being a waste of time. Then, once I get a job, I could get into the management side of accounting and work my way into finance.   
&amp;nbsp;  
What would you guys do at this point? Staying in the family business is not an option as I am ready to leave this town..especially after the divorce. Should I trudge on and get the CPA, blindly hoping it'll help me land a job? And even then, what about the required two-years of experience (TX)..how's that going to go if I can't get a job? Should I start looking for finance-side jobs when I graduate? Should I move to another country where it might be easier to land a job with this shit-GPA? Even all the postings for accounting jobs on my university's career resources page require a minimum-GPA just to be considered for an interview. It's starting to feel like I'm in this huge, cosmic joke, where I got a respectable BA/MA, yet can't do anything with it.   
&amp;nbsp;  
I would like to add that I understand the GPA's use in selecting interns/job-applicants..but at this point, you would think if students could make it through graduate school, they must have some idea of what they're doing. I learned from that internship that I can pick anything up, so I know I'll be able to perform anywhere I get hired..it's just a matter of somehow being a better applicant than the millions of others with better GPA's and experience.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Thank you for reading this stupidly-long post..I don't have anywhere else to turn right now and I really appreciate the time/help from people that know a hell of a lot more than I ever will. From the bottom of my heart, I really appreciate any advice/recommendations/admonitions that anyone is willing to give.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Thanks!

I'm an engineer and huge fan of developing with Ruby on Rails and I'm looking to continue my journey by professionally developing in a remote position. 

I have a **BS in electrical engineering** and attended a code immersion boot camp when I realized I wanted to learn more about web development. The boot camp team enjoyed my work and attitude so much that they later invited me to become a **full time instructor**, where I had the pleasure of teaching aspiring programmers get from ""never coded before"" to building their own Ruby on Rails web apps, knowing JavaScript, and other technical skills! It was an awesome experience and I still look for opportunities to help those that were once in my position. 

I have experience being a Ruby on Rails developer for a large app in a startup company and building multiple personal projects that I deploy on Heroku. On the side, I also run my own company where my goal is to simplify people's lives with technology by helping them with website design + creation, IT / networking, and electronics repair. 

Other useful skills include **version control (Git)**, **JavaScript** (with some small experience with React), **Heroku deployment**, **Linux / DevOps**, and my ability to constantly be curious about what's to learn and do what I need to do to accomplish my goals.

While I will never claim myself to be *""The Best Rockstar Programming Ninja!""*, I can confidently say where I have my success is due to my drive to continually improve and deliver happiness to customers. And I want to continue that by doing what I love in a great, challenging environment with great people. 

I dislike trying to define this myself but consider *mid-level* to be the most accurate to describe my skills. I am seeking a junior to mid level job but even an internship or apprenticeship would be awesome because it would still provide me with some great learning opportunities. Honestly I am open for any discussion on any position you have in mind. 

Thanks for taking the time to read such a lengthy post and I'm looking forward to hearing your opportunity! Even if it isn't for a job, like you're interested in being a mentor for a **go getter** or just want to drop a line, I would seriously appreciate hearing from you! I can send my resume, personal profile page, and LinkedIn. 

Cheers,

A Hungry to Grow Developer, Eager to Join a Great Team

**TL; DR**
Experienced engineer seeking a remote job (consider myself ""midlevel"", so a junior to mid level position is perfect, intern or apprenticeship is awesome too because I'm more interested in learning and doing what I love than what my title is). Deployed multiple projects and have taught full time classes and workshops on web development and Ruby on Rails. Have been complimented by many managers / team members on my attitude and ability to work well with others and get the job done well. Would be happy to talk and share my work experience. Or even just chat, share some tips, receive some help, etc. Can send resume / profile page / LinkedIn upon request. Have an amazing day!

5vt4fw,2,2017-02-23,[M4F] A Society of Good Breeding,MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5vt4fw/m4f_a_society_of_good_breeding/,"Some of you may have read my previous prompts, and a select few of you glorious nutcases even upvoted them. Thank you for that, but now I'm back! There's a reason the signs say ""Don't Feed the Bears.""

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds.

Of course, there are also parties for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box. Inside are forms for entering the information you just so painstakingly wrote down, but you figure you should do this the right way. The contents are odd, but they are all within reason for a company attempting to isolate strings of beneficial human DNA. Even if they do get awfully personal with fertility, hey, people have to reproduce, right?

Reading the form, it is as follows:

INTERESTS: *Let the Facility know about who you are as a person! We would really like to get to know you, and anything you want to tell us will help make your experience with us more comfortable and enjoyable!*

OTHER INFORMATION: *If there's anything else you think the Facility should know, please use the provided space.*

GOLDEN GENES PHOTO CONTEST: *As a special promotional offer, the Facility is running a photo contest! This contest is open to the general public, regardless of application intent or status, so get your friends involved! Insert the probe, get creative with the temporary tattoos, and snap a pic while testing your fertility! Please make sure the display of the instrument is visible in the picture.*

*Prizes will be distributed for Sexiest Pic, Most Fertile, Best Preggo, Most Creative, Best ""In Progress"" Pic, and Freshest New Mother. These prizes consist of $1000 dollars cash, a guided tour of the facilities, and a Gold Reproduction Package including a session with one of our top quality donors. A Grand Prize will be given out for Best In Show, an honor reserved for the sexiest, most fertile, most creative, and above all most breedable gene carrier that sends in a picture! This Grand Prize consists of $10,000 dollars cash, a private jet and limousine to and from the Farm, a private behind-the-scenes tour of the Farm facilities, a private interview with the Director himself, and a Platinum Reproductive Package including lab-grown custom semen and access to our state of the art equipment! Grand Prize Winners will also be invited to stay the night in one of our luxury suites!*

*Prizes must be accepted in full; individual components may not be turned down at the discretion of the contestant winner. Participation in the tour is not required for the cash prize. Every prize is available to the general public; application not required. (I'm not asking for a real picture. Just tell me about how you made the picture, if you are interested. I'm just trying to get a grip on what you like. Feel free to add a real picture of some sexy little breeder, but tell me how you made it! That's how I judge whether or not we'll click!)*"

Anything would help I'm just trying to identify as many strategies as I can to improve my personal situation. I currently am I second semester Freshman at Penn State - University Park as a engineering pre major intending to study computer science. I chose this school almost entirely because of its reputation in the field of computer science and its notable social scene. Academically, I have done relatively well for an engineering student (for those of you who understand how difficult this is!!) but I have almost no social life and simply put, have grown to hate being here. I have tried to seek involvement in Greek Life and club sports and have been denied both semesters. Despite the academics, I am paying far too much to find no enjoyment here. At the same time, the location is not ideal. There is little to do and I am seemingly in the middle of nowhere. I am out of state and pay around 50k a year to be here. For these reasons I've started to discuss the possibility of leaving. I live in New Jersey so in state tuition at Rutgers is very alluring as is the reputable computer science program, but I had considered Rutgers prior to accepting my offer at Penn State and was less than satisfied by the deteriorating campus. The school however is in good proximity to NYC for internship opportunities which is also alluring. It is on the list of potential schools. If anyone has experience there, can you comment on the Greek Life and or club sports (soccer specifically)? Another option I have is Temple. It is in a prime location close to home for me and in a city where I would be able to seek internship and employment. The reputation of the computer science program is not quite as good but still prominent especially in the Philly area. If anyone can comment on engineering and computer science at Temple, is it good? Temple is also very similar in price to Penn State, maybe a little less, but location may warrant the price. Can anyone comment on the Greek Scene or club sports? Anything would help, these are the 2 things I'd be most inclined to be involved in though. Any opinions would be appreciated. Even other schools I have not mentioned that may be good ideas. I'm not entirely opposed to staying at Penn State but I would definitely like to improve my situation which is becoming progressively more and more difficult. Thanks"

I likely wouldn't take the offer, as the pay will likely be comparable and in a less desirable location, unless they blew me away.

I'm currently looking for a junior position in the creative department. I've done two internships and did 10 months of experience between the two. Now I think it's time to find a junior position and that's what I'm doing.

One of the agency I wrote to just replied to me and said they're willing to hire me and that they would like to see some samples of my work.

Now the thing is this: I've never really worked in the creative department during my two internships. I don't have proper ads to shows.

I'm really visually oriented, though. I do photography and I can show lots of work in that regard. Don't really know if they're interested in my photographs. Maybe my visual style might appeal them?

It seems to me that they do mostly video (from their website). Maybe they'll be willing to invest in me if my visual stile (even if it's photography) will be considered good enough? Don't know!

Should I maybe work on some ads by using my photographs?

What should I reply?

The GOP was ever-bitter about the New Deal, about America's strong labor unions, and increasingly (and ironically, given its 19th century history) Civil Rights.  They craved power but could only chip away at the towering American society they despised.

But then came Ronald Reagan, proudly contemptuous of this nation's achievements and values, and substituting in their place a bunch of hollow taxidermist rhetoric.  Democrats worked with him despite his nuttery, but it was not mutual.

George HW Bush followed.  Democrats worked with him - it was not mutual either.  But seemingly to their own surprise, Democrats retook the White House from HW Bush, and waited for Republicans to work with the Clinton administration.  Nope.  It was all-out propaganda war from Day One.

They blocked appointments by default, spewed unhinged lies through their radio monopolies, and brainwashed their followers to the point where their cultist disciples believed simultaneously that Bill Clinton was (1)a feckless hippie and (2)a raving Communist maniac on the verge of sending the ATF to Waco them.

The loss of 18 soldiers in Somalia was treated as a greater scandal than when Reagan threw away 200 Marines in Beirut - a scandal that barely anyone remembers because Democrats had stood for American interests over partisan gain.

Republicans spent $90 million in taxpayer dollars on a vast, sweeping investigation of every aspect of every life with even the remotest connection to Bill Clinton and found...nothing.  But then years later an intern blew him, so IMPEACHMENT!  Bill's blowjob right up there with Nixon's attempt to overthrow the republic.

But then they rigged a presidential election in 2000, committed more crimes than can be counted in a reasonably-sized post - including torture and starting a war that killed 5,000 Americans - but they refused to even investigate it.  Democrats were completely shut out of it all, and yet even then they were cooperating with these lawless pigs. 

Democratic leaders were using words like ""misguided"" to describe fucking WAR CRIMES for which enemy generals had been hanged by Allied tribunals in WW2.  They were STILL acting as if they had a partner in government in the GOP, despite constant proof - not evidence, absolute PROOF - to the contrary.

Then Obama is President and the GOP reverses course 180 degrees yet again.  From ""it's not illegal if the President does it,"" they reverted to the ""destroying the Democrat is more important than serving America"" that they held under Bill Clinton.  Most unhinged campaign of hate ever waged and yet virtually zero scandals held.  

Now they won't even investigate an open traitor who is in blatant violation of even the most plainly-stated rules of the US Constitution.  

Ladies and gentlemen, **there is no Republican Party**.  There is no group of political ideas with that label any longer.  There is a hate group and a criminal syndicate that does not believe in or support the concept of laws, or facts, or rights, and that is what's left of the GOP.

They do not recognize your right to exist, to vote, to speak, to do anything they have not commanded you to do in their own interests.  They are tyrants with no redeeming value, and they have zero worth in this country any longer.

Democrats in office, start governing like you are what you already know you are: What remains of a law-abiding government in the United States of America.

And start treating Republicans like what they are: Nihilistic insurgents and vultures tearing at America's flesh, sneering at America's suffering, and longing for the day when there is no longer a free country looming over them making them feel as inadequate and unworthy as they are.

There is no longer any room for appeasement, and no more time for umpteenth-chances for America's internal antagonists.  Republicans chose sides against this country a long time ago, now just fucking fight them.

And what's more, fight to win.  As if you understand that your own careers are the least of what's at stake.

One of the things that stuck this week is Oregon has a 1.4 billion deficit it's trying to resolve with such ideas as taxing coffee by 0.05 a lb or taxing people who own cars older than 20 years by 1000 for every 5 years it exceeds the 20 year limitation. Essentially  really ridiculous tax bills. 

Now I think it would be reasonable to say this deficit is ridiculous since we have a new source of tax revenue from recreational marijuana that did not exist all that long ago.

It seems to me like Oregon state spends money on who knows what way faster then they make money and they are constantly trying to increase the budget.

What steps can a person make to try and heal their states finances? 

Is there anything reasonable I can do to call attention to this? As it appears my state should have some fiduciary duty to do right by my statesmen instead of bleeding is in taxes. 

I assume most people will respond with vote for a different governor. Unfortunately this is not a valid option. What I'm looking for is a reasonable solution which wouldn't eat up massive amounts of my time so that i can continue to build my credentials and provide for my family. 

I appreciate any and all input, thank you for your time."

Some background info: my gf and I are currently in our second year of university. We met in September as classmates and became good friends for a while, until we got together in the beginning of December.

My gf already got accepted to an exchange program to Spain from mid-September to end of January, while I might go on an exchange program from early January to mid-May. Due to this, we may not be able to physically see each other for about 8 months, and I'm getting anxious about it.

Another thing is this coming June, right after our finals, she'll be travelling with her friend to Malaysia for about 2 weeks before her internship starts mid-June. Meanwhile, I will have to fly to Canada for a few weeks in June as well to visit relatives and participate in a competition, before coming back and starting an internship as well.

Before her exchange starts though, we're planning to travel somewhere in Europe together, and the duration of that depends on when our internships end (most probably by mid-August). That's something I'm really looking forward to, but I don't like thinking about the fact that this summer, we might not see each other that often due to our own travel plans and internship, and then the whole exchange thing.

I've already talked with my gf briefly about it, but I don't want to bring it up too much because I don't want to come off as overly attached, especially since our relationship is still relatively new. And of course, I don't want her to not do anything just because I'll miss her, since I know it might build resentment on her part, and I also want her to go and experience new things.

I guess it's just me feeling worried about how much I'll miss her, or the distance drawing us apart since I get scared that she'll see it as more of a chore, but I'm willing to go with the LDR because I'm pretty much in love with her, and I want to see this whole period as a time we both can grow together.

How do I deal with all this? I really want the relationship to endure the distance, and I know it's still a while before it happens, but I get a bit sad thinking about it

Edit: we also might be taking up research or internship programs for a while next summer too, so basically the next academic year might yield just little actual face-to-face time"

So my credit history is 2 yrs 9 mos. old and based on credit karma, my transunion and equifax score are both 689. A couple days ago I finally paid off both of my credit cards (Discover and AmEx) totaling $3K. To make sure I stop using the cards, I had my mom hold onto them while I'm in school. I'm expected to graduate in the spring of 2018 and I don't have any jobs or internships lined up yet.

I've been following this sub for awhile and I've been really encouraged to see how helpful this community has been to its members. In that spirit, I would really appreciate any tips/advice regarding paying down student debt, fiscal planning, investing, etc. So I guess what I'm basically asking for is a 'start-up kit', so to speak, because I'm admittedly a novice when it comes to personal finance.

As for my current living situation, I'm living off campus in a shared house where my rent is $509 all-utilities included; and I signed up for a meal plan at my university (included in student tuition) of which I have about 60-70 meal swipes left. In terms of savings, I have none. I still ask my parents for money when I need it to make small purchases: occasional dining, coffee, etc.

I'm 22 years old, have an internship at a mobile app development company. Great company, nice people, i have the opportunity to learn a lot, but i'm just not motivated. I've been working there for about 2 months now, and already called in sick for 2 weeks. Maybe it's because i don't get paid, but it shouldnt matter, it's required to complete my study, i shouldn't be that hard.. it's only 6 months.

Next to my internship i have a part-time job to make some money, it's not much but i can save up to eventually rent an appartment with my girlfriend. So i work 6 (sometimes 7) days a week, 8 hours a day and travel for 3 hours every internship day. Whenever i get home it feels like a hurry, quickly do my daily gaming things that i want to get done and get to bed cause my alarm for the next day goes at 5:30 again.

This week i called in sick again, i felt a bit under the weather and maybe i should've stayed home for 1 day or so. instead i've been home since Tuesday (Friday now). Every morning has been hard to get out of bed, I just didn't feel like it.

This morning my father called me weak, i'm done with it... i don't want to be weak but it's just so hard to wake up and do what i have to do. i'd much rather stay at home and play v, hide myself from the real world. Not having to socialize with real people, having to put on the face again that i'm enjoying working on the project they gave me. While i'm just browsing reddit and watching youtube clips.

How can i survive like this, no company would want me if i call in sick every other week. I'm scared that when i'm done studying i'll have the same problem, not being motivated to work everyday, calling in sick every month for a whole week.

I'm just done with it, i don't want to be weak anymore and i don't want to be unmotivated. I have no idea what to do at this point to motivate myself to get to work and no faith in that i can bring up the motivation to work 5 days a week for the rest of my life."
5vwojt,1,2017-02-24,My date/gf [F22] told me [M23] she'd like to take a step back and get to know each other better.,Darmvlinder,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5vwojt/my_dategf_f22_told_me_m23_shed_like_to_take_a/,"Hey there.

I'm just going to start with a quick rundown of the situation. I got out of a 2,5 year long relationship last October. The whole breaking up, in itself, was horrible and soul rending. It probably went in the messiest way possible.

After the initial weeks following the breakup, I started swiping on Tinder again. Fixing some hookups here and there, which were fun. But only filler. And I always told my hookups this (I'm a really transparent kind of person) and they didn't mind.

The day after a disappointing date, I swiped another girl (my to be SO) and we started talking. Immediately I realised that there was something about this girl that was different. I found that the conversations we had were very tender and sweet. And very corny sometimes. But it felt pure. I terminated all other hook-up contacts because I wanted to focus and be exclusive to her for at least this while.

She came out of a long-term relationship as well, which ended around the time I got broken up by my ex. Her relationship lasted over 6 years, though. She told me very early on she is over her ex, but is still friends with him. I am inclined to believe her since she does not give off the vibe of a ""game-player"". So I rolled with it.

We went on several dates, I tried to keep the rushing at bay beccause I wanted to do it right and approach it with a clear mind (I fucked up in my last relationship from time to time).

Then we started meeting up regularly. She lives on the other side of the country so I regularly did long drives to go see her. It all accelerated rather quickly. We kissed, had sex, started hanging out more. We had our ""little things"", little nicknames and all that stuff. I sometime cooked for her, drove her and visited her at work. I found that I was investing myself emotionally but not too much. 

This went on for about two months, eventually I told her I wouldn't mind being boyfriend/girlfriend at that point, to which she replied she doesn't either and she'd like to be a couple.

Soon after, her school started and my internship did too. There was less time to physically see each other. Usually only one day over the weekend.

Then we were suddenly chatting (we texted a lot since the distance) less and more distantly. The last weekend I went over before we 'split' there were some awkward moments. Like when I visited her during her lunch break, she got distant.

Fast forward to several days ago, I asked her about the awkward moments. I wanted to know if there was something wrong. Eventually we started talking about the elephant in the room.

She says she find herself 'too emotionally unavailable'. She finds it hard to fully emotionally connect to someone right now. I assume it has to do with the fact she came out of a long relationship not too long ago, and that our relationship went so fast. She says she always has a blast with me, finds me cute, finds me very physically attractive. But she cannot seem to figure out the emotional part at this moment. She used the wording ""I find myself emotionally unavailable and I lock up and it annoys me and I don't know why"".

She suggested to ""take a step back and get to know eachother better first"".

However, this sounds ambiguously vague OR implicitly permanent to me. So I initially told her I do not want to participate in any of these ""friendship"" businesses, since I that's not what I'm looking for in her or right now. She said she'd understand but emphasized that she ""does not want to lose me"" and she'd be very bummed out if I decide to cut contact with her.

Through this whole ordeal, judging from how hard it hit me, tells me I have feelings for her. Which I can only confirm. So that makes it even more annoying right now.

I'd really love, and I mean LOVE to have the chance to maybe pick this up again with her in the future. I seldom feel so cherishing of a person as I do with her. And I do feel flattered that she still wants us to be in touch.

I just don't know how to do the intermediary or possibly permanent friendship part that's in effect now. I honestly don't care much for friendzoning. And I don't know what I'm expecting now. But for the time being, I'm gonna wait it out and see what happens. But I'm afraid that, in the end, it's always possible we'll not make up a team again. I'd be very sad about it, honestly.

What are several courses of actions for this situation? I know every person, every relationship and every situation differ. Do any of you had similar stories where a new relationship moved too fast and had to be dialed back in order to build up something in the future?

Or if any of you think I best bail on this ship, please just tell me.

Sorry for the wall of text. I literally just write as it comes in my mind and it might not be all the coherent.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Met amazing girl online, we click great. Started hanging out very regularly and soon after decided to form a couple. Both her and I came out of long term relationships, but she says it might have been moving too quickly for her now and she wants to take a step back and ""get to know each other"" better, but as ""friends"". I asked her if this is permanent or what this means exactly but she cannot give a conclusive answer to this other than ""I'd like to but I can't right now"".

5vwwcs,1,2017-02-24,Participating at Google Summer Camp as an intern,AyXiit34,google,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/5vwwcs/participating_at_google_summer_camp_as_an_intern/,"Hi /r/google, I plan on participating at Google Summer Camp but the only problem is that I have to do an internship as part of my school year.

The internship starts in the beginning of April and must be at least 3 months long ( until beginning of July then ), but as our year starts in October, we can extend it up to 6 months up to the end of september.

The problem is that Google SoC is during June, July and August so I'm not sure if I can participate it as if I were to make a longer internship I would be working full time in a company during these months, so I could only work on SoC during the afternoon after work, and if it's really work-heavy I could only work on it for 2-3 hours a day.

I don't know if any of you ever participated in it or if I should post it in a more appropriate subreddit to get an answer, but I would love to have some insight about how Summer of Code is taking place.

Thanks for reading :)

**Edit:** Forgot to mention the fact that my school is a private school and not a university, I don't know if it causes a problem during signup because the website states that the student ""Must be enrolled in or accepted into an accredited institution"""
5vx6b7,42,2017-02-24,Thoughts from a Paladins Fanatic on Season 1,NinjaBoffin,Paladins,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paladins/comments/5vx6b7/thoughts_from_a_paladins_fanatic_on_season_1/,"Before i start my ""essay"" i would like to introduce myself a little bit (incase you don't know who i am). Honestly though, get read for a long read (even by my standards)

**Introduction**
---
As you can guess from my username, name is NinjaBoffin. I'm currently 20 years old and study Financial Economics in University (2nd Year) (Hi o/ ). I've been playing Paladins since December 2015 (Not Day 1 adopter, but week 1). Now i said paladins Fanatic in the title and it's true. I've been involved deeply with the paladins scene since the beginning. I've been involved with the esports scene since it's infancy (Coach/Manager and gathering feedback from the players), I've been active especially in the discord communities (/r/Paladins, PaladinsWorld), I've been also been a part of initiatives that help new players such as Paladins Training Centre (Now no longer active), I'm currently staff for PaladinsWorld, I've even casted an ESL tournament (Hell, i've even won an ESL tournament) and finally i now make a lot more content on youtube. (Oh yeah, i was subreddit moderator as well :P )
I've met with some of the Paladins Devs in person along with the top players (Dreamhack Summer 2016) and do stay in contact with both parties as well.

So to say Paladins is a big part of my life is an understatement. 

---

---

Now Paladins has seen a fair share of patches and some of them have been bigger than others. During Closed Beta, there would be a patch every week and HiRez being HiRez would literally turn the game on it's head every patch. Just to name a few examples there was Beacons, Maps changes, Adding Reloads (Yes, you could fire indefinitely as rucks in early closed beta) and of course the the various TTK changes (time to kill).

But i'm not here to reminisce in the ""Old Paladins"". It was fun while it lasted but we are no longer in Closed Beta. We are in Open Beta and more importantly, it's season 1. The game has changed a lot and so has the core direction of the game (More on that later)

---
2
---
Here we are in Season 1. The subreddit has made a LOT of claims about HiRez (Mostly Negative but some positive). So i will start off by saying this. /r/Paladins can be a very powerful tool that can make it's voice heard and affect Paladins in a very positive way. I've been posting here since God knows how long and there are some very bright individuals here. For previous patches i've read some creative solutions to problems that had some ""make-do"" solutions implemented. It's a very strong asset.

But as OB44 has shown us, the subreddit is just ""Loud"". Yes, i understand OB44 is not what many people hoped for. I also understand where the P2W argument is coming from but there really hasn't been any good ""discussions"".

I've been reading the subreddit for a couple of days now (to really get the feel of what the underlying problem is) and the most popular ""solution"" is ""Revert to OB43"" or ""Get rid of the Essence system"".

See the thing is, that's not a solution. That's an out. and i'll explain why. But first we need to discuss the subreddit mentality.

---
3
---
As i've said before the subreddit is full of people that have that have amazing ideas and valid concerns but it's also a big sheep field.
By sheep field i mean, hive minded. You'll see the same thing upvoted to the front page but if anyone is speaking against it, it gets downvoted into oblivion.

There are always two sides to the story. 

As my mother says ""There are more good things in the world than bad, but we as human tend to give bad things more importance""

To put that everything into practise, we'll take the ""PrettyHair Drama"" as an example. On his personal stream he reads comments about himself (and OB44 reactions) and then proceeds to call ""Reddit a hole of whiners"" and ""Vocal minority"". Then the specific ""time stamp"" is posted on reddit with the title [""Reddit is a hole for Whiner - PrettyHair 2017""](https://redd.it/5vprz8) and it's upvoted to the front page. Then ironically enough, people are literally whining on about the statement.

Now i'll say now that i don't personally know PrettyHair but the guy is not as bad as people make him out to be. If anything he should be an inspiration for the masses. He started off with a summer internship at HiRez, then got hired after that and now on top of working with HiRez in the weekdays, he casts the top level games on the weekend. Some might argue that he gets paid for it, but there is only so much you will do for money.

Now, i'm not defending his words or what he did (It could have been handled better) but he is just like all of us Human. All those hours of work he put in gets disregarded because he used an inappropriate phrase (About himself) on his personal stream.

Now enough dilly-dallying. On to the main problem of OB44 instead. The Essence system and the pricing.

A new currency was added that ONLY drops from getting duplicates which you get from chests. Chests can now be purchased using both GOLD and Crystals. The only way to craft cards now is to use Essence (The new currency). The essence drop rates however are not as proportional as the pricing of the cards.

5000 essence to craft an Epic, but getting a duplicate epic gives your 1250.

That's the main problem (We'll touch on legendaries a little later). 

To that i've to say one thing.I don't love the system but it does have some merit (more than all the hate it's getting).

The main problem here was that Gold i earned over X months has no meaning and there is little to none progression. WIth that the essence system was added. You can now buy each chest for 2500 (discounted if you buy them in bulk). So personally i had close to 350k Gold with all champions at level 10 or above. With 110-120 chests already stockpiled  (as the value for the chests were super bad), i was in a very fortunate state. Having 230+ chests, 350k gold and 108K essence (I've had the Founders Pack since 2015 as well).
So it goes without saying that i have all the legendaries for all champions (With Gold, Chests and essence left over). But that's just me. I've played the game for over 1.5k hours, and i have the currencies to do that. Not everyone will have the time or dedication to do that. Which i understand perfectly.

One thing to be noted is that, yes i spend money on the game (A far bit actually if you watch my youtube videos) but it's all o cosmetics. I've never bought any chests with Crystals (Don't think you can count the founders chest), so all of the chests i got were from Champion masteries and bought in bulk with gold.

There are a few important questions here. Is the game P2W? Is the game too grindy? Are the legendaries overpriced? 

So i will answer each of the question one by one, giving my personal thoughts on each topic.

---
5
---
**Is the game P2W?** No it is not. I've spent money on the game but that's purely on cosmetics. I've played enough to stockpile chests/Gold to get all the legendaries and card collection. So i think i can show you that if you grind enough game hours (winning certainly helps), you can get all of the legendaries with gametime.

**Is the game too grindy?** To a certain extent but not as much as the community is making it out to be. The newer players are now showered in gold/chests/ essence. It's easy to level up in the starter days/weeks of you paladins account and it gets harder and harder the more you play. When i started, there was no FWOTD bonus, no chests for levelling up champion (just gold). Now answer truthfully, do you really want a new player to have a 100% card collection in under 1 month who plays a moderate amount when a guy has gotten a 100% collection after 4-5 months of solid play? No, it seems unfair for the person who's played longer. You can't give a nursery student an university book and expect them to make their choices. In a way giving them more knowledge before they are ready is too confusing. You gotta remember, even if we remove all the cards, the game is still confusing (Lots of mechanics at play).

**Are Legendaries overpriced?**: This question will probably be the downfall of the thread because i am going to say they are not. But hear me out first.
Each champion has 3 legendaries. You are given 1 as a default and you have to unlock the 2 by spending nearly 36,000 essence. So if the epics cost 5k to craft, why do i justify this leap? Well, because legendary cards change your playstyles completely. Investing into a legendary card means you know everything about the champion at a high enough level, so that now you can prioritise which ones you want. Taking Androxus for example, is default legendary will give you 50 bonus headshot damage (That's 100% i total). So this is prioritising your aim at the basic level. The reversal legendary will now always shoot an orb that does 800 damage. This is teaching you projectile aim (Which is harder than hitscan aim) and therefore it's locked (as you need to get a feel for it). The nether step legendary is now no longer gives links nether step. You can dash whenever you please, wherever. Now this is complicated because cooldown knowledge, air aiming, where to dash, when to dash all come into play. If i'm starting out, that's a very complicated mechanic for me to be introduced to.

Jeez this is a lot longer than even i intended it to be. So now potential solutions.
Reverting back to OB43, getting rid of the essence system don't count as not only is that really naive but it's not elegant nor efficient. Increasing the drop rate of essence is also not a great implementation (Because the underlying problem is still there). Finally dropping essence after a match is again not a good solution because it might make life easier, the ""grind"" will still be there, gold will be absolutely useless and essence will be the new gold ([Third currency incoming?\)](https://redd.it/5vr1vx)

So here are a few solutions that i believe are efficient, solve the core problem and being the economics student i am, efficient:

**1) Give the players the choice of the ""Default Legendary"":** What this does is a couple of things. The ""I don't like the legendary was given"" argument is gone completely. You are now given the choice of what card YOU want to play with. 
Keep the 18,000 essence cost for the other legendaries (as i believe more game time educates you more, so by the time you unlock the rest of the cards, you know if it's worth it). So as an example, i prefer to play viktor that is running a lot and deals damage up close (not from a distance). So when i pick my ""default"" as Hipfire, i can do just that. Now the more i play, the more i realise that Iron sights would have been better, so now i'm working towards a goal (of getting the other legendary). If you picked a default legendary because it was ""OP"" or didn't think about it and it gets nerfed, you'll remember not to do that next time. So thinking is important

**2) Remove the essence pricing from the ""Default Cards"" but keep it on legendaries**: Now i believe that you should try everything in life as the more experiences you're opened to, the more of a personality you become. 
If you want a full collection of legendaries without having the core cards firsts, then buddy you're gonna have a bad time. That's why i loved the 1200 gold pricing on all rarities of cards. It's a one fee for all ranks of cards for every card. You pick whatever you want and get a loadout suited for you. You won't know how legendaries will interact with other cards if you haven't got them all to play with. With that out of the way, the legendary costs stay the same. So now finishing quests, winning games will give you gold (that will give you the ""Freedom"" to craft whatever card you want). The duplicates you now get mean that you are playing the game more and more (more knowledge) and hence you really decide what legendary suits you well. Also with only legendaries costing essence it makes some sense.

These are not your everyday cards, they need a new ""Thing"" to craft them as they can ""Change the tide of the battle"". If you didn't guess already, it fits in with the non-existent lore :P

Now we are nearing the end and i would like to end on a ""real note. I don't how many of you (if you even do) watch ""House of Cards"". There is one line that the main protagonist (Frank Underwood) makes that really makes you think.

""You are entitled titled to nothing"" 

Now if you want to watch the show, don't watch this (as there are lots of spoilers) but if that doesn't concern you, give this a listen: https://youtu.be/XJUyPjguq6E

Gets the point across beautifully.  Yes you are a beta tester of the game and you make the player base, but that doesn't mean you are entitled to anything. Sounds harsh but just think about it. 

Now i'm not saying HiRez are just as harsh with the community (Hell, they are some of the most active in the community i know) but if you are going to write angry posts that berate the company without offering any constructive feedback, you are entitled to nothing.

Secondly the one thing we all need to understand is that most of the players would make bad game designers. I'm saying this because i've seen a LOT of threads saying ""HiRez the community is saying something"" or ""[HiRez listen to the community, we know best](https://redd.it/5vss2a)"". Now i can say from past experiences that the community does not know best.

Currently Paladins is focussing on Champions &gt; Cards but that was never the real goal of the game. It was customizability (Cards) &gt; Champions. If you've been around for that long, you'll remember the ""Champions are always free"" drama. 

Basically all the champions were going to be 100% free forever and the patches would have an emphasis on crazy card combinations and really customizable cards. So every card would be like the current legendary but on steroids.

But the ""community"" at the time wanted a free overwatch. Paladins beta and Overwatch beta started in the same period and people wanted a free Overwatch. So when the ""community"" wanted champions &gt; cards, the game had lost it's original direction. Now when HiRez still tried to keep cards in (but Overwatch released), it was a very confusing time for both the players and HiRez themselves. The people that wanted the free overwatch had left because ""Overwatch is better than Paladins"" and the fans that were left wanted customizability (which was very low). So when season 1 as announced, i and countless others were ecstatic. If HiRez want to stand by the system, i am glad that they are. This system may not be the best, but the gameplay changes are solid. 

No system is ever perfect. All systems have flaws and it's our job as players that care about the game to tell the devs.

Screaming and calling names is easy, but sticking by what we have and trying to improve is a different story.

I've seen some users that are trying to do what i am and honestly, my heart goes out to them. They are however overshadowed by ""Dead Game"", ""Abandon ship"" threads that don't help at all.

Hopefully that was a different read and not your typical reddit post. God that was so long :L

Edit: I still have more to say (HOW?!). So i see a lot of sites that are complaining about how bad the grind is but if i may be so blunt, none of them can really be considered a ""credible source"". So Ten Ton Hammer made a post about how the grind i really bad, but it's done by the same guy who made a tier list where Makoa was not top pick and skye was over Grover (Grover is not meta in EU, but other regions pick him up).

I also see how the content creators are quoted a lot. Namely Joshino (I mean PCGamer quoted him). Again, he isn't exactly a ""Veteran player"" as PCgamer says so. Starting 6 months ago doesn't really give you enough knowledge to give balance changes. Yes, he is good at the game but a lot of people that are giving ""Balance changes"" tend to cater the game to themselves. So if i like playing precision champions, i would want to buff Kinessa/Androxus/ shalin, But what if they're in a good place and you just don't see it? That's why player given balance advice is not regarded as highly as the statistics (Which it should be). That's why even i don't give out balance feedback every patch. I observe the top tie games, get the stats from their and correlate the data with any changes in the patch notes. Again, nothing bad about the guy (He seems pretty chill) but claiming that ""one person said so, so it must be true"" mentality is not helpful in a discussion when asked for your own opinion

I see posts from Brits who say they get shot down often at the open, or that the girls just seem very confused about being approached by a stranger, and I think that the US guys can't relate to this (since US girls are so much more social with strangers) and  they assume that it must be down to having a really bad vibe or opening line or whatever.

PICK UP AND SEDUCTION IN THE UK – WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

By 5.0 and Mr M (JOINT INSTRUCTOR ARTICLE)  


(With special thanks to Mr M's wonderful intern londonwizard for the colorful formatting and proofreading)

British Girls are typically not as immediately sexually open as Americans and other Europeans 

British Girls are generally not as sexually open, or as quick to be sexual, as Americans and other Europeans. This may on face value sound strange as British girls have a reputation for being quick to bed. This ‘slutty’ reputation is true on a certain level, particularly when the girls are overseas or when they are very drunk. Moreover, you can set sexually adventurous frames with certain British girls that incite sexual adventurousness. However, on the whole, our experience indicates that they are less sexually open and are not as forthcoming about sexual adventurousness as American and European women.

This stems from cultural differences. British people are taught to be very polite and reserved, particularly about their feelings and emotions to strangers. Furthermore, the entertainment culture in the UK is still quite conservative when compared to the US and Europe. Contrast this to the US, where shows like Girls Gone Wild and MTVs Spring Break actively encourage girls to get sexual / make out / experiment with other girls. There are of course exceptions to this rule, but on the whole, this difference in ‘sexual expression’ holds true.

Note that this is not meant to engender limiting beliefs that same night lays (SNLs) are not possible in the UK. THEY ARE VERY POSSIBLE AND THEY DO HAPPEN WITH REGULARITY. However, the secret to getting girls for FAST closes (e.g. SNLs) in the UK is logistics, buying temperature and discretion. Because of the conservative social conditioning, a girl can be very attracted to you but won’t go home with you. However, if you can provide a LOGISTICAL REASON TO GET TO THE SEDUCTION LOCATION and maintain buying temperature in the process (thus engaging her logical mind), achieving an SNL is a distinct possibility.

The Effect of Teasing

The British have a very distinct sense of humour. Girls in the UK love to laugh but the culture is one of irony, self deprecation and banter as opposed to slapstick. 

This is why a guy like Braddock does so well over here – girls in the UK love intelligent banter and teasing. Contrast this to European girls (as Mr M and HiRoller mentioned in a previous article about Nordic girls – see here) who often do not understand this type of banter and are more likely to take teasing and banter more seriously and be limited in their ability to respond. 

Of course, you should avoid seeking to be the guy who just teases and banters guy as his entire ‘seduction repertoire’. Being one-dimensional in any area is bad for pickup. Building rapport and establishing an emotional connection are still important skills. For more on how to do this, Mr M has a great free article on Qualification – click here. But be aware that you can be quite outrageous and teasing with British girls more than perhaps any other culture (as long as you deliver the banter with a smile and appropriate sub communications).

Differences in Bars and Clubs 

•	Due to the legal drinking age being 18, the average age of girls in bars/clubs is lower

This can be both awesome and scary at the same time! Be aware that girls in UK bars are on average a lot younger than what you might find at other bars and clubs in the world. See that smoking hot blonde standing at the bar and having massive approach anxiety? Well she is probably barely 19 and is likely making that bitch shield ‘don’t talk to me’ face because she is feeling out of her depth! This is why it is super important to open the 9’s/10’s in the UK – a lot of the time they are in fact intimidated by you (for more info on Gaming 9’s and 10’s, see Mr M and Braddock’s Interview Series on ‘9 and 10 Game’ here (you can even download a free sample from that link)).

Also note that knowing that the average age of girls will be younger allows you to calibrate your ‘game’ towards younger girls. For younger girls, garnering attraction VIA BUYING TEMPERATURE (USING TEASING AND HUMOUR), LEADERSHIP AND DOMINANCE, AND SOCIAL PROOF is more effective than using intrigue based attraction (cold reads, IVDs etc).

•	Bottle service is pretty much nonexistent in the UK, hence having a table at a club will mean girls assign you higher value

Whilst in many other countries bottle service is seen as standard in nightclubs, in the UK, and especially London, it is still the reserve of promoters and people with money. Mr M, Sheriff, Vercetti and 5.0 used to use this to their advantage and have all, at one stage, (5.0 continues to do this) worked in nightclub promotions for several of the top high-end night clubs in London. The difference that this made to their perceived value was staggering. 

In short, however, tables = status. This does not mean you should go out and spend the £1000 minimum just to get a table. Far from it. It is still possible to get hot girls without them. HOWEVER it is important to realise that being on a table in a high-end nightclub in the UK establishes you as having value above other guys in the club and can be used to your advantage as a DHV.

Note, however, that you don’t want to set the frame that you are buying the girls attention with drinks. Because the age of girls is lower, they will also try to rinse you for your drinks while flirting with no intention of hooking up. DON’T FALL INTO THIS TRAP. The best thing to do in order to close these girls if you have a table and drinks is to pump their buying temperature throughout the night and develop rapport. The hook ups and sex at these sorts of clubs usually happen at the seduction location so invite the girls to an ‘after party’ and close there.

•	Door policies a lot stricter

Once again, male-female ratio logistics come back to haunt us. The sheer number of guys wanting to go out in the UK means that door staff will turn guys away for literally the smallest reason. They will cite any reason - shoes/trousers/jeans/t shirts/hair cuts/certain fashion labels... the list is endless. 

The best way to ensure entry is of course to go in with girls, which means you are either going to have to roll in with some, or get chatting to a few in the queue... which even the best ‘PUA’ has to resort to sometimes!
Also, to avoid this completely, Mr M and Braddock go through how to make a location your ‘Prized Venue’ in Social Circle Mastery. If you manage to do this, you will never have to wait in line at the door again and be social proofed on your way in.

•	Dancing with a guy is more of an IOI

In the USA, a random girl dancing with, or grinding up against you, cannot be taken as an IOI. This is a common occurrence in the USA and is often a way that girls tease guys. 

If a British girl grinds and dances sexually with you on the dance floor, it is ok to take this as more of an IOI. If this happens, you should start escalating. If you feel as if there is still more comfort necessary for the close, then go for moving her around the bar by saying something like ‘let’s grab a drink’ or ‘I need some water’ or simply take her hand and show her a different area of the bar.

Calibration of High Bitch Shields

As a general rule, girls in the UK have a much higher perceived sexual value. A British girl you would rate as a 7, is more than likely to have a bitch shield comparable to a 10 you might meet in America for example. The reason for this is threefold – climate, ratio &amp; suspicion.

Climate – The UK (and Western Europe in general) is not blessed with the sunshine and heat of many other countries in the world. Therefore, British girls know their bodies are not on show as often and they therefore drink / eat probably more than they should – they know they can cover it up. They know the majority of girls don’t have the classically ‘hot’ figure and so they don’t strive to achieve it. Compare this with LA or San Diego, where going to the gym forms an integral part of a girl’s life. When a girl steps outside, there are attractive girls everywhere and she has to compete. This is not the case in the UK.
Ratio – In a lot of night venues, there are a LOT more guys than girls. Therefore girls assume a higher internal value because of the sheer number of guys that will be hitting on them. If one guy hits on a 6, she knows she is a 6. If fifty guys hit on a 6, she will assume the attitude of a 10. Because the girls assume a higher value, this means your own internal value has to be high and resilient to attack. It also helps greatly to demonstrate social proof in the venue.
Suspicion – British girls are more suspicious of strange guys talking to them. Ugly British girls, although they may act like a 10, still know inside they are a 6. Therefore, they are always on the back foot when a well dressed, articulate, funny guy comes to talk to them. They assume you are hitting on them. As a result, we find that some warm up sets are harder to hook than even a group of 10’s in a high end club. The 10’s know they are hot and so expect to be hit on; the 6’s will blow you out like a 10 but only because they are suspicious of your motives.

THE LESSON? EXPECT COLD APPROACHES IN A CLUB TO BE JUST THAT… COLD… EVEN ON AVERAGE LOOKING GIRLS.

In order to deal with the ‘bitch shield’, or shields in general, the first principle is to be UNREACTIVE and not let it visibly affect your value. For more on the principle of being unreactive, which is KEY to becoming attractive to females, read the following free Inner Game article written by Mr M – The Secret of Attractive Reactiveness. 

The following lines can then be employed to deal with bitch shields:

You know, everyone around this bar has been so friendly, it’s awesome. I’m [INSERT YOUR NAME]
You know what’s a real shame? People are never real in bars. You never get the real person - there’s always the veneer… I mean, I’m sure if we had met in a library, we’d both be fun and interesting people, but seeing as it’s a bar, it’s different. I’m [INSERT NAME].
OMG I love your angry face – it’s so cute. Don’t start smiling.

MR M IS CURRENTLY WRITING AN EPIC ARTICLE ON ‘THE ANATOMY OF BITCH SHIELDS’. CHECK HIS CLASSIC WRITINGS IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO TO SEE IF IT IS THERE.
IVDs such as Magic and Cold Reads don’t tend to Hook as hard

As a magician, 5.0 used to do magic tricks in bars as a DHV but found it rarely hooked. Coming back to the girls’ inherent value again, British girls see it all too easily as you trying to ‘impress’ them, hence smashing your value. Your actions will almost certainly be perceived as ‘Emotional Overreaching’ (see Mr M’s article on Attractive Reactiveness for more on Emotional Overreaching). As most sets will be cold or tentative at the outset, you will find that while teasing and bantering works for the initial parts of attraction, attempting to get the compliance for something like The Cube (a detailed cold read) or an elaborate magic trick is construed as ‘try hard’ as opposed to a DHV.

We have found however, THAT TIMING A COLD READ LATER IN QUALIFICATION OR COMFORT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN, IN BRADDOCK’S WORDS, ‘THROWING IN A HAND GRENADE OR AN ATOMIC BOMB’ – THE DIFFERENCE IS STARLING. Whereas in the US, using magic can be a huge DHV, in the UK, it will only hook if you have value in the first place. Examples of two good Cold Reads that can be used include:

THE CHILDHOOD COLD READ. I'm going out on a limb here, but it feels to me like that when you were a kid....or even a teenager...something happened. Something made you grow up really fast, or become an adult before you were ready.
THE HARD LIFE COLD READ. I bet people think you’ve had life easier than most people but I think the truth is you’ve had to work a lot harder than most people and at the same time I think you’ve had to play the role and pretend it’s easy that must be difficult. I understand.
Other Miscellaneous (but helpful) Points

•	Being foreign is not as much of a DHV as it is in other countries 

Mr M has theorized that a potentially useful attraction trigger is being the ‘vagabond’ i.e. the traveller. It is partly the reason why you tend to get laid more on holiday. Being the ‘vagabond’ can lead to sex due to (1) fewer social repercussions for sleeping with someone outside her social circle (i.e. you can be her secret and she has guaranteed discretion) (2) no repercussions to her social value for sleeping with someone (as no one else has to know and there is no lasting effect) and (3) evolutionary based attraction because you signal that you come from such a diverse gene pool. In LA, for example, just having a British accent is often enough to buy you at least 5 minutes of conversation. 

However, the Americans who have gamed with us in the UK have not experienced the same phenomenon to the same extent. This is due to the fact that the UK has continental Europe right on its doorstep, and that many travellers from other countries like to use the UK as a base for further travel in Europe. British girls are therefore used to a multicultural society and consequently take it for granted. Taking London as an example, you are almost more likely to meet girls from Europe as you are from the UK. To add to this, the UK is not a massive land mass, and so all these cultures get crammed in together resulting in a very cosmopolitan mix.
•	Being dressed better helps - particularly in High End clubs

Harking back to the male-female ratio question, girls in the UK can afford to be a lot pickier in bars and clubs. Therefore you should aim to dress just a bit better than anyone else at the venue you are going to – whether it be a high end night club, or an indie venue. Many British guys make the mistake of not taking fashion seriously. While we are not advocating you should go out to spend £10,000 on 3 outfits, you should still seek to read men’s style and fashion magazines to see what is ‘in’ and aim to replicate the look based on your own style. 

Moreover, Peacocking does not have a very strong effect in the UK due to the more laid back nature of the people.

One of the guest instructors on Project Rockstar (the amazing 8-week Game internship created and led by Mr M) advocates ‘pimp cocking’ in the UK. This means simply wearing just one or two items that invite conversation. Those that have been out with 5.0 will know that he wears a bike chain necklace and a cool leather bracelet with a metal crucifix on it – this will give girls something to open or re-initiate a conversation with. But a fuzzy hat, black nails and platform shoes may be too much (although once again there are exceptions to this rule). This is because the British people are more sarcastic and derisive with each other than many other nationalities. Granted, it will get girls to open you and can work if it is completely congruent with your personality and identity, but otherwise you run the risk of the girls seeing you as having a lower perceived value or quite simply ‘weird’. 

In summary, it is better for people to open you with a compliment, question, or intrigue about the 'pimp-cocked' item rather than for you to wear something outrageous and not congruent with your identity just for the sake of peacocking. That being said, Sexy Stereotyping, a concept Brad P teaches, is still very effective if done correctly, but this is the topic of another post .

Even more intensively so since I started looking for a new Notebook. As this is my first post here please be considerade regarding potential mistakes I've made.

I'm in desperate need of a need Notebook as my current Late 2008 MacBook (Unibody) is dying.
As the Keyboard as well as price of the new MacBook Pros do bother me a lot, I'm thinking about buying a Thinkpad instead. Having used T420, T420s and T430 during internships I am familiar with the devices.

As I am a German citizen studying in Switzerland, I have access to both, the German Lenovo Campus as well as the Swiss Projekt Neptun discounted devices. The following configurations made it into the ""final round"":

**T460**
- 1920x1080
- Core i5-6200U
- 256GB SATA SSD
- 8GB DDR3L
- no operating system
*898.00 €*

**T470**
- 1920x1080
- Core i5-7200U
- 512GB PCIe SSD
- 8GB DDR4
- Win 10 Home
*1,199.00 €*

**T470s**
- 2560x1440
- Core i7-7600U
- 512GB PCIe SSD
- 20GB DDR4
- no operating system
*1,580.00 CHF (roughly 1,485.00 €)*

All devices would come with a 3 year warranty, the T470s even with on-site support incl. battery.

If I ordered the T470s I'd still have to replace the keyboard with a proper German one as I cannot type on the Swiss layout, so I'd have to pay another 70 bucks.

I have read that the WQHD screen is substantially better than the FHD ones on the non-s models. However, while I could return the ThinkPads when bought in Germany within 14 days, this is not possible in case of the T470s, which also has an estimated delivery time of 6 weeks.

It is somewhat of a dilemma for me, as all devices have their advantages and disadvantages. I don't need Windows as I can Win 10 EDU for free over my university. The weight is only of second order importance as I never had serious problems in this regard with my rather heavy MacBook until now.

Which of the devices would you choose if you were in my position?

We are very compatible in terms of hobbies, personalities, life goals etc &amp; I feel like we are working towards a real future together.

The past couple of months have been really rough on me, however. I'm a senior in chemical engineering &amp; I applied to several graduate schools for my PhD, and have gotten only 3 rejections so far with 6 schools not responding yet. I am incredibly anxious about this, and every single day it just gets worse. I'm at the point where I cry multiple times every day because I feel like at this point there's a very slim chance I'll get in anywhere, I don't have a future without grad school, I'm a failure, I'm not competitive for an industry job because the only experience I have is in research &amp; I don't even WANT an industry job anyway, etc etc. Objectively I know I have options but being stuck in this limbo is absolutely soul-crushing and I'm absolutely miserable. Additionally, I'm taking some graduate level chem e courses on top of the regular senior curriculum to prepare me for grad school, so my coursework right now is incredibly demanding and every day I feel like I'm just working nonstop with intermittent crying breaks.

My boyfriend on the other hand is a Master's student in computer science and has done very well both in school and industry internships. Right now he is applying for internships for the summer and has gotten lots of interviews and really great offers. I'm really happy for him, but hearing about his success just makes me feel even more horrible. We go to schools about 35-40 minutes apart so with our school schedules we only see each other on weekends, and when we talk over the phone I feel like we only end up discussing him and how great he's doing with everything so I feel like even more of a failure. I also help prep him for interviews on the weekends when I do see him, and he compares his offers with me, but thinking about anything in the future beyond the schoolwork I have due over the next couple of weeks is just agonizing since I'm basically directionless right now. I want to support him and I am genuinely happy for him, but hearing about how great things are going for him &amp; how he's getting everything he's applied for kiiiiinda makes me want to die since I'm such a failure in comparison and I'm incredibly humiliated and angry at myself.

I do see a therapist every other week (since I know somebody will suggest this lol). I haven't had a chance to speak with him about this issue in particular yet and our next appointment isn't for another couple of weeks and I don't know if I can stand this for that long. His main advice for me regarding my grad school anxiety has been to practice mindfulness and try not to dwell on it since I can't control the outcome right now, which works at least some of the time but recently it's become incredibly difficult when my boyfriend talks about all the great opportunities and job offers he's getting.

Basically I would like to know, how do I remain supportive of him and his career when mine is a failure before it even started?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm very anxious about grad school and can barely hold myself together most days because I haven't been accepted anywhere. Boyfriend is doing great and getting lots of internship offers/interviews and I feel like an awful failure in comparison. How do I remain supportive while protecting my own mental health?"

I'd like some help determining how many allowances to claim for an internship I'll be taking this summer.  I am filing single, full-time undergrad student.  My state of residence is IL.


My 2017 projected taxable income:



Current employer (Jan-Apr) (note 1): 6,795

Chase bank bonus: 300

Future employer (May-Aug): 30,675

TA position (Aug-Dec): 1,800

Current employer's pension (note 2): 2,067

Current employer's 401k rollover (note 3): $5,917

Total: 47,554

**note 1** I've claimed exemption from federal tax withholding on my W-4 here.  The American Opportunity Tax Credit has wiped out all federal taxes for the past three years.  I project a IL tax withholding of around $255.

**note 2** I'm fully vested in this pension plan, and the online tool tells me I'll get a lump sum payment of about $2,067 when I leave in April.  It also tells me I need to roll this into my Roth IRA to avoid penalties, and that the entire lump sum will be taxable.

**note 3** I expect my 401k to have a balance of around $10,500 when I leave.  My contributions are all Roth, so this portion of my 401k rollover isn't taxable again, right?  But my employer's contribution is fully taxable?  The $5,917 listed above is my employer's contribution.


Ok, so my taxable income will be around $47,554 for 2017.  Subtract the standard deduction and my personal exemption, that's $34,154 taxable federal, $45,379 taxable IL.  Projected federal income tax: $5,107.  Projected IL income tax: $1702.


The AOTC takes out $2,500 of my federal tax liability.  I'll have around $255 withheld for IL my April.  So the amounts I'll have to pay are **$2,607 federal** and **$1,447 IL**.


**This is my main question:**

My monthly gross pay for my summer internship is $10,225.  If I want to pay off my entire income tax liability over these three months, I will have to have $869/month of federal income tax withheld, and $483/month of IL income tax withheld.  According to various online take home pay calculators, I should claim 16 federal allowances + $5 additional withholding and 0 IL allowances + $51 additional withholding.  Does this seem right to you?  Are my calculations above correct?  Thanks!

Now, the position. GIS/CAD Analyst and 3 hours from the American hub of oil and gas where I reside. Met with the VP last Friday for lunch. Met with the President yesterday morning at the job location. Offer last night. 

They love my CAD background, and my little GIS experience in my internship, my project management experience over the years, coursework background, ability to problem solve, yada yada yada...they like me. Great. The pay is significantly better than any other CAD/GIS position I have come across, great benefits, PTO and the works. 

I worked my dick off to get these degrees and these internships and worked so hard during both of them, it was just unfortunate timing during it all. I overall want to be a god damn geoscientist. I love problem solving, mapping, interpreting, presenting data and putting the petroleum stories together to prove my science. 

On the other hand I have been unemployed (end of second internship) since August. Fortunately I am handy and have done lots of odd jobs and kept the bills paid just fine. I'm just trying to decide if I really want to do CAD and GIS work, and be 3 hours away from where I'd anticipate getting a geo job. That said, I have been contacted about more geo jobs in the last month than the prior year and a half combined, so things are coming around. 

Should I accept this position? If I start and get asked for a geo interview 3 weeks into this job, how do I tell my new employer that? What if I have to drag up on them a month into it and leave an apartment lease in a new city? 

Thanks for any help. "

“On the snow-covered slopes of Utah, the President of the United States has been kidnapped and his Secret Service detail massacred. Only one agent has survived—ex-Navy SEAL Scot Harvath. He doesn’t buy the official line that Middle Eastern terrorists are behind the attack and begins his own campaign to find the truth and exact revenge. But now, framed for murder by a sinister cabal, Harvath takes his fight to the towering mountains of Switzerland—and joins forces with beautiful Claudia Mueller of the Swiss Federal Attorney’s Office. Together they must brave the subzero temperatures and sheer heights of treacherous Mount Pilatus—where their only chance for survival lies inside the den of the most lethal team of professional killers the world has ever known…”"

I work at a media agency where I started a year ago as an intern myself. I did great at the internship and felt really at my place at the company so they offered me a job while I finish my bachelors degree. My 23th birthday was last week which makes me the youngest in the office.

In my department I work with 5/6 other people. I'm a pretty well-liked guy in the office and made some pretty big moves for an ex-intern in the 6 months I work here.

My spot as intern was filled up pretty quickly when I got my permanent contract, so in comes this girl.
She's 23 aswell, really cute and insanely smart. We work with all kinds of difficult systems and she understands them all perfectly within a week. 

We sit opposite to eachtother, and I get to help her with new stuff. So obviously we start talking, which makes me like her more and more. Sometimes I notice her looking at me too, but every time our eyes meet we both stare away awkwardly. This might be my imagination that just wants her to like me though.

Last night the company had a dinner, and I sat next to her. Our conversation didn't really get going since I thought I was in a strange position, since we're collegues and I talk/work with her every day.

Should I make a move? If so, in what way? How should I approach this situation?

The entire front office funnels outside to the practice field to watch a competition between John Elway and Tony Romo.

The interns set up some buckets and targets to throw at, and the contest begins!

Surprisingly, the 56-year-old Elway still has some juice in his arm. He whips the ball 40 – sometimes 50 – yards down the field with ease. His accuracy and footwork are a little sloppy, but that’s to be expected given his rust. Out of 100, he scores an 86.

Tony Romo steps up next, getting a little nervous about this now. But luckily: he’s in the best shape of his life. Not playing for the bulk of 2016 has him rested and raring to go. He whips passes all over the field, hitting almost every single target. Score: 98.

DAMN. 

Vance Joseph and Mike McCoy APPLAUD Romo’s showing. You proudly watch, expecting that contract offer to come in any second now.

But John Elway still appears unsettled. “This isn’t a proper contest… you need to throw to some live bodies. We need to do it again with real receivers.”

Ugh. You look to Romo to make sure he’s okay with this, but you don’t have any other choice. He’s going to have to prove his worth – again.

Thank you for that, but now I'm back! There's a reason the signs say ""Don't Feed the Bears."" I apologize if I've been a bit repetitive lately, but this prompt took a *long* time to write, and I think it can be adapted to pretty much any whim and desire. Ask and ye shall probably receive. I also don't expect you to match the length and detail of this prompt. This was developed over quite a long time with a bit of thought. Roleplay responses simply cannot receive that kind of attention without going stale.

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds.

Of course, there are also parties for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box. Inside are forms for entering the information you just so painstakingly wrote down, but you figure you should do this the right way. The contents are odd, but they are all within reason for a company attempting to isolate strings of beneficial human DNA. Even if they do get awfully personal with fertility, hey, people have to reproduce, right?

Reading the form, it is as follows:

FERTILITY STATUS: *Percentage displayed on the instrument will be most accurate during or immediately following an orgasm. The instrument can accommodate this necessity.*

CURRENT MEDICATION: *Please include any and all medication, including birth control.*

RECENT SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS: (Get creative!)

JOB EXPERIENCE: (Again, creativity will be rewarded!) *Please include any majors, minors, concentrations, and advanced degrees.*

PROPOSED AREA OF RESEARCH:

INTERESTS: *Let the Facility know about who you are as a person! We would really like to get to know you, and anything you want to tell us will help make your experience with us more comfortable and enjoyable!*

OTHER INFORMATION: *If there's anything else you think the Facility should know, please use the provided space.*

GOLDEN GENES PHOTO CONTEST: *As a special promotional offer, the Facility is running a photo contest! This contest is open to the general public, regardless of application intent or status, so get your friends involved! Insert the probe, get creative with the temporary tattoos, and snap a pic while testing your fertility! Please make sure the display of the instrument is visible in the picture.*

*Prizes will be distributed for Sexiest Pic, Most Fertile, Best Preggo, Most Creative, Best ""In Progress"" Pic, and Freshest New Mother. These prizes consist of $1000 dollars cash, a guided tour of the facilities, and a Gold Reproduction Package including a session with one of our top quality donors. A Grand Prize will be given out for Best In Show, an honor reserved for the sexiest, most fertile, most creative, and above all most breedable gene carrier that sends in a picture! This Grand Prize consists of $10,000 dollars cash, a private jet and limousine to and from the Farm, a private behind-the-scenes tour of the Farm facilities, a private interview with the Director himself, and a Platinum Reproductive Package including lab-grown custom semen and access to our state of the art equipment! Grand Prize Winners will also be invited to stay the night in one of our luxury suites!*

*Prizes must be accepted in full; individual components may not be turned down at the discretion of the contestant winner. Participation in the tour is not required for the cash prize. Every prize is available to the general public; application not required. (I'm not asking for a real picture. Just tell me about how you made the picture, if you are interested. I'm just trying to get a grip on what you like. Feel free to add a real picture of some sexy little breeder, but tell me how you made it! That's how I judge whether or not we'll click!)*"

She was going to stay over the summer and do classes, but she told me a few weeks ago she randomly decided to apply for an internship at a hospital in NY. So today she got an e-mail saying she got an interview. I'm really happy for her, but I'm more worried about what will now happen to me for the three months she's gone if she passes the interview.

She said she'd pay the rent while she's gone, but that's all we've talked about. She doesn't seem to want to talk about what I'll have to do when she's gone. I do not want to sublease for 3 months because that just sounds like trouble. I'd say I'd just get a new roommate permanently, but if that were the case I'd like to move out and find a better apartment to live in along with a new roommate, and that all seems very complicated. 

I don't think she'll be able to pay for rent here and rent wherever she will be living in NY. She hasn't seemed to have thought any of this through, besides the fact that if she gets it she'll will he going to NY. I feel like I don't matter at all, and it's all up to me what happens while she's off at her internship. This is the first apartment I've ever rented and I'm not entirely sure what to do. I know I have to get her to sit down and talk to me, but what is the best course of action? See if she can pay for the time she will be gone? Have her sublease? Our lease is up in August. I've been really stressed out about so much and this is just the icing on the cake. I know she hasn't got the internship yet, but it's a high possibility. Any advice is much appreciated. "

I’m a friendly 19 year old, an engineering student, naturalist, and tinkerer. I'll be starting a summer internship in Des Moines with a startup company making bikes, and I'm looking for somewhere to be my new home base during the summer. My goal is to live with one or more roommates, male or female, who are big-hearted lovers of life, reasonably mature, and be consistent with our agreements (on shared space, schedules, parties, shared costs, etc.)

I don’t smoke, but don’t mind pot or the occasional hookah or vape. I’m clean and tidy but not necessarily meticulous; I’m down to share cleaning duties and will honor whatever we agree to. I’d like the freedom to have the occasional guest come by, but don’t throw many parties. I welcome others’ guests and parties, but am not really interested in an all-the-time party house. When home, I like to read and tinker with projects a lot, but can also be community-oriented if it feels right!

I’m down to share meals, or not; I’m not vegetarian but am totally down to cook veggie or vegan any time. I have a frankly awesome stereo that I’d love to share, but if that doesn’t work out, no worries. If anything is broken, I have been known to be pretty handy and will gladly lend a hand. I love animals and enjoy having them in the house, as long as they’re well treated and cleaned up after. I love taking in and creating art, movies, music, etc. and am drawn to the beautiful and absurd. Oh, and I enjoy slacklining and rock climbing, and have equipment to share (if you're into that)!

I’d like to spend less than $500 per month, but if it’s a little more than that and you’re really excited about meeting me, get in touch and we can talk about it. I currently live in Ames; I'd love to live close enough to work and downtown Des Moines so that I can rely on my bike (within 10 miles would be ~groovy~!). My internship runs from June to August (10 weeks).

My expectations of living are pretty low: as long as I have a place to sleep, bathe, and cook a meal I'll be happy. Overall, I consider myself a pretty great roommate for the right people.

If you have somewhere I could stay, or you know someone who you think could help me out, you should message me or comment. Thanks for reading!!"

Or, if you have some differing ideas, I'd love to hear those too.

First I want to get likes and dislikes out of the way, which will be pretty quick.

Likes: bimbofication, impregantion/breeding, creampies, cheating, light noncon/dub con, fantasy, sci-fi, history, rough sex, soft sex, romance, light ageplay.

Dislikes: bathroom stuff, blood, excessive violence, bestiality.

Now, I can write in either first or third person, so I leave that up to your preference, though I do like detail and punctuation. Quotation marks to denote speech, that sort of thing. I don't need huge, long multi-paragraph replies, sometimes the occasional short reply is inevitable.

So, the prompts!

The Warbride (Historical)

War feeds on the young. It takes romanticized visions, youthful feelings of immortality, and national pride, ships them over land and sea, and grinds them together into shattered illusions and doom.

But, out of such darkness, passion, life and love can bloom. Be it two young bodies seeking comfort from each other in the dark, or two halves finding their other part, when they'd otherwise remain distant.

In every war the US has fought in the 20th and 21st century, men have left bachelors, and returned husbands... and often fathers the question is, when we set our story? During World War 2? Korea or Vietnam, our more clandestine operations in Latin America?

One thing I think would be interesting would be add some raceplay, maybe the American soldier and young Asian woman with traditional parents? Investigating the clash of two cultures?

The Wild Man

It is the latter days of the nineteenth century, the industrial revolution is moving forward full steam, old ideas of mysticism and miracles being rolled back by the advance of science and technology. The world still has it's mysteries though, uncharted islands, the mysterious interior of the vast continent of Africa still greatly unknown. It is here we tell our story.

In the depths of the Jungle a family of explorers was lost. The parents succumbing to predation, but their son, miraculously survived. He grew to the age of manhood, staking out his dominion over the jungle beasts, the dark mass of trees and vines, a foreboding mystery to most... was his kingdom.

Of course now, as money becomes king in this bold, industrialized world, there are men who will take those with money to see the untamed wilds, and this is how you and the wild man come to meet.

Perhaps you are a young lady of European aristocracy, or the treasured only daughter of an American industrialist, but you and a gathering of your similarly high-status friends chartered this sight seeing adventure.

But taking a small canoe up the river... catastrophe strikes. It is true, the guide had a gun. That didn't help him when the crocodile capsized the boat. After that, it was pure chaos... you barely remembering, just struggling to get to shore in your dress... the panicked sounds of the others on the boat... then nothing.

When you awoke, it was to a crackling fire, a lean, masculine shape sitting nearby. As you sat up, he stood, looking down. He wasn't like the men at the parties or country clubs back home. He stood tall, broad shouldered, powerfully muscled from years climbing and hunting and fighting the dangerous beasts of his home. A thick mane of hair tumbling past his shoulders, with a strong jaw, and light blue eyes, striking in skin tanned a warm bronze by the sun.

This wasn't the sort of man you'd been told to find attractive, you had been groomed to marry a smooth, sleek gentleman, with fine clothes and soft hands... but something about this man awakened a new feeling... a deep, primal need, an aching emptiness between your legs, and the look in this mans eyes suggested desire as well...

A Marriage of Convenience (Historical or Fantasy)

For too long have our houses feuded, a bitter struggle for dominance over the land as the kingdom to your west fell to men from across the sea, a new and martial people, who moved out from their conquests subjugating all in their path... until meeting your people.

Now, our fathers grow weary of seeing their sons and their peoples sons come back carried on their shields... so a compromise is made. A so of his kingdom shall marry a daughter of yours. Together they shall be installed over the contested lands to start a new kingdom, buffering the two rival empires.

(We can take a historical approach with this, setting it in medieval Europe with some detail tweaks depending on the era, or set it in an entirely fictional setting.)

The Homewrecker

Maybe you're a rival of my wife, maybe you're the girl next door, or a new intern at work, looking to bag a handsome and successful man, and you don't care that he's already married (or maybe taking what belongs to someone else is the thrill?)

All that matters is you decided that I was wasted on my wife. A wife who doesn't like the attention you've given me, and likes even less how clearly I enjoyed it. So, you decide to get your legs around me, and take me away from her. You'll show me how much better you are, and you'll do it by giving me what my wife hasn't been able to.

You see, I want a family, and she and I have tried. Unfortunately, she's been... unsuccessful. Why don't you step in and do what she can't?

I want to select a polyline and insert/attach/snap a block (in this case a small center cross) at every vertex.

I already use the 'path array' command to *regularly* attach object to polylines, but in this case I don't want evenly spaced, I want to snap only to the vertexs. 

The Why:

I'm a landscape designer and after I've represented all the plants with circles (circles are better than blocks in my work flow) I connect circles representing common species with a polyline for annotation. 


I also snap a center cross to each circle.


If I could draw my connecting polyline and then auto snap a 'center cross' block to every vertex I would only have to snap to the center of each circle once, not twice... 


This would save a lot of time (until I can hire an intern to do my busy work! kidding all you interns).

So is there a command I'm missing?
Or a script?

We would hang out regularly and I started to sense he might see me in a romantic way but made clear that we were just friends. He ended up admitting to have feelings for me but I said I didn't feel the same. We remained close friends after that. 

I went living abroad a year ago and one day I was feeling very home sick talking to him so I ended up saying missed him a lot and even being far away we would always be friends . He responded the same . (this part is important)

Shortly after that he told me he found a girl (actually an old ex, let's call her Maria ) and so they decided to speed it up and go live together and I told him how happy I was for him. We said bye bye talk to you later. 

A few days after , someone (Maria) ,added me on Facebook and I thought it was one of my old colleagues and accepted it. 

Everytime I texted him after that convo he would be blunt so I just gave up and stop texting.
He then texted me saying sorry for not talking to me but Maria hated me and he didn't know why. He was going to my city in Christmas and maybe we could meet. I said I was disappointed that this was his reason for cutting a 4 year friendship and that I didn't think it would be right to lie to his girlfriend to meet me. 

On Christmas I did a swipe on my Facebook and ended up deleting that person. 10 minutes after I received a text from Maria asking why did I delete her from Facebook. I responded that I didn't know her so I didn't know it was her . 
She accused me of hitting on her boyfriend (the conversation I said I missed him) and of trying to hide my tracks in Facebook. She also said her boyfriend has no interest in being my friend.
 I explained the conversation and said I have a boyfriend and live in a different country I don't understand why she hates me and I don't see her boyfriend that way. 

Obviously she didn't believed me and demanded I never spoke to him again. I decided I wanted him to be happy but didn't want to ghost him so I called him and said that we should not talk again. He said sorry and that it was all lies and that we could talk in secret. Obviously I said no if she found out it would be worse and that I was sad but wished him happiness but please don't tell her I called. 

So I now know I should have never called because she just texted me again. This time to ask why did I call him on Christmas if she told me to never speak to him again. She also said I feel very brave because I live abroad but if she ever sees me she will kick my ass (i am not worried about my safety I know Karate). She told me he said I used to trow myself at him and he would say no to me because he was afraid if he did something with me I would die and proceed to make fun of me(I have a heart condition). She warned me to never speak to him again and called me a bunch of names. 

If you are still reading thank you. I guess my question is what do I do ? She clearly just wants a fight and takes every opportunity to come talk to me, insult me and threaten me. I don't think she is going to stop.

My friends say he probably told her that I fancied him and turned the story around and that I should just tell her it was the other way around and send her proof  so she leaves me alone but I don't want to wreck his relationship with her... He seems happy...

Help?

The amount of inane bullshit is driving me crazy as I get more accustomed to the job market in this field. Everyone always talks about ""golly gee whiz every company needs tech people so go code"" and no one every mentions how incredibly stupid this industry is. Every fucking company keeps asking for side projects or a github. Are you fucking kidding me? A github? Would you ask an accountant how many fucking taxes they file for people in their spare time? I have enough work on my plate doing my college assignments, you want me to code for fun too? I come home and drink out of my godddamn juice box and watch netflix. Seriously, what other industry, besides art-based ones where you need a portfolio, would anyone fucking expect you to do your job for fun in your spare time??

Then there's the fucking languages. Hi, this is an entry level position, please know the following: 24 different javascript frameworks/libraries, ruby, html, css, C++, C Go, Java, Python, Scala, perl.... the fuck? Did someone from HR write this? Why the fuck do I need to know 100 different languages for this job? And why the fuck am I expected to have a so many internships from big 4 (fuck that term) companies.

Even if you manage to get a fucking interview good luck remembering how the fuck to do brain teaser linked list questions, a data structure you haven't seen since your first course in uni. Better start practicing those hacker-rank questions on top of your github projects!

So let's review: Make sure you have a great 3.0+GPA, make sure you have plenty of internships, make sure you're constantly reviewing how to use stupid data structures that you will NEVER use at your job, and make sure you live and breathe this shit because that github better have comitts from the day of your birth. I hate programmer-work culture. Not knocking anyone who loves it, but christ, this industry has a serious problem. "

I met her over the summer at a university internship and have seen her in ages. I was lucky enough to get her phone number and text her occasionally. But I've been texting her over the past week and haven't gotten anything back from her. God damn it, man! If only she knew how much she means to me. I have to put on a mask or a facade when I speak to my friends and family because I don't want them to know how truly broken I am. I called her once and got a laugh from her.

I need your help...,pelvicpain658,Endo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/5w5h3u/have_anyones_symptoms_returned_while_on_mirena/,"Hi Everyone! I have never posted online before, but I don't know what else to do. I want to thank in advance anyone who could help me. This is a long post, but I need to get this off my chest. I need someone to listen. I have not been diagnosed with Endometriosis , but I have so many similar symptoms  that I think I may have it. 

In advance TL,DR: Mom had endo, and I have always had painful periods until getting Mirena at age 20. Now after 6 years the symptoms are returning. I am seeking medical help, but I don't have a diagnosis and I feel helpless. Is this Endo? Do symptoms return after having Mirena for years?

My mom had endometriosis and painful periods. I have always had very heavy and painful periods (a whole box of Tampax Super Plus each month starting at age 11), and due to PMDD and painful periods I chose to get the Mirena IUD at age 20. This is when I learned that I had a retroverted uterus, but was told this was no concern. I no longer had periods, I was pain free, it was amazing. I had my Mirena replaced in 2015, on schedule. I was 25. Beginning in August 2016, I began having ovulation-type pain which also occurred when I was aroused and after sex. Each month since, the pain has gotten worse and lasted longer. Recently,  I have had pain, mild to severe, almost every day. I sometimes have spotting, but I don't have a monthly bleed. 

In December I tried to get a gyn appointment, and went to Planned Parenthood in the meantime to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Normal pelvic exam, he offered to remove IUD, he said it may be cysts. Beginning of January, went to urgent care due to the pain, and after a normal pelvic I was told that this may be normal monthly cramps BY A FEMALE DOCTOR. Finally, I went to my GYN appt with a FNP (she was the earliest appointment). Normal pelvic. She said that it may be cysts or possible endo since my Mom had it. Scheduled ultrasound. Given Naprosyn and BC pills.Told to go to ER if pain is level 10 severe, since they have the advanced testing machines like CT. The ultrasound showed a 3 cm haemorrhagic cyst on right ovary, told to reschedule in 8 weeks.  I had to go to the ER due to pain on Jan 25, about 1 week after ultrasound. There they did another ultrasound, that showed same condition on right ovary, 3 cm hemorrhagic cyst, and a new 3 cm simple cyst on left ovary. Told it may be PAINFUL OVULATION and to follow up with gyn again.

In desperation, I called the triage nurse line w/my insurance and I spoke with a gyn doc who ordered no refill 5/325 pain killers and a CT, which came back normal aside from Right haemorrhagic cyst. 

I have an appointment with an actual gyn md on March 8, and another ultrasound on March 15th. I have had to miss work and university courses because of the pain, it hurts to walk and sit directly down. I have burning behind my belly button, spastic cramping at times, and also pinching and stabbing pain in my ovaries and uterus, the pain is mainly on the left side. Also, I have pain in my back, left side. Pain radiates down my legs and inner thighs. I will become bloated after eating or drinking anything, sometimes even waking up looking 5 months pregnant. The swelling is sometimes more noticeable on the left, like I have a lopsided baby in there! I have pain in my lower left back /sciatica which seems to get worse when i have pelvic pain. I become so tired; I have effectively laid in bed all but 4 hours from Wednesday to Saturday Morning. This bout of pain began 28 days after my ER visit. 

Could this be Endometriosis? Have anyone's Endo symptoms returned after using Mirena for years? What should I tell the new doctor, so that I don't just get pushed to make another follow up?  I don't know how I can live like this and pass my classes and not lose my internship. Please, any advice you could give would help me. I live in San Diego, CA, and I have Sharp Health Plan as insurance."

There's something I need off my chest and it is thus that I post here. Long time reader of reddit, first-time commenter - I used to never have time for non-essential social media.

The bottom-line is that I'm unemployed, overqualified, bored, feeling poorly, and stuck in a place I don't want to be - all for no real reason at all.

So here we go, in a couple of quasi-chronological not-so-short bullet points:

* I have one bachelor's degree; the second one I am due to receive next month because of rather severe health issues. I did both at the same time in less than the standard three years while also being very active in and outside of university life.
* So yes, I used to be a very active guy. Five months ago, however, I fell very ill, and I have been stuck at home for months now, slowly recovering. Since then, most of my friends have left the country which, combined with my low energy levels, doesn't quite lend itself to an active social life.
* I did two internships at some point. I worked as a freelancer on three different projects in the last two years. I currently own a news website, but it's just now breaking even. I used to love volunteering at a variety of organisations, but due to my health I cannot do that anymore.
* The one good thing is that I have a book offer going on. The problem here is that I cannot possibly work under these conditions; my flat doesn't have central heating, I don't have the money to do anything fun - or eat properly - and most of my friends are gone so hanging out with them is no option.
* I feel like a stranger in this country and I feel more and more that I don't want to live in this political climate, yet I don't have the funds to move. I can't stay here, and I cannot move.
* I would do anything to get a job right now. No matter how many cover letters or references I submit - nothing. All my previous employers have said that I have outperformed and do still outperform all of my peers. Now, however, I'm stuck. My previous jobs were always offered to me, or I created an opportunity myself. I very much consider the option that I'm not just very familiar with the current dehumanising job search process. I feel like the market doesn't work. I would love to work on my own again, but if you can't eat or have fun, that's difficult.
* My parents are wealthy but strict and have basically given up on sending me money; they think I'm old enough to stand on my own. They're right, but I feel like this is really no longer up to me.
* I have tried everything. Either I don't have the experience, or I'm overqualified for the most menial jobs. I can't afford to move for yet another internship, because I'd end up losing money. 

I just want to contribute to society. I was made for public debate and public service, yet nobody will give me the opportunity to actually do something useful. I'd take anything; if I make enough change to be able to continue playing the violin, finishing my book and maybe go out once a week, maybe I can just sit it out. Right now, however, these problems dominate my life. If only it weren't so incredibly boring.

I fully realise I'm probably just spoiled, whining member of the literati, but it still bothers me. I'd love some advice, comforting words - even just knowing that there's somebody else out there with similar problems who will no longer feel he is the only one would be worth putting this drivel up on reddit.

Thank you.

5w6cr0,1,2017-02-25,"Advice for summer plans, first-year CS student w/ no car.",admin-admin,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5w6cr0/advice_for_summer_plans_firstyear_cs_student_w_no/,"Hey all, first post to r/personalfinance, I really hope I can get some insight as to what I should be doing with my time. Mostly I’m looking for help as to what I should be doing during my summer and where my money should be going.

I’m a second-semester Computer Science major at a state school in New York, currently with a GPA of 3.56. I’m here on full academic scholarship, but I take out $3500 in sub loans for room and board. I have about $1,000 in my savings account and about another $500 in checking, and get about $30 a week in child support money from my dad, which I usually spend  on groceries for myself.

While I live on campus most of the year, and can walk most places I need to be, I’m 19 years old and don’t have a car or driver’s license. My family lives in the woods so it’s mostly necessary to have a car or harass a family member who does.

While I worked the past 2 summers at a McDonalds I can walk to from my mom’s house (the only business I can get to with no car), I have no job currently. I’ve put applications into every business that’s in the strip mall I can walk to, but have not gotten a call back from any of them. I’m work-study eligible and plan on getting a position at the library IT help desk next fall, I have friends that can put a good word in for me.

Getting money for a car seems to be high on the list for where my money should be going, but I’m not convinced getting a used car as a college kid isn’t a huge money sink, and I’m not sure I need to be getting into that if I can walk most places while I live on campus.

Also with the release of AMD Ryzen I’m really wanting to upgrade my below-average PC, though I know it’s more of a hobby than anything and I probably should worry about other things.

While the ideal for my summer seems to be getting into that Microsoft summer internship where they pay to fly you out and house you while you work for them, I can’t guarantee being able to land that internship. The only other option for me right now seems to be another summer of flipping burgers, which seems like a huge waste of time compared to getting experience in my field.

Anyways, I’m not sure what else I could be doing over the summer without a car other than flipping burgers, and I don’t know how else I can be making money to afford a car, or if I even should given my situation. My family isn’t in the best financial situation, and can’t help me pay for a car or insurance just as much as they can’t help pay for my education or drive me to work every day. 

Any help with finding internships or job opportunities, or even just some advice on how to get ahead would be awesome. Please tell me if I’m missing any information that would be useful.

Besides an overall uncertainty, I have a few specific questions. First; I only know Java at the moment should I try and learn a language like Python quickly to boost my language count? What places besides programming internships wouldn't be a bad idea for it? Programming internships? Where are some goog places to look for them specifically? For reference, the only real place I could think of was a National(US) Laboratory close to where I live. Anything helps! Thank you in advance."

I just finished watching the short documentary with Tinker Hatfield on Netflix and a couple of weeks ago i read Phil Knights biography.
I am 18 years old and am currently studying business in what would be similar to highschool in the US, and i am graduating this summer. The last couple of years i have become more and more certain that i wanna work in the sneaker industry at least in some sort of position.
After watching the documentary with Tinker Hatfield i really wanted to get started drawing/designing some sneakers at least to get and understanding on how the best and most innovative sneakers work in detail and what is taking in too consideration when designing them.
This i were you guys come in: I need help! I have no idea where to get started.. I went to the bookshop an hour ago to buy pencils and a notebook, but now i do not know where to go. Can you guys recommend any good books to read, documentaries to watch, or some youtube channels i could get som inspiration from?
If you have any information regarding summer jobs / internships in companies like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Under Armour and so on i would also like to hear from you!
Thank you! -Anders"
5w6zdc,41,2017-02-25,"My thoughts on the fallacy of ""Moderation""",totallymanlytears,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5w6zdc/my_thoughts_on_the_fallacy_of_moderation/,"This is the most detailed post of my situation and my trials with ""moderation"", hope it proves valuable to those who risk their abstinence with the illusion of controlling your weed usage. In reality this is just proof that its still controlling you. 

Trust me please. It doesn't work. It really doesn't. You have been smoking weed for days, weeks, years? Look in the mirror and ask yourself; ""what has weed done to me"". Be very honest. Dark bags under your eyes, maybe yellowing teeth resulting for forgetting to brush frequently. Unkempt hair, dehydrated, malnourished. 

These were all daily realities for me when I was smoking an eighth a day. But you know what part of me really became ugly? My personality. I became complacent. I was happy watching my roommate with his GF and friends. I was happy sitting in my room crying due to the anxiety and stress weed brought into my life. I really mean I was happy too. My brain seemed to had rewired itself to enjoy the misery and pain, as I knew weed would level me out no matter my mood. I hated myself but hid it well. I hated myself so much I started mixing my weed bowls with tobacco. This combination was my favorite; The headrush made it so I couldn't think straight if I wanted to. The pain in my lungs felt sweet, as I knew I was hurting myself. Its fucked up to think about, but this was my way of slowly killing myself. I didn't reach out to friends, family, or peers for support. I made sure I was always wearing a mask, hiding my problems. Not even my roommates knew I smoked that much, so they encouraged my behavior. 


What was the final straw for me? Weed effecting my schoolwork. School is the only thing I care about really. I have a 4.0 in accounting and finance, having had internships, certificates, etc. I do well because I try, not because I am smart. That all changed this year. My self loathing reached new levels; I enjoyed the pain of ruining my life. I smoked all day every day since school started, skipping most of my classes. I would take my first ""mole"" (Mostly tobacco, little weed bowl) at 7am and smoke at every opportunity till I slept. Constant headaches, friends commenting on the smell of tobacco, yellow teeth, bad breath, and the worst anxiety ive ever dealt with. I failed 4 out of 4 of my midterms this semester. I am no longer graduating on time. Typing that out almost brought me to tears. Once I got those grades back I couldn't stand it anymore. I quit everything. Right there. I haven't smoked now in a month. I don't feel better at all. I have caused so many problems that I only now realize the severity of. But I am slowly becoming myself again. 

Where does moderation fit into this rant though, you ask? Well, I have tried to quit many times before this too. I have even quit for months before, only to convince myself that since I was able to stop I can surely moderate my use. Wrong. Sooo wrong. Sometimes it takes days, sometimes weeks, but I always relapsed. hard. But its ok right, its part of the process? NO. I don't think it has to be. Because I believe that moderation is impossible for people like us.

Ask yourself this: Has moderation ever been an option while you were abusing it day in and day out for YEARS? Did you ever go from heavy, daily use to only using it a few times a month? Of course not! Because you know that moderation leaves you unsatisfied and craving more. You know that you wanna smoke as much as possible without restriction, and you think its OK too because you're doing ""just fine"". WHO THE FUCK WANTS TO BEING DOING JUST FINE?! I dont. I want myself, but more importantly all of us, to be more than fine. Thats why were here, to become the best version of ourselves.

Trying to moderate your use is like texting your ex every 6 months to make sure she is still has hot as when she dumped you. You are ripping off the healed wound, but why? She never cared about you, and neither does weed. So stop obsessing on this stupid fucking plant and make something of yourself. Find another ""girl""; art, mountain biking, extreme ice fishing or whatever you're into. If you find your passion and put effort into that, opposed to sucking on a burning leaf, you will not only be happier but healthier too. 

Best of luck to all of you, promise me you won't make the same mistakes as me, by moderating weed you are really just tormenting yourself, dreaming of the times when it was great. Its not anymore. Its magic has been gone for years, now its time you face that fact."
5w7j9g,3678,2017-02-25,HEY GUYSSSS! I THINK I SOLVED THE CNN LEAKS: HERE IS WHAT IT IS!,mobileDevKing,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5w7j9g/hey_guyssss_i_think_i_solved_the_cnn_leaks_here/,"I was up late last night listening to part 2 of the CNN leaks.  I am a software developer so I was trying to solve the problem what these leaks really amount to. Unfortunately, a lot of people are discouraged, using the strategy [in the 1hr divide and conquer thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5vqlvw/project_veritas_signup_sheet_we_need_a_lot_of/de6z8yk/) of 200+ hrs most people will be listening to impossible to decipher open floor office chatter (while she works at her desk).  But there is a larger pattern, and it's big! I listened for more than 6 hrs last night (finding the one on one meetings only) from the first 3 days of leaks part 2 and I heard almost everything.

For one thing, each clip is a full (edit: work) day in the life of Sophia, an intern at CNN international desk.  Her day follows a fairly typical corporate pattern of large open floor office work(no cubicles), individual one on one meetings and group meetings. You can easily break down the audio files along these lines use Audacity (http://imgur.com/a/M5r18).  This removes the clutter and allows you to connect the dots

This is only for the first day (0020T  07-10-09) of the part 2 files.  But I listened to a few more days of audio (the date month day year is clear in each file’s title on Okeefs links) .  It’s horrible!  The entire thing tells the story of how they attempt to indoctrinate her.  **It’s a real life 1984, and these very leaks, transcribed and told to the world could very well be our generation's 1984!  I am not exaggerating, it’s that bad!**

And it’s all in the one on one meetings with her managers/editors.  All we need to do is identify the portions of audio during the one on one meetings, and transcribe them (which is easy since they are al in a (relatively) quiet office vs the open loud chaos of her open floor desk). 
Here is an example of the story I got out of only the first 3 days from part 2:

First, one of her managers(or editors)  doesn’t like the line she is taking on Honduras.  She pushes back, for young doe eyed Sophia believes the facts in their constitution make it quite clear which side has the stronger case, but the manager pushes back that “facts are not always facts” and tells her she is taking sides (the wrong side). He thinks she is possibly from Honduras (the casual racism) and maybe that’s why she has an opinion.  She argues she is from Pittsburgh, and doesn’t even have a stake in the matter. Her article is never published and she has to move on.  **She committed her first thought crime!**

She tries another story on the polls from the recent supreme court nomination of [Sotomeyor].   She presents that the polls show that her approval rating dropped, but the manager wants nothing to do with it.  “Those aren’t our polls” he tells her (in this case, he only means not the CNN poll).   Sophia argues rather convincingly that the CNN poll was from before her confirmation hearings, while the new polls show a drop in support after confirmation hearings, even ABC, NBC etc that don't have an axe to grind with the Obama admin.  But the story she is writing is clearly not CNN's political line! **She committed thought crime 2!**  The guy launches into a whole diatribe trying to convince her why fox news and right wing press is so wrong/sore losers bad perspective, trying to break her down and move her to the politics CNN wants.

I haven’t gotten far enough, but let me guess, this one doesn’t get published by CNN either!  I bet she doesn't get offered a full time position at CNN, that's for sure. This is amazing and we need to tell her story!   This is 1984 in real life!


How to solve it: 

* 1.)	Download the mp3 by day from okeefs site [gif for how to do this here](http://imgur.com/LjA7c0W)
* 2.)	Open in Audactiy (make sure title of file is visible) and take a screen shot
* 3.)	Open in image editor and edit like I have in gif(http://imgur.com/TnNpgrm). In audacity the meetings are easier to find since you can jump around and notice the meetings have similar visual characteristics vs the open office
[How to edit the image:]  (http://imgur.com/TnNpgrm)
* 4.) Upload to image hosting site and post!	
* 5.)	Work together to transcribe only the 1:1 meetings (and maybe  group) meetings initially. The casual racism and identity politics in the group and interns meetings is amazing!  (someone can filter the open office time later, it’s not worth wasting our time transcribing on first pass).
* 6.)	**Assemble the dialog into ALL or combo of web, book, video, animated, digital or even live theatre / screenplay/ movie/ documentery form.**
* 7.)	**Profit/ donate to OKeef and nail these bastards!**


**TLDR:  It's our generation's 1984 and it's real!**

edit:  This approach will cut the amount of (initial) transcribing needed by more than 3/4. We can circle back to review the open office chatter (i know a few nice gems have already been found there) but it's not central to the story and is a waste (IMO) of initial resources while the story is still hot.

edit: added some missing grammer, apostrophies 


EDIT:  UPDATE    -- I started a website:  https://sites.google.com/view/cnn1984/home
it has links to the audio (I cropped and uploaded to sound cloud) only for important sections from first day of part 2 . I will be working on following days to highlight the narrative I have mentioned. Please pm me to help transcribe only the 1:1 audio portions i links

EDIT 2-26 UPDATE -- Added transcripts for first two conversations thanks to user r/streezus .  We made some name mistakes on Arthur Brice, we are trying to correct as the names become more clear as transcriptions come in.  Need the first few conversations with Arthur Brice transcribed, first one is 25 min long (user r/MinionCommander in progress) please pm me if you want to help me transcribe the audio segments I pulled out and posted on soundcloud at: https://sites.google.com/view/cnn1984/home

5w7rql,9,2017-02-25,Is Izuku's special treatment getting out of hand?,HokageEzio,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/5w7rql/is_izukus_special_treatment_getting_out_of_hand/,"So I was having this discussion with somebody in the latest chapter discussion about how Izuku has been getting more and more special treatment, so I wanted to do a post about it alone for everybody to see.  Personally, it seems like Izuku is getting more and more special treatment all the time, where even when he makes a mistake it doesn't matter because of who he is.  And I personally think it's starting to get annoying, but I'll go through it fully.  

And just to start it off before anybody gets all butthurt about it, yeah Izuku is the main character and will obviously get special treatment.  I just think it's getting a bit ridiculous at this point.

---

Now, obviously there is stuff from the beginning like Izuku passing the entrance exams for one rescue and all, but that stuff makes sense.  And even with how they handled Stain, it makes sense to a degree that they brushed that one under the rug because of how dangerous Stain was and how much promise Iida, Shouto, and Izuku have.  But ever since that point, it just seems to be getting out of hand.  

* So, first off we have Izuku's injuries.  Now, he has been told multiple times the damage he is doing to his arms and he has obviously changed his style accordingly.  But other than scars on his arm that look nasty, has he really suffered anything?  I would argue no.  He has not lost any of the functionality in his arms that we know about, because the doctor said if he does regular rehab they'll be back to normal.  So the only real damage is cosmetic and his ""deteriorating ligaments"" that show no signs of weakness.  Even though he has injured the same spot over and over again, it's not any worse than it was originally.  Which I think is a little crazy.  You can't injure the exact same spot over and over again and be as good as you were prior, just ask [this guy.](http://www.bigplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/drose.jpg)

* Next argument that was brought up originally was that emotionally, Izuku has been having drawbacks.  For example, hurting his mom's feelings getting hurt all the time.  But again my argument was, what drawbacks?  The only drawback Izuku has seemed to suffer is that his mom thought about taking him out of school, only to be convinced not to take him out of school.  He doesn't really seem to blame himself for All Might's fall either, as Bakugou does.  All Might was going to be out of the picture sooner or later anyway, we all know that.  Izuku seems to be in the same state emotionally as he has been for a long time.

* Next we have Aizawa's reaction to the Raid.  Where he fully tells Izuku and everybody that went that they broke the law, which is now Izuku's second time doing this, where he and everybody with him get no punishment.  Now, obviously expelling an entire class of students is a bit ridiculous, but the fact that nobody who went on that mission even got a slap on the wrists is just as ridiculous in my opinion.  Just like Stain, their efforts are appreciated, but that doesn't change they broke the law.  At the very least, Iida, Izuku, and Shouto getting off with only a warning seems weird to me.

* Next we have the fight, which is where it really starts to stand out to me that Izuku is getting an annoying level of special treatment to me.  Bakugou got 4 days for starting it, Izuku got 3 days suspension for participating.  That makes sense.  What doesn't make sense to me is that Aizawa held off *the entire class* from receiving information about the internships for three days because of one student.  17 students (because Shouto can't participate) had to wait for one student who got himself in trouble of his own accord.  I just find that a bit ridiculous and Aizawa (Horikoshi by default) playing favorites.  It's like [Dumbledore giving Gryffindor last minute points to put them in the lead for the House Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iGTlfmjtQU), but without the ""I saved the entire school gimme my fucking points"" action.

* And the moment that spawned this whole discussion to begin with, the recent chapters.  We learn from Mirio that Sir has some incredibly strict standards and you have to make him laugh basically just to get a seat at the table.  Something Izuku bombed at.  In that week's discussion, I remember somebody talking about how basically ""who cares, we all know he's going to get the internship anyway"".  And I can't find myself necessarily disagreeing.  But of course, he connects on his absolute nerdiness for All Might and avoids getting the door slammed on him two seconds in.  He is then given an ultimatum, take the stamp in three minutes if you want to show you're worth being here.  This absolutely rare chance that Sir has never given anybody before.  But because Izuku didn't step on a poster, here he is.  A new intern.  Because Sir was going to do it from the start, that rascal!!  Wonder how many single digit chapters it will take for Sir to be impressed...

---

I just personally think it's getting a bit annoying that Izuku will never actually lose out on something because of a failure.  He breaks the law, nothing.  He fails tests, nothing.  He's always given the benefit of the doubt or given a platform to still move forward, even if he doesn't necessarily deserve it.  I can't think of the last time Izuku had to suffer a legitimate punishment for any of his actions, by legitimate I mean something that isn't a slap on the wrists.  

Plus personally I think Izuku is starting to get annoying with the way he operates.  For example, he talked about how his body just moved when he went after Bakugou in the Raid even though he had two whole hours to think about it and clearly had a plan going in.  

Another was in the recent chapters, where Izuku almost destroyed his giant opportunity for an internship because of a piece of paper with All Might's face on it, even when told he can hit anything in the room.  Which I thought was even more annoying because Izuku has already shown in the past that he understands that he has to sometimes throw out his morals a bit to be the best.  For example, All Might had no clue that he had it in him to be competitive in the Tournament because of how nice he is.  Another, when he was doing the License Exam and he looked somebody in the eye as he eliminated them because of his goal, something that obviously doesn't really go with his nice guy nature.  Yet even after learning from Bakugou that he needs to have more of a Mamba Mentality and go all out, here he is ready to blow his opportunities over a piece of paper.  Makes him look kinda like a pansy to me, personally.

---

---

That's pretty much it, if you want to see the original thread it's [in here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/5vpivs/chapter_128_links_and_discussion/de3zuzl/)  

**TL;DR** - It's starting to feel like Izuku is being given a silver spoon in all situations and cannot fail no matter what he does.  He doesn't need to find connections, he can't get in trouble with the law, the class is completely styled around him, and the other stuff I said above.  Maybe it's just me, who knows."
5w7vf7,3,2017-02-25,Why I Finally Left - TODAY,MeaoMeao,sgiwhistleblowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/5w7vf7/why_i_finally_left_today/,"So after much hemming and hawing (not to mention a desire to be as passive and non-confrontational as possible), I have finally sent off a letter (their own rule) requesting an uncoupling! 


The tipping point was when the **'reaching out'** started again after I had already made it known that I was never going to another meeting - *ever!* That was in January of last year - and the calls and home visits continued until just after the end of the May Commemorative Contribution campaign. All about the money - of course!


Cut to this month, when the calls and random home visit attempts started up out of the blue. I simply could not figure it out... (May is a few months away - and **Mentoar-saurus** is still alive *(allegedly)...* 


Then after I mistakenly answered a phone call from an unknown number - the caller explained. I am aging out of one division - and into another! That would explain the voice-mail messages from three different individuals. :-/ 


And this person, let's call him 'Bob' knew all about me! Including recent events in my life (graduation and a new {low-paying, entry-level} job). Then he started the cult psychology - **'Sensei'** made all this possible for **ME** and it was time to 'make a determination' (i.e., *set a huge goal for my donation this year*)... **Excuse me!? **


He then started talking about how he and his wife challenge themselves every year to *'beat their personal record'* (**donate more and more money**). And about the benefits they get from doing so. **Seriously?** And when 'Bob' realized that I was not buying what he was selling, he went for the emotional aspect - making determinations shows how serious one is about the *Gohonzon* - and it removes obstacles in one's life. 


Story one was about someone who wanted to get into a competitive graduate program but could not afford it - after pledging a hefty sum of money, they were offered a scholarship out of the blue and a paid internship! Magical! I believe stories like those appear in the World Tribune every year. Story two was about a couple having problems conceiving - they had already spent a lot of money going to out of state specialists to no avail. After making 'a determination,' a miracle baby was conceived naturally!  


Granted, I do not know if 'Bob' knew these individuals personally (I think that similar stories appear in the World Tribune every year - from my memory of reading that stuff). And it is an effective sales pitch to my demographic - career or family. But it sounded (to me) as if it was rehearsed or read from a script by a Telemarketer.


So is this what it has finally come to? A sales pitch in late February using emotional baiting? Maybe they don't normally start the sales pitch this early, but since I'm about to move from one group to another, why not start now? 


I was never a regular attendee (only ever been to a handful of Kofu Gongyo and Discussion Meetings. I also attended one Ikeda Wisdom Academy event - that was a little scary, to be honest). *I will say this unequivocally: the*  **ONLY**  *time anyone ever came out of the woodwork was when my subscriptions were nearing expiration or it was the May Contribution Drive.*  I take that back -- there were also several sales pitches for me to join the Gajokai. (Give **money** and **time!** )


So today, I sent out a letter to National HQ requesting **'Voluntary Termination of Membership'** because I fear that a letter sent to the local offices here will not be processed. I also requested that they send me *written confirmation* when my request has been fulfilled. In addition, I requested that my Membership Information Card either be returned to me or destroyed. (I know THAT will never happen, but I can wish). 


It's been almost 9 years - and during 8 of those 9 years, I was fully subscribed and donated every single year (token amounts - well, more than token amounts - who wants to be shamed) *to stop the phone calls, home visits, and e-mails.* I never moved, but did change my cellphone number three times - and they always found it somehow (I have one family member who is active - the probable cause of the leak).


I was hoping to be loosely affiliated long enough to witness Ikeda's funeral service. You all just know *THAT will be AN EVENT!* **But no... the insanity must end - NOW!**

My Dad's best friend has been around since I was 15. And was the first man I ever had a crush on. He's ten years younger than Dad. But when they had a business merger, which made them a lot of money, he invited his new friend and business partner over for dinner. Mom was happy to meet him as well. Anyone who made Dad richer made Mom happy. Meant she could get away with going shopping on her credit card more. And then just make it up to my Dad later. In private. Since I knew she really liked to use Dad's foot fetish against him. It's kind of hard to forget when you see your Dad on his knees in front of your Mom doing that. The flashy heels. The  licking. The heavy petting. And then scaring them because they were caught. All because their only female child had a nightmare and wanted to be comforted. The thought of that night and others like them still make me shiver. 



Dad's best friend though. He was like a man's man. You could tell that he kept himself in shape. And he dressed well. In tailored suits. So they would hug every part of his body just right. And give off that clean and well trimmed appeal to clients and being the Boss of his firm.  And it probably also got women to notice him in a crowd. If he went to the right bar. Seeing him like that time after time for dinner just made me melt inside and, well, between my legs. Sometimes it felt like he didn't know the affect he had on women.



When I graduated from High School he sat with my parents. Cheering me on alongside my parents as I walked across the stage. Making butterflies flit about my stomach even more. And he stayed for the graduation party that my Father threw with Mom's party planners help. There was elegant food and plenty of picnic tables in the yard for everyone to enjoy the nice weather. Dad was proud of me. I had graduated as the number one student in my class and had written a speech as valedictorian. And I had been accepted to the college my Father went to for the Fall. Yale. When he found out he was over joyed. I mean I was happy too. I was going to a really good school. So, unlike my older brother, I could follow in his footsteps and work in field of law. I wasn't sure if I was going to be a lawyer. But I knew I could figure it out at Yale. 



Dad's friend and I had a moment alone at the party. I had gone to my room to be alone for a moment and he was there. Looking around in my room. He had a black bag in his hand. Holding it by the strings. He looked up at me with a smile. Which made my face flush and my knees weak. I walked over to my desk so I could lean on it. So I wouldn't fall over in front of him. Then he moved closer to me. Looking me over with those dangerous eyes that any girl could fall into. 


""Your speech was really great. Full of wisdom I didn't expect from a 18 year old woman. I think it was the perfect send off for your class."" He said. 



He held up the bag to me.


""Would you open my gift here?"" He asked. 



I nodded and gingerly took the bag from his hand. I turned my body a little and set the bag on my desk. I opened it and there was a card on the top.  I smiled. I opened it. There was a gift card to my favorite store. For $1,000. Which made my jaw drop a little. I recovered and then noticed something else under it. I put the card down and took out the thing in bag. It was hoodie sweater. I let it fall open. I smiled when I saw that it said Yale. And it was one size bigger than the usual size I bought. How did he know that I did that?



I looked up at him and there was a sparkle in his eyes. Like seeing my reaction had made him happy.



""Um..Thank you. For all of this. It means a lot. I honestly didn't even expect you to be here."" I replied. ""So thank you for coming and thank you for the graduation gift.""



""Its not a problem. I'm happy to be here. I was happy for you when your Dad said you decided on Yale.  I went there as well."" He replied. ""So I feel like its a right of passage to get you the sweater. And the gift card is so you can get some clothes that are respectable for a college wardrobe.""



I smiled. I was trying to resist the temptation to push myself up off the desk and kiss him. To show how thankful I really was. But I didn't I stayed put. Trying to make sure I was breathing right. He licked his lips briefly. Then he leaned in to kiss my cheek. But I moved my head and his lips landed on mine. I kissed back. Which led to more kisses. My arms wrapping around his neck. Chest to chest as we kissed. Then we heard foot steps and broke apart. I looked at the card. My Dad walked into my room. Rambling about this is where we had been hiding. That Dad and him needed to go to Dad's study to talk a little business before going back to the party. 



When they left the room I went to the bed and hugged myself. I had gotten to kiss a man I had lusted after for so long.  The party ended at midnight that night. Sometimes I would catch him looking at me. But I tried to focus on having fun with my friends. Enjoying the food. The cake. And etc. Summer was over before I knew it and I was packing up for college. Mostly with clothes I had never worn before. Because of the gift card. I moved into my dorm. And had an awful roommate my first year. Second year wasn't so great either. Third year I got lucky and had my best friend as a roommate. But it was summer again. And I had to do a internship at a law firm. 


Which my Father, of course, got me a prime one at the firm he co-owned. And the person I was to report to and help all summer was Dad's friend.



This was going to be a long summer. As a 20 year old female intern. And being around a man whose touch I longed for again. That no college lover or Boyfriend had been able to make me feel. Compared to how it felt that night at my graduation party.  



I looked around my college dorm. I was all packed. Dad and him were using their cars and mine to get my stuff home. Where I would be staying for the summer like always.  Seeing him lift boxes and plastic tubs of my stuff was somehow sexy. And I was aching between my legs. Oh. How I wanted that man. 



Between our 3 cars everything got home and unloaded in the same day. I spent the next few days unpacking what I needed. My mom had surprised me one day with a shopping spree for office appropriate outfits for the summer. Since she knew I had none and Dad approved it. Mom didn't stop until I had enough to rotate through in month. To keep myself looking fresh. And, of course, shoes to go with them. 


And now here I was. In front of his office. Setting up a desk that had a plaque with my name on it. I was nervous and excited all at once. Because I had been working very hard in college on my courses to become a lawyer. 

All I had to do was survive being this close to him. Every week day this summer.

___________________________________________________

So at this point in time she is 20 years old. Her Dad is 45 years old. So the male lead is 35 years old. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. This character needs to be played as the Alpha type. That knows what needs to be done in his public and private life. And very much so knows what he wants in his love affairs as well. 

So..How will you play this character and get her to fall into his idea of fun? While keeping appearances of being professional at the office? While dealing with the struggle that they are falling for each other? And what her Father will think?


Turn OFF's: Anal, scat/piss, blood, rape, heavy S&amp;M, Deep Throat blow job,and being degraded.



Turn ON's: Light biting and biting back, kissing, Having my earlobe bitten/suckled on lightly, having my boobs played with, Oral Sex(Giving and getting), breeding kink, cream pies, moderately rough sex, Cuffs for the wrists, under the bed wrist/ankle cuff system(With consent/safe word), Lingerie, and fingered on my g-spot.



Thanks for reading! Hope to see you light up my inbox!

This sub has been a home to me the past year and a half. I spent a lot of time in Physics class reading all of your stories and posts, slowly planning one of my own. 
I am a 19 year old who is studying Computer Science at a university. I have been fixing iPhone screens at my university to save up money for a Sprinter van (I was fortunate enough to not have to pay out of pocket for my degree).

My goal is to save enough money with screen repairs and internships (I'm waiting to hear back from IBM right now, but I believe that they are going to hire me!) that I will be able to live out of my van for a year after I graduate. My plan is to buy a van off Craigslist as soon as I get an internship this summer. I will make enough money to pay it off during the summer. Additionally, my college is in a small town, and I intend on using the van as my daily vehicle.
My plan is to rock climb and travel, as well as just enjoy the smaller things in life before I get caught up in the daily grind of coding for a living. 

Has anyone had similar experiences? And if not, share yours anyways. I want to hear from you, especially if you are a college student who admires this lifestyle (even if you aren't living it yet). 

I know my post doesn't really have any real questions/ goals, but as (mainly) a lurker, I wanted to post something to get myself excited, as I hopefully will be buying a van shortly."

5w9810,2,2017-02-26,Me [20F] super scared about romantic relationships conflicting with my career,scxj09,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5w9810/me_20f_super_scared_about_romantic_relationships/,"[Warning: long post + tons of rants ahead]

Quickly introducing myself: female engineering undergrad student with two years left in my degree.  Asian, first generation North American.  Career-oriented and ambitious.  Tomboyish and not pretty.

 I know it is too early for me to be worried about marriage and having kids and all that, but romantic relationships in general have been on my mind recently, and I feel like I really need to vent.

I am a very ambitious individual.  I do not mind putting in extra hours in school or at work (I've done internships) to get ahead.  I am also ultra-competitive and like to be the leader.

As many of my classmates and friends start to date, I've been increasingly worried about what kind of relationship I will have in the future, and how it will affect my career, and my life in general.  My worries come from my parents' marriage.  

Both of my parents work in tech.  My mom is a tough women and extremely career-oriented.  My dad is also very capable but my mom is the more ambitious one in my opinion.  When I was young, my dad's career is ahead of my mom's.  However, my dad unsuccessfully try to start his own company for a few times, and after almost two decades of failure, he still refuses to give up.  He hasn't made any money, not a single buck.  During these two decades, my mom has been the sole breadwinner of the house.  She is unhappy and thinks that my dad is ""useless"".  My dad, not being able to make money, also does not do any housework around the house, and took little part in raising me.  All the money-earning, housework, taking care of elders and raising me was done by my mom.  I can feel the emotional toll it took on my mom.  She would get mad at me for trivial matters, and thinks kids should be yelled at, and not talked to.  Growing up, my mom always teach me to be ambitious and have a career goal, which I did.  However, as I grow older and begin to enter the dating age, her opinion changed.  She attributed her unfortune to the fact that she was not being a traditional, submissive, good wife.  She felt that her career aspiration killed my dad's manliness and turned my dad away from her.  She felt if she was not as ambitious, my dad would remain the good husband and father he used to be when they just got married.  So, she reverted her approach of teaching me to be ambitious, and instead, suggested me to take up mommy-track career paths, dress up, go on diets, learn to put on makeups, and tone myself down in front of men.  She tried to instill me with misogynistic ideas.  Although at this age, I am able to think for myself, her struggle with an unsupportive husband as well as the changes in her view towards gender role still haunt me on a daily basis.

What bugs me more are the things I see around me.  Many of my North-American-born friends hold the same view as my mom.  One time I had a discussion with my best friend about what we would do later on in life.  When I said I would like to continue working after having children, my friend said, ""I feel bad for your children"", and stared at me as if I am the most selfish person on earth.  And not to mention hearing the degrading and objectifying comments about women made by my classmates.  This is 2017! This is North America!! Hello??? 

I do not want to be like the SAHMs I see on sports fields, watching their kids play while gossiping about the bad things that other people's kids have done.  I do not want to be like the young mother I saw at a bubble tea shop, struggling to stop her two kids from fighting with each other while her husband shared what he learned about some of the newest technologies with his friend.  I do not want to be the woman who, after obtaining a master degree from one of the most prestigious university in Asia, and landing an offer at a tech giant, worked at the same company for two decades, so that her husband can try starting his company.  I cannot forget how my mom painfully tries to force a smile of her face, and agrees blindly with my dad just to act submissive, in order to preserve my dad's ""head of the household"" status.  I have seen way too many young couples, who started out having egalitarian relationships, until the arrival of their first child.  

I have my dreams, and my career aspirations.  I do not want to be woman who puts her career on the back burner for her husband.  I see myself leading teams, working with the latest technologies, and I don't want to trade that future, for a future of pushing strollers behind my future husband.  

Sure, some women are lucky enough to have husbands who support their careers, but supportive husbands are like gems, and marriage is like gambling.  You never know if your once-supportive husband would turn into an a-hole, and scold you for not taking care of your children five or ten years after getting married.  On top of that, because of some of the crap I went through in my childhood, and the fact that I am not very attractive, and does not have very feminine personalities, my dating pool is severely limited.  It is highly likely that even if I do get married, I would be settling with a ""good-enough"" guy.

I have not had any relationships so far.  Sometimes I thought to myself, maybe I will just stay single forever, being single shouldn't be that bad after all (my mom and my dad just filed for divorce, my mom is happier than ever nowadays, her career has only gone upward too because now I'm in college).  Sometimes, on other days, I thought I might as well just lower my expectations, get married, and limit my ambition, a family is still nice to have after all.  Every couple of days, I shift from one view to another, and then back to the other view after a few more days.  Many nights I go to sleep crying thinking about how fk-ed up this world is, only to wake up the other day, and seeing the sun is bright, and everything is still fine.  The overthinking, and the what-ifs have been killing me.  

Now, enough of my rants.  I am just wondering, am I thinking too much?  Has anyone been in the same experience before (I've seen A LOT of positive stories on reddit, but is that what reality is like?)?  What advice would you give me?  What should I do? I would like to thank everyone ahead of times for helping me out!!!

5wa725,1,2017-02-26,Not sure if I [21/M] should tell her [23/F] that I like her,Jeff7424,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5wa725/not_sure_if_i_21m_should_tell_her_23f_that_i_like/,"**tl;dr**: I knew this girl for almost a year and like her for few months but not sure if I should tell her. According to her best friend, she doesn't have the thought of having a relationship because she wants to focus on her career, and I'm not sure if I should tell her, need some advice on whether I should tell because my friends told me to just tell her how I feel and maybe she'll say yes.

So I knew this girl when I was having an internship in a games company and she was an assistant project manager (was because she left and got a new job). At first I didn't know how to start a conversation with her, then I found out that she'll go for smoke break after lunch, and that's how I break the ice LOL. We talked about a lot of things - friends, funny moments, politics etc. Then she said she couldn't wake up as she always missed the alarm, so I offered to gave her morning call every day to make sure that she made it on time to work, and she accepted. Few months later my internship ended as my student pass expired and I have to go back to my country while waiting for my new student pass, and we kept in touch through text. Once in a while I'll go back to Singapore and stayed for a bit and hangout with her, sometimes she asked me out and sometimes I asked. We went out for dinner / shopping / play Pokemon Go / just chill somewhere near her place quite often, about once a week. I started to like her and wanted to ask her but was too afraid because she's older than me.

Then I started my studies in university. We do still text each other but our conversation got shorter as she got a new job and I was busy studying and working part-time. Then I asked my best friend what should I do to show that I like her and see what's her reaction, and he told me to maybe send her home or treat her meals or movies and after a while pop the question, and I did what he said, send her home every time we went out together, treat her meals / movies, bought breakfast for her sometimes, but she doesn't seem to have any response. I started to do even more things, help her out, gave her encouragement but still she still doesn't seem to have any idea that I like her. (Does asking me to text her when I got home a response? I'm not sure...)

During December last year, I gave her a book that she wanted with the author's signature, and she loved it, said it was the best present she ever received. Then a week before Christmas my company's having a Christmas party and my boss said I can bring a plus one to the party if I have any, so I asked her and she said yes. I was planning to tell her that night after the event, but then the date of the event changed as our HR couldn't make it, and then she couldn't come because she got something on. Then I planned to tell her on Christmas eve but her best friend invited her over to her Christmas party, so I decided to tell her on New Year's eve instead, then again her best friend invited her over to her New Year's dinner.

Last month it was her birthday, and I thought I'd do something for her and tell her after that. So I brought her to a fancy dinner place, had dinner and cake, and fun. I gave her another book and she said it was the best birthday present she ever received. I thought it was the best time to tell her when I send her home that night because it seemed like it's the right time, but then she said she have to go back to office after dinner as she still have some things to settle before going back home, so again I didn't tell her. I did offer to send her home after she finish her stuff but she insisted that I go home first and asked me to text her when I got home. 

After that I approached her best friend if I should really tell her because the timing isn't always right and she doesn't seem to know that I like her (I didn't ask her before that because I was afraid that she would tell her about it and she'll ghost on me). She told me that she's actually not in the mood of wanting a relationship because she wants to focus on her career and said best is to wait for now because she's not sure when she will be ready. Then I asked around my friends and all of them said I should just tell her, and they said if she didn't ignore me and even accepted my offer to help her and hangout with me that could means that she probably likes me, and she'll probably recall back all the things I've done for her and she might accept? So the question is should I really tell her? I have this dilemma for a few months already and I'm really lost. We knew each other for almost a year and I don't want to lose her because of me saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Thanks in advance. :(

5wb693,0,2017-02-26,Another Top 5 Worst Mistakes Wolfie Has Done At Conventions,BoricuaPepsiPlunge,howardstern,https://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/5wb693/another_top_5_worst_mistakes_wolfie_has_done_at/,"my Hiatus of writing the last 3 entries of the Top 10 Worst Convention Coverages is almost over. In the meantime, it's time for another Top 5 featuring Weak Obnoxious Lying Fraudulent Itiotic Egomaniac (W.O.L.F.I.E) has done at Conventions.


#5. ""Howard: Was this convention more loserish than Comic Con? Wolfie: Yeah, it is!""

This is one of the main reasons why I personally hate Wolfie. Everytime when the question is asked about a convention if it's loserish, he just comes out and replies with a ""yes."" My question, as a con-goer, how? I've been to conventions before and what Wolfie said about being loserish is bullshit because he has no evidence to back it up. The only way a convention is considered loserish is that if it was completely disorganized (DashCon) or scammed its attendees and guests (Los Pegasus Unicon and JumpCon). This clearly shows that Wolfie is a fucking Sunstormer to Stern.

Most of you who are reading this have no idea what a sunstormer is. A sunstormer means that you are a major ass kisser and you make yourself inferior to the person you suck up to. I came up with that term as it was based off *Transformers: Animated* character Sunstorm, a clone of Starscream who represented his personality of being a suck up (in the original *Transformers G1* series, he thinks that he is the living embodiment of the Will of Primus, placed by the divine in this universe to deal righteous judgment on the blasphemous).

#4. Wolfie: Gary, I need you to tamper the audio for PonyCon 2014.

Yeah, you heard that correct. Wolfie faked an interview from PonyCon 2014. How it went: Wolfie ""claimed"" he interviewed two people in NYC were Big Apple PonyCon 2014 and they played the clip of an African American guy getting interviewed.

HOWEVER...............that clip was fake! That clip came right out of BronyCon 2013! So, Wolfie lied and fooled the listeners and Howard Stern into believing that clip was in New York when in reality, IT WAS FROM BALTIMORE. What a way to cover your tracks, you fucking fraud.

#3. ""I hire new whackpackers to make my interviews the highlight of the show for ratings, since I'm getting stale now!""

He hired Mick the Nerd and recently, Ruby the stutter. Truth be told: neither of these dumbasses made me laugh! I'm sorry, Wolfie, but you can't make this guy laugh when you hired these two. All it did was put me to sleep.

#2. ""I have freedom of press rights but I got banned from this con! WWWAAAAHHHH!!!!""

Boo fucking hoo, Mr. Fraud! Yes people, your precious idol got banned from several cons for violation of the Press Policy. When you signed the Press Pass and accepted the Press Policy, you have to be sign and ask questions that are general. However, Wolfie would never sign anything and sneak inside the convention and ask disrespectful, asinine questions. This alone had led to some cons around his region to ban him permanently. Case in point: RetroCon, BronyCon, PonyCon, and Monster Mania had banned Wolfie and any Howard Stern intern. If Wolfie violates his ban, a lawsuit is filed (yes, that does happen. Convention staff have the right to do that).

The only he can get out is if he apologizes but who am I kidding? Wolfie's a jerkoff.

#1. Unlikable Asshole 101

Just like No. 2, Wolfie's biggest mistake at every convention is that he's a major, unlikable asshole. That alone is what led to him getting banned and backlisted from the conventions. Must I recall from the last countdown, Wolfie played victim and said **""I tried to be a nice guy.""** You **TRIED** but you **WEREN'T!** You never were nice to con-goers and attendees! You asked questions that were disgusting and tasteless, you nearly got into fight with BronyCon security in 2014, you sexually harassed someone at PonyCon (I got a screenshot of the conversation between a brony who reported the whole incident on facebook), you were a jerkoff in all of interviews, you show no remorse nor regrets when you ask questions involving ones personal life, and so on and so forth. When you put all of this together, it sums up one thing: **Wolfie is an unlikable asshole!**


That concludes this countdown. Be back in March for the final three of Top 10 Worst Convention Coverages of All Time.

Dad (60s) is only vaguely in the picture. Me and little sister live in different countries (not our home country).

My middle sister (31F) is there perfect storm of what I can only describe as middle child syndrome, daddy’s baby (gold child syndrome), narcissist, always the victim, and probably some form of (undiagnosed) BPD. I see her as mentally ill and limit my contact with her because don’t want to be accused of not reading her mind or hating her or having her tell me I ruined her life and she has been keeping a list of ‘horrible things I’ve done to her’ that apparently runs all the way back to elementary school. I see her maybe 2 times a year and kind of forget she exists the rest. /r/JustNOSister. My mother and I, however, are very close and speak nearly every day; I am probably closer to her than most other people in my life, so this situation is really difficult for me.

She went into the same profession as my mother (same kind of Dr), and through a combination of idiocy on both parts and (I feel) pretty manipulative behavior on my sisters part (untreated depression, panic attacks and mental breakdowns, self medicating with prescription drugs, playing the victim card and never actually applying for jobs anywhere because ‘nobody would hire her anyway’) they now work together. God damn idiots.

And, for the past 7 years, it has been hell. From day 1. She is a very good doctor, but is a horrible employee and partner. She treats my mother like garbage, does not respect her or her authority, undermines her in front of their physician employees, nurses and patients, refuses to get involved in any paperwork, billion or admin that goes with running an office. My sister is, literally, behaving like a 13 year old brat. She made my mother fire one of the PAs because she ‘didn’t like her smell’, refuses to attend trainings needed, complains that my mother ‘is a thief’ because she’s not paid enough (even though this is above what she would make anywhere else) and if she’s upset will not talk to my mother for weeks at a time, making daily work a nightmare. My sister basically hates my mother (she tells me and little sister this) but won’t leave because of course being a bully with a lot of power earning a lot isn’t really a reason to quit.

And my mom… seems completely powerless. They have gone through multiple rounds of mediation, she has sent my sister to a therapist (I think she went like twice), they have seen a career coach… and every time things are better for a couple of weeks, and then we’re back to where we are. Lately things seem to be really bad again; my mother is crying on the phone and telling me she isn’t sleeping and is dreaming of my deceased grandmother and hates going to work and is incredibly depressed. Her main reason for not firing my sister is that she is convinced (rightly so, I think) that my sister would never forgive her and cut all contact for the rest of her life.

This situation is incredibly difficult for the family as a whole. I spent enough time in therapy myself coming to terms with the fact that I am working my ass off applying for jobs, internships, working for free, being a decent person and struggling to get by while my sister sits in her nest and is an asshole about it. It is very hard not to be resentful, especially when I hear things like the great vacations my sisters is taking and the new car she bought while I’m barely getting by. And watching my mother be so unhappy is torture… she is so sad and powerless and is basically in an abusive relationship and it’s so painful to see.

I have tried everything from the more forceful ""you need to get out!"" to the softer ""maybe you just need to see a therapist yourself again?"" to the more guilt-trippy ""how would you feel if I was in a relationship like that for years and cried to you about it but didn’t seek help?” and… nothing. It is now affecting the relationship I have with my mother and me and my little sister can’t get around talking about it either.

Any advice at all on how to proceed? Maybe I just need to disengage, but it’s really, really hard to watch. I just want my mother to be happy in these last years before retirement and it’s killing me to see her go through this sh*t all the f*cking time.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My mother and sister are in the same profession and my sister joined my mom's practice, and it's a nightmare. My sister is unprofessional, abusive, and a bully, and my mother does not seem to be able to get out/fire her/do anything about it. It's killing me to watch this happen, and I have no idea what to do. "
5wd3lt,4,2017-02-26,[M4F] The Key to the Future is Within Us All,MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5wd3lt/m4f_the_key_to_the_future_is_within_us_all/,"Some of you may have read my previous prompts, and a select few of you glorious nutcases even upvoted them. Thank you for that, but now I'm back! There's a reason the signs say ""Don't Feed the Bears."" I apologize if I've been a bit repetitive lately, but this prompt took a *long* time to write, and I think it can be adapted to pretty much any whim and desire. Ask and ye shall probably receive. I also don't expect you to match the length and detail of this prompt. This was developed over quite a long time with a bit of thought. Roleplay responses simply cannot receive that kind of attention without going stale.

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds. Furthermore, there are televised PR and recruiting events for those interested in working at the broadcast center, as well as interesting and exciting gameshows like ""Who Wants to Be a Mother?"" ""The Genes Are Right,"" and ""Whose Sperm Is It, Anyway?"" (Okay, maybe it's not that goofy. I just liked the wordplay.)

Of course, there are also the Baby Bashes for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships. Olympus corporation is looking to hire event staff to answer questions at the parties, demonstrate the equipment, and act as little Venuses to encourage good pairing. Partygoers should look up to the event staff as their goal in attending a Baby Bash.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

I've been seeing this chick (we'll call her M) for about 9 months, she's pretty much halfway between a plate and a LTR. She tried to get me exclusive and 'official' more times than I can count, but never prevailed. 

The other night we were watching Goodfellas, and during the scene where Henry beats the dude with the gun then gives it to Karen to hide, M just sits there in disbelief, saying how if she was Karen she'd ""call the cops ASAP"". I asked her if that was me and her if she'd snitch on me for anything like that, and the bitch gets this smug look on her face saying ""yeah immediately"". 

Anyways this was kinda the last straw for me to dump the chick. Currently she's on a 2 day road trip with her bestfriend (who's in a LTR) and 2 of her dude interns for the uni-club she's a part of. Despite AWALT i know that i'm her first, but you can't really be too sure.

After all that snitching talk, and this trip, im thinking that I cant trust M at ALL. Am I being an insecure POS or should I say fuck it and do it?

Thanks in advance dudes "

College Sophomore First Time Renter,iamdrinkingcokezero,NYCapartments,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/5wdlrd/advice_help_college_sophomore_first_time_renter/,"I need help!  I'm going to be a sophomore moving off-campus next year.  I have no idea how to rent an apartment, and I've gotten a general sense by looking online but I have a few questions.  I'm looking to rent a studio somewhere in Manhattan or possibly Brooklyn for under $2000.

1. When should I start looking?  I will be in Los Angeles this summer until August 15 for an internship.  My classes start around September 5.  If I head to NYC after my internship, will that be enough time to look at apartments and sign a lease if I've already started looking online?

2. Does my dad need to come with me?  I have no employment, income, etc, but I will be paying for the apartment with my own savings.  My dad can be the guarantor but does he have to come with me, or can he sign documents over fax or something?

3. How do I go from Zillow to real life?  I've been looking online just to get an idea of apartment prices and everything.  If I find a place I like on a website like Zillow, do I just make plans to tour the place with the agent/broker on the listing?  

4. What do I do when I'm looking at the apartment?  Aside from checking the water pressure, etc, what should I ask about?  Should I bring documents with me?  What documents do I need (again, I don't have pay stubs since I don't have a job; I can bring my own bank statements and documents from my dad, though)?  

I really have no idea what I'm doing and I know it's early but I've just committed to off-campus housing and am getting worried that I don't know anything about how to rent an apartment.  Mostly I'm worried about the timing with visiting the apartments in person, and the logistics of actually signing papers and stuff.

Sorry if I sound like an idiot-- any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Dresses like a buzzfeed intern. Capable of multiple orgasms (manual record 8 in a day, mechanically assisted probably 50). Perfect candidate for all your weird manic pixie dream girl nonsense. 

You: 21-27, DDF (including weed/no smoking in general), at least 5'4"" but not a giant, in shape, not overly muscular, takes care of yourself, willing to host, not going to murder me, enjoys being used for their body, likes to tease, has nice eyes but is willing to eat me out for hours and fuck me into their mattress.

Why: long story but the last person I was with refused to touch me at all. And I had no game in high school so I'm way behind the curve. Haven't even properly kissed anyone. What I want is to find someone I'm comfortable with to teach me as we go without being belittling or weird about the fact it's my first time, who is able to fuck me and be respectful in the morning. Potential for this to be an ongoing thing but I'm also ok with it being a one off. 

Send me a face/body pic in your message to get mine- I'm going to be very picky. No full on dick pics right away, seduce a girl a little first. 

Edit: the age range is deliberate because in this situation there's already going to be a power imbalance between me and the person who is more experienced, adding a large age gap would only make that more pronounced, and I'm not into power play. Please don't message if you are outside of the age range- zero percent chance you get a reply as you've already shown an unwillingness to adhere to my boundaries! 

Edit2: I won't be doing this for a few weeks so feel free to send offers my way 

Edit3: this week is crazy so in order to properly weed through responses and pick who to chat with I'll be contacting candidates on Friday :)

5we6a8,4,2017-02-26,Paid Internship in Shanghai,polarizing1,shanghai,https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/5we6a8/paid_internship_in_shanghai/,"Hi guys, I'm currently searching for a full-time paid internship in SH starting from June through Mid-August (2.5 months), potentially part-time before then, and was wondering if anyone knows a company or have some advice on where to start searching.

I am studying Computer Science and Integrated Media Arts at NYU Shanghai. I am an ABC (American Born Chinese) originally from the United States but chose to come to China to pursue my undergraduate studies. I am also fluent in both Mandarin and English and happy to work in a bilingual environment. I also have a long-term residence visa so the logistics wouldn't be a problem.

A little background about me: I graduated from a fullstack web development bootcamp a year ago and have around three years of experience working with Javascript both frontend and backend. I've worked with a small team building a larger ATS (applicant tracking system) project similar to Lever, Greenhouse, Workable, etc.

I also have two years of experience working with Python and can work comfortably with some Java. 

I also have a more creative, artistic side which I like to express through creative coding and generative design. I have completed few side projects of mine, one I am more proud of is this interactive xylophone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCrVpYpPzbk.

When I am interested in something, I tend to dedicate a lot of time to make it as best as can be. I am also quite good at solving problems, I don't believe any problem is unsolvable so I prefer to work on a team that is also very enthusiastic and have potentially ""lofty goals."" I have a full resume and a Github link which I can send privately if need be.

Why am I not going through my school? Most of the larger recruiting companies at our school are finance-based, the technology-based companies hiring are mostly smaller startups and many students experience with these companies were that they were relegated to rather menial roles. This is partly why I am seeking less traditional outlets.


I will be responding to comments throughout, please feel free to ask me questions or PM me. I will be checking throughout.

If anyone knows or can recommend something, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for the help!"

First, some background. I'm a 22 y/o college student, 5'5"" and 174 lbs. Last spring I went from 185 to 165 though diet alone. Over the summer, however, due to a weird internship related living situation I had no kitchen and thus couldn't maintain the way I had been eating. It was raw food, microwave food, or eating out. I also didn't really keep track of my weight at that time, but was playing co-ed softball twice a week, rock climbing 4x a week or so, and doing the Zombies Run! 5k trainer. When I got back from that internship I was around 175 lbs. Then, in September, I started Stronglifts with just the bar on every lift. I also try to go rock climbing once a week, but the campus rock wall has hours that make that difficult. Current stats are:
 
Bench: 80 lbs
Deadlift: 165 lbs
OH Press: 65 lbs
Barbell Row: 80 lbs
Squat stalled out at 165 lbs so I'm down to 150 to try and work on form.

I definitely have some tangible muscle in my arms and quads, so despite the fact the scale hasn't moved some changes have definitely happened. I wasn't tracking what I was eating in the fall, but since January I've been trying to eat 1700 calories a day, but find myself really really hungry some days so usually end up between 1700-2200/day and walk about 8000 steps a day, on average.

Basically my goals are to loose fat and get stronger for climbing, as I'll be able to get back into that more regularly come summer. I know I need to get my calorie count down, but after six months I'm finding myself bored with stronglifts. I know I need to eat more to make any more significant progress, but I also need to get lighter for climbing. I'm looking for something different. I only have time to be in the gym 3x a week, usually W/F/Sun, for 1.5 hours because being a full time student with a part time job does that to you. Thanks for any suggestions!

tldr; Need to get stronger and loose weight for climbing. Bored after 6 mo of stronglifts. Help?"

I am having an incredibly hard time deciding.


I interned at both NASA and Google while doing my undergrad and I loved working at both but they were very different experiences. The google internship was definitely more fun and exciting (tons of company sponsored events, freebies, etc), but the work at NASA was more interesting for sure. 


As far as I can see, here are the pros/cons of each.


Google

Pros

 * Very high compensation (~200k / year (salary, stock, bonus))
 * I like the location (sf bay area, CA)
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Amazing perks (Free breakfast/lunch/dinner, free shuttle to work, gym, misc benefits)
 * High prestige if I want to move
 * Good work-life balance (at least for my team)
 * Better Software engineering practices


Cons

 * Very expensive location (I would pay ~2k/month rent for a studio)
 * Specific project isn't very exciting to me
 * Not advancing humanity
 * All software (no hardware which I'm interested in)
 * Most people leave after a few years


NASA

Pros:

 * Very cool project/team (Robotics/Avionics)
 * Good Benefits
 * Cheap Location for living (~800 for a 1BR apartment)
 * Mixture of hardware and software
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Very good work-life balance
 * High Prestige
 * Advancing Humanity
 * Many people stay for life


Cons

 * Not a location I want to live in (very hot + humid)
 * Low compensation (starting around ~45k but likely to increase in the future. Will never match Google though)
 * Poorer software engineering practices
 * No real perks besides benefits
 * Government bureaucracy
 * Unsure what will happen under current administration / future administrations


So what do you guys think? I understand this is a very good problem to have, but I am having a really hard time deciding. I know money shouldn't be the biggest factor in my decision but after receiving the Google offer it is hard to imagine accepting ~4-5x less. "
5wesfm,3,2017-02-26,Nothing is worse than seeing your toxic mother ruin your younger siblings lives. Please help.,bubblewrath420,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/5wesfm/nothing_is_worse_than_seeing_your_toxic_mother/,"Hello. I just joined into this subreddit because I have no where else to go about this problem I have been facing. Its draining me. I have already gotten help but I'm trying to help the rest of my family. Anyways, here is a little back story. 

My family consist of 8 children, the emotionally unavailable mother, 3 different fathers, currently one of them is living with us and is married to my mom. My mother had a horrible childhood from what I've heard. Unimaginably abusive sexually, emotionally and physically. Anyways, I was in a 4 year long relationship with a very abusive guy. I am 18 now but was 14 when we got together. I was abused in every way and after 4 years of it happening, I realized what was going on and saw a counselor. I learned the characteristics of emotional abuse the most and found that there has been a trend going on with my family. 

I moved away from my house for about 8 months and lived with my new boyfriend at his dads apartment (we've been dating for 9 months) but he got an internship to live on a farm so I had no choice but to go back home... he knows my situation and has tried so hard to help me. So here it goes.

It's day two of being back here. I use to visit every now and then to see the kids and every time I visit, I'm reminded of why I left. I'm already disturbed by all the subtle ways my mom is ruining the kids like she ruined me. These aren't their real names. This will be the youngest to the oldest:
Nate: 7
Kyle: 8 
Carly: 10 
Seth: 14
Bethany: 16
Me: 18
John: 25
And Taylor: 29. 

All kids live at home except the oldest, Taylor. My concerns are for the younger kids, because the older ones like me are already damaged by this severely. And by older I mean, kids ages 16 to 29. Here are the problems. 
My mother is emotionally unavailable. I suggest doing a quick google search if you aren't familiar with what that means. She treats the kids problems as if they are an inconvenience to her. She yells instead of talking. Always yells. I see that when she yells, the kids tense up, freeze up, and they walk around the house with their heads down in fear of being yelled at again. My mom is weird- she can act happy and love on her kids and laugh with them, but there are definitely times where she yells and when a stressful situation comes at her, she makes sure everyone feels it to. I know all of this because I went through it. She always treated my teenage girl problems as if they were a nuisance to her, and always said, ""why are you always so dramatic? You're always acting like the victim. You're always trying to get attention. You just love being depressed and acting like you're abused."" So that should tell you enough about the way things are. I have too many details to describe. This post would be too long to read. 

But the thing is, what can I do to make this easier on the kids? They're already FULL of anxiety, just like me. All of her children are struggling with anxiety and mental illnesses and not once has she thought, ""hm, maybe I'm doing something wrong"". What can I do to make the kids realize it's not wrong to show your emotions? And to show them how to be mentally healthy, and how to deal with emotions properly instead of just yelling and getting mad. I've tried talking with them before about how it's not okay to yell like mom does, and it's not okay to treat people so harshly, especially the people you're suppose to love. But they're reactions are always the same. They get uncomfortable, and confused. It's like they don't ever even want to face any kind of emotion at all... and they get scared that mom might hear me talking about her. it breaks my heart. They're all young and the older they get, they ruin their lives and live unhappily. I'm saying that because I saw my older siblings turn into alcoholics and hate their lives. I don't want the kids to be this way.

My mother breeds alcoholism and drug addiction. The older kids, anyway. Even the 16 year old doesn't go to school or anything. Just smokes pot. I'm the only kid in my WHOLE family to graduate from high school. Anyways , all of the kids are addicted to junk food and the internet and video games. What could I possibly do? I'm so worried about them. I don't want them to be faced with the pain and anxiety I've been faced with because of my mothers toxicity. Please help me figure something out. I don't want them to get split up or put in foster care- I don't know how else I can handle this. If I tried telling my mom this, she'd probably get so mad and act like I'm attacking her ego... when I'm only trying to save my family.

5wev61,6,2017-02-27,Could any Seattle software/tech workers answer some employment related questions for me?,seahusky123,SeattleWA,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/5wev61/could_any_seattle_softwaretech_workers_answer/,"Hey guys, I'm currently a senior at UW majoring in applied physics, and when I graduate in June I'm hoping to get a job in the Seattle tech industry. I'm very anxious about the job hunt and am looking for things I can do now that will help me with the job search as I get closer to graduating.

I feel that I am stuck in a bit of a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" situation. UW doesn't offer a CS minor, but I've taken as many CS and Informatics electives as I've been able to during my time here. I've gone through all the intro CS classes and taken upper level classes in algorithms/data structures, databases, data science, and front/back end web development. This exposed me to a lot of different technologies and languages, Java being the most used one, but also learning about HTML/CSS, SQL, R, JavaScript, and some other things. I also got an internship one summer through my dad's startup doing a lot of random grunt work but also some Node.js work, and I did two quarters of research with a physics professor where I did some Java and Mathematica coding. I've put a few projects from these on a GitHub account as well, but I don't believe they show a strong skillset in any particular area or language.

I would like to further develop my skills in a particular area so that a potential employer would actually value me for those skills. I am thinking this would best be done by working on various projects and trying to build a portfolio of personal work, but I don't know where I should be focusing my efforts. The type of programming I enjoy most is object oriented work, for example I really enjoyed my data structures and algorithms class which used Java. (Java is probably the language I'm best at I'd say.) But I'm worried that my degree being in applied physics will put me at a great disadvantage in this area, since I'd assume an actual CS degree would be more valuable to employers than some personal projects.

Anyway, I am hoping to get some advice on what skills or technologies I could be teaching myself to make myself more attractive to Seattle tech employers. Are there languages or technologies currently in high demand in Seattle that I could teach myself to be a better candidate? Would making a few Java projects to put on GitHub be a good idea or a waste of time? Would it even be possible to get an OOP type job out of college without a CS degree? Are there other things that would be better to spend my time learning, like C#/C++ or .NET or a different area of programming altogether? Are there any fields I should look into that I'm not aware of? I'd really just appreciate any advice about ways I can go about making myself more employable in Seattle tech by graduation. I've been applying for some jobs but haven't had much success yet. Thanks guys."

Chapter 38: Aftermath

“So Mrs. Henrietta Palaiologos,” Athena asked. “What is it like being the regent for the newly-freed Imperium Romanum?”
 
The two were in the Imperial News Network office in the Imperial Palace, Constantinople. Bright white lights and cameras illuminated the two women. Athena was trying her best not to squirm in her tight white dress, but she couldn’t stop her feet under the desk from shaking. Henrietta, meanwhile, looked like she was made for the camera. Her sparkling purple strapless dress had no wrinkles, and a permanent smile was etched on her face. Both of the Greek women were considered quite beautiful with their light olive skin and their high cheekbones. Henrietta, while older, was serene and graceful while Athena was young and pretty.
 
The young woman’s voice was unsteady. Athena couldn’t believe it. She must be the unluckiest person in the galaxy. She thought she would be free after the war. But noo. Her parents were too worried about silly nonsense like death and civilian casualties. So they “recalled” her all the way back to Anatolia. They tried to nab her twin, Sophia, but she managed to escape the, erm, “bounty hunters.” Athena always figured she was the unlucky sibling.
 
And now her father’s connections landed her a job with the INN. Right smack in the middle of Constantinople. In the Imperial Palace, of all places. Athena visited the city before, but the amount of bureaucrats and ass kissers made her wish to never see the capital again. Just her luck that she was pretty and Greek enough to be a reporter for the INN.
 
She hated her boss. He was an idiot. He practically worshipped the Imperator just because he saw her for the grand total of five seconds during the declaration of war. He was one of the interns that fetched the Basilissa a cup of water when she declared war on the beans. Now he kept going on and on about how everybody including the “filthy xeno scum” should worship the beautiful Augustus. Ugh. There were dumbasses, dumbasses everywhere. But she could deal with that. She dealt with dumbasses until she and Sophia boarded the colony ship out of Terra. Actually, scratch that. There were also dumbasses on Alpha Centauri, too. Even the beans were dumbasses. They did lose a war to a nation of dumbasses after all.
 
And so by some sheer dumb luck, Athena was interviewing Henrietta Palaiologos in the INN studio. It was stupid. The main reporter, a big-bosomed woman, called out sick today. Athena knew that was a lie. She was probably in the bed of some noble. Probably a Doukas. But because of that, she was now forced to interview Henrietta Palaiologos. Sweet Jesus. She just got this job a few months ago and only talked about the weather. But now she was expected to interview the heir to the Imperial Throne, the regent of the Roman Empire? Ridiculous. Completely and utterly ridiculous.
 
“Well, Miss Komnenos,” Henrietta said. She smiled those perfect glossy-white teeth. Her makeup hid every wrinkle and blemish, and it was good enough that it looked natural. “I underestimated the position. It leaves me exhausted at the end of each day. The Imperator has many stresses on her plate. However, I’ve grown more and more accustomed every day.”
 
“Shut up old hag,” Athena said. Or, she wished to say. Athena wasn’t too familiar with the Palace’s political environment, but she figured it was the same as the intrigue that went on in the Komnenos household when she was younger. Instead, she smiled and beamed.
 
“So can you tell us more about the Imperator’s vacation?” she said. “It has been rather hush-hush. I’m sure our citizens wish to know if they could get a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see the Basilissa.”
 
“Unfortunately, details about the Basilissa’s vacation are highly classified,” Henrietta said. And then she smiled even more widely. Athena was certain it was fake or forced. “However, I do know she considers it her honeymoon with Basileus John Smith, and she’s not on Holy Terra. I urge citizens that if they do see through her disguise that they do not bother her. She deserves this vacation. It would be her first break in a long time.”
 
Athena almost gagged. Wow, the garbage she spewed. Did anybody actually believe her when she said she renounced all relations with her son, Constantine the Pretender? Ugh. Unbelievable. “Thank you for your concern, Imperator-Regent. I’m sure the Basilissa appreciates it. Now, can you tell us about your work? What have you done in your first few weeks?”
 
“Well, my primary concern has been improving relations with our alien neighbors. We do not want to enter another war so soon, and we need to be strong enough to fight against the Tezekian birds. I have secured a non-aggression pact with the Najklax Serene State.”

http://imgur.com/a/uIG5v

Athena shuddered, but it was an exaggerated movement for the unthinking consumers of the Imperial News Network. “Ew, those spiders? Are you sure that’s a good idea?”
 
“Yes. We need all allies we can get. In the meantime, I have also improved relations with other nations by giving them research agreements, star charts, and other various gifts of goodwill. The Finu Kingdom and Jogollwa Confederacy are quite pleased with our gifts.”

http://imgur.com/a/BJDOh

http://imgur.com/a/804mD

“Are there any concerns that we are giving aliens all of this free research?” Athena asked. She was actually interested in the answer. She recalled where the alien empires were located. The Finu Kingdom was located directly south and the Jogollwa Confederacy were located to the east across a Milky Way  arm. The Imperium didn’t have powerful enough warp drives strong enough to jump over, but the Jogollwa Confederacy definitely did.

“I have full confidence in building goodwill with these aliens,” Henrietta said. “We have not done much of these negotiations before. That may be why we have terrible relations with most aliens. In this violent galaxy, I am confident this diplomacy will bring peace to the Imperium. I have results that shows this is a good strategy. See, the Najklax Serene State is providing us with their own research and even some minerals after we built up relations with them.”

http://imgur.com/a/y00Im

“Ouch, low blow to Imperator Allysse,” Athena thought, and then she smiled again. “Interesting tactics you have there, Imperator-Regent. Well, let’s hope they work in the future.”
 
“Yes, yes,” Henrietta said. “But while we do want to increase our relations with these powerful xenoi empires, we still have to keep in mind our own personal powerbase. So with that I took the initiative to incorporate another primitive system in the Thuban system.”

http://imgur.com/a/CS0sp

Athena thought she was well-versed in the many facets of politicking. She always knew how to wear a porcelain smile and knew how everybody lied. But this caught off her guard. She choked on some air, her eyes widening at Henrietta’s words.
 
“Excuse me, Imperator-Regent,” Athena said. While she recovered, her mind raced through her knowledge of the universe. Where was the Thuban system? Some primitives owned a planet called Veorix there, right? “I think I misheard you. Did you just say you’ve invaded the Thuban system?”
 
“Oh, no, invasion is such a strong word,” Henrietta said, still smiling. “You see, the Veorix system was already well within our declared borders. I’m simply integrating them into the Imperium.”
 
Athena wished the primary interviewer was here. She really wasn’t suited for this job. “I’m sorry Imperator-Regent, my ears are acting up. Let me put it this way. Did you land troops on the planet of Veorix?”
 
“A policing force led by General Long Wang,” Henrietta said. “As with any rebellious population, the aliens on Veorix don’t accept our rightful rule yet. But in due time they will understand their benevolent rulers.”

http://imgur.com/a/sirwa

Athena could see her boss jumping up and down behind the cameras. She wasn’t sure what he was telling her to do. She used to have an earpiece to talk to the producer, but she had broken it a long time ago to stop listening to his annoying voice. Maybe she shouldn’t have done that.
 
“Um, who is this Long Wang fellow?” Athena said. She could see her boss smack his face with his palm. Whoops.
 
“Excellent question. He’s an extremely talented general that I discovered during the War of Independence. I’m astonished the Basilissa hasn’t discovered a man of his talents yet.”
 
Athena was tempted. She really was. But unfortunately, she was a professional airing a live interview in front of a billion Roman citizens which included children and the highly religious. She couldn’t do it. She wondered if everybody watching or reading the news would make the connection between Long Wang and the Basilissa’s lack of “experience.”
 
Ugh, she should stop thinking about that. There were more pressing questions to ask at the moment. Like how Henrietta secretly invaded some aliens out of nowhere. She paused, remembering her lessons from her various Komnenoi family members. To calm down and take a deep breathe. That is how you deal with dumbasses. Out of the corner of her eye she could see her boss flapping his hands around, silently shouting at her.
 
“This is an interesting decision you made,” Athena said. “Wouldn’t the aliens, not just the primitives, but the galaxy at large be angry at our sudden invasion? How does our population feel about this? How does the Imperator feel about this? And why did we invade this sovereign nation?”
 
Athena couldn’t tell what Henrietta was feeling. The heir to the Imperial Throne was even more experienced at public speaking than she was. However, the Komnenoi girl could just feel that Henrietta was nervous. Maybe only a little bit. Maybe she was annoyed that the supposedly loyal Imperial News Network was questioning her. Whatever it was, Athena wanted answers. Not because it was her job, but because she didn’t want some dumbass to run the Imperium into the ground right after another the Imperium was freed from the beans.
 
“That is a lot of insightful questions,” Henrietta said calmly. “But with my improvement of our foreign relations, I doubt the galaxy will care about our renewed enforcement of our interior borders. And Imperator Allysse surely can’t criticize me; she already invaded and annexed two whole xenoi planets during her reign. What’s an additional xenoi planet?  Lastly, we can’t always rely on diplomacy to solve our problems. Just like we need strong allies, we also need a strong base. Securing another alien planet which is clearly in our borders is within our God-given rights. I am doing nothing wrong, but preparing ourselves for a potential war with the Thembolans or the Tezekians.”
 
Damn. She answered those questions as smoothly as, well, Athena was bad at analogies. But Athena just felt scummy, just like all of those dumbasses she avoided when she ran away from home. The Regent purposefully avoided using the words “invaded” or “attacked,” and generally seemed apathetic to the fact she conquered a home world when the Imperium was supposed to be recovering. Regardless of how she justified it, it just felt bad.
 
“Oh, I forgot to mention,” Henrietta said, going on as if invading aliens was as common as morning breakfast. “To round out my first week, Dr. Pitt finished researching mountain clearing. I don’t know why the Imperator ordered him to research something as simple as mountain removal. He’s a brilliant man. The Imperator says he’s eccentric and, in her words, ‘weird,’ but I find him a model citizen of the Imperium. Every child should strive to be like him. Anyways, he’s now researching how to create more efficient quarters in our ships and spaceports. Battles last forever so it’s important their living bedrooms are clean.”

http://imgur.com/a/TvIHN

Then a lightbulb went off in Athena’s head. She thought something was strange. No, not just Henrietta’s deceptive conversations nor her calm and confident demeanor. Something was just plain weird when the Regent talked about the alien invasion.
 
“I have one final question, Imperator-Regent,” Athena Komnenos asked. “Forgive me for asking, I haven’t done proper research. What’s the name of the alien species that lives on Veorix?”
 
Henrietta looked puzzled. “Oh, I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. All xenoi are the same anyways.”

------------------------------------------------------------

It wasn't the throbbing in his arms, nor the rhythmic pounding of the drums that woke Owen from his stupor, no, it was the sharp, tortured scream of his best friend, Jesse.  His eyes snapped open, stinging from the light of the massive fire in front of him.  Tribesmen, dressed in ceremonial garb, war paints, and masks danced elaborate moves around it, all to the beat of the drums.

Owen couldn't see Jesse, or his other friend, Brandon, but he knew that they were all in danger.  He knew he hadn't dreamed that scream.  No, his ears were still ringing as proof.  Every cell in his body was screaming at him to flee, but, he couldn't!  Owen looked up, his wrists were bound, and hung from what appeared to be a crude scaffold.  He hung above a platform, apparently a crude altar.  Craning his neck as far as it would allow, he caught glimpse of something resting on his brow, quite possibly a crown woven of river reeds.  He had also been stripped naked, and painted with lines and what could have been old letters or runes in the same war paints the dancers wore.

Jesse's horrific scream erupted from Owen's right.  He snapped his head in the direction only to witness something that shook him to his very core.  Jesse too, had been stripped, and tied down.  He had been restrained to a table, a limb stretched to each corner.  Blood had soaked it all ready, either from him, or previous victims. 
A line of tribe members waited patiently for their turn, each holding a stone plate or bowl.  As the line moved along, each person, even children and the elderly, were handed a knife by what seemed to be an officiant, and cut a piece of Jesse's flesh off of his still living person, deposit it into their bowl or plate, and consume it greedily.  Some had even cut into his abdomen and begun taking his lower organs!

How he was even still conscious let alone alive was so beyond Owen's line of thought as he screamed for his friend in vain.  A child, who had just cut himself a large piece of Jesse's thigh, caught Owen's eye as he stuffed the meat into his mouth, chewing obviously with a malicious grin.  Owen vomited at the sight, the contents of his stomach hitting the altar with a pitiful ""splat"".  His mind raced as he tried to remember how they had gotten to this point.

It had been another hot day on the beach as Owen and his friends were winding down the last days of their spring break.  The three had been best friends since elementary school, and now, they were in their second year of college.  While they had always been close, life tends to have it's own path in mind, and they had been seeing less of each other- Jesse found an internship, Brandon was engaged, and Owen had begun preparing for graduate school.  Together, they had decided to have one last ""hurrah"" as it would stand, with a booze filled spring break in South America.  Jesse and Brandon had ulterior motive for going as well.  They knew that Owen was still a virgin, and had made it a mission to get their friend laid.  Owen, having always been the most reserved of the trio, could never find the confidence to speak to the women his friends would point out at the bar, or even bring over to him.  There would be plenty of whorehouses, and legal ones at that, they had thought, and had asked around the town bordering the resort they were at for help in getting their friend's dick christened.  That was how they had come to meet Ramone.

Ramone was a sleazy little man, but apparently the best of the best when it came to finding what one was after.  His eyes had quite literally lit up with glee when he heard about Owen's ""condition"", as well as the young man's concern over catching an STD.

""Ohhh, aren't you in luck, my young friends!"" he had laughed over the phone the next day.  ""As it turns out, one of the local tribes is having a festival of the harvest!  Food!  Dancing!  And most importantly....promiscuous women!""

Jesse and Brandon, of course, were ecstatic.  Owen was still a bit worried.

""No need for such worries, friend!  My people trade with this tribe all the time!  You're not the first white men they've seen, and certainly won't be the last they lay, either!  Why, in fact, they prefer it!  The women are enthralled by exotic dick!""

""C'mon, Owen!  It'll be fine!"" Brandon had encouraged.

""Just think of all the pussy you're gonna get!  It's even better than a whorehouse!""  Jesse pushed.  Reluctantly, Owen had agreed.

Ramone had driven them into the jungle that afternoon, in his quite cramped, beat up, car.  Owen wondered how the thing was still running.  They took backroad after backroad, until finally they were bouncing along a pair of tread marks.  The sun was getting low in the sky when the sight of huts and a giant, unlit pyre greeted them.  Ramone had exchanged words with some of the men who had been setting up makeshift tables, pointing to the white men as he did.  Owen was unsettled by the wide smiles of the tribe men, but was pushed into the village by his own friends.  They had been welcomed warmly, the men smiling, the women not so subtly checking out their crotches, and the chief inviting them to feast with his tribe.  They were given cups of a homemade wine, and drank it without question, as the rest of the tribe was.

Then, Jesse screamed again, in even more pain, if that was possible at all.  Owen screamed himself as he saw an old woman dig his friend's eye out of the socket, and lick it before tearing it from the stalk of retina.  Owen squirmed as best he could, despite his bonds and helplessness of being strung up as he was.  The sounds of a scuffle caught his attention, and he looked past the fire to see Brandon fighting with three tribesmen.  He too, had been stripped naked, and his hands were bound behind his back.  He was being dragged to another fire, smaller than the bonfire, but still substantial in size.  As he was dragged there, more men brought out an enormous pot, which women filled quickly with buckets of water from the nearby river.  The fire was lit, and more women added spices.  By now, the tribesmen had wrestled Brandon close enough to the pot and the other men who had carried the pot out were now helping to restrain him.

""YOU SONS OF FUCKS!  I'LL KILL YOU!  I'LL KILL ALL OF YOU!"" he screamed as his ankles were bound, and he was lifted above the heads of the tribesmen.  Three more men appeared, carrying a heavy looking pot lid.  As the fire was large, and being tended religiously by the women, it wasn't long before the water was boiling.  Owen could only watch in horror as the man who's wedding he was supposed to stand in was thrown in.

Brandon screamed in agony, flailing his whole body, trying desperately to escape the boiling water, only to be shoved back by the men, or swiped at with burning kindling by the women.  The men with the lid slowly lifted it onto the edge of the pot, slowly sliding it into place.  Brandon continued to scream even as he was shoved back the final time as the lid was fitted into place.  His screams inside the pot were so loud, Owen could still hear them minute after agonizing minute until they finally stopped.  The scent of cooking meat filled the air as steam slipped out from under the lid, many participant tribe members licking their lips in anticipation.

Owen was more desperate as ever to get away, his wrists becoming wet with blood as he twisted his arms back and forth in a vain effort to get free.  Tears welled in his eyes for his murdered friends, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he too, would be brutalized by this tribe.

Suddenly, the Chief himself stepped before him, grinning.

""You're lucky."" he said, heavily accented.  ""As a virgin, you will serve a higher purpose.""

""Fuck your higher purpose!"" Owen spat, ""You sick fucks killed my best friends!"" 

""Your friends have also served a purpose, boy."" the Chief responded.  ""My people feast on a delicacy most rare.""  The drums began to die down, and the tribe began to enter their huts, leaving Jesse's remains and the large pot out.  ""And now, you will appease our god,"" the Chief finished, making for his own hut as the calm water of the river began to stir violently, ""A virgin sacrifice pleases him the most.""

Owen gaped in horror as a large, black mass emerged from the water, and slowly made it's way onto the bank.  As it approached, Owen only became more panicked, flailing his legs and body to try and get free.  

The snake's body glistened with river water in the firelight, accenting it's green and brown markings.  It's head was as big as rowboat, and it's body was thick with muscle.  It's large tongue flicked slowly in and out as it slowly moved closer and closer to the altar.

Owen was fighting every urge to scream as he squirmed against the binds, feet flailing to reach the altar below.  The snake had reached the altar now, it's tongue moving faster as it picked up on the scent of him.  It lifted it's head up, it's tongue sliding across Owen's feet.  He screamed then, kicking at it as he did.  The snake seemed to have liked what it encountered, and drew it's head back from the kicks.  With supernatural intelligence, it fixed it's dinner plate size eyes on Owen, and opened it's mouth wide.

Despite his frantic kicking, the snake easily took Owen's feet into it's gaping maw, quickly forcing them into it's throat, effectively restraining them.  Now, it could take it's time.  Owen screamed again in horror as the snake then swallowed his legs, and his knees, lifting itself up higher to do so.  He pulled back with all he had, trying to pull his legs out, to no avail.  The snake's teeth, while large, gently grasped Owen's naked body, guiding more and more of him into it's mouth.

The snake reached his genitals, and, to his disgust and horror, it's tongue caressed them, stimulating his penis and asshole, giving him an erection.  Owen moaned with a mix of pleasure from the feeling and disgust at himself for even being aroused by the damned thing.  He ejaculated as the snake swallowed the rest of his lower half, semen splattering his stomach and the inside of the snake's mouth.

The scaffolding, at this point, could no longer hold the weight of both Owen and the snake.  The flimsy wooden bar snapped in two,  dropping both predator and prey to the altar.  Owens arms were now free, but it didn't matter.  The snake's tongue ran over Owen's torso and chest, licking sweat out of every crevice and fold it found.

Owen screamed again as the snake reached his shoulders.  He could feel the pressure of the snake's throat forcing him further in, the muscles rubbing against his penis and making him hard again.  He felt the teeth on the top of his head and screamed again, dropping into a moan of pain as he ejaculated a second time, what few parts of his body could move shivering with it.  Owen was seeing less and less of the outside world as the snake took it's time to savor licking the blood leaking around his binds.  He felt a shiver go through it's body, was it also getting sexual thrill from this?

""No...NOOOOO!"" Owen screamed as the snake's mouth closed around his outstretched hands, cutting off all light.  He felt his neck and head squeeze past the snake's throat and into it's stomach.  He wanted to scream, but couldn't.  The snake's body pressed all around him, not quite crushing him, but popping his knees and elbows out, and breaking his ankles and wrists.  It was hot, too hot, and getting harder and harder to breathe.  Digestive fluids slathered his body, helping it move down the digestive tract.   While it didn't burn, yet, Owen knew it was only a matter of time before the acids would break him down.  He prayed that he would die before that began, even wondering as to why he was still conscious without an air source.  Owen gasped in pain as his collarbones broke from the pressure on him.  Fluid poured into his open mouth and he choked on it, his body spasming as more and more bones were broken by the snake's body to best compress it's meal for digestion.  A pitiful gurgle escaped his throat as he choked on digestive fluids and his own blood.

The snake made it's way back to the river, it's bed, the sizable lump in it's body squirming only slightly now and then as it did.  It left a trail of fluids of it's own, soaking into the land and forming puddles.  The god was very pleased indeed.

The tribe emerged from their huts and collected the fluid in buckets.  They would later treat their crops with this fluid, and would have a bumper year.  But for now, there was a feast to finish, and a god to sing praises of."

At the end, hero shows up at heroine's family gathering and reveals how heroine has been undermined her whole life by her frenemy/cousin.",DoomTurtleSaysDoom,tipofmytongue,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/5wgfc7/tomtromance_novel_from_about_10_years_ago_heroine/,"I read this, I'd guess, sometime around 2004 - 2008.  It was a contemporary romance novel/chick lit book. I think the cover was predominantly pink and it had some very forgettable title.  

The story involved a woman who I think was afraid to fly and met the love interest dude on an airplane--she had maybe been bumped up to first class for some reason--by gripping his hand/arm in fear. He turned out to be some rich CEO or something and distracted her by getting her to talk about herself so she spilled a bunch of info she wouldn't normally have said.

I don't remember why their association continued after they got off the plane.

The heroine had a roommate or best friend who was obsessed with marrying rich and would say things like ""If you want a rock on your finger by the age of [whatever]"" then do x, y, or z.  One of the rules was about wearing your fanciest jewelry on a first date because the roommate's mom (or maybe the roommate herself) had once hit it off with a very rich man who sent her some simple jewelry (with a note saying he had had to restrain himself from buying something grander since he knew she liked simple things) and then he died before she saw him again.

The heroine also had a cousin, I think, back home who was always undermining her.  I think this cousin, or whatever she was, was taken in by the heroine's parents.  The cousin later owned her own company and the heroine offered to work there for free as an intern or something to get experience but the cousin turned her down.  The cousin would also do things like finding out what gift the heroine was going to give her parents, and then the cousin would give them a grander version of the same thing.  

There was also some subplot about the hero having a mysterious secret which ended up being that he was secretly raising the young son of maybe his dead business partner or something like that.

And everything culminated in some big family gathering scene where the heroine was getting shit on by her family, as usual, and then the hero appeared and defended her and revealed all the things that had been going on for years, like about the cousin being shitty about gifts and not helping the heroine, and the heroine's parents got mad at the cousin and finally appreciated their daughter."

A couple months ago MB mentioned they wanted to keep me on through summer but would move the kids to daycare when 3F started preschool in the fall. I was very surprised and a little upset when she told me this but told her I would like to continue through the summer. Recently now she is saying they would like to keep me on in the fall and not put the kids in daycare. I'd love to stay on and love working with the family but right now I'm only making $12/hour. 

I told MB I'd love to stay on but that I am hoping to get an internship in the fall and if I get that I would not be able to work full time for the family. My one year is in June and at this point I don't know if it's appropriate to ask for a raise when it's unclear on both sides if I'll be there in the fall. 

Should I wait until I find out if I'll still be working with them in the fall before I ask for a raise? Would asking for $14/hour be too much of a raise to ask for? "
5wgsf3,1,2017-02-27,Need help -- college student dealing with a collection agency,Alleneby,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5wgsf3/need_help_college_student_dealing_with_a/,"Hi everyone, so like the title says I'm having a bit of an issue with
a debt collector. First I should
probably give some backstory, so here goes:

I'm a computer engineering student who knows extremely little about finances and all that stuff. I'm also doing my first ever internship. What this means is I'm not studying right now, instead I'm working full-time this semester in a company around 80 miles away from where I study. Thing is, when i left for my hometown (which is the same place as my internship) during winter break, i forgot to disconnect my internet service in the beginning of January. When i remember i didn't disconnect it, i call the company to do so, knowing i'd be gone for at least 6 months. They say i can't disconnect it until i return the modem they gave me. I figure there's no way i'll have the time to return it, since it's at least a 2 hour and a half drive each way, so in all my stupidity i decide to just let the bill run, thinking they'd simply disconnect it eventually.
 
It seems that was not the case though, as 2 months later i got mail from a debt collection agency stating i owed 350 dollars: 90 for the 3 months i didn't pay, 200 for the ""cancellation fee"" (really?), and 75 for the modem I didn't return.
 
i was looking around, and it turns out most debt collectors send the debts they receive to collections the instant they obtain it right? I really want to know but every credit report online ive tried (credit karma, annual credit report.com) has said my information can't be found (I've never had a credit card or anything like that). 


So basically im wondering what the best course of action is. I assume i dont need a credit card or a loan or anything for them to send my debt to collections right (they most likely have my SSN from when i signed up)? if it's already there should i even pay (i'm not sure how to find out it's already there either)? and if it's not yet
in collections, what should i do?
 
i probably could have summarized this more/better, but i felt it was probably a good idea to give all the details i coult think of. anyways thanks to anyone who took the time to read this and thanks to anyone that can help; im extremely lost and don't really know what i should be doing "

But who are you?

Are you the lonely housewife next door who settled down with a good man thinking she could leave her wild past behind and that her more clandestine desires would fade with time? I'm sure looking out the window at your new neighbor fixing up the house doesn't help. Can you resist the urge to bring him a glass of sweet tea and introduce yourself?

Are you the new intern at work set to help this tall, articulate man with whatever he needs? Sometimes we will have to stay late to finish up, just don't get distracted and spill a cup of coffee on my new suit.

Did your best friend's mom get remarried? Rather a bit of a surprise when you go over to her house for dinner. Still, when everyone else is asleep and you need a glass of water late at night try not to make too much noise?

Or are you someone else? The milf at the gym, freshman at college, or something completely different?

Of course be a good girl and introduces yourself, tell me why you love or are curious about BBC, and a little bit about yourself. I'm not looking for lazy girls, or short term play, and cuck roles are definitely not interesting.

Still up and looking."
5whl7z,4,2017-02-27,"My [23 M] S/O is moving for a job in a different state for 6 months, without me [22 F]",oceankate,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5whl7z/my_23_m_so_is_moving_for_a_job_in_a_different/,"Dear Reddit,

Out of my curiousness to see some of your comments, I have decided to make this post. Maybe this should be an 'Ask Alice' message.

A little background: I'm a 22-year-old female who is in my last year of undergraduate school. I have a fulfilling life, and I'm positive about my current situation and my future in general. I involve myself in different creative hobbies such as ballet, singing, and figure drawing modeling. My life is interesting, and though I spend a lot of time alone, I like it that way. I have my own circle of friends, and have been dating the same individual for two years now.

About the relationship with my partner: My significant other appeared in my life at a point where I was ready for change, and I was nearing the end of a past relationship. I was very engaged with my now boyfriend as soon as we met, and our relationship launched with passion, relatedness, fun, and compassion for one another- as well as other people in the world (one of the things I love most about my partner). He has fulfilled certain areas in my life that in turn, make me feel more connected to my true self. Yet, he has also challenged me. I love that my boyfriend can challenge me mentally as I am a deep- thinking individual, but he has also challenged my well-being, too. 

My boyfriend has anxiety and depression issues, and they became well noticed not long after we started seeing each other romantically. Throughout the course of the relationship, I have tried my best to be a friend, and to genuinely show my concern for his struggles, as well as encourage him to help himself. I am happy for him, as he recently decided to seek help, and is now taking a low-dose anti-anxiety medication that he sees as a big help. We have had several odd bumps in our relationship, and I view that is mainly being a result of miscommunication, and difference in thought. Blatantly speaking, I am more of a positive thinker vs. he is more negative, which I realize can really affect any given relationship- normally resulting in distance or break-up. 

Recently, my boyfriend got accepted to a position in another state for six months. He is also in college, and interns for 6 months, and then finishes up school for the other 6 months. This time, he was accepted to a research position at a giant non-profit. I was very happy and excited for him, but also became very upset. We had a whirlwind of thoughts and feelings festering, in which I confronted him about first. At first, I asked what he was thinking, what he wanted to do, and what we could do to stay connected if we were apart. He expressed how he certainly did not wish to breakup, and the whole thought of us discontinuing made him upset. So upset, that he didn't even want to think about it, but he was certain that he wanted to make our relationship work. Later (weeks after), I brought up the idea of moving out there with him for 3 months (June-Aug) as I did not necessarily have any prior obligations that I could not achieve out there if I found a place to work, and could help him pay the rent. As I did not mention, I am very flexible, and love new adventures that are risky. At first, he acted as though that's what he wanted- but in turn, it really wasn't. I had to approach him later, because I felt as though he was faking that part, and he was. According to him, he thought that would give him more anxiety, and it meant that soon enough we would be expected to take our relationship a step further. Wow! This was upsetting, but also somewhat expected (now it's kind of my fault for staying in the relationship if I had wanted more from someone). I was upset, because I just wanted to spend time with my boyfriend, and it was only for 3 months. He knows how I think, and how I live my life- marriage, children, and etc. was never something discussed or something I had expressed interest in during the near future. What a negative way to look at a relationship, I thought. 

Soon after, I confronted him about his emotional and mental state of being. This brought to my attention how I often do not recognize the severity of his negativity (this is why he decided to take a step to take a medication). We ended up having a heartfelt discussion, and he explained how he did not want me to see how he really felt if we were to live together. I was very heartbroken about how bad he felt. We ended up leaving things on a good note, even though we had almost broken up several times because of the moving situation. 

I am able to go out and visit him in another state twice, and so I can spend several weeks there in the summer as I will be doing other traveling. We discussed this topic again recently, and my boyfriend expressed that he wants to wait until he is finished with school and job internships before he will be ready to commit further. I can relate and understand how he feels, but I just don't feel the same way in general. Being together was never about taking our relationship a step further, and if it was, why is that looked at as a negative thing? He and I have different views (negative vs. positive) about how we live our lives-- certainly, because I looked at being together in the summer as a positive thing. Yes, it was very hurtful to discover that he wasn't thinking that. It also made me question my position in his life, as well as his position in mine.

I realize that it would be easier to be with a person who did not have as many emotional fears and issues as my current partner. I empathize and love this person, and I hope the best things for him. It is also in my nature to help people through issues (I have a long history of this) though I realize I cannot ""fix"" them. Through experience, I am aware of this. As of now, I feel like I could be happy and content with visiting my boyfriend in the other state. Apart of me wonders if I am making the wrong decision. Am I completely missing something? We are young people, and I am more apt to let things go, as I feel we have a lot of growing to do. I am not sure what he will want, or how he will change in the next several years. I am also unsure of how I will change. That is why I feel forgiving of the situation, and why I have felt willing to ""go with the flow.""

Based on what I have shown you, what do you think of the circumstance, and am I making a right or wrong decision in your opinion? 

Ultimately, I will go with what I think is best for me. Thank you!

  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend is moving away for 6 months without me. He claims to want a serious relationship, but he is limited by his negativity and emotional issues. I realize it is my decision in whether or not I can accept that. What do you suggest?"
5whlj7,24,2017-02-27,I'm (22F) trying to find the right time to tell my parents (40s M/F) about my secret 5 year relationship. I think they already know?,secretluv,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5whlj7/im_22f_trying_to_find_the_right_time_to_tell_my/,"EDIT1: formatting
EDIT2: words

No idea where to start, but I'll try to keep it as organized as possible...here goes!

Grey &amp; I have been together since high school and are both now about to graduate college. My parents have met Grey multiple times as a ""friend"" - I've invited him and a few close friends over for some family gatherings - and I think they like him? They've never said anything bad about him, at least lol. My younger sister knows and has met Grey, and they get along. As far as other relatives, only some close cousins know about my relationship. We've talked about marriage and starting a family eventually, and I really want him to become a real part of my family. 

**Extent of Mom's knowledge of Grey:**

* Mom found out something was going on based on phone records within 1st few months of dating
* Told her the truth and tried to convince her to let me date (he is my first bf ever), but she made me call to break-up w/him the next day (I obviously didn't lol)
* **Her reasoning for not allowing me to date was because she wanted me to get a Bachelor's degree first**, but said that we could remain friends, and that if it was ""meant to be,"" we would end up together again 
* Her reasoning comes from experience (she &amp; my dad ALSO snuck around as teenagers and married young, then had me before finishing college. Ironic, right?), so I can kind of understand
* Mom helped Grey get an internship position at her workplace about 2 years ago, and I think that helped her get to know him better. She only had good things to say about him when she brought him up
* Started packing him food for school (she cooks for me when I visit on the weekends to bring back to school for the week)

**Extent of Dad's knowledge of Grey:**

* He may or may not remember Grey was my prom date lol
* Grey took his car to get fixed at my dad's, and he kind of walked him through what he was doing (brought him down to the pit and kind of taught him stuff). Outside of Grey, he has basically refused to help fix other friends' cars, now that I think of it...his reasoning being he didn't want to be responsible?? (weird thought as a mechanic but okay)
* Sparse interactions at the family gatherings

The reason I haven't told my parents for so long is for fear of their reaction and being disowned. 

* I grew up with the reputation of being the model child -- elders always spoke highly of/compared their kids to me. My parents have always been so proud, I was afraid to let them down because of how terribly they spoke about my other cousins having boyfriends. They have also been very strict on me growing up (and still are) whenever I go to hang out with friends back home (having curfew, against drinking, etc). I've never been to a sleepover!
* They also paid my way through college, pay for my car, are letting me live at home for free after grad until I find a job/place. I'm really blessed to have them as parents and feel terrible for lying, but I've just had so much fear. 
* My dad often speaks of reputation and threatens to leave the family if something went wrong/he is no longer needed?, and I don't want to be the reason for tearing us apart. But I'm an adult, and Grey is a part of my life that I want my family to know about. 

I'm working on trying to find a job so that I can be more independent, but I'm going to have to tell them eventually anyway. 

* My question is when/how? Before/after graduation? I honestly want to tell them before b/c my mom is planning to throw me a party and I'd really love to introduce Grey to everyone and not have to hide him at my own party. But I'm so afraid to bring it up. 
* On top of that, we are planning a big trip after graduation, so I'd have to wait even longer to tell them?
* Should I tell them together? Tell my mom first?
* How do I start the conversation??

This past summer I interned in NYC and made close connections with a few of the other interns where I worked. After we all got full-time offers, we decided we wanted to try to live together in NYC. 

There's three other people including myself looking for a 4-bedroom apartment, but biggest issue I see is that I'm the only one of them who is in the tri-state area. I'm not 100% sure anyone else would be able to actually come to NYC even for a few days and look at places with me, but I could try to arrange that if need be. We are looking to move in the first week of July, so we should have a lot of time to figure out our situation.

All of us have agreed to an individual budget maxing out at around $1500/mo for rent, meaning $6000 total. Where that gets us isn't the issue as much as how I go about explaining to brokers or landlords why I'm the only one there in a group of four. Is this situation at all common in NYC? Is this just not feasible to do? Would brokers not even try to accomodate us for this situation? Could the guarantor (something I know is a thing in NYC real estate) be split up into multiple parties, since I can't imagine any one of our individual families being able to put up 40 x $6000 as a safety net?

Any advice at all would be appreciated!

5wlq1r,5,2017-02-27,"I feel like a failure, but i know i shouldnt",well_shiit,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5wlq1r/i_feel_like_a_failure_but_i_know_i_shouldnt/,"It’s been a little more than two months since I graduated college with a bachelors in economics. I graduated a semester early (so in about 3.5 years) and am 21 years old. I have been struggling to find a job and it has really been hard on me mentally. The first month without finding a job was not so bad because I didn’t expect much, due to the holidays and new year, but the past month or so has been pretty hard. I have had maybe a dozen phone interviews, but only one in-person interview. I felt that the one in-person interview went really well and that was two weeks ago today and I haven’t heard anything from them, which they said they would get back to me last week. 

I was never the smartest person in school but I got by. In high school I was in mostly honors classes, the B student of the honors kids. I went to college studying mathematics but change once I got to the higher up calculus. I really got interested in economics and still today find it interesting, but I sometimes doubt my major of choice. I look at the jobs and a bulk of them ask for accounting or finance majors, which I was unable to major in, due to my college having a minimum high school GPA to apply to those majors. It pisses me off that my bad grades during my freshman and sophomore year of high school have come back to bite me in the ass this far in life. 

Job searching has become one of the most draining tasks of my life. It has affected me mentally and put me in a bite of slump. I avoid going out and being social because I find my inability to find a job an embarrassment. The part that is the most depressing is that most entry level roles I do find, ask for 1-4 years related experience, which I do not have. My only work experience is an internship I did this past summer and was extended for the fall semester. The internship was with the US Department of Treasury and was some of the best 6 months of my life. I really had a great time with the people I worked with and I felt that I was really appreciated there. When the internship ended, I told that if I wanted, when they hired at the beginning of the year, I would be on the top of the hiring pool for new candidates. But after the new administration put a freeze on government jobs, the position was taken away. I’ve applied to well over a 100 positions, all over the United States and not much luck. I am really worried for the future when I must start paying back all my student loans, which is a substantial amount. I don’t bring that up to my friends because they are mostly all engineering majors and have little to no loans, whether it be from scholarships or grandparent paying for their schooling. 

It has really been a struggle on me mentally. I spend most of my days at home alone and search for jobs, I see the same jobs every day and new ones don’t come along as often as id like. I wanted to prove to my father that going to college was actually a good decision and was better than just taking some dead-end job in the smallish town I am from. If I had stayed there much longer, I probably would be still living at home and/or gotten some chick pregnant (I feel like that is what happened to most of my high school graduating class). Currently I am living off my savings and have until the end June (when my lease runs out) to find a job and not have to move back home. I never though not being able to find a job would cause this much stress and affect me mentally, like it has done so already and makes me feel like a failure, even though I understand that I have accomplished more than a lot of people do.

5wluck,76,2017-02-27,"Today, at work, I flushed my boxers down the staff toilet.",ReachH,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5wluck/today_at_work_i_flushed_my_boxers_down_the_staff/,"TLDR I was edging. Been edging for days now, just to reddit girls. It started as an idea. I was gonna message and talk to these girls. I was feeling so good, been going out, dating, dancing, making out with random girls. I thought I wouldn't look at my favorite reddit girls, I'd just message them because why the fuck not. I thought this is way better than porn, at least there's a psychological arousal. At least there's some talk. 

Fast forward to my 5:30am, I was stood-up yesterday. And this morning I was distraught. I brought myself back by smashing my morning workout. During my shower, I was watching camgirls fap. The seeds had been sown. I dressed in front of an open window, I felt powerful as fuck. I can do NoFap and check out redditgirls - at least they're like the real girls I'm chatting up. 

Then at work I was browsing the subreddits. It was no longer just checking up on one or two or three favorite girls. I was indulging in even more novelty. I wasn't even close, but I guess 14 days of spunk just can't be held back. I clenched as hard as I could but there was so much. I experienced it with excruciating awareness of every moment thanks to my meditation. The transition from surprise, to determination, to resignation, to figuring out what the fuck to do. 

Thank fuck my colleague was out of the room. I grabbed a wad of tissue and crammed it down my pants to limit the transfer onto the trouser. I immediately bee-lined for the restroom. I locked myself in and started undressing to clean the mess. It was a fucking mess and the whole toilet smelled of zinc. I comforted myself that people would think it was just chlorine for cleaning the toilets, but who am I kidding - it's a mans toilet. Someone will wonder. I resigned myself to the logical outcome. I needed to ditch the underwear. I folded it up and shoved it into my back pocket, as flat as possible. I left to look for an unguarded waste paper bin to steal it's plastic bag. I go left - no dice, my colleague is interviewing some interns. I go right and find a bin. But it's right next to a meeting room with massive glass walls and a full house. Fuck. Would they suspect a man carrying a bin back into the bathroom? I had no options, I went back in the bathroom. Hopefully they'll just assume I had the runs. I'm in my cubicle when my boss comes in. He tries the first door, I forgot to lock it. Luckily I body block. Unluckily I'm holding my underwear. I pray he was so surprised his brain didn't notice. So I undo my pants again to make sounds like I'm about to shit. I'm sitting there, holding my stained under-garments, listening and smelling my boss take a desperate shit. I rattle the paper dispenser as I dip my boxers into the toilet water. It's my only option. My last hope. I pray it flushes. I try to estimate the girth of soggy boxers versus a massive turd. I think it will work. I stand up, the underwear has soaked and expanded, but the bunched elastic barely fits. I say a small prayer and flush. Meanwhile in the next cubicle, my boss is straining. The bowl fills up with water, no dice. The toilet automatically flushes again. The bowl fills up further, to the brim. And by the mercy of almighty God it starts to drain, and the soiled linen is sucked away. I stare agape at the scene, thankful. So thankful.

I'm going to reset and keep going. I'm going to destroy my day's to-do list as restitution. Mozart and coffee, sans underwear. I'm going to go upstairs and have lunch with the cutie in another department that's been flirting with me. I'm going to go out tonight to a music cafe I frequent now. I'm going to see some familiar faces. The counter is reset, and life goes on. I'm sorry to myself for failing. I respect the reset and will pay with effort going forward.

When you start fighting against this beast, it fights back. Hard. It spills over into your new life, even as your days get more and more glorious. The beast lurks in the shadows waiting for your hubris to reveal a path to your jugular. Be vigilant. Cultivate discipline. Practice courage. Live your life, really live it. Forgive yourself. Keep moving forward.

Thanks for reading."

Totally clueless college kid here who had made that amount during a summer internship. My earnings weren't taxed during the summer (with held?), so I understand that i would need to pay up now, but $2.5k+ seems like a lot on that amount. I am using turbotax and claimed as a dependent by my parents. Did I fill something out wrong? Additional info (don't know if it helps): I'm in CA; had another part time job during the academic year but those wages were taxed properly (i was supposed to get a $270 refund according to what i entered on my w-2 until I input info about the 1099-MISC); I don't pay any tuition (financial aid and scholarships covered it), but I pay for rent and living expenses. 

Any help is appreciated! 

edit: the $2664 number is just for my federal taxes (not including state or local taxes) 

edit 2: my total income for 2016 was $15,795 (this is the $11.5k+$4k~ from my other part time job mentioned above). Given these numbers, I tried calculating using some of the percentages mentioned in the comments and came up with $2402.50 for federal tax alone. What does the extra $200 (from the number turbo tax gave me) account for then?

Chapter 41:  Alternative News

An Aldari, Jhoolian, and human were sitting at the airport. The security guards would’ve thought this was the start of a lame bar joke if it wasn’t for all of the serious-faced lawyers, witnesses, and judges who didn’t look like they had a sense of humor.
 
“So, let me get this straight,” a lawyer said, tapping his electronic pen against his tablet. “At sixteen-hundred local time you, Private Maria Longshanks, claim that you met and interacted with Sophia Komnenos, twin sister of the famed Athena Komnenos in the Imperial Bazaar.”
 
“I told you. No, I don’t just claim,” Maria said impatiently. “I know. She told me herself. And she would have told you too if she was here.”
 
“But you had no proof she was Sophia Komnenos?” the lawyer continued. “You only had her word and, ahem, the hearing abilities of this alien?”
 
“She’s not just an alien. She has a name. Alice,” Maria said.
 
“Why are we talking about this?” another lawyer said. “It’s beside the point. Who cares if it was really Athena Komnenos? The allegations are whether or not a xenoi attacked the famed Russian scientist Boris Federov.”
 
Maria wanted to scream. The three of them were in a rather informal court gathering.  They were in an airport instead of an actual court room because apparently there were some orders from Constantinople for the Imperial navy to mobilize. The engineer was dying to know what the hell was going on in space, and not deal with this ridiculous hearing.
 
Sophia Komnenos disappeared soon after that incident. That was fine. The woman told her that she should probably escape, lest she meet the clutches of the media and subsequently the wrath of the Komnenos family.
 
What was not fine was that everybody thought that OoO attacked an apparently famous Russian scientist. On purpose. As in, people believed that OoO maliciously assaulted the unprovoked man who was doing research on Alpha Centauri. Which was completely idiotic. She had no idea how that happened. There were hundreds of people in the bazaar, all of which saw the bounty hunter run off with the screaming woman. But for some reason the media ran with the story “innocent man mauled by space slug.” Nor did it help that apparently there were a lot of alien racists (specists? Xenoists?) in the bazaar that day.
 
Boris Federov, the name of the bounty hunter, was lapping up all the attention.
 
“It was as if I hit a brick wall,” he said reporters thrusting their microphones near his mouth. He had a hint of a French accent, and Maria felt glad he still had two black eyes. She felt disgusted that she felt that the Russian/French man was at least remotely attractive. “I’m a large man. It takes a lot to bring moi down. I tried to calm the slug, but alas, nothing could stop his rage. Now, I don’t blame him for my injuries. Maybe he didn’t mean it. But Jhoolians are dangerous to be around, because at the flick of a switch they can beat le feces out of you.”
 
“You liar!” Maria yelled. Some guards had to restrain her. “You were the one that tried punching him first! OoO barely did anything! You were the one that got knocked back!”
 
“See what the unintelligible petite girl says?” Boris said. “The slugs hardly need to raise a finger to harm us. Look at me. I have two black eyes, three fractured ribs, and I’ll need to enter rehab for the next six months to fully recover. I salute our soldiers for being able to subjugate them with such a minute army. Those are brave warriors who could fight the monstrous xenoi like that.”
 
Maria was trembling, her fists balled up. Why the hell wasn’t anybody else speaking up? They were all there. They all saw Boris Federov making his way through the bazaar, pushing aside women and children. This was completely, incredibly unfathomable.
 
Nova Alexandria’s airport was only one of the five places on Alpha Centauri Prime where one could take a shuttle up to the space station. It was dominated by glass ceilings and walls, perhaps inspired by Jhoolian architecture. It gave the illusion that every room was much larger than it actually was. Trying to calm herself by gripping her bag, she forced herself to reassess. No, there were people that argued. Perhaps not as loudly, and perhaps not as argumentatively. But they were there. Individual citizens calmly and quietly described their viewing of events to the various judges and priests.
 
The judicial branch of the Imperium Romanum was headed entirely by the clergy, led by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople and the Pope in Rome. Upon conquering the first capital of the Romans soon after the execution of Charlemagne, the Immortal Imperator was at an impasse. While she could just force the Pope to bow to her, the Latin westerners and barbarians would not agree to that. They would have probably set up a new head of Christendom. The thought of their religious head, God’s regent on Earth, subservient to a human, a female human no less, would’ve triggered revolts in the already rebellious territories of Gaul, Germania, and other recently conquered parts of the Holy Roman Empire. So Bella Palaiologos had to find a different solution. And so, she established the third arm of the Imperium.
 
In addition to the Senate and Imperator branches, she gave power to the church to preside over court trials. Cases could be escalated from the lowest levels of priest and bishops all the way to the highest level of the five religious heads of the Pentarchy which both the Pope and the Ecumenical Patriarch supervised. And in this last, highest level, if the five seats unanimously agreed, a law drafted by the Senate and even the Imperator could be stricken down.
 
This gave the Immortal Imperator much respect and veneration. As the clergy was already the moral leader in medieval times, adapting the Christian bodies into a legal framework was easy. While there were still rebellions, none of them had any legitimacy in the eyes of the general public as any peasant leader would be revolting not only against the Roman Imperator but also the Pope.
 
Mind, the Pope nor clergy never actually did end up revoking any of Imperator Bella’s laws. While many local and provincial laws were deemed illegal and/or heretical, no Imperial-wide rule was repealed. Over the centuries the Imperator regained her power over the judicial branch, especially with the act that established the Imperial Executive Order. But by that time, well after the Immortal Imperator subdued Christendom, there was no one that doubted Imperator Bella was the second coming of Jesus, or the Messiah, or God’s true regent on earth.
 
Which is why half the lawyers and judges were wearing white clothes and funny hats. Honestly, they would’ve preferred for the “hearing” to be at the local church or court, but one man prevented this incident from even being a “trial” in the first place.
 
Grand Admiral S’bu Chukwumereije was at the center of attention. He was bound to a wheelchair. Apparently he spent most of his time in zero gravity even if there wasn’t a battle; the white-bearded commander said that it helped him think. Even the mandatory muscle-empowering drugs couldn’t reverse years and years of muscle atrophy. He was already old, but now he basically looked like a corpse. His eyelids couldn’t even stay open, and a nurse hurried around, shooing around bothersome reporters and readjusting IV needles.
 
“I’ve told you,” he said again. S’bu just sounded tired. Tired of the media, tired of the clergy, tired of the law, and tired of life. “These soldiers are under my command and authority. If anything, Maria Longshanks and yes, the two xenoi should go through a military tribunal, not this excuse you call a hearing. And I have orders from Constantinople to leave within the hour. Either this gets resolved now or you can interrogate my subordinates when they get back.”
 
“But Grand Admiral,” said a priest/lawyer, so young that he probably just graduated out of college. “We also have orders from Holy Terra that this must happen immediately. The Ecumenical Patriarch is a Komnenos too, after all. We’re already making concessions that this trial is taking place in an airport of all places.”
 
“This is not a trial and you know it,” S’bu Chukwemereije said. He took a moment to cough, and the nurse wiped the spittle from his mouth with a handkerchief. “This is an interrogation by the media and interns like you who want an extra line on their resume. Now if you don’t release my soldiers within the hour, I’ll personally ask the Imperator to detain all of you.”
 
“But Grand Admiral,” a reporter said, jabbing her microphone. The nurse snapped at her, but she didn’t relent. “You haven’t personally talked to the Imperator in years. Does she hold your opinion in high regard? When was the last time you’ve been to the Imperial Palace?”
 
An IV popped out of one of his veins, spewing saline all over the place. The nurse chided him and placed it back. S’bu didn’t flinch at the re-insertion. “I’ll be on my ship,” he said. “I don’t need to answer any of you. Private Longshanks. And Ooo. And Allysse or Alice or whatever your name is. If no one comes within an hour, we’ll be leaving without you.”
 
“Wait! One last question Grand Admiral!” a reporter said. Her microphone had an Imperial News Network icon. “What are your thoughts on your current mission? We’re not in a war, and it seems rather soon, doesn’t it? Do you trust the Imperator-Regent?”
 
The nurse started pushing S’bu’s wheelchair into the nearby terminal, not caring if she ran over people’s feet, which finally prompted people to back off. It was only halfway through the walkway that he replied.
 
“I trust the Imperator who trusts the Imperator-Regent. That is enough for me.”
 
“But I want to leave toooo,” OoO said, his arms pathetically reaching towards the Admiral, but that only prodded more reporters to pester him with a million more questions.
 
“Jhoolian! How do you feel about the Imperator-Regent’s remarks about not knowing the name of a xenoi we conquered?” one said.
 
“Mr. OoO, do you feel any repentance for injuring Mr. Boris Federov?” a priest said. OoO, meanwhile, looked overwhelmed by all the questions.
 
Throughout all the questioning, Maria was trying to think. It was hard with all of the noise, even harder than it was trying to concentrate while running in the bazaar. But something was off. Just why the hell were they being interviewed like this? Were these people actually part of the media and clergy? They did have official badges, but were they faked? No, no, that was nonsense. No way they’d dare fake being part of the news or clergy right in front of the Grand Admiral himself. So they were genuine. But did genuine members of these highly-recognized organizations act so, well, unprofessionally? Anyways, Maria couldn’t think about it any further. Her head was hurting too much. There was also another voice at the back of her head, one that she couldn’t ascertain was imaginary or not. “Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!”
 
The group of onlookers was getting bigger. There were only humans in the crowd. Maria noticed that over time, whenever Alice or OoO talked, they would start jeering or yelling. She tried peeling herself away on more than one occasion, but she wasn’t given the luxury. The crowd would just push her back.
 
The questions were getting harder, and the airport clock couldn’t tick by any slower. Twenty minutes, thirty, forty…really, has only forty-five minutes passed? People were holding up signs. “EXTERMINATE ALL XENOS,” “SUFFER NOT THE XENOS. THE IMPERIUM TRIUMPHS,” and “YOU WOULDN’T LET SPIES JOIN THE NAVY. WHY ALIENS?” were some of the hastily written signs. A chant was even growing. “XENOI DELENDA EST. XENOI DELENDA EST.”
 
OoO and Alice weren’t faring well. The lawyers asked them questions that made them stutter and squirm. “How do you feel knowing that Mr. Boris Federov has a wife and two kids? Did you know the Grand Admiral is a very untrusting man and hates aliens with every fiber of his being? Did you think that you had his trust? Do you know it’s a sign of disrespect to name yourself Alice after the Imperator?”
 
OoO’s skin was getting very dry. From over the months she worked with him, Maria knew it was a sign of nervousness. The normally cool Alice wasn’t much better. While she had initially deflected the first questions, her answers grew more and more flustered.
 
But then, finally, an hour passed.
 
“Excuse me!” Maria gasped, trying to clear some space. “I have to get up now! It’s been an hour! The Grand Admiral is waiting for us!”
 
“Ah, but yes Miss Longshanks,” a lawyer said, scrolling through his tablet. “But we need you to clarify your answer to this situation. You see, you assumed that Mr. Boris Federov was a bounty hunter solely on the word of Alice the Alari? I’m your friend. I can help you out. If you can deny these allegations, then you’re free to go.”
 
“Well, yes, that’s true,” Maria said. “But she’s telling the truth. Alice would never lie. And besides, I confirmed it later with Sophia Komnenos herself and…”
 
But her voice faltered at the sad expression on the lawyer’s face.
 
“I tried my best,” he said. “But you messed up. Come with me, Miss Longshanks and her two alien friends. You won’t be going on your mission after all.”
 
“What is the meaning of this?” a voice said, storming into the area. Maria saw it was the woman who raged into her computer at the bazaar. Her hopes lit up. There she was, a member of the tour group! She had no idea where they all disappeared to. The cyborg and the short man weren’t there, but the husband and wife and the four clearly ex-military soldiers was clearly enough proof.
 
“See! I was telling the truth!” Maria said, pointing a finger at them. “These are members of the tour guide that Sophia Komnenos was leading.”
 
The reporters and lawyers and priests swarmed around them, but the woman scoffed. “Get away from me. What the hell is going on? Why the hell are these people not on their ship? Why are you detaining them against their will? Why does the media get to question the defendants? This is not a proper court hearing.”
 
“Miss?” a priest said, as if expecting a name, but the woman just glared at him. “Sorry. Under Article XVII of the Declaration of Judicial Rights line 381b, it states that—”
 
“That document doesn’t exist,” the woman said. She only seemed to be getting madder and madder. “Off! All of you! Do none of you have better things to do? This is horseshit!”
 
Boris Federov spoke up. “Ma’am, how do you know this article doesn’t exist? It’s on all our data pads right now. And what gives you the authority to just dismiss everyone?”
 
“I should hope I know every single law in the Empire,” the petite woman said. There was venom, pure venom, in every syllable of her voice. “It’s part of my job.”
 
“Oh? And who are you?” Boris asked, pumping his chest up. “We have important priests and bishops from all corners of this planet. Employees of the Imperial News Network and other trusted sources are also present. Myself, I am the top researcher scientist serving under Aoi Goto herself, the Chief of Engineering. Not a bounty hunter as these people claim. Who do you think you are just strolling into here and interrupting this conversation?”
 
The woman’s eyes got even narrower. And then, she itched her cheek. No, not just a scratch. She tore into her face and ripped off her skin.
 
“My name is Allysse Palaiologos,” she said, strands of the face mask still clinging to her hair. “Queen of the Greeks, Basilissa of the Byzantine Empire, Imperator of the Roman Empire, Augustus of the Imperium Romanum. And I’m not in a good mood today.”
 
Several of the people in the room bowed down immediately. Others begged for forgiveness. Some, trying to argue that the claim was absurd, couldn’t speak more than gibberish and collapsed to the floor after a few seconds. Her presence was intensifying. Alice had to force the awestruck OoO and Maria down.
 
“What are you fools doing? There were hundreds of witnesses in the Imperial Bazaar, myself included, who all saw this man drag Sophia Komnenos away. Do any of you idiots dispute that claim? Why are you hounding these soldiers who should be heroes? Kill the xenos? What nonsense is that? True, we’ve invaded their planets and killed millions of lives. But these two souls chose to join the Imperium despite that. OoO and Alice chose to fight for our side despite us murdering their kin and friends.”
 
“But they’re spies!” said a rogue voice. “That’s the only reason to explain it! Think about if you were in their shoes!”
 
“Do you dare insult the Imperial vetting process?” the Imperator raged. Her true face was red, and her hair not in its usual tidy braid only made her look madder. She was waving her hands around, and Maria noticed one of them was still black with ink. “Just because you have the heart of a cricket doesn’t mean these three can’t see the bigger picture! Now scram, and let these three board their ships so they can risk their lives for the Imperium instead of sit their asses at a computer all day like you worthless no-lives!”
 
Silence. Maria looked at the Imperator. She couldn’t believe it. There she was, in all of her glory, defending a mere common peasant like her. That was the sort of story that one would pass through a family for generations. But then her heart felt cold.
 
“Greetings, Private Maria Longshanks,” Decurion John Smith said, also having ripped off his face mask. No wonder why he seemed so familiar. “I heard the Regent wants us to investigate the hostiles near the black hole. We shouldn’t keep the Grand Admiral waiting. You too, Privates OoO and Alice Alari. Come along now.”

He grabbed her by the forearm. As she walked down the terminal, she constantly shot back glances at the Imperator. Her head was still swimming with emotions. And there was still that aggravating, male voice screaming “Idiot! Idiot!” What the hell was that about? Was there something she missed?
 
“Imperator, a quick question,” a reporter said. In fact, it was the same reporter that asked Admiral S’bu his last question.
 
“No.”
 
“Was it you who cut the Faster-Than-Light Interstellar Communications Device off so we couldn’t transmit this to our stations on Terra?”
 
The woman’s eyes went wide as she pulled out a worn computer, eyes scanning through the text.
 
“…no.”

Mit dem 3:2-Sieg im Kellerduell gegen Arminia Bielefeld hat das Jahr 2017 für den Karlsruher SC optimal begonnen. Seitdem aber haben die Badener aus vier Spielen nur noch einen Punkt geholt und zuletzt sogar dreimal in Folge verloren. **Zu Buche steht deshalb Abstiegsplatz 17 und diesen zu verlassen wird mit einer Leistung wie am Montagabend beim FC St. Pauli kaum möglich sein.**

Mir fehlen ein wenig die Worte. (Mirko Slomka)

Am Hamburger Millerntor wurde der KSC über weite Strecken von einem zuvor punktgleichen Konkurrenten im Abstiegskampf vorgeführt und zerfiel am Ende in alle Einzelteile. Mirko Slomka war kurz nach Spielende weitgehend ratlos: _„Der Sieg war am Ende auch in der Höhe völlig verdient. Mir fehlen ein wenig die Worte. Wir haben in diesem Spiel eine Vielzahl an falschen Entscheidung getroffen, St. Pauli dagegen zu oft die richtige“_, zitiert die [Webseite des Kiez-Klubs](http://ift.tt/2lNIwcv) den KSC-Trainer, dessen Bilanz sich mit vier Punkten aus fünf Spielen wenig berauschend liest.

### Erst Hannover, dann nach Aue

**Und dem KSC droht am kommenden Wochenende der nächste Nackenschlag, ist doch dann mit Hannover 96 einer der Aufstiegsfavoriten zu Gast im Wildparkstadion.** Ohne signifikante Steigerung in allen Bereichen, vor allem aber im Defensivbereich, dürfte es die nächste Niederlage setzen und die ohnehin schon prekäre Situation würde sich weiter zuspitzen.

Ich bin schockiert. (Oliver Kreuzer)

In den kommenden Tagen ist allerdings damit zu rechnen, dass intern klare Worte fallen. Während Moritz Stoppelkamp bei [Sky](http://ift.tt/2m0WFDA) offen einräumte, dass es die Vorstellung eines Absteigers war, richtete sich die Kritik von Sportdirektor Oliver Kreuzer ebenfalls bei [Sky](http://ift.tt/2myJp70) ausschließlich in Richtung der Spieler: _„Wir haben heute eine katastrophale Leistung abgeliefert. Wir waren in allen Belangen unterlegen. Das hatte mit Zweitliga-Fußball nichts zu tun. Ich bin schockiert“_, so Kreuzer, der sich vor Trainer Slomka stellte: _„Das war Abstiegskampf, da kannst du dich nicht so präsentieren. Die Spieler sind nun gefordert.“_

Schon gegen Hannover, auf jeden Fall aber danach im nächsten Kellerduell bei Erzgebirge Aue.

Gewinnt der KSC gegen Hannover? [Jetzt wetten!](http://ift.tt/2lxRB9q)

5wmlmn,8,2017-02-28,Not sure if my ex is narcissistic... but I'm trying to find what I need to heal.,Ella999,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/5wmlmn/not_sure_if_my_ex_is_narcissistic_but_im_trying/,"Some of this post will be on the vague side because I am afraid to post too many intimate details of my story. I had been trying to leave my relationship for months now. We were together for 9 years. I have been overwhelmed for the past few years now with a lot of confusion and a lost sense of self. I go back and forth between healthy habits like eating well, meditating, sleeping well, exercising to unhealthy habits like binge drinking and using pot to cope. Some days, I have so much anxiety though it's nearly impossible to even leave my house. 
I started to think back to the time before I dated my ex and although my life was not perfect, I remember being a much stronger person with a clear set of goals. 
When we first met, I had just moved to a new city for college. I had no friends in this new city but my goal was to finish college and start a new career. We had became friends right away... but he always seemed to keep me at arm's length. We eventually slept together and the relationship moved slowly from there. 
I have very little knowledge of any of his exes and what his past relationships were like. I feel like I have asked him but he seemed to find ways to avoid the topic. And I eventually just gave up on asking. 
He was definitely a big charmer, makes a good amount of money and has his shit together. He always seemed to have the upper hand over me but that didnt' really bother me in the beginning. I was young and naive. To this day, I can be a very naive person. I have been told that I almost always find the good in everyone. 
The first red flag I missed came very early on. And to this day, I vaguely believe I had a temporary moment of insanity. We were hanging out and listening to music on his phone and he had fallen asleep. As I was going to change the song, a text came up from another girl. I could have sworn it was sexual in nature. I know this is so wrong, but I read the rest of the conversation and again I could have sworn it was an entire sexting convo. I'm not exactly sure what happened next.... if I woke him up to ask him about it or he woke up. Either way, I brought it up to him and he got extremely mad. Rightfully so, I was definitely in the wrong for peering into the rest of that texting convo. However, he was extremely mad and said that I didn't know what I was talking about because I had been drinking and that I was seeing things. He kicked me out of the house. Having been under the spell of ""falling in love,"" I believed and rationalized that I didn't know what happened because I was drinking.
Over the years, I blacked out many times when we had arguments. Everything was just too confusing for me to understand what exactly was going on. 
I seemed to have also lost touch with my personal values and my boundaries. I feel like over the years, I had been subtly manipulated with many different tactics. Early on, we would get into fights and he would not talk with me for weeks at a time. Because of this, not knowing if we still had a relationship or not. I was confused and I cheated on him. We were not talking at the time. I had to keep it hidden because I was very scared about how he would react. I felt absolutely horrible as I had never cheated before and it definitely goes against my own moral values. Because of this, I tried to end it years ago but I saw him cry for the very first time. And it hurt me to the core to upset someone I loved so much. So, I stayed with him. I sought help to figure out why I was so bad at being in a relationship. I began to think that I was extremely selfish because that's what he always told me. And yes, I probably do have a bit of a selfish streak. 
We fought many times over the years, because I felt like he made it very difficult for me to make friends. I have a very weak support system in this town. Virtually every time I had gone out to be social without him, he would get angry about it in one way or another. Telling me that I shouldn't go out alone because I do not understand how to handle myself. He has even asked me not to talk to people in certain situations where money could have been involved because I would fuck it up. 
Anytime I would talk about hanging out with a group of people, he would tell me that they were losers who don't have my best interest in mind. People he has never even met, but would say he just knows when people are not good. I have always been a little bit shy but over the years I developed a bit of social anxiety. It has gone away, but now I just have a generalized anxiety. 
When I did finish college, I was planning to take an internship in a different state. However, he subtly lead me to believe that he would help me get my career started better than taking an internship in another place. I bought in. And he did help with some things but they seemed to be always on his terms. I had to help him a lot with his pursuits as well. I guess I thought it was a decent balance. 
One time, when I tried to leave him a few months ago, I let him back in after a lot of texts from him. I felt really guilty. He seemed to have made an attempt to be less mean to me verbally. It was mostly sarcasm when he did say mean things but it still hurt me nonetheless. Especially when I would ask him to stop and he wouldn't. 

I found myself starting to lie about my whereabouts in recent months because I was desperately trying to build some semblance of a support system just in case our final breakup didn't go well. I feel terrible about lying. I was irrationally fearful to tell him the truth though, I was afraid to set him off. 

But here's where it gets confusing for me. I don't know why I was so fearful of telling him the truth of my whereabouts. He never got physically abusive and occasionally, when I did tell him what I was up to he would be sweet and tell me to have a good time. When he did get upset with me, I wondered if it truly is because I can be selfish and not put our relationship first. 

The other thing is that most of the time, we could talk for hours on end and never bore each other. We had a lot of good laughs and a lot of fun times. But I always had this nagging feeling that something just wasn't right. He never wanted to spend time around my family only occasionally when he felt comfortable about the situation. Usually just dinner or something if they were in town. I'm okay with that.... I know that it's important to respect your partner's comfort zones. But I feel like my family started to feel like something was a bit off. My parents really did like him. They thought he was sweet and we made a good match. It just seemed weird to them that he was always working when we had an important family function. 

I guess I'm really confused over the whole thing. I wonder if there is something wrong with me and that's why I ended it. Like maybe I really am scared of commitment. And I keep thinking in my head, what if I'm the narcissistic one? Maybe it's me that cannot figure out how to form healthy bonds. "

5wmtwt,14,2017-02-28,On the Subject of the Real-World,lilac-nightshade,HistoricalWorldPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/5wmtwt/on_the_subject_of_the_realworld/,"Ah! My Gosh, I don't even know how to begin saying this. It's... it's been an interesting series of events that has led me here today. And I am just beyond blessed that I can type out these words.

As some of you know, I was previously a ChemBE student before I ran into Organic Chem. My advisor really recommended that I switch over to something else, and I did. But I never did feel quite right leaving behind a potential engineering degree. It was unfinished business that would keep on nagging on my conscience for weeks to come. *However*, that would not be the end of my attempts at Engineering, for I have been given another God-granted chance at redemption. The curriculum is not going to be stupidly crazy trying to balance all these classes, but I know I can do it. 

Long story short, I'm on track to get myself 3 fancy new bachelor degrees, one of which is in Environmental Engineering. I'm still talking with my advisor about the feasibility of it, but I think I gave a good pitch for it.

On top of that, some of y'all also know how much I like internships. I didn't really pay attention to it in my first year at uni, but my mother's really been insistent that I do something about it (since all the other mothers are talking about their children doing stuff). In an effort to appease her and to build up my resume, I'm also going to be working over in the Office of Admissions for my university. Honestly I wasn't expecting to hear back from them, but they responded within three days of me sending in my application. So that's that I suppose. 

And finally, above all else: Volunteering. I realize I'm typing like a shit-load and I'm not getting to a point, so I'll just say that a good bff of mine dragged me along to a sort of extra-curricular group that spends a lot of time basically cleaning up trash in the nature preserve near my university. The group will be more active when the weather is warmer, but temperatures look to be rising pretty soon. I'm having my first meeting with the group in question Friday of this week. 

So. The point. After a long introduction, is there a point to this? 

Haha, gosh. I'm just rambling. Unlike my other posts, there really isn't a way to just come out and say it. 

At this current point in time, I do not think that I can keep on playing HWP. No, I'm not going to delete my account (so I'm still reachable here and on Discord). No, this isn't about some form of justice. Honestly, the responsibilities of my (self-inflicted and) hectic were always there, but it's gotten to the point where I cannot balance a game and my responsibilities to my resume as an adult in the working world. 

In 2 years, I'll be out looking for a job. And in this day and age, having a strong backdrop and active involvement above academics (just like highschool, I'm sensing a pattern) is almost necessary for the kinds of work that I want to get into.

So... yeah. It's been an interesting time here in HWP, for both seasons, and so goes the end of an era. 

Blogman, my dude, you're more than welcome to expand over into my lands. It would be easiest to have the Dukes stage a revolt, create 12 separate Duchies, and then either invade or be diplomatic to absorb them. Also, I'd recommend that you snatch the workings of Mr. Erick Bloomburg. Pretty sure he'll be of use to combat the plague. There's no one else who is more deserving of my lands, and I know you will treat them well. The work we've done really has been unmatched by anyone else in the sub, and my God has it set a standard. Is that narcissism? Is that my attempts at a huge compliment? A bit of column A, a bit of column B. 

To the Celtic nations, I'm pretty sure this wasn't going to come as a surprise to anyone, but I was going to join the Union after this disease was over. As you can tell, I'm very melodramatic, and I wanted to stress stuff about national identities and whatnot. Still. I hope that y'all can color the New World with your colors and carry out the fantastic gameplay methods y'all have had since day one.

Ducker, congrats on having an Empire! Just like Japan in S1, it brings me joy to see people take an area with zero resources and makes a large and powerful force from the ground up. Go forth in the name of all Vuugists, and maybe kinda try to make a Vatican. I'd like to see that in my irl lifetime. 

Mi querido Frankia, no hay mucho que puedo decir sobre como deberias de seguir en mi ausensia. You're going to go off and be the major middle power in our part of Europe that I already said you were going to be. Cheers! Si nesesitas algo, estare in el Discord, al cantio de un gallo. 

Toz. Obibo. My dude. It's almost like the fates purposefully kept us from ever doing any RP that was world-changing. Wars. A plague. Wars again. Such a shame that your wares will never grace our markets, and the mysterious land of wonder will have to be embraced by someone else. Still, we had a good run. Even today, I still reread the work we've done in fond remembrance. Golden times, I tell ya.

And that just about covers it. So long, and thanks for all the colonies.

5wmyk0,2,2017-02-28,Oversea internships—how to reach out and land a job,ECTD,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/5wmyk0/oversea_internshipshow_to_reach_out_and_land_a_job/,"So I've been lurking here for a bit and figured that I wouldn't bother to ask questions relating to exams and which one to do first... 

However, I've ran into another problem: I don't want to do an internship in the US—mainly because I'm in such a remote region in the US it'd be just as good for me to go overseas (from ND). 

I have 1 exam passed and I am studying for the second one; I am obtaining 2 degrees—the first is in math with a minor in Statistics and the second is in Economics with a minor in Computer Science; I'm in my 4th semester (though I'm a senior in credits). I've done about 3 semesters of research, only one of which is in statistics. I know R, SPSS, all Microsoft suite, and Spanish to boot. On top of that, I lead 3 organizations on campus.

As it stands, I'm making over $41,000/year (I became homeless so I qualify for tons of money, plus I work as hard as I can) in scholarships and I am happily applying for unpaid internships, but I just don't know the exact medium to reach out to people. For example, I just went through a list of all of the Society of Actuaries in Ireland's 2016 list and e-mailed every single person listed from international companies (20 or so) with my resume and CV. 

I'm currently looking for jobs in the UK, but I want to know what anyone here has experienced within this realm of internships. How did you reach out? How did you apply for it? How did you stand out? How did you find the opportunities?"
5wnbtk,2,2017-02-28,I [21 F] don't know if my LDR relationship (1 year dating/2 years of being together) with him [23 M] is doomed.,_LXC,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5wnbtk/i_21_f_dont_know_if_my_ldr_relationship_1_year/,"Please excuse the long background story but I feel like it's important to know. 

Some background info: 

I met my current boyfriend on tinder after matching in 2014. We met after a few months of talking and really seemed to connect but I decided not to pursue anything because at the time I had other love interests. Fast forward to the summer of 2015, we started to reconnect and talk more. We hung out a few times and went to a music festival together. In the car on the way to the festival, I knew there was something different about this guy and I knew I wanted to be with him. He had been kind of talking to another girl when we went to the festival but made it clear he was interested in me over her. We had an amazing time there together. We continued talking into the fall. I was starting my sophomore year of college at the time and being the dumb girl I was, I started talking to someone else when I got back to school. Basically I was talking to both the guy from the summer and this new guy (my excuse being I didn't know exactly what I wanted and the new guy was easier because he went to the same school whereas other guy was at school 2 hours away and didn't have a car). I ended up dating the guy at school for a few months but was still talking to the guy from before. I ended up cheating on the guy from school to be with the guy from before. I admitted to it and I know it was shitty to do but that's not the point of this post. I've been officially dating tinder boy officially for over a year now. In my eyes, our relationship has been amazing. I've never been more in love with someone or connected with someone more. After he graduated from college (May 2016), he got a job and moved to the other side of the state (a 5 1/2 hr drive). I also spent last summer interning in another state, so it's safe to say, we've been dealing with a long distance relationship for quite a while. 

Distance is hard but because I love him so much, it doesn't matter to me and I would do anything to make our relationship work. I'm completing another internship this summer after graduation, this time on the opposite side of the country. Recently, I think my boyfriend has doubts about our relationship. God forbid I mention the future because he likes to take things one day at a time, but it's important for me to know if he even sees a future. A few days ago, he came home to my side of the state and we saw each other and I thought everything was great. When I was leaving, he didn't really even seem to care all that much and wasn't a lovey as usual. When we were texting that night, I brought it up. All he said was ""sorry it wasn't enough"" and then brought up how summer is going to be difficult. In response, I said something about how I think that means he should be cherishing the time we have now. This was his response: ""I am cherishing it. It's just I've also felt kind of distant. I just feel like I've been being criticized a lot recently and like, everything has to be done your way. And even when I do do things it just doesn't seem like enough...So it makes me think maybe I'm just not right for you. It makes me think I should let you be free when you're gone so you can find someone who can be that stuff for you and does do these things"".  All of this came as a shock and I was hurt because he's never said anything like this before. We decided to meet again the next day to talk things out before he had to leave. We discussed everything in that message and came to solutions on the criticism thing etc. The thing I can't get out of my head is the way he answered the question ""do you think we should break up?""  He said that he didn't know. The talk (with lots of crying from both parties) shifted to basically how I think he's ""the one"" and how he doesn't know if I'm that for him. The talk ended with more crying but him deciding he wanted to stay together. 

My question is, what am I supposed to do with this information now? All I can think about is how he clearly isn't happy with something and has doubts about our relationship and me being the right one for him. It's really difficult for me because now I'm doubting our relationship. What should I do?

TL;DR:
Long distance relationship going well has turned sour when boyfriend mentions doubts in the relationship. "

* Economic Analysis Master’s degree 
* Cracow University of Economics graduate
* Excel &amp; R enthusiast
* Freelancer for 8 years and counting
* Looking for paid internship or junior position (freelancing only)

Hi! 

My name is Przemek and I am 25-years old guy living in Cracow, Poland. I finished 5-year long studies of Economic Analysis at Cracow University of Economics, I got my master’s degree here. During my studies I had multiply classes connected with data science – we used R, MS Excel and Statistica (which is similar to SPSS or any other statistics software). 

I would like to find a job as Data Scientist. So far I don’t have any experience in working in this area. Right now I am working online as a journalist on the biggest Forex website in Poland. However, for some time I feel that I should use more of the knowledge I gained during my studies, I believe that I would enjoy it more than my current work. I am only interested in working as a freelancer, I am really self-disciplined, I work that way since I was 17 years old. 

I know that my lack of experience as data scientist is a problem. This is why I want to earn some experience in real environment. I am really interested in any kind of internship so you can see my value. If you are looking for someone ambitious and eager to develop, I am perfect choice for you. 

Who am I in normal life? I’m friendly, easy-going guy with a lot of friends. Me and my fiancée work from home, she is a journalist. I am intelligent – few years ago I got my Mensa certificate with IQ of 156+ in Cattell scale (yeah I know, like anybody in XXI century think that IQ itself matter). I love travelling, in my life I hitchhiked more than 20k km and visited 30+ countries, mostly in Europe. 

I hope this little description of me will help you decide whether you want me in your teams. Well, I just want to become true Data Scientist, that’s all :)

5wnwlq,6,2017-02-28,Is this behavior considered narcissistic?Mother driving me crazy.,family_of_martyrs,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5wnwlq/is_this_behavior_considered_narcissisticmother/,"Sorry for the wall of text,I need your opinion to understand what is going on.

I am 24 years old,female and have a shit-ton of siblings (4 brothers and sister to be exact,everyone older than me).Mother(60yrs old) has been divorced the last 15 or so years,she is controlling even to the siblings that have moved away,always demanding to know about their finances and always whining if they don't offer her half of their paycheck as a gift to her. My (disabled) sister always gives her all her benefits money,keeping about 50$ cash on hand for when she runs errands. - She whines the very next moment right in sister's  face that no one has ever helped her financially and as her children,we are obliged to.Unless we get a high-paying job across the world and of course take her with us,we are supposed-according to her- to stay in the tiny family home for life-or until we find a husband.

I moved away for 4 years for school,worked two jobs to cover tuition,books and food and shared the rent with 5 roommates.She demanded me to move back home imeddiately after passing my last exam.I went back,found a paid internship (about 800$ month,not too much but good enough for a start).Worked there for 7 months,double shifts and all,quit due to burnout and horrible boss.Of course her encouraging words were ""Wait until you get a job,you have seen nothing yet,when you have to work you will know how it is"".According to her,real work is only unskilled manual labor (her current job description).So,according to her,the 7 months worth of double-shift computer repair work plus 4 hours commute is not worth shit and the years I spent studying are lost time.

She now demands that I give up all the money I earned (I spent about 4000$,the rest is sitting in the bank in case of emergency-and I am the only one in the family who opened a bank account without her name on it)...Because according to her that's what a child should do,give all the money they earn to the parent.I always tell her I think this is a stupid move because if I do this I will be broke in seconds,I would rather pay the bills or the groceries and keep some money to myself.Cue the waterworks and the woe-me-the-martyr whining ""But I always gave all my money to raise you and never kept anything to myself or have any savings,I gave you a decent childhood,do the right thing and be self-sacrificing like me!""..Of course that's why this family is broke and me buying 10$ worth of cosmetics once a year from my hard-earned money is considered the ultimate treason,or my BC meds are a useless luxury (that I pay with my own money) since I have no boyfriend (I could go on with a list from Earth to Moon about all the things I spend my money on and get whined at about.)

More short examples:
-Wanting to shower more than once a week?Why are you so selfish?
-Wanting to go out alone?Are you meeting someone there?No?Ok,I'm coming with you.
-Wanting privacy in the bathroom?Tough luck,there is no lock and she barges in whenever without knocking and ignores if you ask her to get out (onlt does this to me and sister,but it's still shitty).
-Always making bitter comments about any woman who wears make-up or nice clothes,always bitter comments about families who order take-out instead of cooking all day,always acting as if anyone else's cooking is disgusting and hers is the food for gods.
-Whenever I decide to throw out or donate my old stuff,she goes through the boxes behind my back and puts everything back in the closets pretending that someone already picked them up from the front yard while I was in the bathroom.My closet broke because of that and it took me a while to figure out why.And then she whines I have too many clothes and take too much room in the house.(Half or more of the house is treated as a storage room by her)
-She believes that it's ok for me to have to share a room with 3 other adult siblings and have no privacy and no quiet at all,and that I am a spoiled brat for wanting to have my own space even for a few hours a week.
-She always makes misogynistic comments right in my face,about perceived flaws in strangers-that are things I do too and are perfectly fine,and then pretends I am crazy for telling her that her behavior is shitty.(example: I wear make-up,she sees a woman with similar to mine make-up ""Oh look at that she is like a painted whore"").
-Whenever someone tells her about her current bad behavior,she fake-cries and starts listing all the sacrifices she made for us years ago and how she should be above all criticism.As if choosing to have so many children makes you instantly a saint for some reason.
-I am not allowed to go out without at least her and my sister,so I can't make friends-meet people to date,and also I am not allowed to online date.Of course she never expressed not allowing me to,but if I do go out on a date she calls me every 5 minutes and if I miss a call she berates me at home.
-I still have a curfew,I am not allowed to stay out past 20:00 (even when I was working,I got yelled for coming home after that).
-I can't have any hobbies that do not consist of cleaning the house and cooking all day,or else I am disgustingly selfish and an egomaniac  according to her.
-Plays the martyr all the time ""My problems are soooo bad...No I won't tell you what's wrong,you should have guessed.No one cares about me,you do not know what having problems feels like."".
-Whenever I mention saving money to move out,she starts crying and claims that my sister's condition got dangerously worse while I was away for school,so I should never move out or I am evil.

Tl;dr : A pot-pourri of mother's behaviors , waiting for your opinion if narcissist or not."

Everywhere that I look online, I see so much about how the tech industry is sexist against women, and how women are leaving because the feel isolated. But I don't feel that way. I admit, I'm still a student and I haven't had much experience in industry. Even my internship was in academia. 

I actually feel like I belong, but not with the other women. Other women talk about how they feel strange being surrounded by men, and feel left out and like they have to be someone they're not. But this is who I am. I fit in with the guys, and I can't get along with the girls. I feel isolated, not because of the male dominated field, but because people think I should be isolated an I am not. 

Does anyone feel this way? Is there any science I can point to to describe this phenomenon?

To be clear, I'm not saying that women shouldn't be in computing and I'm not denying that the computing industry isn't perfect and could be better for women at large. I'm just saying that while we're encouraging little girls to get into computer science, we should also be encouraging little boys. Some children will be influenced more by the fact that they are being singled out than they would have been if they were simply ignored and left to do what they want whether that be computing or something else. And while that may or may not be a small proportion, I think it's a unique and interesting point to bring up in a class speech."

5wp5hd,10,2017-02-28,Some lessons learned and tips to stay on top of your finance and retirement goals,peppaz,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5wp5hd/some_lessons_learned_and_tips_to_stay_on_top_of/,"Very quick story and some lessons I learned.

I went from broke graduate student / government intern at 25, living in Manhattan, to mildly successful Director at 32. During these 7 years, between two different jobs, my salary changed more than 8 times (always in the right direction, thankfully.) I want to retire early and comfortably, so I started trying to set myself up for that. I am nowhere near my goals, but you need a goal to start down this road at all.


I was always contributing to 401ks and saving what I could (not much). Rent and food was always an upsetting pain (extremely high in NYC if you aren't crafty about it) and took a big chunk out of my extra cash, and still does.
So lazily, instead of drastically cutting expenses, I tried to grow my salary, which did work.

My point is this: When you start to become successful *(and all of you will, since you already took the first step to educate yourselves and read forums like this)* and get some breathing room in your budget, it is a natural tendency to increase you spending WHILE decreasing you vigilance over your finances.


Do not let lifestyle creep or extra cash put you behind where you started by not monitoring and adjusting to your new financial situation. Here are some the ways I try to stay ahead of the curve into early retirement. All of these concepts revolve around the idea of **PAYING YOUR FUTURE SELF AS IF YOU WERE A BILL.** Think about that and reflect on it.

* **Maximize ALL pre and post tax advantaged investment accounts.** It only takes $692 pre-tax dollars to maximize your 401k, only about half of which you would see if you don't invest it. You are buying your own money from the government basically. Even if your company offers expensive shitty, investment plans, absolutely take advantage of them and try to move your money to lower cost funds in the future.


* **Open a low-fee Roth IRA IMMEDIATELY if you don't have one**. Vanguard will let you open one with only $1,500. $10,000 in a single qualifying fund gets you admiral shares, which typically have an Expense Ratio of 0.05%. Check your MAGI against the limits which I believe are $118,000 (phase out begins) to $133,000 (ineligible) for single filers. The contributions are post-tax, and the withdrawals are not taxed when you are of age. Contributions can be taken out at any time with no penalty (except for the future earnings you lose on them)


* **Start investing (smartly) outside of your retirement accounts.** I use Acorns, which uses low Vanguard index funds. I set up a daily contribution of $7. This adds up to $2,500 a year, just as a little piggy bank. I also use eTrade to invest in companies I like, but this is just play money. Never invest money that you need or don't have, since is it literally gambling.


* One thing I do not do and am chastised about is not keeping a **separate emergency fund**. The arguments are that there is a chance that when you need the money, the market is probably doing poorly also so you would have to sell investments at a loss to get the cash you need. For me, I have no family and no car or home, so any large, unexpected cash needs I can easily come up with, between liquid investments, cash on hand and credit. I would rather every dollar I have be working for me, at a risk level I can pre-determine and tolerate, than have a pile of cash sitting and earning nothing. It is still recommended to have a few months living expenses on hand for when you need it. Not a bad idea.


* **Get your student loans in order.** Check your interest rates. If you are paying more than about 5-6%, start paying extra on every payment if you can. My loans total about $40,000 at 4.6% for undergrad and graduate school because I went to CUNY to save money. The minimum payments are about $280 a month, which I contribute $380 to. That extra hundred bucks is basically like earning 4.6% on an investment because the interest on that part of the principal does not capitalize. Try to consolidate your loans into a lower interest loan if you can, there are some companies that do this, but be careful, there are a lot of predatory practices in this field (just like issuing student loans themselves - what 18 year old understands the day they leave college they will start paying $1200 a month forever after graduating from NYU? none.)

* **Don't Use Credit Cards.** Even if there are rewards, letting the interest capitalize on the balance even just for one month will outweigh the rewards of the card,like cash back. I have an Amazon rewards card and the only time I use it is when I immediately log onto the Chase app and pay the card off completely that instant. Even having autopay pay the full balance is risky depending on the card, since they like to charge interest for even just one day after interest kicks in. Don't get scammed. If you have Credit Card debt- snowball it by transferring high APR balances to low APR cards and prioritize paying those debts down first and foremost before any post tax investments.

* **Keep watch of your finances.** I did everything wrong and still struggle with this. There is a story about a famous basketball player, many of whom go broke after leaving the NBA/NFL because they don't know how to manage their finances and are taken advantage of- This one fellow was paying 60 peoples' cell phone bills, since he felt he owed them and they expected him to because it was so little compared to his multi-million dollar contract. Don't do it. I stopped monitoring my finances like a hawk - I used to check every bill and autopayment that went out because each one was painful. I stopped doing that when I had the extra cash, and went back and found incorrect bills and fraudulent charges. Don't make that mistake. Many rich people are rich because they live like they make or have much less. Stay on top of your spending with budgets that you stick to, and monitor all outgoing money.


* **Entertain yourself with cheap hobbies.** I play WoW on some weekends instead of going out, and I know I save hundreds of dollars by not leaving the house for a night out between drinks, cabs, dinners and entertainment. Absolutely go out, and have fun, but don't party every weekend. It isn't healthy for your body or your wallet, even though t feels nice to spend $100 on dinner and not flinch because there is $7,000 cash in your checking account. Don't do this. Get outside, exercise, enjoy nature and be thrifty with your hard earned money. (but treat yourself within reason once in while.)

This is something I struggle with still: Every Penny Counts. Really it does. I still buy $4 coffee form Starbucks, and order seamless a few times a week because I don't feel like preparing food. But I am aware of this, and working to reduce unnecessary spending


There is a lot more, but trust me when I say, you will be successful, and you will be smart enough to keep that success forever.


Please ask any questions - I am not an expert but I have lived through a lot of this and other stuff.."
5wpn3c,0,2017-02-28,[REQUEST] [XBOX] XBONE. Please help me bond and build a relationship with my brother! - Second Try.,AmericanPatriot117,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/5wpn3c/request_xbox_xbone_please_help_me_bond_and_build/,"My brother moved away for college about 3 and 1/2 years ago. He went 5 hours and two states away. We didn't have the best relationship at the time and building it hasn't been a priority until recently. I am two years younger than he is, btw. I go to a college in my home town so the distance didn't change more than 20 minutes. This spring, though, I accepted an unpaid internship in the city he lives in and luckily a spot opened up in his house for me to live. You may be asking why I took an unpaid internship in a different city.. I am trying to work in the entertainment industry and landed an awesome one, right where I'd like to work. I am still taking part-time school online too.

Anyways, growing up really the only thing we connected on was video games. Specifically Halo 3. To this day he still talks about how much he loves it with our roommates. I can't help but think that with the generosity of a redditor, I could surprise him with a game we could connect on and build our relationship anew. We don't get to see each other until night time because we are both busy during the days, but he also has a Girl friend of 6 years so that makes it even harder. I just want to give him a solid memory of us together as we spend one semester of our college experiences together.

How do we both have xbox ones? I bought mine with money from high shool, when I was a freshman in college on black friday. He was gifted his by his old roommate who left it when he moved out. Given that we are both in college and with busy schedules, buying a game isn't the easiest think.

I would like to get a game on xbox live that we could game share on consoles and play together! The reason I came up with this whole idea is because of Halo War 2's release and I thought that would be so fun for us, especially given our history with the wonderful Halo franchise.. But I heard him talk with a friend about destiny too, so that could be a fun way to connect, though I have never played. Destiny including all DLC is only $40 right now, that I could get from the Microsoft store or buy it from my xbox. Halo 2 is brand new at $60. Either would be so appreciated. Lastly I think the new game For Honor would be great given his and my interests. It seems like a new innovative game and an awesome way for us to connect. 

Maybe you are passionate about a franchise or game I listed or just brothers bonding, but I would love some help! I just think this would be such a cool move to further our relationship and can't do it without your help.. Thank you so much!!

When asked recently why only these two games I explained with this - Growing up I always liked Call of Duty but he never got into it. He really doesn't enjoy modern war games or even semi modern. I watched some footage of For Honor and might revise my list by taking it off. The reason I chose halo wars 2 and Destiny are because he loves the halo franchise. He's very interested in it, and loves strategy games. He even mentioned it to me, like ""oh that's cool!"" To this day his favorite number is 117 hahah!

As far as destiny goes, I've never played it but I can explain it's relevance as far as I know. The whole point in me getting a game for us to game share would be for us to spend time playing together. Destiny seems to have an online mode where we can enjoy classics like team death match. But being able to do online campaigns and adventures reminds me of when we used to play halo 3, split screen campaign. I am trying to make friends outside his friends group but when I was with one of his buddies he mentioned that his house plays destiny so I thought that would be cool for us to play together, and if I can't, at least he can keep playing with his friends!

I think these three games make the most sense given his interests! Although he may enjoy shadows and Skyrim, I really would like to get something we can play together and build our relationship on co-op adventures and challenging eachother!"

I haven't had an internship though. Everyone I've talked to has told me not to take another exam since I have no experience. I've been applying to jobs and internships all over the country (US), and I've sent out quite a few cold emails. I've also applied to underwriter and data analytics positions. I think I would do well in an interview, but I can't seem to get that far. I also have been using this time to sharpen my technical skills. 

Should I go ahead and apply for grad school? I'm considering either MBA or Statistics. I haven't really thought this through because I had assumed I would have a job a few months out of college. 

Sorry for the rant, I just didn't think I would be here after three exams.

So I have an appointment in the career center tomorrow to get my resume reviewed, and I just have a few quick questions so I can get my resume looking as polished as possible before getting it reviewed.

How do you guys feel about using a skills-based resume when applying to internships? In the past I've just used more traditional resumes where I listed my jobs sequentially starting with the most recent position. But for the past few years I've worked in education/non-profits so I feel that traditional resume format may not be the best for my current situation.

Would it be odd to include a section listing my accounting/business coursework? Or should I instead have a section where I talk more specifically about skills acquired in those courses? Or neither or both?

The woman who is helping me with my resume tomorrow doesn't have an accounting background so I kind of just wanted to get some different opinions from those of you who do.

I know recruiters spend about 6 seconds reviewing a resume so maybe I'm overthinking this. But I know I will feel so much more confident during the whole application process if I have a resume that really stands out!

Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Also- if anyone has any general resume questions they'd like me to ask the career center at my university I would be happy to ask them and get back to you!

Reading the stories here has opened my eyes tremendously, and enabled me to put my finger on what’s wrong with my family, especially with my mother. If she isn’t a Covert Narc, than she’s something similar enough to feel recognition here. In this post I want to ask for some advice, and therefore I’ll try to explain my current situation as good as possible. I will make another post when I’m ready for it to explain the abuse itself. Warning, I’m afraid it’s gonna be a long post ;).

I’m 27 years old (F), married, and chronically ill. I’m fully bedridden and very sensitive to light, so I lay in a dark room. I have been ill since I was a teen when I started having health problems (I will at a later time explain more about this period, or this will be too long). I met my now husband when I was 19, and we married when I was 20 (yes, that’s young, haha. But he’s the best thing that has happened to me in my entire life). I spent our honeymoon in a wheelchair, for the first time. From there on my health slowly got worse. I had to quit my studies, became fully wheelchair bound, had to spend more and more time in bed, untill I became bedridden. By this time, my Nmother started to come by regularly to help out, because I wasn’t able to take care of myself or my house. She was so sweet and helpful, that I thought the past was in the past, and I could forge a new bond with her. What also didn’t help, is that at that time I had almost no childhood memories, only the memory of how I felt, so I  thought it wasn’t as bad as my gut tried to tell me.

My husband and I reached a tough spot in our lives. We had a few traumatic experiences outside of family shit, and he was not able to both take care of me and finishing his college degree. We decided together with my parents it would be a good idea if I would move in back with my parents, give my husband room to work for his internship and then write his thesis. He would try to find an apartment and when I would be a bit better, we would move in together again. He would in the meantime come around 2 nights a week. At least, that was the plan. Btw, getting better felt realistic because I was diagnosed with untreated neuro-Lyme and co-infections, so I though that I would get better after the  long treatment (untreated Lyme is different than if you catch in in an early stage, for those who think why the treatment would be so long). 

Anyway, I got worse. To shortly describe it, 1 to 2 years ago, the room was so dark you couldn’t see a hand before your eyes, had many long term meds like morphine, sleeping meds, etc., an oxygen tube and a situation that was unbearable. I couldn’t go on social media, listen to music, anything. I had to be taken care of to 6 in the morning, and my husband had to work the next day. He did so much caretaking that he coudn’t finish his studies anyway, partly because I was so sick, but mostly because of my Nmom who of a sudden couldn’t take care of me enough for my husband to be free enough. I had to beg for over six months just to get a nurse to help out. And the abuse started again. And I had nowhere to go, I couldn’t walk away, and when I asked her to leave my room, she wouldn’t most of the time. And it was all me, because there would be a certain point where I snapped, and given that I had neuro lyme, I was the one with the toxic bacteria in my head, so it was me. Sigh.

We finally managed to find a suitable home for us 6 kilometres away from my parents. It’s almost a year ago since I moved back with my husband. 3 weeks later he kicked my Nmum out of the house. The final breaking point was that she got mad on me for having my period, and there where no tampons yet, which she had to get from the supermarket, and she didn’t want to do that. 
I slowly got a bit better, but not much. Then last summer I was in the hospital for a week or so, and there was a psychiatrist who asked me if I had been abused as a child. I’ve always said ‘no’ to that question, but now  I realised that it was bullshit. I have been abused. But I will write about that later, it’s already such a long post, sorry!

I really improved over the last year, especially the last six months. It is lighter, I can go on my mobile and tablet with good screenfilter apps to make it dark, i can listen to music, audiobooks, and even watch series since a little while (be it darker, but hey :)). I have worked my ass off with fysical therapy, and I’m morphine free since a couple of weeks. I’m still bedridden, but I’m improving for the first time in my life.One positive thing of living with my parents again: they have shown their true faces to my husband so he understands me really well.

With the improvement however, also comes the room to think, and remember, triggered by living with my parents again for 2,5 years. And it’s just soooo much. I’ve also recently let go of my faith for several reasons, and I have started hypnotherapy  at home, which now mainly focusses on self esteem issues, but we’re gonna go down memory lane soon. 

Ok, now where I need help with. I want a psychologist, but it’s difficult to find one that will do housevisits, let alone one specialised in child abuse, let alone in Narc related abuse. What kind of tips would you have to heal from this all? Also, I want to write a letter to my parents that i want NC. I’m VLC now, but I feel I need to break free. I want to be brave, but I’m chicken shit. I don’t know how to go about it. What to tell, what not to tell.
Sorry for this enormous post. It’s much to take in. And I feel like I haven't really told much yet, haha.

My personal back story: I got ""monkey branched"" by my ex-girlfriend 1 month ago because made rookie mistakes down the road in my relationship.

A little bit about me, I am 26 years old, new to redpill, fairly fit, lives in midtown Manhattan (NYC) and makes over 100k. 10 months ago I met this latina girl (24 years) who is in line to get a Fashion degree. That being said, she seemed to have some good qualities as she lived with her family in jersey, while also maintaining an impeccable body with her workout regime.

We went on a few dates, fucked after a month and she ended up telling me that I was the best thing she ever had (she said she had been with only 2 other boyfriends and confessed that she is on pills because her ex's cheated on her and first one physically abused her coz he thought she was cheating on him. She also mentioned that she got kicked out of her home due to first ex for over a year (major red flag) but my beta ass gave her a pass. Quickly I saw that she was clingy and we went exclusive. I kept my frame from day 1 so she was always chasing me in the relationship. She cooked and cleaned for me. Also she was always available to have sex anytime. She said she love me and I told her I need my time. I said the 'love' word back after 2 months. 

I kept doing my thing on the side by going out on weekends and meeting up with my plates on the side. She was very jealous and insecure that I had a lot of friends who are girls in the city(she found on social media: Snapchat and instagram) and used to complain about it but I used dread game to my advantage. However, things started to change 6 months after we went exclusive. I went to Miami to meet up with a plate during Halloween and she told me that she is going out with her girl and her boyfriend but I found out that she was put on with a dude that night by her friend through her Snapchat. I got busy next month because I had to travel a lot for work but she always hit me up on the phone and didn't give me any room for doubt. She eventually started hanging out with her girls so often and she used to come to my apartment and leave to party with her girls right after first round of sex. I started to realize the change (typical monkey branching behavior pattern: less sex and less availability to meet up directly but always available on the phone). So I kept it real with her and told her if you go out with your girls then you gotta come back to my apt coz I live in the city and don't sleep over at their spot. She agreed and slept over at my spot after.

I took her out for New Years and she went to the bathroom with my buddy'a girl and didn't return for 20 mins so I went to check up and found out that both of them were flirting with couple of dudes at the bar (red flag #2) and I went and punched the dude and called her a whore. She used up her fake tears and tried to make it up with a head and sex.

I had a one month vacation planned for the next month to dubai, SE Asia and turkey so I went and meet up with her family because she had been pushing me to do so from 4th month of relationship. She was really hooked when I left the country but after I got back things changed drastically. She started to pick fights with me for no reason but still maintained my frame. I got back in the city but she was not excited to make an effort to come and see me at all and she texted me on a Saturday night saying 'I'm going out with my girls in the city' (4 blocks from my apartment) I don't reply back so she texted back again after 30 mins 'girls from my internship' I started to smell cheating so next morning I looked up tagged phonies on her instagram and i see her with a dude (same dude from Halloween sitting very close to her) and his friends with their girlfriends. I asked her about him on the phone and she said 'you need to stop nagging coz I'm trying to make this work' I was like wtf. She sounded like a totally different person. I said ' don't try me coz I'm not like one of your ex's'

Next day she came over to my apartment and I said I wanna break up. She asked me if it's possible to make it work and I replied only if you confess (my frame changed and beta ass mistake). She admitted that she was seeing that dude on the side for past couple of months but she only went out with him only couple of times and didn't fuck him and only kissed him when I was outta the country. She said he lived near her home in jersey and he is a college drop out and work as a real estate agent. I said you ain't the only one and showed a picture of a 9 hottie kissing me and She asked me did you fuck her and I said I'm not gonna tell you. 

After my beta ass asked her to pick either me or him. She said she choose me then I asked her to call him and tell him that you got a boyfriend and she flipped the script right there and said i choose myself. I asked her to get the fuck out of my apartment and threw away her stuff. She tried to have sex with me and we ended up having sex twice and she asked again we could make this work but I replied no and kicked her out and blocked her number. She tried to hit me up on social media that night so I blocked her on social media as well. I went out with buddies that night and tried to game girls but being played by an insecure chick affected my game. Next day scarcity mentality took over and called her in the afternoon instead of NC (biggest mistake) and she was like 'I miss you'. We started talking again and she was like 'I can't wait to see you on Friday and have sex with you'. I played along and kept my frame. Next day she asked me if I f'd that 9.5 girl or not and I said I was about to but I didn't. I said i went out with her right after I saw her instagram picture with that dude. 

She started acting cold after I confirmed that i didn't f her and she bought the full beta out of me. The entire dynamic changed because I started chasing her ass by asking her what's wrong. She told me that she never felt like she was in a relationship with me because I went out with my friends a lot in the city and lived a single lifestyle and she is sure that I cheated on her a lot. Also she said I didnt make any long term plans with her wtf. She said if you want this to work then you gotta come down and confess about my past cheating. I made another big mistake by taking advice from another girl and she told me to confess. I went to jersey and confessed about going on dates and but I lied and I said I didn't have sex with anybody while i was in a relationship. She started bitching and I ruined everything when I asked her to give me another shot ( I still can't believe I acted like a chump). I later realized that she was looking for an opportunity to blame the breakup on me and she was already fucking him. She asked me what I'm doing on Valentine's Day and I said I have a date. She said I thought you were gonna invite me and you don't care and shit. I changed my plans for Valentine's Day and called her that day but she didn't answer and called me back later and said 'I just woke up and I'm depressed coz of school'. I said okay. She also asked me to unblock her on social media. I unblocked her but didn't add her back. I called her couple of days later and asked if she is seeing anybody and she is like I'm really depressed coz of school and She doesn't even go out to meet her friends. 5 days later I realized that she blocked me on social media and that's why she asked me to unblock her so she could block me. So I looked up her profile on my buddy's phone and I found out that she posed a picture on Valentine's Day all dressed up ready to wine and dine from somebody's bedroom ( not her room). It literally crushed me and I called her and went Nuke. I said 'F U whore and no wonder why you are depressed and your ex beat you up' I know it is not a sigh of strength but I had to do it. I also sent her a photo of the hottie (9/10) and said I'm gonna go smash her now and she blocked me. I blocked her back. 

I know my story is a beta ass story but I'm posting this because I'm new to redpill and I swallowed the pill right after I went nuke. I have been reading a lot about your posts and I wanna learn from my past mistakes and tryna write down lesson learned.

5wrapw,5,2017-02-28,[Seeking] Web/software development internship or junior position,Bioe,atljobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/atljobs/comments/5wrapw/seeking_websoftware_development_internship_or/,"Greetings,

If you're looking for a hard worker who's able to work at a fast pace and learn quickly, maybe we could help each other out.

I could provide a source of cheap labor ( minimum wage or lower depending on how much I would be involved in the development process ) and can probably grow into developer in record time for you without the high salary. Considering there's tax credits from hiring interns, It probably wont cost you anything to hire me.

In return I would like to get experience in software / web development. I would like to be involved with programming as much as possible and learn as much as possible. I don't need to be babysit, I would just like to be involved in dev projects where I am given a direction by a mentor but given enough room to grow into the field. 

The reason I am doing this is because I would like to head into the IT field and I don't have bootcamp/CS major, and I'm only self taught on basic web development technologies.

I'm familiar with:

* HTML5/CSS3/bootstrap

* Javascript/Jquery

* some Node/Express

* Basic agile workflow

and I'm studying up on:

* RESTful APIs

5wrghk,3,2017-02-28,How do firms handle interns wanting to move?,scorodites,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5wrghk/how_do_firms_handle_interns_wanting_to_move/,"So I've always wanted to move when I graduated (for personal reasons). And I kinda feel like if I don't move after I graduate, I'll get sucked into work and I'll wind up not moving. Now that I'm finally getting SLPs, maybe I'll finally get an internship (I'm only a junior, planning to get my masters, so there's still time).
However, I've heard that you should intern in the location you want to work full time. So if I get an internship, I won't be aiming for a local one. I know a couple people who've interned in other states, but it seems rare. And I know when the firm's recruit, they want the local students for the local offices. 

So if there's any interns who didn't do their internship locally, or did their internships locally but wound up accepting their job in a location that's not local:
How did you bring up the subject of moving away? 
Did you mention it in your initial interviews, or after you got the position?

Is there anyone who tried to intern in a different state and was told the company wouldn't let them?

(Btw I'm kinda hoping for big 4 advisory or audit, if that changes anything)"
