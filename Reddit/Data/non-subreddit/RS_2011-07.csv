idvow,4,2011-06-30,How do I get out of this without cheating or hating myself afterwards?,dumb_nerd,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/idvow/how_do_i_get_out_of_this_without_cheating_or/,"I dated Laura for 1 month (and went all the way with her) until she moved away for a 5 month internship she had already signed up for before we met. Since there was no reason not to, we kept it going over the phone. 3 months later (May), she came back and we had awesome sex for a solid week. Then she began a second internship across the country which will be ending in September. We still talk on the phone almost every night, but I really, really miss the physical contact. I'm not in love, and not sure if I ever will be, but I am very fond of her. It's possible I'll never fall in love with her, but I haven't spent enough time with her to even know.

Ever since I entered this relationship, that phenomenon has started to occur where women are suddenly attracted to me more than usual. On Saturday, a girl that I've been hanging out with for a while as a friend will be coming over, and I'm starting to think she is going to want to have sex with me. I'm really tempted here, because this never happens to me. I'm 29 and I've only had sex with one girl before--the one who I'm in a relationship with right now. So there's the novelty factor and the fact that I am almost certainly not getting any until September.

What are my obligations here? The least complicated thing to do is to turn this second girl away, but that's easier said than done. It would be a really easy decision if I knew if I had a future with Laura, but I still can't tell based on my little time with her. She does have a lovely personality and our phone conversations are quite enjoyable.

Other relevant info: Laura is not happy where she is and I feel bad for her because she needs my support. Also, the other girl is open-minded and might be open to a summer fling. Also, I don't have a lot of friends in town that I relate to and I don't want to lose the second girl's friendship.

**tl;dr**: I've only been in the same town as my girlfriend ~4 weeks out of the 32 weeks I've known her and now an attractive girl might throw herself at me and I need to know what I'm doing before it happens.

**update**: I hate it when people don't provide closure in these threads after strangers have taken the time to provide advice, so here's what happened: I chickened out of talking about this with my LD girlfriend because I still haven't sorted out how I really feel about her. 

I did go ahead and hang out with the other girl, planning to go in and permanently friend-zone myself. This ended up being much easier than I thought. We started talking and it turns out she's had a rougher week than I thought. She broke up with her boyfriend, then had a health scare. IMO she mostly needed someone to talk to, which is what I wanted too.

Thanks for the replies! I managed to get through this without cheating and without hating myself."

myself 20(m); girlfriend: 20 (virgin when I met her, was her only for a year and a half), friend 20(f)

When I graduated from HS, I went off to college not knowing what I wanted to do, or study, or whatever.  My #1 motivator for leaving home to go to college was just that: to leave home.  I hated where I was from, my home life was a wreck (shouting matches with parents day after day after day), and I felt the need to start a completely new life, and I did.  I went off to university and started a relationship with a girl on my floor who was from another state. Living on the same floor, we pretty much lived together, and that summer she had an internship near where I'm from, so we continued seeing each other, and again this past semester at university.  However, over thanksgiving break last semester, I sort of snapped and realized I was ""in school"" for all of the wrong reasons. I didn't have an end goal, the program I was about to transfer into was of no interest to me and I could see no value in having  degree in it, and I couldn't justify continuing to spend money at the school without a solid plan, so I made the decision to take a leave from the university and go home and take classes at community college until I was ready to go back with a better plan, transfer to another school, or whatever.  I wanted to stay together with my girlfriend, and I planned multiple trips up to our university  during the next semester (a few states away) to be with her, before I even knew if I was going back.  When I got home though, I realized that keeping up a long distance relationship when I wasn't sure if I was going back to the school, and with her going abroad next semester, was going to be a lot of work, anguish about unknowns regarding if we would see each other again, and wasn't necessarily guaranteed to work. Plus, she is a SMOKING sorority girl who binge drinks (something we've had issues with) on the weekends and I would have had to keep up with ""who'd you go out with etc etc did any of the frat guys try to take you home"" (her ""big"" sorority sister once asked her ""would you cheat on your boyfriend? we're so young"").  The next time I went up to see her, I told her even though I loved her, I didn't know what I was doing, and that we were too young to be forcing ourselves to keep it up while we were in school, and might not ever see each other again if I changed programs or didn't come back.  It was absolutely the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.  We had planned to stay in a hotel that night, but she asked me to leave, so I went and stayed with a close female friend who also goes to this univeristy that I'd known about the same amount of time as my girlfriend. 

That friend and I had sex. I told her I had broken up with my girlfriend and would be going home and possibly not coming back, and she had always had an interest in me apparently, and it happened. The next morning I saw my ex at a coffee shop to talk, then went home.  Over the next few weeks, the emotionally draining and newly NOT independent living conditions I was living in at home after being away on my own for a year and a half made me change and focus my schooling priorities.  My goals became becoming completely financially independent from my parents ASAP after graduating, and gain not only a highly employable degree with my education, but a SKILL that I can market without the degree, and will continue to hone with jobs I take, and will allow me my pick of locations for jobs.  I changed my classes at community college to fit my new major, registered for the fall at the university, and even signed a lease on a group house when I was 100% sure that I would be going back. 

Here I was, having just LEFT this place, and DUMPED someone I was living with and had a perfect committed emotional and sexual connection with for a year and a half, and the situation was changing all over again. I couldn't stop texting/talking to my ex during this time. Even though we were ""broken up"", our texting routine after a year and a half was much the same.  I kept talking and skyping to the friend who I'd slept with, who I had already been close with (hanging out between classes and such and going to a lot of the same shows), and we got even closer.  We talked about next year and how awesome it would be to have a relationship and be able to see each other a lot since I'd be living near her.  I visited her a few times (couldn't keep up a LDR with a year and half ex but was keeping one up with someone I'd just started with?), and I must say they were some of the best days of my life so far, though tough because my ex's apartment is across the street from hers.  I know it seems like this girl was a rebound, but I honestly felt a deeper connection with her than I'd ever felt with anyone in my life.  We got along so well, probably because we had been friends for so long, and literally had everything in common with each.  Then, the last time I visited her, we were out at different parties and my ex called me at 2 AM.  I don't know how to explain what happened in my head. I realized I might not ever see her again if I didn't and let her go abroad. I knew she was moving on but I still had so many lingering feelings for her. Every beautiful memory from the year and a half we spent together came into my mind and I had to see her.  I did, we spent the night together like old times, and the next morning she flew home to her home state for the summer, where she is staying until she goes abroad. When I showed up at the the house of the girl I had been visiting later in the morning, she wanted to know where I was and why I didn't come back to her place the night before.  I told her very straightforwardly what had happened, and that I had seen my ex with no prior planning.  She didn't freak out at me, but she was obviously upset, and when I went home she broke it off.  I'm devastated by my actions.  I gave into emotions that were obviously not gone for my ex, and for what? A hedonistic fuck. But of course it wasn't just a fuck, she and I had a year and a half of amazing history that we both didn't want to see end when it did.

To make all of this even more complicated, after I broke up with my ex, she was saying she didn't want to know about other people, so I didn't tell her about this girl, but she heard that we had slept together through the grapevine at our university (how, I don't know), and tells me I was lying to her by not telling her.  I'm also aware that she met and slept with a guy a week after meeting him up at school, and again back home since she booty called me, and even though it shouldn't bother me ""since I broke up with her"" as people have been telling me, it tears me apart and makes me so jealous.


reddit, I've fucked everything up. How can I stop beating myself up over all of this?  I can't stop thinking, what if I had just gone into school knowing what I was going to study and not left, would I have broken up with her? What if I hadn't left? What am I going to do when I get back to school in the fall?  Will I ever have a relationship as fulfilling as those two were? What are the rules for all of this when things can change so fast? Why did I get in these relationships in the first place?"
ifrv0,6,2011-07-03,"Advice with ""conflicted"" girl",boomgoesthethrowaway,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ifrv0/advice_with_conflicted_girl/,"So this girl in my internship that I've been talking to/inviting to parties and group events invited me to get lunch on friday. It went well and she had a whitewater rafting trip planned for Saturday which she invited my roommate and I to. My roommate couldn't make it, so I ended up going with her, a girl friend of hers, and two other guys. I did my best to talk to her friend as much as possible to generate more interest, but also did my share of flirting with her, of which she seemed receptive.
Now after we got back, the other kids got dropped off and I had to go back to her house and drop off the money she fronted as well as pick up my mp3 pkayer I left in her car. She let me into the house and we sat/chilled and talked in total for around 1.5-2 hours. During this time I had my arm around her and eventually made a move for a kiss. At this point she didn't receive the kiss and began to tell me she was conflicted. She had a long term relationship (3+ years) that she just got out of but the kids been telling her he wants to stay together, and then telling her he doesn't, basically ****ing with her head. Also, hes in Europe for the time being. She seemed visibly conflicted and suggested that she would sleep on it, partially because it was getting late and she didn't want to do anything spontaneously. I didn't want to force anything on her, so I kind of continued with the light touching/kino but didn't end up getting to kiss her. My question is, what would you guys do at this point? The girl is pretty gorgeous it would be a shame to let this slip through."
ifo40,6,2011-07-03,Major (IMO) issues in my relationship,numbheart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ifo40/major_imo_issues_in_my_relationship/,"M 19 here, SO's F 18.

Okay, so after sleeping over it for another night, I really feel the need to vent all the shit that's been going on over the course of our one-year relationship and get some insight from you guys whether I'm just too harsh on her, my mind is fucked up or the situation is actually *that* bad. Ask away if you want more detail, for now Imma give you guys a quick summary of our relationship so far and the major (as the title suggests) issues I have with her behavior towards me and others.

Right now I'm at the point where I truly feel numbed by our relationship. It's long-distance (450km) and it's been really hard to deal with so far. We've had a lot of great moments, the time we spend together's always wonderful. We have had not a single argument when we were together. Deep inside I do believe that she's ""the one"", despite all the shit that's going on, but I also think that I most likely can't continue like this.. alright, so here's the issues:

1) She's not interested in the stuff I do at all, but expects me to go all apeshit about the things she does, which, quite honestly, don't go far beyond meeting friends and dancing. No real other hobbys, no passion for anything.. Well, the things I do aren't that interesting to most people (programming, wood-working, handling my own small business, web design, design in general, firefighting, etc.), but whatever I tell her about it (she often asks me what I did today when we're on the phone), she just goes ""meh... k..."". Which leads me to the next point:

2) There's practically nothing we can connect through. I'm a fast-food guy, she's believing to be eating healthily. I love to daydream, she's all rational. I'm always optimistic, she usually only sees the bad side of people. I'm accepting all that, really, and despite me being completely different from her, I engage in conversation about it, I try to grasp why she does things the way she does them, I ask questions, etc.
All I get from her is ""meh... I don't like that..."" or ""meh... that's nothing for me...""

3) She think's I'm the child while I think she's the one who needs to grow up. If I ever ask her why she thinks that, she says ""I got this feeling.. Iunno really"". She doesn't ask me why I think she needs to grow up. Here's a couple examples: She doesn't think about things before she does them. She's easily fascinated by things, which is really well and nice, until it gets to the point where it severly intervenes with our relationship.
For example, due to her parents (which I don't really believe), we hadn't seen each other for 6 months.. so finally we get the chance to reunite. I pack my stuff, preparing myself for a very nice week. Upon my arrival on Friday, she tells me she already told her driving instructor (?!?!) she wanted to meet him on Tuesday, so I can't stay a whole week.. nice, having not seen her for 6 months, I get dumped early for a driving instructor she's known for barely a month and who turns out to be a shitfaced asshole anyway (more on that later).
Another example: We usually travel by train when seeing each other. Its also usual that there's no way of knowing when we'll see each other again until half a week before that day because she ""doesn't know"".. I mean, wtf? If I was her, I would've already marked the next couple meetings in my calendar so that nothing intervenes with them. Period. No chance with her.. This also really fucks me up because I can never be sure when I'm gonna see her again.
Nevertheless, she expects me to be perfect. She once told me she wanted to see me sometime in September cause her parents were away. Now I got an offer from a very nice company to do an internship until including exactly that date, which she went berserk about. I'm always telling her ""Hey, I have time here and there and on that date and pretty much always"". She's like ""Oh, sounds nice. I'll talk to my parents"". Four to five days later (cause she's ""scared of talking to her parents"") she tells me it's a no-go cause they told her she needs to stay at home or I can't come cause she needs to learn, go to driving school or any other bullshit excuse. Every single fucking time... and honestly, I don't believe her anymore. Now when I would go apeshit about that, she'd always be like ""You're not supporting me! You've no clue about what I'm going through here!!"" etc. fuck that..

4) Next thing.. don't wanna bore you too much. She's very, very gullible and reckless when it comes to anything not regarding myself our our relationship. There's been two occasions (in only one year, remember) where this has shown a lot:
One, she's had a very good friend for a long time. One day, she texts me while I'm on a family dinner, she's having a sleepover at his house. They're sleeping in the same bed.. He always tells her how I'm not good enough for her.. WTF? First thing that comes to my mind: ""The guy loves her"". Nice. I swallow the huge lump and tell her about my thoughts the next day. She's all like ""No way, we've been friends forever, that can't be! He's told me back in the day, but I told him I don't want a relationship with him, we're just friends blabla"". Nice, so he's been in love with her, rejected and they stayed friends.. Nothing unusual, since I have some friends with that background as well. Intuition proven wrong? Guess not - The day after she tells me he told her he still was madly in love with her and that she should leave me. I'm like yea, nice.. told you so?! She doesn't put any trust in my word when I'm telling her about these kinds of feelings. None at all. She just goes one, being gullible as ever. Well, at least she didn't see him again, though I'm not sure if they're still texting or talking behind my back.. I can only believe what she told me.

And here's the absolute bummer:
Ever since she met her driving teacher, she's been totally nuts about him. Driving here, driving there, going out to dinner, eating ice cream, going shopping, staying at his place, playing with his children, all the while totally neglecting me.. in every single fucking way..
well, I'm 450km away, so I can't do shit about it.
I always found his behavior really suspicious. Then came the day she told me ""duude, we've been driving around for like the whole day while I only paid for one hour!!!!!! :D :D"" and expects me to find that all nice and well... well, I didn't. I finally told her ""Girl, there's something wrong with that guy. They're not allowed to just take the car and drive. They need to keep a protocol. They can't just give you free hours all the time.. that guy's seriously wrong. and honestly, I think he's got a crush on you..."" Well, that's when she went berserk again. ""YOu don't give a shit about me being able to enjoy myself one! Why can't you be happy for me for once! This is so nice of him and you're ruining it"".. well, she got mad, I apologized and told her that maybe he's really not the guy I was expecting him to be.. especially since he's already around 60 (they should probably revoke his license at some point.. just sayin').

Again, things go quite well, she's happy, I'm not too happy, her driving teacher gifts her a total of 53 free hours... (WTF?!??!)
Until she's got her driving license. Well, nice, at least that guy's out of our lives now. WRONG! She likes him so much she's meeting up with him AGAIN! He's again taking the driving school's car, lets her drive in it, they spend the whole day together (that's the time when I couldn't stay the whole week because she didn't think twice before saying yes to meeting up with the moron). Nice.. then she tells me the same evening they walked in the park... .... 
And yea.. .. he somehow told her there were more feeling for her than just friendship. At that moment I quit real life entirely. I just sad there, tears somehow flowing down my cheeks, listening to her telling me in all seriousness the friggin creepy things I always believed about that guy she always told me were soooo untrue finally becoming reality.....
The guy is a fucking pedophile. Every single time she went out with him I could've lost her.... ... Every fucking single time..
I hated her for her stupidity and ignorance. A lot. Especially since after I asked her about what she was gonna do about him she said ""Idk"". Nice one. Really. Well, during the last couple weeks I learned from her that they were still texting and emailing each other (note: I haven't received an email from her in over three months now), but yea, she *promised* me she was not gonna see him again... I mean, WTF?!?!?!

5) Next one... I'm getting quite sad right now, writing all this shit off my heart.. Like I said, when it comes to other people, she can meet up at short notice, she can text them, write them long emails, etc. When it comes to me, the apparently (like she said) most important person in her life, she can't do shit.
Our communication's crippled to a minimum. Two text messages (max.) a day, one good morning, one good night. No clue about what each other did that day really.
Emails, like I said, haven't happened since around three months now. It was different before. She was writing me mails almost daily, but its gotten to a point where I don't really expect anything anymore..
We're on the phone usually twice a week. After about an hour of talking, she usually falls asleep. I can't blame her for it, because she's not talking directly to me, but I wonder why she can stay up all night talking to male and female friends on the phone, but not to me..

6) Relating to this, here's what bothers me the most: I seem to think that as soon as I'm not with her, I'm forgotten. entirely. No mails, she usually ""forgets"" to send me a message in the morning even if she said ""yea, *promise"" I'll send you one"" the evening before, phone calls get cancelled cause she wants to go out with friends.. nice one, girl.. really..
I already told her a thousand times calmly how I feel about that. When I tell her calmly, she doesn't believe me. I tell her that my heart physically hurts by now.. it feels like I'm having a stroke every single minute of every single day.. no chance, she doesn't believe me at all. Says ""I Still love you, you should know that"".. yea, but saying ""I love you"" isn't enough. It's about DOING things that make me see she's telling the truth.. Ignoring me, not believing me, going out with pedophiles are NOT things she should do to prove that..
I've yelled at her recently (Wednesday last week). I told her about how much all that shit is affecting me.. she seemed to believe me, said she ""had no clue so far"".. yea, thanks for listening to me and complaining I don't listen so often..
Thursday and Friday, she managed to send me a message in the morning. Yesterday, no sign of life. Today, no sign of life. Yesterday evening I got a short message telling me goodnight.. yea, awesome.. I asked you about how your day was, what you did earlier, how you feel and I get a ""goodnight, hope you're fine"".. Great..


Okay, that's it. I finally gave in today and told her there's no need to text me in the morning anymore, cause honestly I told her once, twice and a thousand times how much it hurts when she makes promises she doesn't keep and I don't want that anymore. It's okay and I love you still, but if you don't want to send me a message in the morning (which you didn't tell me anyway, and I asked about it.. a lot), don't do it. Its just sad that it works with every of your friends, but not for me.. Seriously, she even says her driving teacher goodnight -.- WTF...

I have yet to receive a response. Idk if she's feeling well, Idk if she's angry because of what I wrote in the most polite manner I know exists to tell someone something like that, idk anything.

I'm not sure what to do right now.. guess I'll have a talk with her tonight, she'll be pissed at me cause I don't understand her situation, she'll make no effort to understand mine, but says she ""gets it"", she'll say ""I'll change, promise"" and that'll be another one kept for two days and then forgotten about..

Honestly, I'm sick of it, really..

So, reddit, I'd appreciate any advice. Am I wrong to believe she doesn't give a crap about me, despite telling me she loves me (which I believe..). Am I wrong to feel so fucked up, so betrayed and so friggin insecure about the whole thing?

Please, do tell me!


**TL;DR**
GF of almost a year treats me like shit (not cheating though), not sure if I should continue the relationship cause in all honesty - I do love her."
ihl3y,8,2011-07-05,Living two different lives...somewhat literally.,sadinlove,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ihl3y/living_two_different_livessomewhat_literally/,"Longtime Redditor here, using a throwaway for my first post to r/depression.

I'm crying uncontrollably in my boyfriend's living room, he's asleep, and that's probably for the best. (24F and 28M, together ~5 months)

Here is the back story: Over a year ago, I got out of a very long-term relationship that completely fucked with my head. My ex was a wonderful person, but he had psychological issues that go even deeper than my own, and certainly exacerbated mine. I was in and out of therapy throughout our entire relationship, during which we were long-distance for 2 years and lived together for another two.

After a year of living it up being single and feeling like perhaps my problems were now mostly gone with my ex out of the picture (though still suffering occasional bouts of anxiety), I find myself in a loving relationship with a guy who makes me much, much happier. Problem is, it's another long distance scenario. He works 7 nights a week, and sleeps most of the day. When I come to visit him, he goes to tremendous lengths to spend time with me, often going without sleep for way too long. He is warm, kind, takes really good care of me and always notices if I'm feeling down. He does not know about my history of depression. I feel too guilty to tell him. I come from a fair amount of money, and can theoretically afford to focus on ""building a career"" (taking internships, volunteering, freelancing in areas of interest) versus just working to pay the rent. (EDIT: I have a part-time job and do some other projects on the side, so I'm not literally just at home doing nothing all the time.) He is barely getting by.

Anyway, I live this double life where half the time I'm at home (my parents' house), theoretically applying for jobs, but mostly just getting completely overwhelmed and falling into a not-quite-suicidal rut, and the other half the time, I'm with him, living in a fantasy world where I get to be in love and not think about how totally insane I feel. When I'm home, I look forward to the time I get to spend with him, and that (mostly) gets me through the perpetual feelings of worthlessness and inability to take action and build myself a life. When I'm here, bliss.

Today, though, the two worlds collided. I came down for a visit not expecting to spend as much time here/with him as I did. (fyi, I take a bus and don't have my own transportation. He has a car and usually picks me up/drops me off at the bus) I thought I would see him Sunday and leave Sunday night or Monday morning, but instead spent all day together yesterday and had an amazing time. He completely exhausted himself in the process. He left for work last night around 10 pm, and got home this morning around 8:30. We spent about an hour together today (Tuesday) before he passed out for the day. He was supposed to wake up and start a second (!!!) job for the first time at 3 today, and I figured he'd drop me at the bus on the way, but that fell through, so I'm stuck at his house until probably at least 10 pm (it's about 6:45 now, so home stretch I guess?), or whenever he's able to drag himself out of bed for work, which starts at midnight. Then I have the option of either staying here some more, or spending 4+ hours on buses, only to arrive home at my empty apartment in the middle of the night (family is out of town). I have endless respect for how hard he works and how much he goes out of his way to make time for me, but I'm losing my shit being essentially alone in his house. I haven't had a real conversation with him or anyone else since yesterday evening. If I'm at my place, I at least have the option of going out when I want to, but I don't know that I'll have the motivation, and I'll just miss him and want to be back here. I know, completely nuts.

I'm just feeling like a total crazy. A little while ago, I cried briefly while lying next to him, he woke up and asked me what was wrong. I couldn't explain, and now he thinks it's because I'm ""bored"" because he can't wake up and pay attention to me. Boredom sucks, but it's not the boredom that's the problem, it's the falling apart into a not-quite-suicidal emotional mess because there is nothing to distract me from how worthless, pathetic and directionless I feel. I want to be here with him, and I want to build a life and a career at home (and maybe someday build a life with him but who knows). The former is more appealing, but I know the latter is more important to my long-term emotional health (and financial security, obviously). Both scare the hell out of me. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if I'm making sense.

Anyone have any kind of advice at all? Besides ""get back in therapy,"" which I already know I need to do?

As most of you do, I get depressed. It's usually a 3-6 month cycle with me. But lately, I haven't come out of it. It's not the.....'conventional' type either. I don't want to sleep all day, I'm not fatigued or restless, and I'm not chronically sad. I can carry on my daily activities and not appear depressed.

But lately I haven't been able to take pleasure in anything, I have next to no sex drive, and I procrastinate like hell. The procrastination has always been there to a certain extent, but now it's worse than ever.

Here is an example. I got fired from my job just over a year ago. It was a shitty sales in disguise job and my sales weren't good enough. I've been living off of unemployment since then, and am on my second extension. The second extension just started, but there was a chance I might not have gotten it because of changes in PA unemployment policies. However, instead of scrambling to find a job at the last minute like I normally would, I didn't even care. I just let it happen knowing I would be letting my roommates(best friend and boyfriend) down and fucking myself over in the process. 

Related things have happened over the past year. I completed a project for a possible internship with a set design firm, which would have been really good experience even though it was unpaid. They really likfe my work and wanted to see what else I could do. I started but didn't complete the second project, and this was after I had worked pretty damn hard for an entire weekend on the first. 

Another time, a friend of my boyfriend let me know that there was a visual merchandising opening at a store she applied to, and I had a pretty good shot at getting it considering my experience. I called the store and the job was still open, but I never followed up or applied.

I don't know why I'm sabotaging myself. I'm fucked if I stay on unemployment because it really isn't enough to live on(which is why sometimes I want to punch people who say the unemployed are taking advantage of the system and getting a free ride, but that is a whole other story). I need a real job, or at least something that puts me in a better position. Even an $8.50 an hour wal mart job is better than what I am doing now.

Lately I haven't even been able to bring myself to search for a job, crappy or not. I know(and have been told) I have the talent and the skills, I just never seem to follow through.

To make matters worse I just moved in with my boyfriend. That in itself isn't a bad thing, but there is one argument that just keeps coming up. I've been depressed for an abnormally long time for me. He asks what is wrong, and I tell him what's going through my head and that I can't seem to figure out why I'm holding myself back job-wise. Every time this comes up, I am met with a barrage of questions about why I've been passing up all these opportunities and what am I doing to make this better, and why haven't I been following up. The other night he basically gave up and just said that he doesn't think I even want to look for a job anymore because the same issue keeps coming up every time I talk about this. That hurt. That really fucking hurt. 

What he said led to me accusing him of not understanding and giving up on me. I try to explain to him that it's not that I don't want to, it's just fucking hard for me to even bring myself to do it right now and the reason I'm talking about it is because I'm trying to figure out why, if there is any reason at all. I hate saying this because it sounds like an excuses, and I'm big on not making excuses, no matter what the situation. We had the same argument last night.

We have some of the same issues personality wise. Insecurity, low self esteem...etc, but he isn't bipolar and although he gets depressed, it might only be for one night as opposed to months on end. I would never wish this on him and I'm glad he isn't, but there is a definite disconnect as a result.

I know he cares and he means well. We have a great relationship otherwise. He is very supportive. He just doesn't get it.

ihg9y,2,2011-07-05,"Oh no this again!  Canadian tech intern moving to the Bay, please help me make the most of it.",Waterwoo,bayarea,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/ihg9y/oh_no_this_again_canadian_tech_intern_moving_to/,"Hey guys - I know I know we have one of these threads every week.  But please if you could spare a few minutes of your wisdom, it would be greatly appreciated.  I skimmed through a bunch of previous 'moving to SF' threads so I'll try to mostly limit my questions to less generic questions.

First, bit about myself.  I'm a 23 year old male University of Waterloo student, got a software development internship at Facebook for the fall.  Canadian with Russian background.  Pretty easy going, drink socially, don't smoke pot but don't care if you do, as long as that's not ALL you do.  I have an awesome GF so 'where are the hot girls?' is not a primary concern. Hobbies include working out (gym and mild jogging), snowboarding(can I go to the mountains or is it too warm?), hiking, movies, and of course Reddit.  

So, some questions:

1) Anyone want to meet up?  I will probably be working a lot, but for my free time I know virtually nobody, and it would be great to make some friends.  Similar age preferred but not mandatory.

2) Living recommendations?  I was thinking Palo Alto for easy of commuting to work, but I hear it's insanely boring.  Is this true?  Keep in mind I'm coming from a sleepy Canadian town that's boring as hell.  Is Mountain View any better, or do I have to go to SF for any sort of fun?  When does public transit stop running, if I live in Palo Alto but go to SF on a Friday night to party?  Where are the sketchy areas to definitely avoid?

If anyone has a place they're trying to rent you can also PM me.  I'm leaning towards either studio/ 1 bedroom apartment to myself, or renting a room in a house.  However I definitely do NOT want to share a room, and will also probably have a few visitors coming by for a few days at a time, so that has to be okay.

3) What's fun?  Good eats?  For the record I like most food except Mexican and Indian, but prefer plain old American style or Asian food.

4) I'm considering buying a car while I'm there.  Anybody move a US registered car to Canada? Is it the same process as if you just buy a car for importation, or does owing it in the US first grant you any advantages?

5) What's the best grocery chain around there?

6)  Any other tips you can think of?

Thanks everyone.

ihf66,2,2011-07-05,I'm pretty sure I'm doing it all wrong.,[deleted],askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/ihf66/im_pretty_sure_im_doing_it_all_wrong/,"A friend just broke up with her long term boyfriend. We've got on tremendously since we met (about 6 months ago), and now I want to see if it's not too late to make a move (I've been into her for about 2 months).

It's fair to say I have one-itus, but yeah, I don't want to be fucking other girls *just yet*.

She broke up with her boyfriend the Friday before last. I invited her round for lunch that Sunday with my friend who had just come back from being away for a year (who she knew, but not quite as well as she knew me).  She couldn't manage that, and asked if I'd be interested in dinner with her the evening after. Unfortunately I was away for a week.

I invited her round that evening (Saturday), but she politely declined.

My friend who I'd originally invited for Sunday and who's going to be living with me next year was in the area and decided to come around for dinner that night. I told the girl and she'd just finished work and felt like a drink so came over with two bottles of wine.

She had a great time with us and stayed until 2AM drinking. She asked if she could live with me next year (since her original plan had been her boyfriend). I accepted. She asked who was living with me, and I told her, ""me, x, y, z.""  To which she responded, ""You had me at me...""

As she was leaving my flat she said she wanted to see me again after I got back from holiday, and she had to return some stuff she had of mine (I've made her cakes etc. in the past so she had some tins) so she wanted to come over the next evening after work.

She lives very close to me. I bumped into her the next evening as she was going out to a leaving meal her housemate was having with a load of friends. She was excited to see me and ran and hugged me. She said she was just going out to this meal, but she'd come over afterwards to drop my stuff off (it really wasn't important at all, but anyway...). Unfortunately this was at 10PM and I was leaving the following morning. When she realised this she said, ""Right, Friday evening when you get back or Saturday, I'll be over"".

Sure enough Friday morning I got a text asking me when I'd be back. I responded with that evening, but I couldn't guarantee coach times (7 hour coach trip), so I could be an hour or so late. She said she was going out to a party that night, and the following day she had work all day, but she'd be by before work. She came over with a bottle of port and my stuff, but only had 30 seconds and had to rush off to work.

I have really desperately been wanting to make a move on her, but I've realised that because we've just been friends, I haven't been doing all the stuff I should have been doing. I haven't displayed any sexual interest at all, or really been that open about having a sexual interest in *anyone*. I mean, there was the night I spent at her flat drunkenly looking for naked pictures of Nicki Minaj with her friend (they're both bisexual, and this was before I was interested in her), but apart from that, nothing, and she knows I've only had one girlfriend who I didn't have sex with (I was a Christian up until 2 years ago, and I'm an engineer...).

After her 30 second visit on Saturday, I haven't seen her until today. I've realised that because we're friends and I make 3 course meals for all my friends, it's quite ambiguous for her whether I'm coming on to her or what. I reckoned I kind of needed to subtly shift things so she was spending more time doing special things just with me that I wouldn't do with other friends. I didn't think just going in for a kiss would work unless she saw me in a potential boyfriend type paradigm. Also, I decided living with her when I like her would be depressing. I thought there was no way of telling her I didn't want to live with her without either being a wuss or just making a move and putting it on the table, but I only have the next couple of weeks to do that because I'm going away at the end of this month and after that we'll be looking for flats.

I decided to pop by her work today and see if she was around for drinks later. She wasn't actually working that day.

I wanted to see her anyway, and she had accidentally taken one of my cufflinks home the night she was over for drinks, so I asked if she had it. She did. I popped by her flat, but she was tired from being out at too many parties and was just going to bed. Ended up drinking tea and listening to her complaining about her lack of direction. I was tired too because I'd been out the night before. I mainly sat opposite her making sarcastic comments (she was mainly tired and I didn't feel she'd be that receptive to any advances, and I was a bit too tired to make good conversation as well).

She wanted a houseparty next week, and wanted to invite all my friends because hers had mostly gone home or to internships. Particularly mentioned one of my friends she wanted to see again who'd tried to pick her up the last time using seddit type tactics. She's only met him once and he has a massive problem with self-loathing and one-itus, so I'm not *hugely* threatened by him, but he's still much more competent than me (although he sees me as more attractive and more of a ladies man than him).

I feel like I'm digging myself really far into the friendzone. Sure, she's showing me loads of attention, but she does that to a lot of guys because she's at a science and technology university and she's lovely.  I know she feels a lot of affection for me, a lot more than most of her friends. She really tries to push our friendship, but I'm pretty sure that's what it is. I want her to be excited about me as a potential man. I'm happy with friendzone, she's great, I enjoy her more than pretty much any of my friends, but I don't want to be in the friendzone permanently before at least having a shot at pulling her. I don't feel like our friendship will be helped by unrequited love, but I feel like we could get over that if it's in our past.

I'm not a completely typical engineer. I do have quite a large number of friends and end up going out every other night. I'm introverted, but not shy if there's a conversation I'm interested in. I am quite gregarious around most friends, but can go very quiet if I'm depressed or nervous. And I am very nervous around girls when I am actually interested in them. I love this girl because she has a really positive attitude to sex, is hot but approachable, very feminine but in touch with her masculine side and I find it very easy to be with her.

**TL;DR** I am a virgin who is getting a lot of attention from a HB9. We've made friends very quickly. I want it to be something else because we get on fantastically, but she gets lots of attention from plenty of guys and I can't really compete on a seduction level, even though she loves my personality and having me as a friend. Our friendship isn't really deep yet.  We've only met up about average once every 3 weeks for the last 6 months (usually for a dinner party where I cook or drinks or something). So I don't feel like I've completely wrecked everything yet by cementing myself in a particular role. We have a pretty casual friendship, but we usually only meet at special times, so she hasn't got used to me being around or something."

The person that's teaching me all this stuff is helping me the best he can, but it's not enough. I need to do my own research and I ask you guys in Hardware if you can point me in a direction of a few things.

I need to understand a little more on how servers work in a physical sense. I know very little about how these huge switches work and why they need to be plugged into another part of the server. I.E. I know that from the outlet, you go to a rack, then the rack is plugged into the switch. I just want to understand why. 

I would also like to know if I can do some kind of at home networking by myself that will help me understand. Maybe a mock server type of program that I can be admin of and test things out?

I've also noticed that Google offers a service called Google Enterprise. Is there anything I should know about that? Is it useful?

If I'm asking the wrong types of questions, it's because I really don't know how else I can ask them. If more info is required in order to help me out, I'll be glad to answer best I can. Thanks."

iic2a,10,2011-07-06,My BF has been unemployed for 4 months and its wrecking havoc on our relationship,unemployedbf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/iic2a/my_bf_has_been_unemployed_for_4_months_and_its/,"Throwaway account. So here's my situation. I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and half. We're best friends (and were before we started dating), and normally have very few arguments. We're both 19. I live on my own, and he was living on his own until last October. My financial situation is tight, as I'm going to college and mainly paying for everything through student loans, working, and maintaining an internship. I work extremely hard to be able to have all of these opportunities and make them work (time wise) on a daily basis. 

As long as I've known him, my SO has been jumping around between jobs. When we first met, he worked at a Subway. About 1-2 months into out relationship, he got hired at a car dealership, where he worked until last October, which allowed him to move out of his parents. He was fired for insufficent sales after he complained that the dealership was forcing him to push unnecessary extras on customers, which made them simply get up and leave without buying. 

He then was unemployed for 2 months, did very little job searching. He had to move back home with his family. He was eventually rehired at Subway, where he worked until February. He quit because of an ongoing problem with a manager there, which upper management refused to discuss. 

Since then, he's worked for several weeks as a Pizza delivery driver, barely scraping by with enough money. Then his car's engine blew (it's totaled). Since then, he's spent a minimal amount of time searching for jobs. He maybe fills out 3 or 4 apps a week (lately, not even this many), and never calls or spends any serious time trying to get a job besides filling out an application.  Not to blame video games (I love them too) but he usually spends all day playing minecraft lately. 

He typically spends about 4-5 nights a week at my place, and usually is there all afternoon &amp; night on any given day. He basically almost lives with me. Currently, I work from home and am taking summer school classes, but he's very good about respecting my need to get work done. His family situation is not the best (his mom is extremely verbally abusive, and has been on several occasions to me as well) and he desperately needs to move out completely on his own. Moving in with me completely is not an option, as I live in a place that my parents own and they don’t want us living together. Also, it’s all rented out and there’s just not enough space for another person to live here. I feel like he’s very concerned about our relationship at this point, more than about himself and his future, and that’s partially what’s causing him to hang around my place all the time. 

 He's very intelligent and wants to go to school, but he can’t until he gets a good enough job to support himself on his own (due to family and financial situation). It's pretty hard for him to get out and job hunt due to his lack of a car, but I can't spend all my money on gas driving him around. He’ll do random side jobs every here and there for his parents and a friend’s company, and it’s enough that he contributes a little to my grocery bill. This situation has been causing almost daily fights for the last two months. I love him, but I’m sick of him sitting around and making very little effort to better himself and fix his situation. I’m stuck though, because a lot of what has happened is not his fault, he has just had very bad luck. I feel like I’m trying very hard to make something of myself, and though he wants to badly, he’s just not trying. 

Aside from the job situation, we get along excellently. This is the only problem we have. It’s causing enough problems though (like I said, fighting almost daily), that I’m beginning to think about ending the relationship.  Maybe just for a few months, until he gets back on his feet. What advice can you guys give me?

My plans have changed so I'm just checking back in again!

Short story: I'm a 25 year old Irish male PhD student, moving to Singapore for a 6 month internship in Fusionopolis in A*STAR. I'm arriving on the night of the 19th of July and I'll be looking to move into a room as soon as possible.

Longer story: I'm outgoing, play bass guitar, into computing/gaming, into sports and athletics, like rock/metal/punk music. I need a place with aircon and internet is desired. This is my first time in Asia and I'm looking for the full experience of Singapore!

I'd love to live with fellow redditors, if possible. The best kind of people are reddit people. So, if you have a room for rent or know of a room for rent in the Buena Visto/Queenstown/Holland Rd/Clementi area (anywhere it's convenient to get to Ayer Rajah Ave.) then please let me know!

il3hu,1,2011-07-09,Chi square question/biostatistics?,[deleted],statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/il3hu/chi_square_questionbiostatistics/,"Hello all, I would really appreciate it if someone could look over this for me and let me know if I am on the right track.

As some background, I am working a summer internship at a hospital and somehow found myself doing statistical analysis despite initially thinking I'd be doing something else. I've taken a couple of stats courses, but I am not really confident yet in what I am doing as I am an anthropology major.

Alright, onto the problem at hand. I work in a pathology lab, and I am trying to determine whether results for a cancer diagnostic test vary with respect to the amount of time it takes for the tested specimen to be put in formaldehyde after being excised from a patient. The current recommended standard is that this should occur within one hour.. 

So here's what I did..
I looked at pathology reports since 2008, recorded collection times and times into formaldehyde for all breast excisions then subtracted formaldehyde time from collection time to get the overall times I was looking for. I also recorded whether a particular test result was positive or negative for each case. 

I then split this data into two categories-results for under/equal to one hour and results for greater than one hour, and found the number of negative results and positive results for each category. Then I ran a Chi-square test for homogeneity of proportions between the two time categories and got a significant result (using Yates correction since it was a 2x2 table that was set up as shown below)). 
                       ≤60 minutes         &gt;60 Minutes
Test Negative        26                        49

Test Positive         130                      129

Essentially, is this an OK way to see if the two categories are different? I am not sure how else to go about it. If I am completely off base here please feel free to correct me, it would be very very much appreciated."

What to do?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ilq6a/came_across_a_lady_who_has_a_heart_of_gold_and_is/,"Hello everyone,

I am usually not the type that seek advice, but I just could not sleep well because of her taking over my mind and I am extremely frustrated that I have lost control over this in multiple ways.

Here are some of the puzzle pieces I am dealing with:

- The biggest problem is that she is constantly surrounded by Co workers (both Cockblockers and others) and I have no way to approach her privately and let her know about my feelings. Whether to be rejected or not comes secondary, and I would be relieved so much even if I get denied.

- She is an intern from overseas, being part of an university/company partnership program and will be gone in a month.

- I started to work at the company 3 months ago, and I was only able to notice her only recently because I was very busy learning about the work.

- Of all the people I have met, I am absolutely confident that she will be a fantastic spouse and a mother, and has a smile that will melt my heart. This is not a biased opinion, but she is better than 99% of the women out there, and it is probably the reason why I like her so much. And I know for a fact that I will not able to meet such type of women for a very long time. * We are in our twenties and her being few years younger.

- During a private conversation, she mentioned that she has a boyfriend once, but only brought it up because of the story she tried to tell (about traveling). I am not sure if this was intentional to cut the subtle signal I am sending (e.g. insisting that I will gladly take her to show around the great places she has not seen yet; she agreed that it sounds like a great idea)

Will I be a douchebag for spilling out what my feelings are and try to win her heart? Will this be very inappropriate since she will be gone in a month? Even if I win her heart, it will be a long distance relationship.

(Thank you for reading this redditors. I probably won't stir the shit up, but I what I really wanted to was to simply vent out.)

inn0y,2,2011-07-12,I am the type of person that needs to make sense of things. Help me figure out what happened.,bitterandbetter,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/inn0y/i_am_the_type_of_person_that_needs_to_make_sense/,"I (21f) was with my boyfriend (21m) for 3 years. I was his first girlfriend/romantic interest. He was not mine. We talked about marriage and children. I was convinced this was the real deal. I'd never been with someone that I saw myself with longterm. We worked very well together.

Throughout our relationship, I had some concerns about it being so serious without him fully knowing what he was committing to. I knew he loved me, genuinely, but I wanted him to experience other people before settling down with me. Things were very serious and, with his best interest in mind, I wanted to make sure that's what he wanted.

In April of this year, I suggested an open relationship. I did my research and was convinced that we were at a good time in our relationship to do it. We had very open lines of communication and I thought that only growth could come from it.

It progressed well enough. I would go out dancing with friends. He would go out drinking with his. I made out with a guy at a bar. As of the end of May, he had yet to do anything with anyone else. 

We were driving and he says ""So and so from work approached me at a bar last night and asked me to sleep with her."" A little taken aback, I said, ""Oh, wow, what did you say?"" He hesitates and says, ""I said no, I had work tomorrow."" We had made it very clear that this was only going to be a physical thing, not an emotional thing. I was upset because he works with this girl; she clearly wants more than a relationship. I asked if he was interested in her. He said no. I asked if she was pretty. He said she was ugly. I asked if he thought she wanted to be with him. He said no. She apologized the next day at work for acting like a ""dumb drunk slut."" Still, he seemed to be texting her pretty frequently. He asked me if he could hang out with her. She has no friends here and is lonely. I, trusting him, said I was uncomfortable with it, but I would of course let him go. I knew he wouldn't do anything with her.

2 days later, he breaks up with me while at work with her. His reasons didn't really make sense. He claims to have been upset for a few months but had decided not to tell me (around the time of the open relationship, probably). He says he just doesn't want a relationship anymore. He says they're too much work. He says he does want to be my best friend, though. I am heartbroken, but I agree to those terms. He was my best friend, and I still very much wanted him in my life, even if I didn't understand. I say, ""Are you sure you're not leaving me for someone else?"" He says yes.

We try to be friends. We go out to dinner one day, a week after the breakup, and he says, ""What if I did get into a relationship?"" I said ""Well, I'd be a bit offended, seeing as your reasons for breaking up were about relationships. You made it a point to say it wasn't us, it was relationships."" He agreed and let it go.

The next day I get an e-mail about how he's asking the girl from the bar on a date. 2 days later, they're in a relationship. I cut off all contact from him, as he was clearly lying to me. He says he understands, but he wants to make it clear that he does care about me, he just didn't want to hurt me. I find out much later on that he did have sex with her that night. I also found out that everyone at work knew something was going on between them, and it was very clear they were together. She is a summer intern that is only here until the end of July. She lives 3 hours away. Apparently, they're very much in love. He's already visited her parents.

It's been over a month. I am living my life the way I want to. I am happy again. I gave myself the time to grieve and mourn. I am ready to start dating again. I really just want to understand what happened here. Was it that this girl was the first to show interest in him and he jumped on it? Is she a rebound? Did I hurt him by suggesting an open relationship? I don't know what I did and, moving forward, I'd like to do some self-reflection to figure out what went wrong. I don't even think about the breakup much anymore but, at the end of the day, I just don't understand. He was my best friend and the man I saw myself marrying, and I lost it all."

iomiq,0,2011-07-13,I'm fat.  Let's not push around the bush.,KoSoVaR,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/iomiq/im_fat_lets_not_push_around_the_bush/,"I've always been a bigger kid.  I was between 250 and 270 in High School.  I wrestled all 4 years and really took notice my last year, played Football, and really enjoyed working out and keeping in shape.  Even though I wasn't the fittest of the bunch, I could surely hold my own.  Then, I lost it all.  Rather, gained it all. 

My heaviest was 335lb in the summer of 2009.  I travelled to Kosovo for the summer to visit my family and do a summer internship.  I had to walk up 8 flights of stairs everyday to get to where I was staying, and I walked every morning about 2 miles to get to work.  I sweat going to work and would find myself going to the datacenter room to cool down.  Sometimes I would leave even earlier to avoid the sun.  I enjoy looking and acting presentable, and I think a fat, disgusting, sweat man isn't really what people want to see or be confronted with.  Eventually I started playing ping pong on a daily basis with my coworkers, that was fun.  I was the only one who sweat (ok, they did, too, but not that much).  I was there for 2 months, and came back at 305lb.  I was happy, content, I felt good - I could go and run, play in the park with friends, throw a football around.  I changed my lifestyle for 2 months and really enjoyed it.

Then I came back.  I came back to the constant pressure of food around me, back to the beer, going out, being a lazy bumb, and not having one ounce of **drive** in me to work out.  I always say I'll start next week, or Monday, or Tuesday.  I even joined a weight loss competition in hopes I would accomplish something.  I weighed in at 320 and ended up losing 50lbs in 3 months.  This was at the beginning of May.  I felt great, I went from being able to do 1 push-up to 20 push-ups.  Now I'm back to 285lb and trying to watch what I eat.  I do NOT want to gain it back.  I have seen praises for Insanity quite a few times on here.  I made the purchase.  I have seen praises for eating right, which I am trying so hard to adopt.

But every step I take, I still sweat.  I huff and puff riding 2 miles on my bike.  I despise not being able to eat whatever I feel like eating.  I'm not sure why.  I don't know why I don't feel like getting up at 6AM and going for a run.  I don't know why I don't feel like trying the Insanity workout when I get home from work.  There is no one to blame except myself.  I'm not happy.  I'm not who I want to be, and I feel trapped in this horrible body.

I don't know what to do."

io8ou,2,2011-07-13,Life altering decisions. Anyone ever been in the same boat?,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/io8ou/life_altering_decisions_anyone_ever_been_in_the/,"After doing months of stalking, I finally broke down and made an account. I was anxious for this day to come, but I never thought the problem I'm seeking advice for would actually be happening. Like all great dilemmas, it involves a girl; well to be precise, it involves 2 girls and another guy (my current gf, my ex gf and her fiance)

I'll try my best to keep this brief. My ex and I met years ago when we both were participating in an out-of-state internship (we currently live about 10 states away). I had just turned 20 and she was a few years older. The relationship we had was damn near perfect; the connection we had was indescribable. Like an idiot, I cut it short of its full potential. I was young and thinking with the wrong head. My mind was in the wrong place and everyday that passes, I regret pushing away the best thing that ever happened to me.

Few other key notes:
- Since then she has been dating a guy that just recently popped the question. From what I understand, he's a great guy, but their relationship lacks ""excitement"" and its become obvious to me that she has many apprehensions about saying ""I Do"" to him. I suppose he is the safer bet (he's older and is more financially stable than I) and I'm the wild card, but she stated several times that she would be so much happier with me.
- A few months ago I started dating an amazing girl that I think the world of; my family loves her and so do I. She brings promise of a long happy relationship.

The Story (Where I question my morals): (Forgive the discreetness)
A few weeks ago, I receive a text from my ex saying that she has a layover in my state on the way to and from her destination. We talk and agree to meet up at the airport under the conditions that no one knows about this. Im sitting outside the security gate, shaking like never before due to all of these mixed emotions. Little did I know that she was an even bigger mess than I was. All of our feelings came flying back once we laid eyes on each other. It honestly felt like the few years we spent apart never occurred. We talked for a few hours; she shared with me her shaky feelings for her fiance and also how she stills loves me. We are all smiles as we said goodbye because we both know we will be seeing each other again fairly soon. The following day we're both going through the ""wtf am i doing?"" stage. We realize that we both care for each other greatly and that we will need some privacy next time around. This is where I should feel bad for what we have done, but honestly I don't. I feel guilty for not feeling guilty; the feeling I have is mutual to hers. Believe it or not, we are not bad people. The idea of cheating makes me sick, but I would do anything to have this girl back in my life. We both know the ramifications of our actions. I'll just ffwd...She ends up hanging out with me for longer than originally planned on her way home. This allows us to share more stories, thoughts, tears and unleash our burning lust for each other. She has since returned home to her fiance. She is currently reaching out to her friends and family about her 2nd thoughts (excluding my involvement). I have done the same; my verdict is: to stay the course with my current gf without ever mentioning anything, in hopes that time works everything out. And by everything working out, I mean: she doesn't make the mistake of settling for a guy she's not full heartedly in love with. This will allow me more time with my current gf and I wont be the one left holding the bag. I want her to be happy and I want her to be with me. Im willing to fight to make this work, but as you can tell I am going to make A LOT of enemies on both sides if she breaks it off and word gets out about this. 

-okay I know im a terrible person for what I did with an engaged woman, but I cant decide if acting on old feelings and making this type of life altering decision is a good idea. I mean I have a draw droppingly gorgeous gf that thinks the world of me and I really shouldnt ask for anything else. But you know how the saying goes ""the grass is always greener"".

-She has many red flags with this guy and I want her to make the right choice (which she needs to figure out on her own). If she ditches him, Im pretty sure shes going to expect me to do the same for her. 

-Is pursuing what your hearts desires and passing up a ""safe/secure bet"" such a far fetched idea?

I thought love crazed people only ran through airports and had these kind of predicaments in movies/ novels. Has anyone been in a similar situation and can offer some advice? There are a lot of missing details; im just trying to keep in concise. Fellow redditors, be easy on me.

My plan is to check them all out and apply to all that have open staff positions, internships (if I'm eligible), whatever I can. I've applied to 2 so far but now have questions before I continue.

First a little background on me:

* I have my BA in Econ and my GPA (both overall and major) are not good. I basically eked through. I am not a great student (but an excellent employee/worker). 

* I went back to school to take accounting courses (no degree) and my GPA in those classes is a 3.17. I know that in the accounting world this is just ""eh"" but I'm personally okay with it. I know I worked harder than I ever did before in school.

* CPA candidate taking exams October - February

So my questions:

* When the application asks for my school/university, should I list the school where I earned my BA or where I took my accounting classes? I ask this because...

* When it asks for my GPA should I give my undergrad GPA or my accounting courses GPA?

I can deal with the hours and the amount of work, but I dislike the relatively mindless nature of the task.

I majored in applied math at Columbia, around a 3.3 GPA, and have a fair amount of programming experience (Java/C/Perl/Matlab, some basic experience with oracle and SQL, and I'm learning Excel VBA right now).

ip6k9,10,2011-07-14,Should I try and fix this or end it?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ip6k9/should_i_try_and_fix_this_or_end_it/,"Posting from a throwaway since my girlfriend as well as others I know use reddit.

Anyway, I'm 20 years old and have been with my girlfriend (also 20) since last November. Up to that point, I had not had any relationships whatsoever (I'm kinda shy and am an engineering student :p). She was a classmate of mine and approached me... the whole sitting next to me in class, talking to me on facebook/msn until she finally invited me to her house and decided to hold my hand while we watched a movie. From that point on, we were pretty much in a relationship.

Everything was good for a while and we generally enjoyed eachothers company. I was always at her place sleeping over, or she was sleeping over at mine. The only thing that somewhat annoyed me was most of the time I would be doing school work, and she would be sleeping.

Almost all the time I ended up 'studying for her' for tests (since we have the same classes). What I mean by that is, she would spend most of her time sleeping, reading stuff on the internet or playing handheld games while I read through textbooks, went to class and did homework. When the deadline for an assignment or test would approach, she would get me to explain everything important to her (a lot of the studying in engineering seems to be filtering out what's important from the notes/book). She's a quick learner, so my explanations were typically sufficient for her to do very well on her tests/assignments. The part that ticked me off about it though was she would expect this explanation usually around 3:00 AM before the thing was due... which messed me up since she was on a nocternal schedule and I was not, often leaving me exhausted the next day.

Anyway, that was only a minor upset and is not what led me to posting this. When school ended, we both got internships - mine in one city, and hers in another about an hour and a half away. Every other week (typically) she would expect me to go visit her. I don't drive (never bothered learning since traffic is always jammed where I live and public transit goes everywhere) so I would have to take several busses to get there...meaning I usually wouldn't get in after work until around 11:00 PM. I would complain about how much of a hassle it was for me to get there, but she would just call me immature for not knowing how to drive.

Over time, I've come to realize that she's pretty abusive when she talks to me. She orders me around with single commands like ""move!"", ""stay!"", ""do the dishes!"". I hadn't realized it during the school year (since I was focused on other things), but she was constantly criticising me. For example, just because I like to use the GPS on my phone to figure out where I am sometimes, she calls me 'directionless' and openly tells people I'm completely incapable of navigating myself without a computer telling me what to do or being led by someone else. She also calls me immature all the time just because I do what I would consider ordinary things like often talk to my parents. I often find if we're with a group and someone gives me a complement about something, she's quick to retort with an 'so? anyone can do that' or basically anything else to devalue the complement as much as possible. The thing that hurts me the most is she tells me the small 'projects' I do (I like to build electronics to learn about different types of circuits) are stupid or serve no purpose. I built a voltage converting battery charger for my phone recently to charge it while on the go, and she told me it was a stupid waste of time because I should be charging it whenever near an outlet instead, and says I should instead spend time doing worth while projects that can actually make money like some friend of hers.

As of most recent, I started taking driving lessons and at my parents request am learning how to drive with manual transmission. Last week my girlfriend was over and I decided to let her come along with my dad and I. He was teaching me how to get the car moving from stationary without skidding all the time and I just drove around the neighborhood. The whole time my girlfriend was giving me a running commentary about how my turns were too wide and how the car is jerking around too much. Afterwards, she told me that she bets that if she were to drive manual (which she never has) she would probably do way better than me and that I'm currently terrible at driving and it's kind of sad that I need to drive around the neighborhood so much (which she only apparently had to do once before going onto real roads). I've literally maybe spent 5 hours total driving in my whole life...

It didn't occur to me how real this is (I thought I was exaggerating in my head) until my parents and my brother told me after she went back home that she's pretty hard on me.

Oh, I should probably also add - I'm a North American Caucasian and she's Chinese (negligable accent in English, been here 10 years). I guess I had kind of assumed that maybe this was a cultural thing, but one time when I was at her parents house, she laughingly told me her parents said that she shouldn't treat me like a dog... which implies to me that maybe she's just being a bitch.

Upon reflection after my parents told me this, I realized when we're not together, she only talks to me online or calls me when she has a work related issue and wants my help with programming. The only time she talks to me about anything else is when I start the conversation with her.

As cheesy as it sounds, my mom said when she met my dad she couldn't go 3 days without talking to him. So as a test I recently decided to not initiate any sort of contact with my girlfriend and only respond if she contacts me. She always says she 'loves' me... but so far it has been 3 days and nothing :/

Now I've made her sound way worse than she actually is; there are times where she isn't making me feel bad and we're having fun. I hope I'm not subconciously trying to convince myself to accept this rather than not having a girlfriend :/

Since clearly I have almost no experience with relationships, should I be try to fix this or just end it? I had a few fights with her in the past about her being abusive to me (this is before I 'saw the big picture'), and every time she just broke down crying begging me not to leave her and saying that she loves me.

I feel like I go out of my way to be as polite as possible and not upset her to avoid negativity... but it's feeling inaffective.

At the moment, she has no idea that I'm angry or concerned about this.

**TL;DR:** If you're actually looking for this, you shouldn't be in this subreddit.

P.S. More facts: She has had many boyfriends (only the last one she was physically intimate with) and was always the one to end the relationships... if it matters."
ioys3,3,2011-07-13,I love my gf a lot but I am debating breaking up with her I need advice,Generic_name18,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ioys3/i_love_my_gf_a_lot_but_i_am_debating_breaking_up/,"We have been dating for 2.5 years and I really love her. but all through our relationship she is obsessed with money. She is a saver and I am too but not to the extent that I am. Money is a little tight right now. But not tight enough that I felt like I couldn't buy some games on the steam game sale. I spent maybe 30 dollars on it. All together this summer I spent maybe 60 on myself. I work at an unpaid internship 3 days a week and I am a substitute lifeguard. I take every hour they give me. I am not making nearly as much as last year but I make enough.

The thing is my gf wont stop telling me to save my money. The thing is I am just not the way she wants. I graduate college in a year, she wants me to save for bills and student loans and such which I am but not the amount she wants. a year ago my 6 year old laptop died so I spent weeks searching for the cheapest non netbook I could find. I hate netbooks. I got a nice laptop but its litterally the cheapest one I could find. 2.5 years ago my gaming PC died it took me 2 years to replace it. I built the cheapest one I could. its nice but no where near as nice as my friends or as I wanted it to be, but it does its job.

We wound up arguing about it over the phone(long distance until we are back at college). I admitted that maybe I do spend my money a little freely, but I am responsible with it. My dad told me that when it comes to money I am one of the most responsible people he knows. I bought my own car and have paid for all the repairs totaling more than I paid for the car. I buy my own books, and clothes and food when im at college, and I get my own gas. Her parents pay for everything for her so of course she has a lot of money saved up. She isn't spoiled though, they don't get her everything she wants they give her a small amount of money and she makes it last as long as possible. They did buy her a car because she did so well in school and they are paying for college out of pocket.

As I said before I love her and I could see me marrying her but not if we are going to argue over money like this esspically when at the moment how I spend my money is none of her concern. One day it will be but until that day it isn't she told me how she feels and I listened but even when I said she was right she can't drop it. What do you think?"
iqv5a,0,2011-07-15,Fly to visit a girl for a weekend?,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/iqv5a/fly_to_visit_a_girl_for_a_weekend/,"Alright 'seductionists' I'm tired of being a lurker and want to seek for actual opinions and help because I really like this girl....

Background info:

I've known her for about 2~3 years now? Haven't really talked to her personally because I actually thought she was pretty cute, and did not want to be thrown into the friend zone because she was in a relationship with someone.

Girl's relationship status:

So there is this girl I like, recently(1~2 months ago) her ex-boyfriend(2years) broke up with her because he found another girl when he went on a trip. She is dealing with it pretty well I think

Current info:

She is currently out of state(5 hours away by airplane) for an internship. She came back to visit for a week, and I was able to steal two days of hanging out with her. We went to nice places, learned more about each other, and to what I believe was a pretty nice two days. I even got a job within those two days which made me extremely happy so I'm pretty sure the good-feeling/confidence rubbed off. BUT now shes back in the other state for the rest of her internship. I know a few of her friends are going to visit her the week after she is done with her internship to hang-out and explore that state. I was wondering if I should fly down that weekend (when she is going to come back), and get shown around as well. Of course I would ask her first, but I think it should be ok, because the amount of friends that are flying down is less then 5 but more then 1. And I have to do the weekend because I recently got a job, and the vacay days have not kicked in yet... 

And I enjoy exploring and relaxing in beautiful environments

2long2rd: I like a girl, and want to visit her wondering if I should invest a plane ticket for it. 

ty for opinions and if you need anymore info I'll provide as much as I can without disclosing personal info."
iquhw,3,2011-07-15,[FR] Continued: Texting and First Date /w HB7.5,electronPUA,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/iquhw/fr_continued_texting_and_first_date_w_hb75/,"So this is a continuation of my [Dance FR](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/io9wo/fr_a_successful_night_of_dance_game/) from a few nights ago. Specifically, HB7.5 expressed interest in seeing me soon, this is a continuation with her.

**Why HB7.5?**

I saw a recent ""what makes a good FR"" post which mentioned classifying why an HB is of certain value.  So lets open with that here.  HB7.5 is of attractive Columbian stock. High cheekbones, nice backside, good legs.  She's 21.  During the first night I danced with her (previous FR), she pulled no fewer than five guys onto the dance floor with her, easily and rapidly.  She would smile, high five every attractive guy who walked by: in essence she was sort of following PUA techniques (life of the party).  During this upcoming FR, she had the hottest women in the place pull her up onto a table to dance Coyote Ugly style (and tell her she was ""gorgeous"").  BUT is she an HB8? I think maybe not.  Physically she not quite there (at least for me).  She's not being approached so much as she's bringing approach to her.  Ok? So I'm going with HB7.5.

I texted her the day after our dance evening (prior FR). Normally that would be too early, but she told me she is staying near my apartment with a friend for the weekend, before moving nearer her internship (an hour away).  So time was important here.

**TEXTING**

**Me:** ""I survived my long day, zombies nearly got me though.""  I was going to follow up with a story about a woman who tried to pick me up at a coffee shop and looked undead (perhaps due to her drug addiction ways?).  But HB7.5 didn't ask for clarification.

**HB7.5:** ""Haha I'm glad your alive how many hours did you work senor?""

**Me:** ""That would depend upon your method of measurement.  Some might say 2, others ?? I am still doing laundry so...""

Mentioning laundry was sort of questionable! I was trying to get some dialog going.  She called me on it.

**HB7.5:** ""Laundry :/ so thats what your doing all night?""

Shit test-ish, I ignore.

**HB7.5:** ""So what does a braniac like youuuu do for fun?!""

**Me:** ""I think you know already! At least a little.  You'll have to hang out with me again to find out more.  What's your Friday looking like?""

**HB7.5:** ""Yes I do remember little bit what you told me last night I know your into art.  Tomorrow and this weekend I will be in Torrance visiting another friend if your free tomorrow we can meet up at the &lt;mall&gt;.  I will be watching the mid night screening of Harry Potter because my friend is a big fan.""

**Good: She's qualifying a little in trying to prove she was listening to my interests during our dance conversation**.  And she's trying to distance herself from the Harry Potter because she's afraid I'll judge.  Not exactly confident in her activities.  **Lesson: Don't excuse your plans with a ""because a friend likes it.""  It just sounds weak.**

**I decide I don't want to meet her at &lt;mall&gt;.  That would be sending a ""I'm so available I'll meet you in line waiting for a midnight movie at the mall"" vibe, which is total crap.  Furthermore, I'm not sure I need to make time for her, I'm not sold yet.**

**Me:** ""I'm going to the Twilight Dance @ Santa Monica Pier tonight, 7-10PM.  Theme this week is 80's Pop Rock!""  Turned out the Bangles were playing.  Sweet! And it's free.

**HB7.5:** ""Sounds like fun!! But unfortunately I wouldn't have a ride""

This sounds like a plus to me - if she's not too out of my way.  Not much beats having the vehicle on logistics.

**Me:** ""And you have plans, no? I would think you have to be in line early for Potter? Where would you need a ride from?""  I really thought she had plans with this friend of hers, and I was disqualifying her availability.  But in case she changed her mind, I'm assessing how far I have to drive to take her to this concert.

**HB7.5:** ""Yes I do but I would love to do both :) My friend would be in line so I would meet up with her.  My friend that I am staying with now lives in &lt;city 10 minutes from my office building&gt; is that far from you?""

Good news, it's close.. And the movie theater is near my apartment.

**HB7.5:** ""Hey so I told my friend about Santa Monica and she totally told me to go and then meet her after the movie ends around 2AM.  Do you have work tomorrow?""

Ok.  So HB7.5 is asking for a ride.  She's telling me she's free and putting herself alone with me until 2AM.  She's practically setting up the logistics for me.

So we conclude logistics over text, I'll omit - except I'll toss in this final exchange because I thought it was good.

**HB7.5:** ""Okay sounds good is it okay if I have my bags with me?"" She was moving from one friend to another.

**Me: ""Sure.  $20 for the first checked bag, $25 for the second.  And we don't serve peanuts anymore.  Bring your own pillow.""**

**DATE NIGHT**

Ok. So I pick her up and we drive to Santa Monica, park and hit the pier.  We are dancing in the front row, up against the metal crowd control fence - she's in front of me and I am dancing right up behind her.  **For awhile I'm dancing with my hands in her pockets (fingers sort of rubbing inside upper thighs through her short pockets)**, sometimes hands roam to her sides, back, etc.  **But every couple songs I would back off and let her dance without physical contact** - thinking that might help Push-Pull a little, leave her wondering if I'm entirely sold.

At times I hooked a thumb in the back of her shorts, pulling back and down a bit as we danced together.  Subtle indication of what I wanted to do with said shorts, maybe she picked up on it.  Thought I would try it.  At no time during our dancing did she seem uncomfortable with my actions.

Ok, so the concert winds down at 10PM and I have planned to offer alternatives for the remainder of the night.  This may have been a bit of a slip-up, but I've done this before and if a woman has reached buying temperature she always sets up logistics by choosing my apartment option.  I offer HB7.5 three options: **A** Dancing at a club in Santa Monica (but tell her we would have to do some exploring to find a place, I haven't done enough SM game to know where the dance clubs are), or **B** drive down to my apartment, walk the beach (an excuse to get to my apartment, the walk part probably wouldn't happen), or **C** Beach city dancing where we met two nights prior.  HB7.5 seems to pick up on what I'm getting at with option **B**, tells me she wants to dance and takes option **C**.  I take this as a bad sign (this was the optimal switch-over point in the evening, time-wise, if we were going to fool around until 2AM).  **My slip up may have been to provide these options, instead of more persistantly saying: lets go to my apartment, I'll show you my photography.**  But, I do prefer to have the woman select the option which is clearly leading to my bedroom, without having to shoe her into it (*particularly when I'm her only ride for the night in a city she doesn't know*).  I've run into this moral issue before: I once was a mentor for a woman on a backpacking trip and told her she could stay in my tent with me.  I felt morally I couldn't push too hard on the trip because I was her source of housing for the backpacking trip (and her mentor).  So I was a bit tentative on the sexual escalation, and nothing happened.

We drive to Beach City and hit the dance bars.  She's being far less flirty with other guys this time.  In my prior FR, she was flirting with all the guys in the room (and they her).  This time she's really focused on me (to the point of almost being possessive? If my eyes start to wander to other sexyness in the room she would grab my arm and pull be into her).  We make friends on the dance floor, HB7.5 gets their phone numbers (HB8 girl tells HB7.5 that she is ""gorgeous"" and we all dance together, manage to get a HB8 / ElectronPUA / HB7.5 sandwhich going).  But I'm not able to dance with other women very easily, HB7.5 is being kind of possessive-ish.  At one point HB9 dancing on the table (getting eyes from EVERY guy in the room) pulls HB7.5 up and they dance together.

It's getting later and I really see the prospect for getting HB7.5 to my place going down the drain.  So I'm just dancing, seeing this as a learning experience at this point.  We close out the bar (she seems to purposefully hold off till closing at 1:30 AM, possibly because she wants to have reason to go straight to the theater afterwards?).  We drive to the theater and sit in the car for forty minutes.  Her body language is good, and I've got my hand on her calf / thigh at times - leaving it there and she's not protesting.  But I'm exhausted, and I have given up on anything physical that night.  In my experience so far, I prefer to save the k-close for a time when further closing is possible - and I didn't see that at this point.  She asks what I'm doing Friday, I evade a bit.  Conversation goes pretty deep into confort building territory, she expresses interest in seeing me this weekend.  Friend arrives and I drive home.

TL;DR; Despite HB7.5 setting up logistics perfectly for a First Date Lay, she evades during the night of and I don't push for F-Close."

ipzxj,12,2011-07-14,FYI,livelaughdesign,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ipzxj/fyi/,"Since we've broken up, a million good things have happened to me. I'm in Florida now on a business trip and vacation... with my internship. They said they have a job waiting on me here if I decide to take it when I graduate... and I still have a year of college left. Money is coming in left and right, and I have a million girls hitting on me. I've gone out and made a ton of new friends as well as caught up with old one. My family and I are closer than we've been in at least a year or more. There are so many positive things in my life that are helping me get through you breaking up with me out of the blue. 

I'm happy. My heart, however, has a small part that is so heavy I don't know that I am fully enjoying all of the blessings that have been happening. I love you so much. My heart is still shattered from the way that you broke up with me; I deserved so much better from you. How do you just stop talking to someone you've talked to every day for so long? I find myself talking out loud to you, saying your name. I want to tell you how excited I am about my future and for you to know what's going on in my life. I miss talking to you. I miss you holding me, and telling me how proud of me you are. Its been a month and a half since I spoke to you, and I still hear your voice breaking up with me. I don't dwell on us. I don't expect anything to ever come from us again, or think you'll call saying you regret it or anything. But it kills me to not know if you miss me. Or if you even loved me or when you stopped. 

I will never tell you anything about my pain over the last several weeks, or the love for you I still have. It's fading into something I think goes much more into a sad regretfulness anyway. I don't want us to be friends, or to torture myself watching you happy being free from our relationship.

I just want you to know I loved what we had. "

I've been in a relationship with this girl for about 3 and a half months. I'm a guy, 21. She's 26. She's an exchange student from another country, and is heading back in early August.

I'm quite enamored with this girl, but recently, things that she's said, done or mentioned have driven me to become less so, and begin to doubt things. This girl has a sexual past - a large one, from the sounds of things - that she can't help but mention, even after I tell her that it makes me feel uncomfortable. Things like how it was with other guys, the things they did, how it felt, how I compare (yeah, how's that for fun) etc. Recently, it was a discussion about size, and how I guess I don't ""measure up"".

This is further enhanced by the fact that, due to the age, there's a big difference in the things we think of. She's made it quite clear - quite, quite clear - that she wants a family, and she wants to settle down and start that part of her life. I'm 21. I have a year of college left, and am not in the place where I can even pretend to make that decision.

I've been away (on the other side of the country from her) due to an internship. We've seen each other twice - she visited me, and I visited her - and that was great, but the distance is taking its toll on me. It's sounding like - in this internship - that I'm going to receive an offer. She's mentioned wanting me to move to her home country, something I'm just not comfortable with - especially not with this offer presumably being on the table.

While this alone would push me to make the decision eventually, something else has been pushing it further.

I met a girl at this internship who is, in a word, incredible. An amazing woman. She's closer to my age, and will end up working for this company also. She's so many things, and I really feel a connection with her. She knows about my relationship (and my girlfriend knows that this girl exists), and she's made it clear that if my situation changes, she hopes she hears from me.

This past week, I've hung out with this girl a lot, usually far late into the night, up talking. We haven't *done* anything - I could never ever do that if I were in a relationship - but it's clear that something's there. I brought up last night with her that I plan to end things with this girl, and she said she can't give me any advice (which I respect, and am glad to hear). She's really cool. She told me that if anything were to happen with us, if my situation changes, it would be ""really really great"". Is this girl into me?

There's another thing. I have a story about something that happened to me in the past - something I did - which I'm very personal about. I don't want to type the whole thing here, but it was a situation where very few people believed me besides myself. I told my girlfriend, and she didn't believe me. I told this new girl. She did. She's the first person to believe me, and that's incredibly important.

How do I have this phone call with my girlfriend? I'm terrified of making her feel bad, but I have to. I can't go on being a ""two-woman man"", and I feel a much stronger connection with this new girl. I don't plan on jumping in headfirst with her or anything, but I don't want to start anything off on the wrong foot either. I just need some advice for what to do, and how to do it.

Thanks, guys. You're all really really cool people."

Now I am a philosophy major with only some **very** basic C++ and web design skills I picked up along the way. Since I only have a year and a half left before I can graduate and I want to stay at my current university, I'm more or less stuck in my current major. I enjoy it, but I understand my career prospects with a philosophy degree are basically zero. 

What can I do to get a career in programming back on track from here? Right now I am depressed that I am stuck working a retail job this summer once again while most of my friends are doing prestigious internships.

it6z7,15,2011-07-18,Forever alone vegan,deltabn,vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/it6z7/forever_alone_vegan/,"Hi all,
So the lot of you are the only vegan people I interact with, besides reading and seldomly commenting on blogs. I'm from a rural area in Texas that's definitely 'cattle country', and I go to school in a more tolerant town in Arizona...I know a handful of vegetarians that practice for health reasons, but I'm really starting to go crazy not having anyone to talk to about my ideas and thoughts relating to veganism. My friends support my lifestyle and they general don't try and ""tempt"" me with foods, but I know that having a group of people around me that have the same beliefs that I hold would make life a lot more fun.

As a side note, I'm an undergraduate student and I'm doing an internship abroad this summer and I only adopted veganism about 2 months before I left the states. Since I've been abroad, it's been okay because I'm always meeting new people. However, I know that when term resumes at the end of August, it would be really awesome to have some vegan friends to try out recipes, go to the farmer's market with, and do non-food related things with as well.

I've also had a few thoughts of wanting to spread the idea of vegan philosophy on my campus. Have any of you found this sort of thing helpful in making friends, or have you been successful in leading others to try a vegan lifestyle? Also, what techniques have you used to spread ideas (pamphlets, newspaper articles, etc.), and to what degree were they successful?

How many of you struggled/still struggle to find vegan friends? How have you been successful/unsuccessful? "
it2zc,7,2011-07-18,Financially preparing for graduation,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/it2zc/financially_preparing_for_graduation/,"This fall I'll begin my junior year of college, and I plan to graduate one semester early. I'll graduate with about $35,000 of debt... fun.

It's still a ways off, but I'm planning on getting an entry-level job in the magazine industry once I graduate. I'm going to spend the rest of my education interning part time, so hopefully I can be hired right out of college instead of having to be a full time unpaid intern who is just waiting for a position to open up (it's fucked up, but those do exist. The publishing industry is brutal) when I graduate. I don't know for sure, but I expect my starting salary to be very low and coupled with very long hours. I'm expecting something around $30,000-$35,000 a year, working 50+ hour weeks. This is in New York City.
I'll have to get an apartment, almost definitely with roommates. I'll try to find something inexpensive, but it will be difficult. I'm expecting to have to spend about $900+ a month on rent based on browsing apartments on craigslist, though hopefully I can find something for less, even if it means living way out in the outer boroughs somewhere.

I have no credit history yet. I've toyed with the idea of getting a credit card in the near future and buying one small item a month, paying off the balance in full each bill, to build a credit history, because I've heard that it's essential in renting an apartment (is that true?). I don't have any savings to speak of, either. My parents have very little money and don't support me except for college payments, and what little money I make at my work-study job usually goes to groceries, subway fare, cell phone bill, shopping, etc.

This summer and next I have the opportunity to work my work-study job full-time. I haven't been great about saving so far this summer, though I'm working on it now and I hope to have about $1,500 saved by the fall. I'd like to use this money to go visit my friend while he studies abroad, as I've always wanted to travel but never had the means. Next summer I'll be only one semester away from having to find an apartment (if I haven't moved off-campus by that point already) and fending completely for myself - God help me if I don't have a job at that point. I figured that I'd work full time again next summer, save as much as I can - probably about $3,000 if I'm good about it - and use that for my security deposit/first month or two of rent.

Basically, I'm just looking for general advice on what to do once I graduate. I've never had to think about loan payments, salaries, rent, etc. before and it's extremely overwhelming, especially since I have so much debt and New York is so expensive. How should I go about repaying the loans? Where should I try to consolidate money? How should I go about beginning to build savings, and then what should I do with it? What about if I'm not able to get a salaried job once I graduate?"

Basically I'm going to be in my third year of uni after this summer, and over this summer I think I finally started to truly develop my ""inner game."" Long story short, I realized my self-worth, and it's showing in my personality and every other aspect of my life *including social media outlets*. 

Now what bothers me is that a few of my friends from uni view my new self as out of character and ""arrogant.""  While I agree that I'm not who I was, I don't believe I'm necessarily being arrogant. I'm just... doing well for myself, I'm having a blast at home, I have a fantastic internship that I enjoy, and I'm trying to improve my inner game everyday.

But then once in a while when I see a comment or something from my buds at uni saying something referring to my ""arrogance"" or ""hubris,"" I can't help but be annoyed or bothered immensely... Obviously the ideal thing to do in this situation is to say ""haters gonna hate"" and move on, but I just want to know why it bothers me so much.

itzuu,0,2011-07-19,[FR] Met up for lunch. Did I shoot myself in the foot?,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/itzuu/fr_met_up_for_lunch_did_i_shoot_myself_in_the_foot/,"Hey there Seddit, so here’s one of my few field reports for your perusal and judgment. Last Friday I went out to a late lunch with a girl that I had met and hooked up with a while back. Up until this point however, we were pretty much at the drunken acquaintance stage, and we really didn’t know anything about each other, save for what universities we attend and whatever in FB would yield. According to a couple of female friends, I had made a tactical error in suggesting the lunch rather than a dinner, and that it most likely suggested a friendly date instead of a “date” date. Not sure how you guys feel about this notion?

Leading up to the date/lunch/hangout, we texted and I took the opportunity to neg her a little, she said “hopefully you recognize me!” and I responded “haha no guarantees, I mean, I WAS drunk after all… you’re blonde right?” We met up at in the afternoon after I got off work and had lunch and basically talked and got to know each other for a LONG time. That is, the late lunch transitioned into an evening hang out. Throughout the course of the damn thing I tried to keep up kino and neg her at appropriate times, and really I think it was going well except for the fact that there was no k-close at the end. Really that’s what worries me, since I technically made it to the second “date” (we have yet to plan it but she wants to meet up again). My problem is I have no idea what she views me as at this point. I paid for the meal mainly because I only had a charge but also because I’m employed at a cushy internship for the summer and she’s… chillin at home (it just seemed appropriate). During the lunch we did make reference to the night, although no specific reference to the hook-up, just the events leading up to it. *my memory is a little fuzzy from that night anyway, since I had an abundance of alcohol* After lunch we walked around, talked, sat down in front of a fountain, talked, rode a ferris wheel, talked. In the aftermath we just know a lot more about each other, I personally see this as a good thing, since there were many opportunities to subtly mention DHV examples… Additionally I qualified her a couple of times, (i.e. we walked by a gym and I suggested we go in, “hey, you can totally spot me right?” “are you crazy? haha have you seen me?” “well I mean… I guess I see your point… well here, I’ll give you a year to work on it, and next summer, you are definitely spotting me”). Final point worth mentioning, when we were talking about the night and she asked what I remembered, I mentioned that I couldn’t get over how great her eyes were that night… I’m not sure if this added value to the interaction in the since that I pointed out that I’m interested in her physically, or if I lowered value by… pointing out that I’m interested in the first place.

**Things that would indicate that I’m not friend-zoned and completely desexualized:**
We’ve hooked up before, I maintained an alpha role, our next planned outing is somewhat romantic? (alcohol picnic by the beach I’m thinking)

**Things that would indicate this situation can’t be salvaged:**
Met up for lunch instead of dinner (shrug), I did some kino but couldn’t escalate to a k-close, we literally walked and talked for several hours

Now I’m not necessarily looking for a relationship role here, rather a friends with benefits scenario since I go to school 2000 miles away and I’d only see her when I’m home (i.e. the longer breaks). Of course I realize that there could be an in between where I stumbled and can hopefully salvage but what do you guys think? Did I mess it up with the lunch? Did I not escalate fast enough? Or how do I proceed from here? Should I play it cool and let her contact me? Or should I ping her sometime about the second meeting? (we’ve had a back and forth via text after the date but I sent the last text, she’s also going on a family vacation for the next week or two, so she said afterwards is best.)

Thanks in advance guys, and I apologize for the wall of text.

ituav,2,2011-07-19,"Ok seddit, help me out here...",Proxify,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/ituav/ok_seddit_help_me_out_here/,"I'm doing an internship on another country and there's one HB8 that I'm pretty sure is AT LEAST a little bit into me, only once have we been in the same place outside of the office and she really stood close-by and talked to me a lot, until another guy showed up. 

Let me explain. 
I am a native Spanish speaker, she is not and she finds Spanish ""sexy"" so the difference between the guy that she went with and me is that he's a native Spanish speaker as well BUT he is really fluent in the local language (much more than me at least). That is not the problem however because he just missed his chance while I went to talk to other girls that night, also I'm certain he's not talking to her or seeing her because I befriended him just to have some info should I need it later on ;)

Now, back to the office and HB8. My question is, how can I get more ""into her head"" since it's not as if we could just chat in the middle of the office with everyone listening + not working. I'm not very good at the game also (I'm on day 6 of ""The Rules of the Game""), but I'm getting better. 

I just want to know what would be a good way to approach her, without coming off needy, or kinda that ""look-at-me"" kinda guy, but rather make her even more attracted to me. From time to time, she asks me for some words in Spanish, and in exchange she teaches me those of her language.

Also, I basically disqualify myself as a bf since I'm leaving in a couple of months. I know this is a good chance and don't want to let it go without at least trying because it would be REALLY frustrating for my inner game.

So, what should I do?"

What's the career-path look like for a Linux admin? Do we all start as Windows Desktop Support while waiting for that Linux break? Or is there some sort of specific ground-floor technology I should be focusing on? Databases? VoIP? Are all Linux admins born as web developers?

Thanks in advance. I'm just blown away by all the options, and want to know what you guys think.

**Edit**: Basically, here's my options:

* Take an unpaid general support internship at a local hospital that uses Windows servers, Cisco switches and a lot of VoIP phones.
* Take a paid co-op help-desk position in my college's IT department using Windows servers, HP hardware and a bit of VoIP.
* Take an unpaid internship with my friend's start-up, where I will essentially be the CTO of a small video-streaming network using *NIX web servers and integrating with [a high-profile CDN](http://www.level3.com/). This is obviously the best tech choice, but the biggest risk.

Monitoring our servers would be nice too, but monitoring the network is the primary goal. 

I'm an intern. I have 2/4 years done in college, going for IT, and I'm starting this in about a month when I return for my 3rd year.

Most of our network hardware is Enterasys, with some Cisco and HP stuff thrown in as well. I suspect that doesn't matter much, because they're all going to be using SNMP anyway.

We've got 14 servers. Most being server 2008, one being server 2008 R2, and one being server 2003. Since we're using Windows all over, WMI support would be nice (they all support SNMP anyway, but meh.)

We're also thinking about the benefits of monitoring our clients. 500+ Windows 7 boxes. Monitoring them would allow us to have a broad overview of where electricity us used most, which would probably be useful to someone. I'm not really sure, it was my boss's idea. It would probably look cool, but I'm not sure what kind of impact that would have on network traffic. Hmm...

Also, it needs to have graphs, email alerts, web-based UI, and a quality auto-detection feature would be very nice. Did I mention it has to be free as well? Well I have now.

I'd prefer something that runs on windows, or runs as its own OS. I'm not really familiar with linux enough to go and install/configure something like this. Unless there's a step-by-step install guide, I can follow those like a pro.


Right now I've been looking at Cacti, it gets the job done and there's a CentOS distribution that comes with it preinstalled (called CactiEZ), which is very nice. But, it feels very old, and not as smooth and easy to use as I'd like.


So, /r/geek, what's the best product to get this job done, and is there any advice you can offer me about this adventure? 



**TL;DR:** Putting an SNMP monitoring box together, need awesome free software to put on it, read my post for specifics, then give me suggestions."

My girlfriend and I are both in our mid-twenties and have been together almost two years.  She checked herself into a mental institution over the weekend and I’m visiting her tomorrow.  We will break up.

Our story has been told in at least one romantic comedy, I’m sure.  I was a poor college senior in need of a place to stay; she was new to campus and needed a roommate.  I answered her ad, drove up from my internship, we hit it off well enough and agreed to live together for the next school year.  I had no idea I was about to start one of the best friendships of my life.

Through parties and tests and other partners there was a steady, unrealized sexual tension between us that played softly behind our growing partnership.  By the time the year ended I surely knew her better than anyone; similarly, she surely knew me better than any other.  I packed up and headed off for a big city job with promises to stay in touch.

Stay in touch is one thing we certainly did.  I couldn’t stay away and spent more weekends than I care to admit driving through the night just to see her again.  We started dating; I said “I love you” within a month.  Fast forward six months and she’s packing up to move down to live with me.

And here things start to go south.  We had agreed to a strictly roommate like scenario – split the costs, live as equals.  I make significantly more than she can so I paid for a lot and didn’t complain.  I wrote her thousands of dollars’ worth of checks to pay her bills on the promise she would pay me back once she found a job.  Fast forward seven months and I have a career anyone would be envious of but she can’t seem to keep employment…  And has barely paid me back $50.  The resentment builds and the bonds holding us together begin to separate.

Her behavior gradually becomes more and more catatonic.  She can spend 16 hours a day in bed.  We argue and she promises to get better or at least go outside but she never does.  Long hours and family stresses wear me down.  Finally, she checks herself into a mental hospital.  Her mother speculates it’s related to a previous sexual assault.  My mother speculates she’s depressed.  Her doctors won’t tell me anything.

Reddit – I can’t take it anymore.  I can’t bear the burden of helping her heal and I’m afraid if I did it would inspire more codependence.  I’ve talked with my family, I’ve talked with her family, I’ve talked with her doctors (as much as I can).  Tomorrow, I’m going to see her for the first time in days and break up with her.

Am I a saint?  Will a totally different life help her get better, faster?  Or am I a monster, needlessly subjecting her to more agony?

TL;DR: I’m breaking up with my girlfriend after her mental breakdown."

AMA.",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/iv6e3/i_became_a_millionaire_from_nothing_in_3_years/,"When I was little I dreamed of being an inventor. I always tinkered with lots of things, dismantled everything in sight to learn how it worked. Forgive me for my lack of modesty but I was a fucking genius. At age 12 I began tinkering with electronics and by 15 had taught myself more than graduated 22 year olds knew about. By 16 I got my first computer, a 486 DX2 and immediately began to learn how to program Pascal all by myself.

When I entered college (engineering) our first programming class assignment was to build a tetris clone. While the rest of the class presented barely working text-mode programs I had a fully graphical, textured and animated game complete with music, sounds and different difficulty levels. I pretty much never worked until I graduated college considering menial internships below my dignity. And yeah, I pretty much graduated without learning anything new. Then I found work as a linux programmer. I hated that job and after about a year and a half I was through and decided I was going to build my own business and quit. This was about June 2005.

I dithered for a couple of months deciding what to do. I had a bit of savings and lived with my parents so I could afford to be off work. The only thing I knew for sure was that I had to do something that was fucking hard, because there are lots of people doing the easy jobs. By September I had identified an unfilled niche for some type of equipment that was only available imported and cost a lot. I figured I could do at least as good of a job and sell them for half price with 50% margin so I began working.

I worked days, nights and weekends. By late October I had it designed and began building the prototype which was ready about early December. The first test revealed a design flaw that forced me to disassemble and rebuild everything. I cried that day. By about March next year I deemed it workable and ready to sell. I had designed and built electronic circuits, embedded firmware, Windows software and the mechanical assembly of the machine itself.

With the last of my savings I placed an ad in a relevant magazine. I figured I could sell about 3 of those a year and pay myself a good salary. I sold three in a month and by the end of the year, 8. That was 2006. In 2007 I sold 12 and in 2008, 18. I now had six people working for me; each machine took about two month's work to construct and we did almost everything in house.

One of our customers wanted to purchase my business. I asked for two million and we spent about a month negotiating the deal. By any account, I was a fucking millionaire! But just like that the recession came and the deal died. In 2009 I only sold 4 pieces and almost went broke due to the high fixed costs I had. 2010 was a lousy year and this one is turning out ok, though not as good as 2008.

I'm now developing three different projects that fit the it's hard to do and what else is available is fucking expensive philosophy. There's little doubt in my mind now that in another four to five years I'll have a different Porsche for each weekday in my garage. 

Oh, and my business card lists my title as ""Inventor"".

[As a top 1% earner, here's what I think about people bitching about us](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/iv008/iama_request_one_of_the_top_1_of_earners_we_keep/): you're losers. On more than one occasion I offered jobs to friends that had been fired and were complaining they couldn't find work only to have them never show up to work to me. So quit whining and go do something worthwhile.

TLDR: Step 1: Find something that's fucking hard to do and be fucking good at it and make it a business. Step 2: Repeat step 1.

AMA that doesn't reveal exactly what I do or who I am. (I'm sure many people that know me could identify me just from my story above so if there's any friends reading this then please don't.)

Re:    The Passing of a Rensselaer Student
 
It is with great sadness that I inform you of the recent passing of
Rensselaer student Corey S. McClymonds, while he was at home in
Centennial, Col. On behalf of the entire Rensselaer community, I extend
our deepest sympathies to his family and friends.
 
Mr. McClymonds was a senior pursuing a dual major in computer systems
and engineering and computer science, with a minor in cognition. He was
also enrolled in the co-terminal program, and planned to pursue a
master's in computer systems and engineering. He was scheduled to
graduate in May 2012. This summer, he was working in an internship at
Intel in Fort Collins, Col.

In addition to his studies at Rensselaer, Mr. McClymonds was active in a
number of student clubs, including the RPI Players theater group and
UPAC Lights and Sound, an organization that works to provide
professional event lighting for the Rensselaer community events.  Those
who knew Mr. McClymonds described him as a person who had a knack for
making people laugh and knowing how to make a dull moment entertaining.

The loss of a student is a very difficult event for a university
community and its members to experience, and I understand that this news
will be upsetting for many of you, especially those who were close to
Mr. McClymonds. I urge the entire community to come together to help
those who are grieving.
 
Rensselaer has many resources available to students, faculty, and staff
who may be experiencing emotional distress following such news. If you
are in distress, or you know someone who needs help, please contact the
Counseling Center as soon as possible at (518) 276-6479. The counselors
are ready and available to speak with any student needing
assistance. All information is confidential.

I anticipate that, as students learn of his death, they might be seeking
assistance.  Again, please refer inquiries to the Counseling Center
(518) 276-6479.  If after hours, contact Public Safety at (518) 276-6656
to contact Counseling Center on-call staff.

As of today, funeral arrangements are not available. We will provide you
with a date and time when plans are finalized."

iunet,1,2011-07-20,i feel like i'm an alien that doesn't feel love,blamey,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iunet/i_feel_like_im_an_alien_that_doesnt_feel_love/,"edit of the whole thing because it sucked and was simply irritating to all unfortunate enough to read it:

We are together and have been for one year.  We have a lot of fun, and there isn't much to fight about.  He does say I'm defensive sometimes.  We make a lot of jokes.  We're in a band together, and it's a good one because it's energetic and we're goofy.  We do many things together. 

When it comes to he and I as a relationship, I don't know what to feel.  On one hand, it feels like a fucking fairytale.  And being with him makes me think we're better, smarter, and more creative than the whole world.  I can't believe I'm finally dating someone who can keep up with me, and me with him.  But I don't think he loves me really for some reason &lt;-- when I think that, I feel like being objective about it, and I don't get upset.  There isn't anything I could do about that possibility!  But he certainly does say he loves me, talks about me a lot, is really goofy about missing me (I've been away this summer for an internship/practicum,)  but it's like he's just trying to convince himself.  

For some reason, when I hear ""I love you"" from him, it just seems like he's trying the words out to see how they feel on his tongue, or like he's terrified of it not being true, like he's gotta say it before it fades. 

I wonder if we are too similar.  Our feelings are too mutual.  From the beginning, the very first night, we were like best friends (on the outside at least.)  We ""mesh"" well, and everything we do is fun and cool, and we're very funny and are the ones always making our tight-knit group of friends laugh or thinking of things to do.  We're both pretty snobby about a sort of unspoken expectation of others.  We are so similar.  We both have a very strong intuitive nature, so we can ""see"" things, and ""call it.""  I feel like this sort of snobbery actually drove me away for these past 3 months this summer.  If I'd stayed in our city and not taken the most impressive internship I could find, I wouldn't be worth him dating. Like to see if I'm monetarily and emotionally capable of flying across the country and being in a small town where I know not a soul and I don't even have my cat for three months, and still being successful.  

I can't tell if there's love on either side.  I'm 23 and he's 20, about to turn 21 in August.  I wonder if it's an age difference, since the girl isn't supposed to be older and all.  I don't mean that.  But I think about it too much.  We met because he asked me for a cigarette outside the main college library during a summer semester 2 years ago, and then we tried to pretend we weren't looking at each other for half a year.  I threw a very large party at my house, and he came, and out of the hundreds of people who came, he was one of the last 2 that left.  He said he'd come over the next day and help clean up.  I cleaned up the next day with everyone, and I sent him a Facebook message saying ""Don't come over because we're all done here, but thank you for offering.""  and he sent me a message asking me out on a date.   The date went bad, but it also went good, but it mostly went bad.  I could use quick humor on him and he'd get it, but it was very awkward and I felt insecure about myself because I felt like I wasn't skinny or pretty enough (I'm skinny.  I'm not not pretty.  I dress well.) for this kid that I'm probably in love with from the amount of times I've seen him around and the times I've daydreamed about him.  Also, it was a slight competition between the two of us to not let the other think we were slow or not ""in the know.""

So after a failed hang out attempt after that because he had a class, we didn't talk again until it was summer, and I walked up to his friend at a party and pretended I knew the friend much better than I did.  I wasn't too happy that John had never tried again...  so I just decided fuck it, and in a very goofy way made him hold some restaurant left overs of mine because he had a messenger bag and I did not.  I shook up the clear to go box of the nearing-disgusting best latin food on our side of town before he took it, to demonstrate I won't care if he loses it, and in fact he could eat it.  It was strange and funny and a good prevention to him feeling awkward.  Later I was trying to be amusing to a small group of people and told them the party sucked because they didn't have ouija board, and John said ""I HAVE A OUIJA BOARD AT MY HOUSE""  and I said ""...rly""  and we went to his house, were to drunk to play it in an abandoned shed next door, and I kissed him right as he was about to ask me if he could kiss me.  It's like we're twins god damn it.  

We've been near to inseparable ever since.  Ever. Since.  Til' this internship of mine.  He'll be here in TWO DAYS, on saturday, and even the idea of kissing him makes me feel very afraid and like I can't, because I suck too much and I don't see why he'd wanna. I feel like the nicest thing I could do for him is never see him again and just live my life pretty and successful to prove it to him/the two of us. I always feel like telling him ""Look bro, you don't wanna be with her... come on, you don't wanna be with her.  Listen to me.""  like that shit.  I feel like I hate myself for even being female actually, when I consider myself more of a man than most of the schlucks I see and the shit they do.  

I don't want to think I'm in love with him.  I think this means I'm not.  I think it's the same for him.  There's no reason for this except neither of us are ""blown away"" or ""omgsh you're so incredible crazy amazing"" about each other.  High levels of amusement and glee at each others' existence, but maybe that's it.  We do need each others' help, especially in terms of our insecurities, but he never talks about or addresses mine really.  Maybe I don't with his either, but I feel like I do.  

If anyone has anything to say or would like to interpret this, i would like that please.  I'm very sad...that tearing feeling at the heart right before you're about to cry, I feel that near-constantly, so I'm pretty much always about to start bawling.  I don't feel it in my eyes though.  Just in my chest.  

I feel like I want to SAVE him and me, as if if i don't it will be a huge injustice to the universe and my purpose for being alive.  "

CompSci or SoftEng degree with knowledge of Java, JEE and JBoss and experience with Eclipse would be great.

**Web Developer**

Not just HTML and JS knowledge. Those are really valuable but you must have some server-side scripting knowledge and experience. Work samples would be great too. IDE is eclipse as well.

Both positions are available right now and we'll hire as soon as we get the right applicants. New/Recent grads preferable as we're a bunch of young people and it's a fun work environment. Work experience is really really valuable but if you haven't done coop or internships, having done some school projects could suffice. Interview process does include actual software development, problem solving on paper and a small application developed in a one hour project.

Update: Positions are full time and permanent. There would be a probationary period of course.

ivsf8,40,2011-07-21,Relationship Paradox,body_snatcher,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivsf8/relationship_paradox/,"My girlfriend of two years recently broke up with me. Needless to say, I am absolutely devastated/shattered/just don't even know what to do with myself. 

The backstory:
We go to the same university in Southern California, met freshman year, fell madly in love, lived together Junior year. We finished our Junior year, moved out of our shared apartment, and I went to London for the summer to do an internship. All the while, she had already planned to spend next semester (4 months) in London studying abroad. When i come home from London, she leaves for London 6 days later. As my departure approached, we had both become extremely morose over the prospect of being apart for so damn long, but we convinced ourselves it was the right thing to do, as these are once in a lifetime opportunities, and we'd be learning a lot about ourselves in the process. 

So I go to London, we skype daily, and she is just totally heartbroken over being so far apart. I keep telling her that she needs to be able to find happiness outside of the confines of the relationship, and that she shouldn't depend upon me entirely. This had always been my only problem with our relationship. She had become clingly, to the extent of giving up a lot of her old friends to spend all her time with me. I wanted her to be more independent, to explore other passions, etc. 

So my urging her to be more independent totally backfires four days ago, and she takes my advice to the absolute logical extreme. Essentially, ""I'm becoming more independent. I'm learning that I didn't like myself in the relationship. I don't like who I had become. I'm feeling free and liberated. I don't think we should talk anymore, and I don't think we should see each other after you get back and before I leave. I don't want to go back to square one.""

Alas, the Paradox:
As she becomes more independent -- more like the person I've wanted her to be -- the more attracted to her I become, and the less she sees me as part of her life. 

The way she explained this to me fucking devastated me. I don't understand how she has gone from crying a river at the airport when I left, to this. Even though she's said she doesn't want to talk, I've been calling her every day since, and she's been more than willing to talk to me. I don't know what to do, Reddit. I haven't been sleeping, eating... anything. I'm just paralyzed by my thoughts; an internal apocolypse, as extreme as that may sound. My stomach has been in constant knots since the news :(. What she keeps telling me is this: ""If we wander back to each other, then it's meant to be. And it will be a healthier and stronger relationship as a result."" 

EDIT: Thank you for your insights, redditors. This has really helped me put a lot of things into perspective, and has allowed me to reevaluate my feelings and actions. "
ix7pw,1,2011-07-22,I need debt/ job/ life advice.,IAmAThrowaway101,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ix7pw/i_need_debt_job_life_advice/,"I was hoping to get some advice. I’m in a situation that I don’t know how to get myself out of.

Here’s the story: I graduated 2 years ago with a bachelors degree in recording arts from a pretty great school. My long term career goal is to do sound for video games, maybe film, maybe some music, but games is more my passion. So, I go to this school which is a dream come true and drop 100 grand on a degree, I do well for the first time in my educational career. 100% attendance, course director awards, all that great stuff. 

As soon as I’m done with school I get a really killer (though unpaid) internship: I get to work with tons of indie artists recording multiple bands a day, some are big, some are small, but I really get the feel for working in a recording studio and I think I do well there. All the while I’m slowly dialing down my debt, paying 800 dollars a month so and draining all the savings I have left. After my internship there is no job available. 

Fuck. 

So, I move back to good ol’ ohio and end up living with my fiance in her parents basement. It’s a pretty sweet deal, they have a nice house and we have the basement to ourselves. They pay for EVERYTHING for both of us while she is in school. She won’t have student loans when she is done because her dad pays for everything outright (which is great. they pay for our gas, our food, our soda, for us to go out... so I’m only left with a few bills: my car, our phones, and my student loans (plus odds and ends like netflix and a gym membership). 

The problem I’m running into, though, is even though I live for free, have an amazing degree, I still barely make enough money to live. In fact, many months we go into the red. I’ve been working my ass off at a job that I LOVE but I don’t make any money at ($10 an hour). It’s an AMAZING company, a great atmosphere, products I’m proud of, and it is challenging, fast paced, and really right up my alley. 

Reddit, I come to you needing help. I’m 23 and I feel like i’ve really fucked up my life here. My fiance is still in school and when she gets out she will make probably $36,000 a year, and I can’t bring $12,000 to the table. I love my job and I honestly just don’t know where else I can go to make more. Do I stick it out, see if I can move up the corporate ladder (really hard to do in this company), or do I try to follow my passion, look for game audio jobs and move out, or do I see if I can find something local? I don’t even feel like there IS anything local where I can work. 

I feel pretty lost, desperate, and need some good advice. 


**tl;dr: recent graduate that is 100,000 dollars in debt and can’t make enough to pay to live even though I get room, board, gas, and food for free. Help!**"
ix0bc,11,2011-07-22,I'm so lost,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ix0bc/im_so_lost/,"Terrible that my first post on reddit is on /r/depression after lurking for nearly a year, but I guess want I really want is advice.  I'm so depressed that I really don't care anymore.

I have literally no idea what to do with my life.  Right now I work 7 days a week as a waiter in a restaurant getting paid near minimum wage.  I work lunch on weekdays and I come home completely exhausted and fall asleep only to wake up late in the evening sit on the computer for a couple hours reading reddit then fall back asleep again to wake up to the same routine.  I also work dinner on weekends so hanging out with the few friends I have on weekends is a no-go. I would ask for days off, but I have no idea what I’d be doing instead, probably sleeping, so I rational is that it’s better to work than not do anything.  I put myself in a crappy situation where I know the restaurant routine/menu inside-out that I feel like I'm indispensable, because there's literally no one to take my place if I leave.

I live at home and I’m dying to be completely independent from my parents.   I feel completely embarrassed that I’m still living at home after finishing college and ending up with a crappy job any high schooler can do.  I finished my degree in Materials Science Engineering.  The most niche engineering there is, and I’m starting to regret every second of it.  I know why I chose it, because I was a chemistry nerd in high school, it was my best subject.  Combine that with the fact that my Dad is a doctor and my mom is a nurse, I thought, 'hey, maybe this will set me up to work for a company that builds medical devices'.  But now I wish I had done a more mainstream engineering like chemical, electrical, or mechanical engineering, I see jobs available for those all the time.  I’ve been looking for a job for nearly one and a half years now.  I graduated Dec 2009 without any internship experience so it’s insanely hard to convince what little companies there are that hire materials engineers to hire me.  I’ve had one interview in the past two years and it happened just last week.  I found out that they didn’t want me a few days later.  Their main concern was that the time that I’ve been out of school would affect how much I remember – which is true to a point.  I seriously can barely remember what I’ve learned in college now that I’ve been out of it awhile.  It’s so ironic that I’ve spent so all this time trying to get into the industry and landing an interview to apply what I've learned in college, that I can’t because of the time I’ve spent searching to get into the industry and landing an interview to apply what I've learned in college.  This event is what finally broke me.  I search online for jobs, there is only one entry level job I feel I can apply to and I’m going to have to wait for weeks or months for a response to my application.  In the meantime, I’m in complete limbo living this day to day with nothing to look forward to or achievable goal in sight.  Sitting here watching the months pass as I get further and further away from my college graduation date.  I think I'd be able to hit the 2 year mark without an engineering job at this rate.  What a serious waste of time, I could've gained the amount of experience companies are looking for in these two years.

I regret having this degree.  I seriously love engineering.  The projects I worked on in college were fun, trying to how things worked.  They were challenging, like solving puzzles in a videogame.  The amount of satisfaction you get for figuring everything out or completing a porject gives you a sense of happiness.  I wish I could communicate to these companies how much harder I worked on my school projects than any member of my team.  I loved sitting in the library reading books after books and then ending up having to teach the rest of my teammates how the physics worked.  I even had to end up teaching my professors what I learned from what I read. But I think all the companies on my resume is the lack of real world work experience I have.  

I was so introverted in college, I'd rather sit at home and read a book than go out to the bars drinking with my classmates. Little did I know that that's how you meet people to network with.

A high salary is something that’s not on my mind at the moment.  Give me a wage/salary where I can stay alive and I’ll be satisfied with my life if I know that I’m actually having some type of impact on the world.  Hell, I’ll be happy working minimum wage, as long as I’m doing something more interesting than serving tables all day.

I have zero idea how to break into the field.  The internships I applied to told me they only want people still in school, so I have no idea how to get experience.  I applied through e-mail for volunteer work in the professional societies I’m a part of, and I’m not getting any responses back.  I can’t network because I really don’t know anyone I can contact in my field or really know how to randomly message people and tell them I’m looking for work.

I thought about going back to school, but I’m so dirt poor that I seriously can’t afford it.  I’m starting to think that if I didn’t go to college at all and spend all that money, I’d be in a financially better situation than I am now.  I’m at a conundrum, if I go get a master’s degree, that will take 2 years out of my life and I even might end up in the same situation I’m in now.  My GPA isn’t stellar, only a 2.5.  Most master’s programs want a 3.0 GPA.  I wish I had known how much GPA mattered, I was too naïve in college.  The minimum you needed for a degree was a 2.0 GPA.  So my thought process during college was to just ‘get a degree, then get a job’.  I was so stupid and set my standards to that level. I could have easily gotten at 3.0 GPA and I just wish someone told me just how important that number was.  I don’t know about going for a master’s, I honestly would rather those two years be me doing actual work for a company.  The other option is to completely throw away my engineering education and start over in another major, I was thinking possibly in management since it appears that that skillset can be applied to anything in the business world.  But again, that’s four more years of school and a lot of money to spend on it again, by then I’ll be 29.  Such a far cry from my classmates who have graduated when they were 22 years old and started working right out of the gate.  That would put me 7 years behind, looking for a job.

I’d kill to get work in any field of engineering to get experience. I simply just don’t know how to get it and I’m so lost on what to do now.

Sorry if what I wrote above is in some incoherent order, I just wrote about things that came to mind."
iwxct,2,2011-07-22,I hate this.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/iwxct/i_hate_this/,"I'm 24m, she's 24f. Dated 1.5+ years.

I hate the fact that I wake up every single day since she broke up with me and feel like there's a hole in the universe that I'm being sucked into and cannot get out of. I hate the fact that I can never put my arm around her in my bed and kiss her neck and say goodnight and laugh about how her body produces the heat of the sun when she's under the covers again. I hate the fact that, when she had real feelings for me, she never wanted to open up with me about it. I hate the fact that I never opened up to her about them either because I was too emotionally immature. I hate how I was distant, and immature, and took her for granted and never once asked her ""hey, what's the matter?"" because of my denial. I hate how she emotionally checked out as a result without even a whimper. Without even a remark that she wanted me to step the fuck up if we wanted this to work out. I hate the fact that she was my best friend for years before we dated, and I hate how that will never return because I'll always just want her to be in love with me.

I hate how I acted with her, and how I never let her in, because I had barriers I didn't want to have, not with her, but couldn't avoid having. I hate how I would play videogames when she came over, or how I'd sometimes ignore her texts or calls because I was busy, rather than spending my time with the person I loved more than anybody else and truly showing her how I felt about her. I hate how I never made her feel like she was the most important person in the world to me, when that was the only thing I knew in my head she was, and how that hurt her and made her put her guard up. I hate how I was complacent the whole time, and never got it in my head that love is something you constantly work on, not something that just happens and continues without any investment.

I hate how she had photographs of her exes in her bedroom, and no photos of me. I hate how I never gave her a photo to replace them. I hate how she would speak of being married and having kids as if she was always planning on doing that with somebody other than me. As if I was always temporary. I hate how I never told her how much that hurt to hear when she spoke about it that way, so she assumed I was okay with it. I hate how much I miss her and want her back in my life. And I hate how she probably has already moved on, and no longer misses or cares about me anymore; that she's closed that chapter for good already and I'm still here knowing I wasn't finished, and I never wanted it to finish. I hate how she never once said she loved me.

I fucking hate this, I can't stand it. I've deleted her from everything, I've tried my best at cutting off contact, and I'm out doing new things and finding new jobs and trying to get an internship. But nothing works. I'm trying to grow, I'm trying really hard. I feel like an adult now, and that I was a kid only three short weeks ago. But I wake up every morning and just want her to call me or I just want to swing by her house whenever I'm driving near it, and I just want her to know that I'm better prepared now, she dated an incomplete version of myself, and that if she takes the risk with me again, I will be always be there for because I know now more than I ever did how I feel about her and how I can no longer be who I was and I can no longer be dismissive and inexpressive and unemotional. And I hate that as well, because it's a fantasy.

I just want to move on, but I also just have that empty feeling that moving on means her, a person I've been friends with since I was 19 and fell madly in love with and wanted to grow old with and have kids with, being deleted from my life, and that is a tough pill to swallow. It just seems like I'm confirming her belief that I just didn't care about her that much by going away now.

I just want to commiserate. I just feel like venting. I feel more fragile than I've ever felt and I've spent most of my life hiding my vulnerability and emotions to appear tough and it worked for most of my childhood, but now it's only hurting my relationships with people, and I want to try to pick up my shattered pieces and move along.

iwgaf,3,2011-07-21,"Anxiety, possibly depression, feeling stuck",IMightLikeTurtles,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/iwgaf/anxiety_possibly_depression_feeling_stuck/,"[Warning: long and rambling] 

I don't really know where to begin, but I guess I should start with some history. I went through a bad bout of depression a few years ago. Medication didn't help much and the last one made it so much worse that coming off of it was the beginning of getting away from the depression. I had an okay couple years after that, but last fall felt it creeping back up on me. I had done a group class on CBT techniques and it made it easy to notice when I was getting back into destructive thinking patterns. The problem was I recognized them but couldn't get rid of them. 

So I saw a doctor and told her I was worried about ""relapsing"". As a precaution she started me on Wellbutrin. Somehow I made it through my last year of college and graduated a few months ago. For the last few years all I have wanted was to be done school. I thought it would be a huge relief to be finished, but for some reason it wasn't. To an extent I feel I don't deserve the degree. I get by with a disgusting lack of effort and feel guilty for it, especially seeing my classmates working their asses off. Since graduating I have done absolutely nothing with my life and every day I feel worse because of it. 

I did have plans before I graduated that involved move out &gt; get job &gt; live happily ever after. But I got screwed over on the moving out (long story) and was left with finding a job. Despite interviewing for internships during school I am absolutely and completely terrified of everything to do with a new job: applying, interviewing, starting, meeting people, etc. This is what's eating at me the most lately, I will do anything to keep my mind off of it, but it's difficult.

Over the course of 2 months my doctor went from ""you might want to considering counselling in the distant future"", to ""I think you need it right now"" and gave me the number of an organization that does a lot of CBT. It's going on two weeks of waiting for calls back trying to set something up. (You'd think a place that deals with anxiety disorders would be a little better about that kind of thing, no?) 

I have convinced myself that counselling will help with the fear of getting a job and almost look forward to having someone to talk to about these things, but then two seconds later I'm freaking out over seeing a therapist. 

Just as I was ready to be done school a long time ago, I have been ready to move out of my parents' place for quite awhile. I will need a job first, but somehow the anxiety that comes from living at home (and it is indeed quite a bit) is not sufficient to kick my ass into gear on the job front. I am left everyday wondering what the hell is wrong with me. I don't think I'm truly depressed, I have been there before and this doesn't feel the same. 

In any case, just needed to get some of this stuff off my chest. I lurk on /r/depression a lot and think all you folks are awesome. "
ixkja,1,2011-07-23,"Went out on a limb and confronted girlfriend about some issues, wondering if I did the right thing.",dGhyb3dhd2F5,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/ixkja/went_out_on_a_limb_and_confronted_girlfriend/,"So I know I will get slammed for some of this but I will give it the full run down, but I will try and be brief.. but I  am sure that wont happen there is a tl;dr at the bottom…   
I have been with my girlfriend for 4 years and we live together.  We have a pretty good relationship most of the time but recently she was drifting away.  Things like our sex life got to be like she was just allowing me to have sex with her almost as if she felt obligated, and not into it at all.  She just graduated college and during her last semester she was interning full time as well as taking classes (as per her degree program)  her internship was in the best company in the world to work for in her field.  
She wasn’t talking to me about any of her feelings and they were just coming out passive aggressively, so I started to dig into her conversations with her friends.  I was reading her txt messages and facebook messages and found out that she was talking to her x boyfriend a lot. I met her when she was still dating him, but she was over the relationship- we started hooking up with the “no relationship” agreement… but it sort of came around that we were a pretty good match.  His name was in her phone under some girls name so she was obviously trying to hide it from me.  It actually took me a while to figure out who it was, but then I caught wind.  She had been talking to a few other people from back home that she knew and was saying some things that I found inappropriate for a relationship.  The other day I saw that she had texted someone from home that she has been friends for a while, and said something to the effect of “your new girlfriend is really great, our drunken mistakes need to be over”.  Usually when she goes out with this guy and his friends she gets quite intoxicated.  She sees them almost every time she goes home when I am not with her but never when I am with her.  I have always felt a little uncomfortable about this.   She was also talking to her friends about the fact that she is the queen of relationships that last too long and that she is scared that she is going to wake up one day with a ring on her finger from someone she is not in love with, and other general things like that to various people almost all of them from home.   So I am thinking that she is trying to find someone to be with that will allow her to do to me what she did to her X-BF which obviously scared me.  
So the other night she was finally hired for a full time job with this company, a job that she was also talking to her friends about not wanting… we went out to a nice dinner to celebrate, I bought the dinner and then we met some friends out at a bar and I bought all of the beer as well.  I have been supporting her financially with rent payments, food, entertainment, etc for 2 years so things started to really get to me.  I felt like I was being used and she was just staying with me for convenience to get this job… you know the whole 9.  So have for a couple weeks been passive aggressively been getting annoyed with her about little things. And then at the bar that night she was getting pretty flirty with other guys in the bar, and among other things that were happening, I sort of lost it.  I told her we had to go immediately, my friend was outside and we just left, I yelled at her because she was standing on a street corner where there were a bunch of people yelling and I just needed to get out.  She got really mad at me for yelling at her for no reason, but I still did not want to bring up what I knew.  After thinking about it for a while I decided it was time to put it all out there.  I said “I am going to ask you once, did you cheat on me”?  she obviously answered no… and followed up with “I have been defending the fact that I love you for 2 weeks now and I cant do it anymore, I don’t know where this is coming from blah blah you are an asshole and im mad at you.”  So I said give me your phone, told her what I knew and she immediately turned around.  She attemped to say “you went through my phone” and of course I rebutted with this is not about me… anyway I think I reacted well and took the path of “I love you and you are killing this relationship for yourself, and you need to actually talk to me about things”  In a more supportive “its ok” manner… we talked for a while but then went home and went to sleep as it was late.  
She went out of town today and I still realize that I don’t actually know if she cheated on me, which we obviously need to talk about.  She texted me today and said she was sorry for everything and that she loves me, I reiterated she needs to talk to me about these things and that relationships need to work… 
I just feel like a part of me bowed down too easily, we have been through a lot together and she needs to be supported as so many things are changing in her life right now, and I want to be with her…  but there were some really hurtful things going on there.  Did I do the right thing??? Or am I sabotaging the future by not allowing this to fully come out?
Tl;dr.. .read girlfriends txt messages, she said she didn’t want to be with me anymore, and with a friend from home said “our drunken mistakes have to be over, your new girlfriend is really nice”  I blew up and told her everything I knew, and think I may have been too nice about it that it may mess up the future for us.  We live together and have been talking about getting married.

ixfps,0,2011-07-23,Need wingman in NYC,EtherealOcean,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ixfps/need_wingman_in_nyc/,"Here's my situation: I'm a 21 year old intern living in NYC for the summer. I've never done anything with a girl (have had some opportunities but never with anyone I was attracted to). I don't really know anyone in the city, so I don't have anyone to go out with. I tried going out alone a few times and it just felt extremely awkward. 

What I'm basically looking for is just people to go out with who are also interested in picking up girls. I live in Union Square and there are tons of bars right outside my building that are jampacked with hot college girls at night. I've only got 3 weeks left before I have to leave the city, and I really don't want to blow what is prob my greatest opportunity at getting laid. What separates NYC from where I go to college is that 1. there's a lot more girls here and they're hotter 2. even if you fuck up and make a fool of yourself, you'll never see them again. 

I'm down for anything, not necessarily just Thur/Fri/Sat nights. I'd totally be down for daytime pickup on a Sunday afternoon in Central Park or after work on a Monday in SoHo or something like that. I'd really like to do something like what [these guys](http://www.youtube.com/user/SimplePickup) do. Imagine doing that in Times Square, even if you only got 1 number out of 10 approaches you'd still get like 15 numbers every 30 minutes. 

Anyways enough rambling for now. Let me know if you're in NYC and we'll go conquer the city!"

Their policy is that internships are essentially 3 month interviews.  If you do well, you get to come back as a full-time employee after you graduate and don't have to interview again.  I'm nearing the end of my internship, and my manager told me I will definitely be offered a full-time position.

Starting salary for an entry-level position for an SDE is ~$90k, plus some stock.

However, I'm afraid that if I go to work right out of college, life will become pointless, boring, and stagnant.  What's the point once you become comfortable in the position you are at in life?  Accepting the offer is probably the best career choice, but a big part of me is telling me I'd regret it.

Does anyone else feel this way?  Is there anything else to do in life besides accept a steady job?"

Girlfriend and I are both in college 21, been dating 8 months. Our relationship has been long distance over the summer she lives about 5 hours away. However we have seen each other 3 weekends over the couple of months. Everything was going good, ready to get back to school with her. Well she has a trip planned to California to visit a few friends and was staying with one of her best guy ""friends"", who is in the military and has been out of the country for 2 years. I am not a huge fan of him but, I don't want to be that boyfriend. The one who doesn't let her do something so I let it slide. She says don't worry everything is going to be ok. Trust is most important thing in a relationship for me I am not going to stop her. 

So having to both check out of our Apartments at school, we decide to meet up at the university and spend a day together. I had to change my checkout time so i borrow her phone (left mine b/c i was wearing a bathing suit) I come across some texts she send to this ""friend"" that included ""wish you were hear to lay my head on you"", ""miss you I want to cuddle and Sleep with you"". She came in I asked her what it was about she responded with shock and then said she was planning on resolving her feeling while she was out their??? What the hell thought we were dating? 

My reaction to hug her tell we had a good run and end the relationship right then and there. I just don't think I can be with someone who would do that behind my back. So in my view she damaged the trust and the relationship is over. 9 days with this guy and you are going to cuddle...hmmmm.

Then I had to drive my ass back home another 3 hours. 

BTW We both live on the east coast so cali is a long way. She gave it all up for nothing. 

Long Day

Just wondering how some of you viewed this.

**Update**: I talked to her on the phone and as you could imagine she was a complete wreck, she said it as an ""escape"" from her normal life and the stress of her full time internship and stressful life She said nothing was every going to happen. ""She would take it all back if she could"", ""I was the best boyfriend she could ever ask for"" ""She gave it up for nothing"""" I love you so much"". Admitted she has gone behind my back and lied etc etc. I suppose it would be the standard stuff someone would say when something like this has happened. It was a fairly sad conversation for me as I had to tell her that there is no going back. She did dig her own grave on this one. Her words cannot rebuild the trust. I said as much ""as it breaks my heart we have to move on its time for goodbye"" 

I left the conversation feeling a bit better about myself having my the choices I did. It's hard to hear someone you loved just devastated, no matter the reason

About the snooping, I am one of those guys who will leave his phone out unlocked because I have nothing to hide and I can count the times I have seen texts on her phone in any fashion on less than one hand. I just had an uneasy feeling about it. Yes it was hypocritical I was breaking her trust in a way. However me finding out I am the one just being paranoid would be far easier for me to live with than what resulted. I felt it was worth it if you guys can understand.

It was an Iphone so it took all of just me seeing her text message preview to justify my suspicion.

Next Friday I'll see my ex for the first time since we parted ways in Wyoming.  Quick backstory so you understand where things left off.  We were together for a year, things started going downhill. in March I initiated a breakup, believing we were incompatible, didn't get each other, and couldn't fulfill each other's needs.  He was devastated, and after about a week and some talking, we decided to give it another go.  I always hoped I could get over my lingering issues.  We planned a month long cross country road trip in June after graduating from college.  After we re-united, things were better but they started going downhill again, but we fought it.  We got jobs at the same company (we met last summer as interns) and planned on moving in together when we relocated.  A week before graduation and our trip start, he told me he cheated on me the week prior with his best friend's girlfriend.  He says she got him drunk and he lost control of the situation (don't get me started).  I was stuck with a planned and partially paid for road trip and decided that we (I) could get through this, and the trip would bring us closer.  Well, we fought on the entire trip.  I grew increasingly miserable in the relationship and after another argument, I decided we needed to call it quits.  The day before we were supposed to drive back to NY state.  I just couldn't hold it in anymore.  Initially we decided we could do the drive together, and then he chickened out and flew home, making me drive back by myself.  We agreed before the trip that we would split it 50/50.  He then tells me he thinks I should pay for any expenses incurred during the time we saw/spent with my family, saying that was my part of the trip ($400 he pulled from thin air).  This felt like ""pain and suffering money"", very divorce like.  After being empowered by my mom and friends, I told him I would not pay him extra money.  After that discussion he unfriended me from facebook and we haven't had contact since.

**TL;DR: 1 year relationship, lingering issues came to a head on the last leg of our month long cross country trip (issues that should have been addressed long before, and I couldn't get over him cheating on me), he flew home and made me drive, then wanted extra money for ""my part of the trip"" when we visited family, unfriended me from facebook after I told him no to the extra money, no contact since.** 

So we are starting work at the same company and will see each other for 5 weeks during training.  The first interaction will likely happen this coming Friday.  I found out from our shared Google calendar that he's already started dating.  This has made me resent him and a lot of the things he said to me as we talked a lot during the break up process.  We are just outside the 1 month mark of being broken up.  Compounded with how he acted about money and un-friending me, I just don't know how to be...nice to him.  I broke up with him because we didn't have a lot in common, and that's going to be a big factor in finding any small talk.

Blah blah blah, I'm rambling, I'm sorry.  How do I make this less awkward for myself?  I can picture how he's going to approach the situation.  We don't have a lot to talk about and I really just don't want anything to do with him at this point.  Feel free to make me explain myself, explain more, etc. "

I just got accepted for an internship and will be leaving for Boston in the next week or two.

I just want to get to know some people to meet, maybe show me around and have a good time with.

If you are afraid of me being a creep, socially inept or something else, we could ""meet"" on skype first. :)

Also any recommendations on where to go on a friday/saturday night for me (being below the legal drinking age) would be welcome.

Besides going to bars/clubs I really enjoy ballroom dancing. (which might be a bit exotic) any good places to go dancing?

ps: As I am staying than just some weeks, are there any cheap gyms you could recommend?

*edit:* I knew the day would come that I would regret my childish Username -.-

Update: It will take two more weeks until I will get to Boston. I will try to reach everybody in this thread when I get there. Really looking forward to finally meeting some redditors. (There seem to be none in Germany)

Update 2: I rescheduled my flight so I will come over next week.

Hi Reddit,

I'm a long time lurker and first time poster.  A friend of mine recently found a kitten living under her porch.  He had been there for a few days, and she had been bringing him food and water before she finally trapped him and brought him inside her house.  After a day of having the kitten locked up in the bathroom, her parents said it had to go.  Not wanting to see him go to a shelter, I offered to take him in until we could find a suitable home.  I had a few friends come look at the him, and they all just agreed that he ""needs to see a vet"", but no one was willing to take him.  When I first took him in about a week ago, he was extremely lethargic.  A decent sized portion of his tail is also scabbed/looks like it may be broken.  Over the past week, he has become a lot more playful and I have grown quite attached to him.  I do know, however, that he needs veterinary help ASAP, so I am taking him tomorrow.

I am in college and working a summer internship in Chicago which will only last a few more weeks.  If anyone from reddit could spare a few bucks, myself and especially Paul would be very grateful!  Please note I have explored low-income veterinary assistance, and I do not qualify as I am not on any sort of government aid.  There is another animal shelter around here called PAWS that offers low-income vet help, but they require the cat to be neutered before they do anything, and Paul is definitely not old enough.

I setup a page on ChipIn if anyone can help.  If there are any excess funds leftover, they will be going to food/litter/toys for him.  Here is the link: [http://helppaulstail.chipin.com/paul-the-kitten](http://helppaulstail.chipin.com/paul-the-kitten)

izom7,1,2011-07-25,Recent Graduate from Queen's Commerce Looking for some Advice and Help.,Senator_Palpatine,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/izom7/recent_graduate_from_queens_commerce_looking_for/,"So I know that this is not r/forhire but I have been lurking r/canada for awhile and thought I might have better luck here (being Canadian and all)! 

As stated earlier I am a recent graduate from Queen's University and I have my BComm. I have been looking for jobs for the past 6 months in Marketing and Sales. Ideally I would like to get into the CPG (consumer package goods - P&amp;G, Unilever, Kraft, J&amp;J, etc.) industry as that is where my passion lies. 

The issue I have been having is three fold:

1) The market is not where it once was, so a lot of firms are a) not hiring or b) hiring internally for the positions I want - even though I want an entry level job. 

2) I seem to be lacking an ""in"" in many of these companies. I have done TONS of networking and keep up to date with people that I have met but none of that seems to be paying off. They always say that the job goes to somebody internally. 

3) Firms are taking advantage of the recession and recent graduates. Not cool. I have got offers from a few firms but they have all been terrible. One was for a salary of $26,000 a year - no benefits. Two others were 100% commission - no benefits. The list goes on. All of these have also been in industries/firms I have not been interested in as well. Perhaps I am being picky? But I need something that I can live off of. 

I have a lot of work experience with some overlap with the jobs I am looking into. I worked as a sales representative for a summer and I have worked as a government intern in Toronto (where I live). My roles were both in PR and in marketing. I have additional qualifications as I am a summer camp manager (I do pay roll, training, PR, staffing, and everyday running of the camp) and I also was heavily involved in extracurriculars while at school.

Anyway, I guess I went on a tangent there but I am wondering if anyone has any advice or can help a recent graduate out? I am willing to move to (almost) anywhere in Canada for a job in the CPG industry and am even willing to volunteer for a few months to see how it works out. 

I know that redditors are predominately in computer related fields but I am hoping somebody can help a fellow Canadian out. I got bills to pay and my summer job is just that - a summer job.

I bought my own computer, broke it, fixed it, broke it, fixed it again, played around with weird software and strange OS's, made a hackintosh and all that good shit. I never had ANY question what I was going to go into - obviously computer science was my destined path. I'm going to school for (you guessed it) computer science and I'm doing fan-fucking-tastic. I have a 3.8 GPA after two years of university and I see no reason why this positive trend will not continue. Another part of my school is that we do formal co-ops or internships for six month sprints, so I started my first internship a few weeks ago at a very reputable publicly funded defense contracting company (I suppose my far left politics should have stopped this but they didn't). Everybody is incredibly kind, the hours are lenient (40 hours a week, everything else is up to you). The campus is gorgeous, the people are smart etc etc. And oh my goodness. I FUCKING HATE IT. I HATE WORKING SO GOD DAMNED FUCKING MUCH. I wake up in the morning, drive forty fucking minutes to work, sit down, and realize that I can't leave this place for EIGHT FUCKING HOURS. The worst part is that I do MAYBE two hours of work a day - MAYBE. And i'd feel pretty bad about that, BUT SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE. NOBODY works even CLOSE to 8 hours during the work day. In that case, WHY THE FUCK CANT I JUST WORK FOR TWO HOURS THEN LEAVE? FUCK. I'm happy for literally an hour and half during my weekdays - 4 pm when I leave until 5 30 when I start thinking about the next fucking day where I have to do it all over again. I thought I liked programming but god fucking dammit, all I ever do is inherit obscure-as-fuck code from people that ALSO don't give a shit about their jobs. This shit is fucking mumbo jumbo. I feel like I've been taught to write literature at a middle school level (not very well, mind you) but have received childrens books to edit. And I don't mean this shit is easy, it's just absolutely horrid. I could stare at this cluster-fuck of code for a month and still have NO FUCKING IDEA what's going on. Maybe I'm just no good at programming and all that shit, but god dammit. God fucking dammit. I just don't understand. This place is supposed to be a top 20 or 50 or whatever tech places to work, but everybody still looks like a fucking living corpse. You can SEE in EVERYBODYS EYES that they HATE THIS SHIT. If this is supposed to be one of the good places, then what the FUCK are the bad places like? AND THE FUCKING CORPORATE ATMOSPHERE! Jesus, you can't offend ANYBODY. ALL JOKES are distasteful. Sarcasm is the devil. Fucking hell, is this what the next 40 years of my life are going to be like? No wonder there are so many fucking alcoholics around here. Why wouldn't you pick up an addiction if this is your life? I wake up miserable at the prospect of going to work, sit miserably at my desk for eight hours, then pretty soon I have to start the whole process over again. I get home around 5, literally collapse on the couch or my bed for an hour or so, maybe listening to some music just to unwind. Then I watch a tv show or something along those lines and eat dinner. By now it's around 7. Then I do what I actually enjoy, play video games for a couple hours, then go to bed. This is horrible. I'm not blaming everyone else for my misery (am I?) but god damn. God fucking damn. Why would you EVER choose this for yourself? WHY AM I CHOOSING THIS FOR MYSELF?!

I am a 24/f currently with 28/m. We've been together just over 5 years, living together for the past 3 and half or so, got engaged last October with no definite future plans. Generally speaking, things have been good. We don't fight about anything serious, minus ""hey you need to do the dishes this time, help me with the chores, don't buy a motorcycle, yadda yadda yadda."" The past couple of weeks I was feeling very depressed. I wasn't sure if my problem was within our relationship or if it was with me. I currently work full time in a restaurant, go to school full time, and have another part time job on the side, so needless to say, I'm always very busy and stressed out a lot of the time. I just finished my schooling recently and have now entered ""the real world"" and it's sent my brain and emotions for a jolt. I've become very anxious and worried about the future and wasn't sure why I was so unhappy with my life. After a bad night I joined an online dating website expecting nothing. Just wanted to find a friend and talk, I wasn't interested in starting a new relationship with anyone. I started talking to another guy and I felt like we hit it off pretty well, and we met in person. From the get go I told him I was with my fiance and didn't want anything other than some advice and someone to talk to, and we kept things that way. I told him I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay in my relationship because I was really unhappy, that I didn't know what I wanted, and that I felt like maybe I should have some time on my own. I liked the guy, but I sort of jumped from relationship to relationship previously and wasn't looking to do that again. Since we've met, my fiance and I have been each other's worlds. We're best friends, we're attached at the hip, we do everything together. I wasn't sure if we needed a break or not, or if I wanted to pursue other people. I was curious to see if the grass was greener on the other side but didn't want to destroy 5 years of a relationship for something unknown. I guess I was just kind of wishing for a Plan B if one or the other didn't work out. Which was obviously very selfish of me and manipulative.

A little back story: My parents were also very manipulative and fucked me up good through most of my childhood and teenage years and I never really learned how to like myself or form substantial relationships with people. I always lied. About everything. All the time. I had some sort of traumatic experience happen when I was very young and I felt betrayed by my parents because they didn't acknowledge that it even occurred after I told them. From then on I was always trying to protect myself from getting hurt, by pushing people away, hurting those who loved me, and self-sabotaging any happiness. (I've unfortunately come to realize all these problems much later and after the fact.)

When my fiance and I first started dating very early into our relationship I left for university and sort of went crazy with this new freedom. I hooked up with a previous fling and didn't care about the consequences or how it would hurt my fiance and eventually myself. I was just looking for trouble. We decided to work things out after that incident since we both felt like there was a really deep connection and something worth fighting for. It's 5 years later and I feel like I did it again. The guy I met I barely knew, and wasn't sure if it was worth pursuing or not. I truly felt like he and I clicked, that we liked each other, that even after knowing him for a few weeks that maybe he sort of cared about me. If my fiance and I didn't work out, I wanted to see if this did. But I was probably just naive and stupid and then assumed that maybe he was just looking to get laid and would do or say anything to a vulnerable girl. I didn't know his honest intentions and sort of wish I had though. I guess it's hard for a liar to believe anything that anyone says. After talking with this guy, I came clean with my fiance about it all and of course shit hit the fan.

I told my fiance that we met, that nothing happened, that we just talked because I was unsure and unhappy with myself and didn't know what to do. I got yelled at and belittled and it really opened my eyes up to the situation. My fiance has done nothing but care for me and support me and I just took a huge shit on him. I treated him like he was worthless to me. He's put a roof over my head, he's put up with my antics, and has wanted nothing but the world for me. And I pissed on him. I lied and was sneaky and I didn't care about hurting him, and that makes me a worthless human being. I lied to the person who has put me above all else, and realizing that has been a huge wake up call. In his anger he's pulled all of my phone records after I told him I was deleting texts from the other guy, he's monitored my internet use and posted on my Facebook page that I'm a lying cheating whore for everyone to see. Also in his anger he's threatened to ruin my life and other future relationships that I plan to have if this one doesn't work out. We work in the same office and he said he would ruin me there and at my future internship. He said he'd even come into my other job and harass me everyday so that they would have to fire me. He's paid rent for the past 3 years since he makes more than I do, and we're both on the lease, he's threatened to sue me for 3 years worth of rent and said that he'll make me life a living hell. These things petrify me. I don't know if he's serious or not.

I assumed he was going to pack my shit then and there, but he didn't have the heart. He was afraid that if I wasn't here that night he was going to do something reckless and physically harm this other guy. I stayed that night to make sure no one got hurt. I don't know if staying is the best option right now. He's calmed down, but who knows what he'll do. I can understand that his whole world has come crashing down and he has no place and no one to turn to. I realized that I've messed up something I may never find again, that I've hurt the person that is and should be the most important to me. I can't fathom how badly I've hurt him....and I feel like shit.

To make matters worse, my coworkers and neighbors have tried to get themselves involved. I wanted a fresh start, to come clean and to be open and honest for once, but no matter what I say there's no validity. There's no truth. How can he trust me after I've betrayed him? We both love each other and want to fix this relationship, repair it, mend it....but is it too far gone? Since I've broken his trust and he's angry and upset, he hasn't eaten or slept for the past 3 days. I've wanted to stay at my parents' house but I'm afraid of what he might do. The previous few nights he has done nothing but drink and gone into a mania. He called the guy I met and threatened him on the phone. He keeps telling me that he is going to find him and do something drastic. I don't want anyone to get hurt. The person that I would normally run to for help and advice is the one that I'm scared for. He's hurt and angry and has said the same thing: that I'm the one he wants to go to, but that I'm the one who did him wrong. He had to come home from work today because he couldn't function. I've broken him. I'm not the same person to him anymore since I lied.

What do I do? I love him and in hindsight realize what I've done to hurt and wrong him. He's a good man, and a too forgiving one at that, and should have kicked me to the curb when I confessed everything. I've decided to see a counselor to try and fix my own problems. I want to understand why I self-sabotage, lie, and hurt the people I love and care about. Was this my cry for help? I don't know. He feels he can never trust me again and it tears me up inside seeing him hurt like this and knowing I'm the one who caused it. I want to see a couples counselor and try to resolve this issue, but is it too far gone? I didn't sleep with anyone, but I did see another guy behind his back, which is probably just as bad in this case. The way this relationship sounds is very abusive and controlling, and that he and I should probably split. I just don't know. It's hard when you love someone and they've been your entire world and then one day they're gone. I don't know how I could handle losing my best friend, roommate, and partner all at once. I'd be ultimately alone and that scares the shit out of me. Like I said, this whole situation is so immensely complicated and I have mixed emotions about everything. (The fact that he's threatened to ruin my life if I leave scares me the most, but it may just be an empty threat in his anger toward me, I'm unsure.) Right now he's calmed down, we're civil, but both really upset. No one's eating or sleeping and I've been crying my eyes out the past 3 days. Its been hard to function really. I want and plan to see a counselor and mend myself and this relationship. I just don't know what the right thing to do is.

Advice?

**tl;dr** I was unhappy in my 5-year relationship, unsure of what I wanted, and dated another guy behind my current SO's back. I lied to his face, but came clean (for once) and now he's hurt, can't look at me the same way, and I don't know if our relationship is worth saving."
j0sl5,9,2011-07-26,Tailoring a Suit Twice?,tehfluent,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/j0sl5/tailoring_a_suit_twice/,"I'm nearing the end of a long weight loss journey (~120 pounds lost, thus far), with a modest amount of weight left towards goal. This summer I intended to finish off strong and reach my goal of 175 pounds at 6'2 in time to purchase my first suit. I didn't particularly reach my goal (currently 195 pounds) yet I still need to purchase a suit by the second week in August. In August the suit will be used for a single presentation which concludes my summer corporate internship. The suit will again be used, much more regularly (I'm guessing five times a month), once classes start in September.

Therefore I have a decision to make, and require advice. I'd like my suit to fit well for my presentation in August (I'm guessing - rather hoping - that I'll weigh 190 pounds, 15 pounds towards goal) yet also fit well throughout the school year

1. Should I get the suit tailored to fit my body at 190 pounds, knowing full well that within no more than two months I'll reach my goal of 175? 
2. If I do proceed in getting the suit tailored for my presentation in August can I get it tailored again in early October to fit my new weight?
3. My understanding is that any suit can be tailored as long as it fits well in the shoulders. If I purchase the suit at 190 pounds can I presume that the suit will still fit well through the shoulders at 175 pounds?

Any other advice given my rather interesting predicament? This issue could have been solved had I managed to lose the last bit of weight from May to July as planned, but life had other plans."

j294q,2,2011-07-28,Maintaining my diet,patchesandpeaches,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/j294q/maintaining_my_diet/,"Hi there, first post to r/fitness, glad to be here :)

A little background info, I am:
6'1
175lbs
21 years old
About 20% bodyfat

I'm a fairly active person that eats relatively well.  I stick to whole foods typically and try to eat lots of veggies and protein while minimizing carbs.  I've counted calories in the past but don't currently.  

I've been exercising / lifting weights in some form for the last few years, though obviously nothing too intense or dedicated if I'm still at 20% bodyfat.  I'm not looking to get super jacked or anything, just a bit toned and to lead a healthy lifestyle.  

As of lately I've been doing P90x in my apartment, though I haven't stuck to the schedule, rather choosing to do it when it fits into my summer schedule.  I'm currently working an internship abroad and often traveling so the schedule has been a bit irregular, and I was also sick and took last week off entirely.  

Anyways, I find that when I workout I maintain a fantastic diet and eat as I should.  To the contrary when I take a day or two off I find myself stuffing my face with carbs, and on particularly bad days with sweets or ice cream.  Nothing to the extreme (way less than the typical American I'm sure) but noticeably worse than on days I work out.  I find myself thinking about how I didn't work out that day and it for some reason leads to poor eating.  Does anyone else get this?  What do you do to counteract it?  I realize the best answer is to work out every day so that I eat my best - I don't want to ""waste"" the workout by eating poorly - but with my busy schedule I often find it to not be possible.  

Also, does anyone have any experience with doing the P90x workout not according to the schedule as I am?  Am I cheating myself from doing it as I should?

Thanks!"

j3gss,7,2011-07-29,I just can't do it anymore.  Xpost from r/self,cannot_keep_doing_th,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/j3gss/i_just_cant_do_it_anymore_xpost_from_rself/,"Crossposting this from r/self.  I didn't know about this subreddit until someone suggested it.

Let's start just after high school. My parents are divorced, live with my mom, and she's a control freak. Won't co-sign my student loans unless I go to the school she wants me to, majoring in what she wants me to. Agreement is loans will be paid by family if I graduate. Leave school a year later depressed as hell. Come back, by luck (and displayed skills) get a job doing graphic design, what I really wanted to do. Do well with that, except the family keeps pressing me to go to college and take on massive debt, kick me out because I won't go to college (I already have a job in my field!!!! GAH!!!!). So I look at schools, find a decent one that's not too expensive. Mom starts talking to Art Institute, she buys their whole spiel hook, line, and sinker. This is in around 2000 and even then it was known the place is a scam. But again, won't co-sign student loans unless I go there. So I go ahead.

Art Institute is sooooooo bad. None of my teachers (I will not use the word professor for these people) work in the fields they're teaching, and are not teaching people what they need to know to get jobs. I can pretty much 'phone it in' and still get straight A's, but I don't, I work on getting a nice portfolio together. Roommate sells pot out of our dorm, we all get kicked out. Yay, now I need to find a house.
Oh, did I mention during this time my father has completely lost his mind (lost a lot of family in a short time), drinks waaaay too much, starts smoking crack, I get calls at 3am with him telling me he's got a gun in his mouth. Great way to stay focused in school.

So now a friend and I have an apartment, I'm six months (two quarters) from graduating, about to start my internship. Find out my dad lost his job, so I lose my housing loans. I find this out when eviction proceedings begin, so now I'm homeless going to college, finish out my current quarter, go through withdraw process so I can save my progress and come back later. Get a job washing dishes, get back on my feet, and a year later I try to go back to school. Except the Art institute constantly changes their curriculum, so they tell me my major basically doesn't exist anymore and I will have to redo everything except my gen-eds. FUCK THAT SHIT.

So I decide I'm going to just dive into this cooking thing. Turns out I have a knack for it, I'm really into science, so I understand why food works the way it does, and I did design for so long, so my plates look great. Slowly work my way up, until I get to sous chef. When I was a dishwasher I was hourly, $9/hr. Problem is, once you get to sous-chef, everybody wants you on salary. So they can work you into the ground for nothing. I'm working 80 hour weeks for $400. I made more money as a fucking dishwasher, and I now have way more responsibility. Whatever, I'll keep going, maybe it's better as an exec.

Oh, almost forgot this one. Sous chef at a popular restaurant, 'chef' is just the business owner who one day decided to put 'chef' in front of her name. I'm literally teaching my 'chef' how to make a vinaigrette and saute scallops. She goes on vacation to Spain for two weeks, in which time she raids the company account, I can't pay people (I'm managing while she's gone), I end up paying people out of my pay. She comes back, tells me she has this great gift for the favor, don't tell anyone, she doesn't want them to get jealous. That day she gives the head server (who did nothing) an extra $400. I get a $30 chef coat. FML.

So I just keep going, finally land an exec job, perfect concept for me. I find out later the original chef left after three weeks, wish I knew that first. My 'sous chef' has worked as a line cook something like three months, I'm teaching my 'sous chef' how to temp burgers. Whatever, fine, I'm getting good reviews, doing chef demos for promotion on my own time with my own money, and my costs are pretty low while putting out beautiful plates. Problem is, summer hits (summer here is completely dead) and he hasn't budgeted for it. Starts trying to cut back everyone's hours/pay. I'm working anywhere from 65-80 hours a week for $500 (oh, did I mention I worked 12-14 hours a day, 7 days a week for two months to get this kitchen trained and running smoothly?) and he starts trying to send me home early and cut my pay (what part of salary don't you get?!?!?! If I'm there I get paid for the day!!!). Turns it seems he really just wanted me train the 'sous chef' and push her up to chef (female chefs are all the rage right now, I've met lots of very talented female chefs, one my biggest influences was a female chef I worked under. But right now you don't even have to have a clue, just tits).
At that point, I'm 30, still have roommates, can't have a relationship because, where is there time for that shit?!?!

Anyway, decide I'm going to try a different scene. Friend/mentor had moved out to NM some time before, call him, get some work set up, he has a room I can use. I move out of my place, stay with my mom for two weeks, get ready to fly out. Turns out his buddy gets in a wreck, needs the room, I'm shit out of luck. Great. Now I'm stuck at my mom's house in the middle of nowhere without a car or job, this is pretty much exactly what I didn't want to happen, nightmare has come true. My mom is the type who will tell me to get a job, she'll help me get a ride to work, etc. except she can't ever be bothered to get off the fucking couch so I never get rides. Also, this is the burbs, if you're walking anywhere, you're immediately suspect, cops stop me all the time, also it's illegal to walk on the highway, and all the 'neighborhoods', if that's what you call them, are separated by highways. I end up getting a job in the city which requires me to walk three miles to the train, take a 45 minute train into work, and then reverse it after a twelve hour day. Except because where I live the trains don't run all night, so most of the time, I'm stuck at night trying to find a place to stay. People who I thought were my friends won't even let me sleep on their couch for six hours. It's not like I'm a bum, I have a fucking job, I just can't get home. Half the time (actually much more than half), I end up sleeping in the subway, or riding the bus all night, or just straight up out on the street.

Finally save enough money up to get a place in the city. Boss has another place they want to take up a notch, so I go over there, great success. Actually the only one of her three businesses that were making money, we were carrying the other two places. So she decides to shut it down. FML.

Now here I am, 32 years old, I have three roommates, I'm cooking at the worst place I have ever cooked in my career because I need a job, all I can get for work is three days, I make $180/wk. I won't even put this place on my resume, it's that bad. It will look really bad in light of the other places on my resume.


I really don't know what to do. I'm so fucking in debt because I never graduated so family won't help with that, I'll never be able to get a loan for anything. I can't get a proper over-the-table professional job because my debt always comes up. I can't go to another country because I have massive debt. My health has been getting worse and worse, I have constant anxiety attacks now, I have hard time even getting up in the morning. I haven't weighed myself in ages, but there's no way I'm breaking 120lbs. I can't even begin to try to take care of my health, because I don't get health insurance, I haven't had health insurance for ten fucking years. I used to have a great work ethic, but now I see that doesn't matter. I can't even bring myself to try anymore because I see it doesn't fucking matter. I'm at the end of my rope, and the only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is when my other friend's have done so, the effect it has on others. I don't want to do this anymore. I cannot do this anymore. I just fucking can't.

j3xin,22,2011-07-30,"I'm successful, yet miserable. Money and intelligence don't seem to save me.",__throw__away__,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/j3xin/im_successful_yet_miserable_money_and/,"Hi. I'm sorry if it's too long. There's a tl;dr at the bottom.

I'm 22 years old, male. I'm studying computer science at a well-known university, expected to finish next year (a 6 year degree). I am a paid teaching assistant at my university, and will work as an intern this winter at {a ridiculously large web-related company} in software engineering, in the US. 
You could say I'm successful. You could say I'm smart. You could also say I'm attractive (unfortunately I don't feel comfortable posting a picture of my face at the moment... hence the throw away).

For all of this, however, I'm extremely miserable. To start off, I'm not only a virgin - I've never really kissed a woman. I have the social skills of a three year old, and the relationship skills of a fetus. I do have people who I'd call (and who, in turn, would call me) ""friends"". They are mainly from university.

As a bit of background, my father was an incredibly egocentric sociopath, who regularly beat me. He's recently out of jail for armed robbery (he robbed a bookstore, only taking books. The bookstore was in front of a police department, clerk simply untied himself and shouted :|). Due to this, and the fact my mom worked ridiculous hours to support me and him, as a kid I didn't really receive affection, or learn how to show it. I do not know what is appropriate to do or even feel. I am, as is to be expected, an only child. My mother divorced him 10 years ago.

I was ""in love"" with a girl from school from the ages of 11 to 20. She turned out to be a lesbian. In her own words, the reason we never had a relationship (she knew how I felt, we were... let's say ""friends"") was because I could never show her any affection, and she needed that. I agree with her about me not showing affection. I was scared /shitless/. I planned, researched, calculated, hypothesized, but could never just do something about it. I felt far too much of a piece of shit to ever be looked at by her.

We're no longer in touch. She's been in a lesbian relationship for about a year now. In any case, since entering university, I've ""fooled around"" (in almost the most innocent sense of the expression) with a girl, a friend of mine. The extent of this has been drunk kissing of bodyparts and holding hands. She, in this time, has been with about 4-5 guys from university. Clearly I don't mean much to her, and to be honest I'm not that attracted physically to her, it's just the closeness and friendship. Also being honest, she's not that hot. Other people also have been with her due to closeness, I believe this effect is called ""CS goggles"".
In particular, I've just come back from a night out with her and some friends. Scumbag guy got her high and drunk and made out with her. Oh well. That's not a card I'm willing to go low enough to play. This has, however, made me ponder my situation a bit more seriously, and acted as a trigger for this post.

On a more-serious-sounding note, I was inappropriately touched several times when I was young (say 8), by a family friend (50ish years old). He called them ""massages"". He stopped once he asked me if I was uncomfortable with these ""massages"" (where he would start on my back, and go down to my butt. I've unfortunately blocked away most of what happened, but there was never any penetration or much less - it was just inappropriate touching), and I answered ""yes"". Seen him very rarely since. I don't think this affected me much... but it might've.

I've been in therapy for the past decade. Improved academically and professionally, yet more miserable than ever socially and affectively. I seriously feel like crying whenever I'm around my happy friends. I will probably earn more money than anyone I know. I am aware that I will, in all likelihood, never lack food or shelter. I'm also aware, though this took me a while to accept, that I am in fact smarter than a large majority of people I know.

And yet, I feel like killing myself whenever I realize the pitiable state of my life. I would trade lives _in a fucking heartbeat_ with any semi-moron who has had, at my age, several relationships. Neither money nor success is comforting, to me. I feel incredibly alone, and worse, I feel like I'll always be this way. Yes yes, ""forever alone"". I think by induction, however, I might be able to give some weight to my ""forever alone"" label. Without the needed affection and social tools, I don't see how I'm headed anywhere but to a loaded gun.


Oh, lastly, I'm pretty sure I'm not attracted to guys. I have literally asked myself the question and tried looking at guys differently (""hey, maybe that'll solve my issues?""), no dice. I genuinely feel sexual and mental attraction towards women, and only women so far. It'd have been so much easier if it were just ""oh, I see, I was gay and didn't realize it! Now I can stop being miserable!"".

* People of /r/depression, what should I do to gain the ability to display affection? I've been on several medications over the past decade, and on regular psychiatric treatment. No dice. I feel that, if I do not manage to find someone to love and who loves me back, basically to form a relationship, I will become a news article.

* I am perfectly willing to do things like take a sabbatical from university/working to improve my social life. I can very well afford to ""lose"" a year academically and professionally. If I need to, I'll sacrifice most of my academic and professional progress. I don't care much about it. I have lots of it. It won't save me.

* I have lied to all my ""friends"" about the exact aspects of my life that I find terribly embarrassing - my sexual life (or lack thereof) is one such case. The inappropriate touching is another. I think I know the answer to this but... I should, for the time being, not dump this on them, correct?

* I need to meet new people. People seem to have healthy relationships with people that they don't necessarily see every single waking hour. I'd like one of those. A normal, healthy relationship. Could you give me some advice on meeting new people? Is it a good idea to join a photography or painting class, for example?
I'm really not much into nightclubs... being there reminds me of how ridiculously out of place I am, and how this whole ""seduction game"" is something I'm entirely incapable of. It reminds me of the Colosseum.


That's it. I'm sorry if I typed too much... I tried to keep it down. If you need more info just ask, me and my fucking intellect will be up all night writing about algebraic graph theory and lightly pondering suicide.


tl;dr: Smart, successful, not unattractive, headed for wealth and professional accomplishments. Absolutely miserable, with semi-regular suicidal thoughts. Entirely unable to express affection or to even know what my feelings are in that area."
