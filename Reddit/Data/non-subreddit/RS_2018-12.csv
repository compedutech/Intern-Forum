a1yyxf,3,2018-11-30,Went to the doctor again today for my lower back pain. Still no answers to any of my questions.,auragoId,ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/a1yyxf/went_to_the_doctor_again_today_for_my_lower_back/,"I posted several days ago about how I was diagnosed with grade II spondylolisthesis, though I thought it was a herniated disc. In the last month or so, the pain has definitely reached to a level of uncomfortability right when I thought I had maintained it for a couple of months. 

I guess I'm just here to vent since I didn’t get any new answers to the questions I had for my doctor. I still can't take an MRI until later on this year (or even further, into January or February of 2019) and the longer this process plays out, the more I worry about permanent nerve damage, as my symptoms of spondylolisthesis are atypical (according to my doctor). I was just prescribed another anti-inflammatory again and I'm unsure if I should take it because of the side effects (it's Prednisolone, if anyone has any experience with it). I worry it may interfere with my schooling now that I'm approaching the end of the semester and I have loads of work to do in terms of group projects, exams, finals, and other loose ends. 

Overall, I'm just tired. I'm tired of my legs feeling numb when I sit/walk. I'm tired of my feet feeling tingly and/or losing feeling. I'm tired of my lower back pain. I'm tired of having mental breakdowns because I just want this pain to go away. I'm tired of sitting in class and feeling like my entire lower body is just ganging up against me. I'm a university student and it's so exhausting to have to worry about my lower back pain and leg/foot numbness while I'm still in school full time, ESPECIALLY now that it's finals season. I feel like my body can't keep up with the units I'm taking, the pressure of finding a job post-grad (because what if I have to get surgery and/or my health at that time prevents me from it?), my mental health, and my current internship job. It's hard because I'm away from home for college and all I want to do is be around my family and friends to support me, but I'm away with little support on my own.

Anyway, this is all to say that I'm exhausted and I really am just praying day by day that the pain goes away. If you've read my rant, thank you, and if you experience any type of chronic pain just know that I hear you. I hear you, I sympathize with you, and I hope we get better.

a1z59p,1,2018-11-30,"My Detox ""Experiment""",LadyKatie09,Lyme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyme/comments/a1z59p/my_detox_experiment/,"I have been sick for 4 years and started to learn how to detox about 6 months into the illness thanks to my lyme doc. For the next few years I relied on a variety of alka seltzer gold, epsom salt baths (a few times a week- depended?), parsley x3 a day, yaeyama chlorella in the late afternoon (2-3 pm). I was also an avid green tea drinker, made smoothies very often at home, drank lemon water AT LEAST once or twice during a day. I sometimes took activated charcoal at night depending on what was going on.

&amp;#x200B;

I was functional, but had issues with ear ringing, joint pain, some muscle pain. I had issues where I worked in a heavily and visibly black mold damaged office building on the beach (it was damaged from a hurricane). My condo was also damaged and my symptoms were severe in cycles. I quit that job and moved into a new condo and my symptoms almost immediately stopped coming in bad cycles. It kind of mellowed out. Still have frequent ear ringing, some joint and muscle pain. Functional.

&amp;#x200B;

I became personally skeptical about detoxing. I really wanted to see for myself what it was doing to my body, so I stopped all of the above mentioned methods that I used on a daily basis. I stopped in about June or July. The only natural detox method I did, if you want to consider it one, was I swam in the ocean several times because I live at the beach and swimming in the ocean always feels amazing... cept when its winter, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Cue lots of really intense stress. I always had some ""background EBV problems"" with lyme, but all of a sudden in about September I was bedridden and sleeping nonstop for a week. I went to my lyme doc and with my swollen lymph nodes and symptoms, he put me on valacyclovir which made me sleep for yet another week, but I got way better. Then all of a sudden I was hit with another kidney infection. I did a round of keflex that made my brain feel like it was on FIRE. My body was on fire. I picked up some alka seltzer gold and burbur-pinellas for the ABX which made me feel better, but I didn't continue it after the ABX. I STOPPED the valacyclovir because I was skeptical that it caused my kidney infection. unsure. Haven't been back on it.

&amp;#x200B;

So up to today, I am still having issues with EBV. The lymph nodes in my neck are always constantly swollen, I have occasional joint pain (several times a day usually?), sometimes muscle pain (x1 or none a day), ear ringing everyday, lymphs in the sides of my breasts are swollen, I have some memory issues, balance issues, I developed extreme dizzyness and wanting to pass out (sometimes multiple times a day as of recently, I've never had this issue before with lyme except for maybe when I first was sick).

&amp;#x200B;

I thought now would be a good time to go back onto a strong detox ""protocol"" because I have an intense semester of school coming up and an internship that I need to be in good shape for. My most severe symptom is the dizziness and wanting to pass out, which I absolutely cannot have for my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I drank some green tea in the AM and just took a cool epsom salt foot soak and I feel like hot garbage! But I also feel kind of calm. I feel hazy dizzy, sleepier (?), muscle twitching, discomfort, slight tingling in my body and off balance, my feet feel like they've been asleep and won't wake up, kind of having minor chest pains (probably inflammation related). I'm going to update this again with more info.

Will working as a laborer give me a greater appreciation for what's going on in the field or is it a waste of time?
a20nip,4872,2018-12-01,Tonight I was reminded of how people see me.,beautifulexistence,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/a20nip/tonight_i_was_reminded_of_how_people_see_me/,"I'm 30 and I work in a call center making 30k. For years I worked more hours making much less than this just to get by. I have my sights set on a job making 45k hopefully by next year. The last ten years have not been easy. I've been abused, harassed, threatened, had my wages stolen by employers, generally treated like garbage, and have had two serious mental breakdowns from stress. One of the worst things I've experienced is constant gaslighting. Being told my life can't be that bad or because I'm not working a ""real"" job and someone somewhere has it worse. And, of course, the isolation is horrible. Most middle-class people want nothing to do with someone in their mid-twenties who makes a low wage unless they're a student or an intern. I have been shamed and laughed at on dates for my job and mocked by exes' families. I began to lose friends the year I didn't go to college and everyone else did. At this point I have almost no one left except my family.

Most of the time I try not to compare myself to other people. I've been suicidal for most of my life. I consider any day I'm able to meet all of my goals a good day. I consider the fact that I've been working full stop since I turned 19 an accomplishment. I don't act impulsively or have any addictions. I don't even ""like"" to have ""fun"" the way most people do and try to spend the majority of my time working towards long-term goals. Going from being essentially homeless to owning a newer used car and being able to pay all of my bills on time (if not early) every month is a big deal to me and it took a long fucking time to get here.

My therapist and my boss are both younger than me. I try not to let that bother me either.

Today my boss and I were chatting. She made a comment about moving to Canada for health care (our health care doesn't cover a medication that is both necessary for her and very expensive). She then followed up by saying she was joking and had hope for our state following a few progressive (for us) measures passing in the recent mid-term. I said that I was glad that the minimum wage was finally being raised.

She said that she didn't believe in raising the minimum wage because she thought that people who make that much don't believe in bettering their lives or want to ""be"" anything. The ""minimum,"" she said, should be little enough that people feel ashamed to work that job, and that the ""better"" people won't be able to tolerate the shame for more than a year before looking for a ""real"" job.

People who work low wage jobs DO feel shame, though. Frequently, people kill themselves because they don't know a way out of poverty. I personally have the emotional and psychological scars to show that being poor has long-term effects and getting out of it is far from easy. I worked over 50 hours/week for over four years just to afford my rent. Then I lost my job and had to move back in with my parents. It took me three months to find a part-time job. Two years to find a better part-time job that I could walk to. A year to get a beater car. Two years to get a better beater car, though I didn't know it was a beater at the time. Two more years to get a newer used car after the last one died. I didn't qualify for it by myself so I had to purchase it with my brother. We have to wait a year to take him off the title so that he can get his own car.

I slept on my mom's couch for five years. My best friend died of cancer while I worked my butt off for $800/month three thousand miles away. I went to school when I could. I have a sleep disorder now and cry almost everyday. I don't want to be alive but I'm still here, at least for now. I try to remind myself that I've done the best I can and should be proud for that reason. I beat poverty. I did it by giving up almost everything most 20-somethings get to enjoy and working. I didn't party or date or get to have fun, even though I wanted to.

When someone younger than me who has never worked a minimum wage job tells me that people like me are losers, it hurts. It sucks to remember that this is how most people think, even if they don't say it out loud. I've heard it before and I'll hear it again and it will hurt every time.

I'm not going to self-harm tonight and I'm not going to cry all night either. I cried on my way home and now I'm going to get myself a small oreo mcflurry and watch something funny.

I hope you don't judge people unless you've shared their experiences. And if you do, then I hope you at least have the decency to keep your thoughts to yourself.

EDIT: Wow, I can't believe my post blew up like this! I just want to say thank you to everyone who offered words of encouragement. I also want to thank the individuals who gilded me! I definitely thought I'd wake up to maybe 50 karma at most and didn't expect this much validation. I'm still reeling from it.

I'm a little worried that my tone failed to convey a large part of what was on my mind last night in favor of emphasizing how hard I work toward success. While it's absolutely true that part of the reason I work my ass off is to eventually become successful (financially stable, happy, experienced at the things I choose to do--like writing!), what I really wanted to get across is that all human beings deserve dignity regardless of their station or ambitions. I truly believe that most of the toxic things we believe about lower class people were planted and fostered by those who already have more wealth and power than most of us could ever dream of. It upsets me to see people who used to be at the very bottom work their way up to a place of some esteem, only to turn their backs on everyone like them. A large part of my current success (if you could call it that) is tireless hard work. I am many people's go-to person for knowledge and assistance. However, an even bigger part of it is luck. I happened into my current position from a job in retail making $9/hour. Not many people go from 9/hour to 15/hour in a matter of months, so in that respect I was incredibly fortunate. Without that good fortune I would still be destroying my body for less than a living wage, working ten and twelve hour shifts on hard warehouse floors until I hurt too much to keep moving. I predict that my job will eventually become automated or outsourced. There are lots of people where I work who are older and were displaced from their careers by ageism. This is why we need a livable minimum wage and, eventually, a solution to automation in the form of a basic income.

I hear people complain all the time that ""I didn't get x, so neither should anyone else."" This way of thinking is counter-intuitive and counterproductive to our advancement as a society. It's also killing people. [Yes--actually killing them.](https://soapboxie.com/social-issues/Poverty-Kills-More-People-than-either-cancer-or-heart-disease)

Shout out to all the incredible people chasing their dreams despite wage slavery and class oppression! The only way for us to beat the mentality that there should be a timeline on our success and happiness is to defy it as often as possible. Start college at 40. Write a book at 50. And when people say ignorant shit, feel sorry for them. They're limiting their own growth by projecting timelines onto themselves and others, and you don't need to subject yourself to that or take any part in it. Cheers!"
a21hpd,1,2018-12-01,I was right.... but I still love her.,maxinami,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a21hpd/i_was_right_but_i_still_love_her/,"Everything is happening really fast and I don't know what to do, typically I would talk to my brother about stuff like this, but unfortunately hes not home. A little background to start us off.

&amp;#x200B;

August of last year I had just gotten out of a dead end relationship, you know the one's you know have been done for a while but don't realize until something super super major clicks. 

Anyway not long after that break up I meet this amazing girl, how we meet is a different story and you can probably find it if you search through my comment history, everything felt so amazing. I've had girlfriends before, but nobody like her. she didnt give me a false sense of confidence, I wanted to become better for her. I wanted us to grow up together. 

&amp;#x200B;

At about 9 months into our relationship she left for an internship lined up in Chicago, she would be gone for a month and back in California by September. Everything was going well and we decided to go to a music festival in LA, while we were there I noticed her taking pictures of herself and sending it to other people. After the festival I confronted her about it, she said she had made some friends in Chicago and wanted to show them. Now, mind you these were ugly style selfies you would send over snapchat; these were selfies of her trying to impress people. I ignored it for the night and went to sleep, in the morning I couldn't help myself so I checked her phone and was heartbroken to see that she was flirting with another guy she met in Chicago. When she woke up I asked her who it was without making a big scene, she denied it and said he was a friend. I checked her phone again later and she had deleted the fresh conversation, I waited until we got back to her dorm until i confronted her. She admitted that she had gone out on a few dates while she was there and we almost broke up that day. We smoothed everything out and continued to date for another three months

&amp;#x200B;

that brings us to today, one month after our one year anniversary. She's at a friends birthday parts when she texts me asking to talk. Of course I worry about her so I give her my full attention, after a few hours of discussion she reveals to me that I was right. She did cheat on me, she had sex with another guy (The Chicago guy) and had hidden it from me for the past three months.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so hurt all over again, I feel betrayed and used. I changed my entire life for this girl; all my dreams, all my behaviors. She's saying she telling me because shes tired of it eating away at her. That she's being more honest with me because I deserve that at the least. I just spent the last 30 half talking with her, telling her that she never loved me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that she sorry, I know that she wouldn't do it again, I know that if I end it know that it. But the thing is, I still love her. I still want to be with her and grow up with her, but I'd never look at her the same way again. I've been nervous about her being alone since Chicago and thats only gonna get worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

The stupid thing is, if one of my friends we're in my situation and asked my for advice I'd tell them to ditch her. That she already had a chance to confess and didnt take it, that shes the one that fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

But I cant do it, I still love her, and I think im going to for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I already know I should break up with her, but I dont want to.

Please help me out, tell me if i should give her another shot. and if not, how im gonna break up with her.  Im just so sad right now and typing this out really helped. for anyone who reads this, thank you.  


**TL;DR: Found out that girlfriend really did cheat on me three months after she did it. I know shes actually sorry and has a lot of growing up to do. I dont know if i should end it or hang around for a little longer.**

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE\* I really do hate the situation, but I still want the best for her. I trust her when she says she wants to change but I have also been working making sure i make decisions based on what i deserve. My blood is boiling and i just want to talk to her, but i ghosted everything and probably will for a few days. Please wish me luck, and thanks for reading such a long winded post"

Looks like everything is back on track. Adventuring parties now look more like organised digging crews, methodically mapping the labyrinthine tunnels and clearing out the debris. It was only because of this kind of careful, slow exploration the way even further down was finally found. It looked like nothing more than a slightly deeper than usual crack in the wall, but anything unusual down here was enough to be worth investigating. So after a few hours of pickaxing the crack was widened into an opening which led to a ramp down. This wasn't just a hidden passage though. It was deliberately sealed... from below. And the dull orange glow and mechanical hums coming from the depths weren't filling anyone with confidence.

The theme of this dungeon level is **benefits of games**. Tell the world about how a game had improved your real-life skills, knowledge, or life in general. 

You can request any number of games. First come - first served, aggregated by day. Starting the next day after the offer is posted, if you're the only person who requested a particular game, you get it and aren't eligible for any other games that day. If multiple eligible people request a game the winner is selected randomly. People who put some effort in their comment will have more weight in the selection. This repeats until all games are distributed. For Humble Bundle games, I will be sending gift links after receiving a response to my congratulatory DM. A few offers have multiple copies. Locked games will only be sent out after a significant delay, which is shortened when unlocked games get claimed."

Dr. Rodgers blinked a few times as the severity of her actions and her situation sunk in. She certainly didn't hit the alarm that set off the containment breach protocol, she was sure of that much.

Her training as a foundation researcher kicked in when she quickly scribbled down the idea of 'innate mind control' on a scrap piece of paper. Just in case she didn't make it out.

She turned on the monitors, not wanting to be stuck there alone with the sound of sexual hell on the other side of the door. Her guilt and some sense of morbid curiosity made her want to see how far this beast was reaching into the facility. The cameras all around the containment chamber were oddly dark, but not destroyed. It wasn't until she had switched to cameras far, far down the hall that she saw the shape of suckers grabbing the cameras to realize 5127 was stretching so much that it had already engulfed that wing of the facility. It was far worse than she could have ever imagined.

Dr. Rodgers turned on the audio in the cameras just for a moment, only to hear incredibly loud, slimy movement and the gutteral throat sounds of something being swallowed. She turned it off before her stomach could churn any more. She switched the cameras up a floor to see if 5127 had spread into the other levels.

Large, visibly throbbing tentacles were emerging from elevator shafts, stairwells, and vents. They squirmed through the halls, and occasionally one would got taut before pulling its victim into frame. Dr. Rodgers didn't have to turn on the microphone to know the woman was screaming for help as tentacles as thick as her thighs coiled up her arms and legs, and dragged her away. Her mouth was plugged as the woman was dragged into an elevator shaft. 

Other cameras showed similar fates, with tentacles sucking down body-shaped bulges, or men and women dragged out of their work stations and raped animalistically in the hall by 5127. She watched as her coworkers, people she knew as respectable people devoted to their work, be reduced to writhing outlines on a tentacle's throbbing girth. She would occasionally flick on the microphones on the cameras, only to hear her coworkers cry out for help before being silenced by slick, firm appendages violating their throats. It was horrible, it was savage, it was... an intoxicating watch. 

Dr. Rodgers found herself changing cameras to watch the coworkers she considered out of her league be trapped and ravaged by 5127, earning her brief flashes of what they wore under their conservative outfits before they, too, were submerged under the coils of the beast. She watched as a subject of one of her fantasies, a cute young researcher by the name of Dr. Green, was pulled by his ankle out of his office. She always had different plans for him during sleepless nights, but watching as he was forcibly disrobed was going to do just fine.

She watched the tentacles exposing his young, thin body as a hand drifted back into Rodgers' pants. Her hips wiggled in delight as she watched Green get pinned face down to the floor, his arms and legs bound in tight, thick coils. The mic was muted, but the sound of slimy, sexual hell on the other side of the observation room's blast doors made all the lewd sounds she needed. Her fingers found their way over her mound as she watched Green's thighs get squeezed by two already-leaking tentacles. She couldn't stifle a gasp when his face was slowly engulfed in a tentacle cocoon, his head wrapped up by five tentacles, with one clearly pressing into his lips. She slid a finger over the entrance to her dripping nethers, making her legs shudder in delight, as Green's throat was bulging from the tendril trying to impregnate his stomach. The way he trembled was so cute.

Dr. Rodgers wiggled her hips as she watched fleshy redness crawl under Green's clothes. Her lips parted in a sultry moan as she watched his shirt lift, exposing his chest that was covered in throbbing, slithery goodness. Her thighs squeezed her wandering hand when her coworker's erect cock was freed from his pants, only to be held and stroked by an even girthier tentacle. When the tentacles gripping his thighs plunged into his body, filling the speakers with the sounds of a thoroughly fucked coworker, Rodgers screamed out in ecstasy. Her juices spilled onto the ground as she came hard, her eyes glued on Green's eyes rolling into the back of his head as his stomach formed the outline of the tentacle impaling him. By the time she came down from her tremendous orgasm, Green's body was just an outline on the monsters tentacle, his twitching form sliding down the beast's length. Rodgers changed screens when he was out of sight without missing a beat.

Unlike the first time, Rodgers didn't move her hand from her soaked folds when she came to from her orgasm. She didn't feel as guilty for enjoying it as before. Maybe it was because of the circumstances, or she was still in shock for causing all this, or perhaps she's accepting her own sick fantasies and starting to truly revel in them. She changed her screen to one of the upper floor dorms, where tentacles were burrowed into the guard housing barracks. All they seemed to do was pulse, but with every movement she could make out the outlines of the lucky souls of those subjected to 5127's desires. She switched to another screen, where one of her interns was being held in the middle of the hall. A tentacle was latched onto her face, keeping her upright, and the appendage throbbed as it pushed it's inner monster member down her throat. Her body only occasionally spasmed, but was limp. Rodgers let out a whimper watching her be used as fuckmeat, but it didnt stop her other hand from wandering up her shirt, caressing her bosom and tugging on her nipple as though it was 5127 itself doing so.

She switched screens again as though she were merely channel surfing, quickly switching from scene to grotesque scene. She stopped when she found the perfect image five floors up on the senior researcher housing level, where the first tentacles were starting their hunt. She almost cried out in release watching one of the fatter tentacles drag out her colleague. The tentacle's tip, wide open and drooling, had a swarm of appendages reaching from its maw and constricting this voluptuous morsel named Dr. Ethyl. She and Rodgers were rivals in almost every way, and watching the doctor be forced down on all fours as her pear shaped body was explored by this disgusting  beast made Rodgers even hornier than before.

A twang of jealousy struck the voyeuristic researcher as she watched Ethyl thrash. The sight of a tentacle latching onto Ethyl's panicked face as slime matted her hair made Rodgers fill with envy. *She* wanted to know how it felt, to be trapped in the grip of a monster of love. Her fingers plunged deep into her pussy as Ethyl's pants were torn away and her ass cheeks were wrapped by the strong tendrils. Her mouth hung open with panting breaths at the sight of Ethyl's winking asshole and twitching cunt, the trapped doctor succumbing to the advances, all while Rodgers squeezed her breast as her fingers thrust in and out of her hole, aching for that to be herself in the monsters grasp. She neared her peak for the second time as two slimy tentacles stretched the holes of 5127's prey, making Ethyl's body bounce and squirm to the wild rhythm of the savage thrusts. As Rodgers watched the milk be sucked from Ethyls small breasts, the ensnared doctor finally tensed and squirted her girlcum over the tentacles raping her thick ass. Rodgers came alongside her, leaving the controls and screen in front of her sprayed in her love. 

While Ethyl was still being fucked into submission, Rodgers took a moment to catch her breath. She wanted, no, *needed* more. Her envy was unbearable as Ethyl's head was sucked into the tendril, and her desire for a proper, exciting release was getting so strong she was going go lose it. She stood, kicking off the pants and panties around her ankles, and walked to the bulkhead door that kept out the heaven of sexual desire. She could hear 5127 still slithering outside, its appendages exploring the door for a weakness. The doctors legs shook as she could feel her natural lubricant drip down her thighs, making her feel more impatient and horny to be taken and fucked by the minute. She stopped at a keypad, one which only someone with her level of clearance could access during a breach. She hovered her hand over the digits that would release the lockdown of that room. sensations of fear and excitement welled within her, and with a deep breath, she typed them in. The hiss of the doors releasing were her cue to return to her seat and wait for the beast, but as she was halfway there she heard the door and half open blast doors crash open, with her lustful fate on the other side."

a25gvq,4,2018-12-01,"Transition Difficulities in Norway (Horrible at TW at the moment, but mentions of abuse etc)",[deleted],asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/a25gvq/transition_difficulities_in_norway_horrible_at_tw/,"So the last few months have been pretty bad, 1year without a Psycologist apointment due to being regarded ""to healthy"" I guess that would have been fine for any other living human without these issues, but it also drives me into dysphoria, depression and so on, during the wait for HRT-SRS. which may or may not come.

&amp;#x200B;

We have one place in Norway who treats these kinds of things, Rikshospitalet. Thats it, they are the ONLY source for HRT and surgery in Norway. But lately im Loosing hope a bit, reading stuff Like a FtM who wont be allowed to transition just because His male picture dont fit the directive of their standards for transitioning. He wears a bit of makeup, and nail polish (now, reading this in the news, i dont have the full picture, so can just comment from one case said in news, as to thats what pressented) 

&amp;#x200B;

Me, on the other hand, have childhood, and mental issues, due to living 13 years of my life since 12 years old in complete shutdown, my mom went mental on me for finding out, disquising her Transphobia as ""you could be bullied"" and so on. now i know this is not transphobia to have those kinds of views.. But first time she found out i were trans ""what the fuck is wrong with you? are you sick in the head? do you want to talk with a shrink?"" were the first interaction i had IRL with people finding out. Used to steal some of my sisters clothes.. and this were ongoing the whole childhood untill 19years, she got abusive mentally, and physically treatening, and a few other things. which i wont go into details about.

&amp;#x200B;

This made me more or less shut down all ""apparances"" outwise to the world, trying to act masculin, but at the same time during this, i drove my mind nuts, felt like all these years just proved to myself more and more, how this could not just be an act, cause acting masculin, trying to keep masculine thought patterns just were off to me. When you doubt everything you are doing cause of this, and start hating on every act you do, you get a more clear mind of what is wrong. (at least for me) 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow back to topic: 

This is ""conserning"" the staff at this hospital, and they might not give HRT cause of that. saying that most people under this kind of childhood end up regretting the transition. i totally get that there is a chance that some people regret it, and kinda see their point as to it. But this is just terrible, and offputting. I dont have a shroud of doubt even to that im female. but this might end with rejection from Transitioning. Reading the story that a FtM gets rejected for using a few Feminine things like makeup etc. dont really help calm my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

as to what would happen if a rejection for it is given, there is a way of complaint through one instance, if that fails there is nothing. No other opinions. Either its to move from Norway, or just buying from thai sources of Phytoestrogen and hope that the Import - Export facilities take shipments for this stuff. as its illegal to import.  Im just at a loss of energy, waiting, as ive been telling my Psycologist that she needded to work on it from the begining when i got there (Juli 2016) were doing a Private Sexologist (august 2015)  (might seem strange, but were doing this for a bit first, away from hometown, and talked about these issues, and so on, untill one day i had a mental breakdown, due to a rather unplessant and dangerous living situation) 

&amp;#x200B;

When i got to the Psycologist, i asked her to take contakt with this place, get the papers etc that she had collected and so on, and gave her the notice of that she is quitting this place after the internship is done. said this to her about once everytime we met, and that there was an agreement that she would get it with my sexual therapist. This went on and on, the day came where she finally pulled her fingers out of her ass, But was to late(2017 summer somewhere), She had quit, and all that was left, were an short description, due to not being able to talk about that after her being done there. Asking for the papers myself would have been no issue if she had just told me that ""i wont ask now"" but instead i got ""I will, i just need time"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Seing other getting rejected is also perticularly hard, cause now im the impression that i need to be hyperfeminine at all times for a MtF, as the one other getting rejected were Masculine, but rather small parts of Femine ""accessories"". for the most part i feel this to be a very narrow mind of what it is to be either gender. As i know Males who do ballet(seen from some as feminine) and love dancing, use nail polish etc. I also know Females who hate being seen in dresses, never wear makeup, and do typical ""male"" stuff. There should be no Dead set to what it is to be male or female.

&amp;#x200B;

The definition on gender should not be rather or not you are hyper masculin, or hyper feminine, but the felt distress about being labeled the wrong one. and the part for getting help should not mean going off your way to be getting hormones etc. From black marked etc, cause Norway´s or any other country with same ""rules"" Cause a given % end up regretting.  Permanent changes come, but in the off case i switch my mind, which im 100% sertain i wont, should not limit me to unsafe HRT with home medications, bought from Pam on the black market (Made up scenario)

&amp;#x200B;

Would link the Case from the news, but it is in Norwegain, and i dont know if the news outlet lets other Countries open it. 

But the person who is having the monologue is rejected cause of not being ""stereotypicly"" male"

I don't think I've ever been as completely blank in an exam before. I am a computer engineering undergrad in my third year so zero finance experience. I thought I could take on level 1 part-time while doing my year long engineering internship 8 - 5. Turns out 1.5-2 hours of half ass study after work isn't enough. 

Not sure whether to resit in June or not. I will have one month between my engineering finals and the exam date where I can study all day. I'd guess I barely put in the recommended 300 hours but most of those were low quality. I was pretty much guessing for most of the exam. God damn. I'd wager I'd have to put in ~500 hours of focused high quality study to even have a chance of passing given my lack of a finance background. Pretty much everything other than Ethics, Quant and Economics were a nightmare, and even those three were probably quite poor.

a25ti5,365,2018-12-01,My [23F] roommate [18M] continues making fried chicken and it makes me very uncomfortable.,ballofsnowyoperas,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a25ti5/my_23f_roommate_18m_continues_making_fried/,"I live in staff housing at my job. My partner [31M] is a seasoned veteran at this job and it’s my first year here. We live with another couple, who are fine to live with, and our new roommate, the intern, “Louis” just moved in. 

At his last house, a couple months ago, Louis was making fried chicken and let the oil get too hot. It was on fire, and his other two roommates noticed it while his back was turned and jumped into action. One of them put water on the fire (stupid mistake obviously), and when it got worse she picked up the pan to take it outside and the oil splashed all over her arm, giving her third degree burns. She could have lost her hand. 

Since then, that girl has had to leave work and go home and see a burn specialist, and has been in excruciating pain. This was a traumatic thing for her, and Louis has not apologized for his fault in the matter, instead making jokes about it. And Louis has continued to make fried chicken. Every. Single. Night. It’s all he eats. He invited us over one night, made a HUGE mess of the kitchen, and produced bland fried chicken. Before we left, we asked if we could help him clean up, and he said “No, this is going to wait until tomorrow anyway.” This is a horrible idea because all the staff houses have serious mice issues. 

Last night was the night Louis moved in. We were talking with him about expectations for the house, specifically the fridge, and he mentioned he was going to have ingredients for fried chicken in there. My heart sank and I got really nervous. The kitchen is right below our bedroom. I am super nervous about another fire, especially as my partner and I are leaving on a long distance hike in February and we are leaving all our stuff in this house. I also work really hard to keep our kitchen clean and I really don’t want him to treat it the way I saw him treat his old kitchen. Our other two roommates are on vacation until January but I feel like they’re not going to be comfortable with this either. My partner doesn’t seem to care and seems to think I’m being mean. 

So I guess my question is: am I being mean? Am I being petty? Am I bitter that my friend got hurt and that Louis has not apologized? Should I just let the kid make his fried chicken? Or do I have a right to state that I’m feeling uncomfortable?

TL;DR - My new roommate almost burned his old house down making fried chicken and now that he’s moved into my house he wants to continue making fried chicken. Should I just let it go?

EDIT: important point, I learned yesterday that it was in fact Louis who put the water on the fire, not the housemate. She grabbed the closest fire extinguisher (there were 2 in the kitchen) but it turned out to be made for wood fires so that didn’t do much. She didn’t know about the second fire extinguisher and that’s when she decided to take the pan outside. So I understand why you all are saying the fire becoming worse is her fault when in actuality it is Louis’. I think we are going to get him an air fryer for Christmas. Excellent suggestion. 

EDIT 2: for all those asking why we are allowing Louis to move in, it is not up to us. We are a really small staff (fewer than 20 of us) and housing is very limited AND we live for free. We are not renting. Our bosses decided Louis should be in a coed house (he previously lived with two women) and since his old house is becoming used for a different purpose, he was told to move in with us. Not our decision, but I did make my worries known to my bosses. "

Hi dpp, I'm looking for someone to play a hypnosis rp. I love someone man or women to make me give then consent forever. Their slave. Their pet. Too many people try to turn me into a mindless obedient slave. That is no fun. I'm into obeying every command and instruction as if they're perfectly reasonable requests or stuff like that. Ideally the request tap into something about my character's personalty. Other kinks are public sex, pet play, daddy/mommy play, making me a nudist, corrupting a religious girl.

I love playing new scenarios so I would like you to send me the scene in your mind already. I will share some of the things I have been sent and liked. Don't think these are your choices. You can try, but I do love originality. What I would love to hear is twist on these or completely new ideas.

Also make sure to make your title related to your scene.

Your slut's daughter: While I was away for college, you hypnotized my mother to be your sex slave and wife. She was so lost on your spell that she never brought me up. Well now I'm back for summer. You have a nice nudist wife always ready for your biding. You are not going to let me get in the way of that. You may make me join.

Stuck out of my house: I lost my key. My thankfully I have the nicest of neighbors and he will let me stay till tomorrow morning. I don't know what he is planing thou. If he gets what he wants I will never be leaving. How could I leave my daddy after all.

Finding my friend: A friend of mine has disappeared. She wasn't kidnapped, she told me she was leaving, no explanation. After weeks of trying to reach out, she tells me to come over she has a new home. She would love for me to meet her master. I look up an address and see it is a mansion. I can't resist but to accept the invitation.

My new personal trainer: This is what I needed to do to lose weight. A pesonal trainer. You gave me a dvd to watch so I know what to do. I don't remember what was in it anymore, but since I did I eaten better and worked out everyday. It is like you put a spell on me. Today you are coming for our first one on one meeting. I'm so exited.

Free use internship: The guys in the company were getting too stressed till the boss decided to make one of the female employees into a free use slut with hypnosis. Of course the other girls were hypnotize to think this was okay. Slowly every hot female employee was turned. Now you need more. Help Wanted. I apply.

The perfect saleswoman: Sex sells after all. Your business is not doing to well, but you have a solution. Me. You have made me into your slave and I'm willing to do anything to sell your product.

Group orgy: This is the vague one. I won't play more than one character at the time. I will respond as whoever your character is paying the most attention at the time. We will both play the other girls and the crowd. Still your words are truth, so where will you do your orgy. Are you a teacher in an all girls school, are you in a first class plane ride, yoga class? Anywhere you want.

Everyone is welcomed. Men, woman and futa's. (I will only play a women or a futa). Will love to hear from all you lovely people.

Please, don't be scared to pm me all of today. Also if you have tried before don't be scared of trying again."
a26t55,177,2018-12-01,The Story of My Posture and How I've Made Vast Improvements (Detailed Guide with Progress Pics!),SideRetired,Posture,https://www.reddit.com/r/Posture/comments/a26t55/the_story_of_my_posture_and_how_ive_made_vast/,"Hi guys, I’ve been waiting for a long time to make a post like this—to share my experience with posture and everything that relates with it. This is probably going to be very long, but I would feel bad if I left anything out. To start, I’m a male (21) that had hunchback issues, forward head, APT, rounded shoulders, winged scapula, or any other major common postural issues. Awful posture is something my dad would constantly rag on me about for many years when I went to high school—which I completely ignored. I did not care for it and thought it was just some bullshit that he would constantly say. Guess that was my first mistake—listen to what your parents say lol. Anyways, I started noticing around the age of 18, that I looked different in clothes compared to people with even decent posture. This brought upon a slew of problems such as lack of confidence, anxiety, wearing clothes that would mask shitty posture, etc. I would start having awful back pain and headaches and such at such a young age that I was extremely dumbfounded. I wanted to change and found a ton of resources from Youtube, articles, various subreddits such as this and realized change was going to be hard but definitely doable. What always annoyed me was the lack of progress pics or “transformation” pictures. I was overweight at an earlier point in my life and always seeing progress photos would motivate me. This wasn’t the case for posture, it’s a whole different game. I wanted to prove to myself it was doable and set out doing multiple routines and consistently being aware of my posture (maybe a little too aware). Regardless, one thing I learned so far is that posture takes time, especially if it is in awful condition and that over time, you will see results, I promise. My postural problems were stemmed from YEARS of inactivity, consistently gaming without minding posture, sitting too much and keeping my shoulders slumped a bit forward in public to hide the fact that I was overweight. The first thing I recommend for anyone looking to improve posture is to lose some weight. You can definitely be a big overweight guy with good posture, but more often than not, it’s rare. Anyhow, I’m going to cover my routines, exercises, stretches for each issue that I had/have. I say “have,” because good posture is still a work in progress. There’s no way in hell I can say I have great posture yet, but it’s slowly getting there.

&amp;#x200B;

Progress Pics - Keep in mind that my posture today is nowhere near perfect, but it's definitely seen huge improvements and I'm still working towards the elusive ""perfect"" posture!

2 years ago: [Pic](https://imgur.com/a/kTYyK7y)

1.5 years ago: [Pic](https://imgur.com/a/ot2maWf)

7 months ago (got extremely lazy with posture and took a break, hence why not a crazy change): [Pic](https://imgur.com/a/rdGDvLN)

Recently (as of a couple weeks ago): [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/a/p0qMnDF), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/a/04NB8YF), [Pic 3](https://imgur.com/a/DaFEGsh)

Notice how quick the change gets from the last two progress pics. I really think it’s due from a heavy back workout regimen. I incorporated working out back over the last few months and it’s helped a ton. I’ll cover more of this when I talk about hunchback/kyphosis/rounding shoulders later in this.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting off, I was determined to fix my ugly forward head posture. Forward head is something I know occurred from years of craning my head playing games on a TV or sitting in an awful position at a desk working/gaming on the computer/phone. The following stretches and exercises I did are listed below. Keep in mind I made it a priority to try get a combination of exercises/stretches each night before I went to bed. It’s OK to skip sometimes, but persistency is key.

* Wall angels- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT\_dFRnmdGs&amp;index=23&amp;list=WL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT_dFRnmdGs&amp;index=23&amp;list=WL)
* Laying on a bed with head “dangling” of the end of bed for around 30 seconds (be a bit careful with this one). This one is easily the least stretch I did, but I’m including since I did do it at one point 
* Wall slides (this also helps with kyphosis/hunchback and bad shoulders imo)
* Chin tucks- Consistently making a “double chin” reinforced my dormant weak neck
* Lastly, be mindful with your forward head posture. I’ve read here before that you should keep your head up and pretend there’s a string attached from the top of your head holding it up. This works wonders when just standing or walking, or even when sitting.

Some great resources that I would reference and sprinkle here and there are included in YouTube videos. Check out AthleanX’s channel, he has a ton of postural videos and they’re all valid considering he’s a great physical therapist. Jeremy Ethier is another person that has recently emerged on the fitness front on Youtube that provides valuable postural tips. This is a great video on forward head posture: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQylqaCl8Zo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQylqaCl8Zo)

Keep in mind that a lot of postural exercise/stretches that target certain issues correlate and help other issues too. That’s the great thing about fixing posture, since fixing one problem starts improving others too.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I’m going tackle APT. This is a prevalent issue today and it definitely was/is a problem that I’m working on to this day. APT is the prime reason why people have that “sagged protruding stomach” even though they’re really not that fat. I do admit, this is one area that I put the least effort in, considering I really wanted to fix my upper body first. Regardless, I’ve seen improvements so I thought I might as well share. The number one thing that helps APT is working on your legs and core/glutes and hip flexors. Just squeezing your butt on the daily will help. Here are some of the stretches/exercises that I did and have been doing that works well.

* Glute bridges
* Lunges with or without dumbbells (make sure you get a good stretch here)
* Planks or any core exercises for that matter.
* Working out your legs. I use to shy away from compound exercises at the gym, but this has **by far** been the most effective way for me. Squatting heavy with good form will help tremendously. Strengthen your leg muscles and always remember to flex your legs when performing them. I’m probably going to mention this a lot, but building your body and adding muscle is the secret to fixing postural problems along with the side routine/stretches.

Again, utilize the previously mentioned YouTubers on their guides to fix APT, they’re very beneficial. And as always, be mindful of APT. Flex your glutes whenever possible, flex your cores, and try to “protrude” and move your hips forward to be in a good postural position for your lower body when standing (not too much to be in a posterior pelvic).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the biggest postural imbalance I wanted to correct was my hunchback which usually comes with a case of rounded forward shoulders. I personally had a small winged scapula problem too, which has gotten tremendously better. Back pains consistently arose from poor slouched posture which barely happens to me anymore. The biggest fix to rounded shoulders and hunchback IMO is to work on your back and strengthen the shit out of it, while simultaneously fixing your tight pec minors. I’ve done a **TON** of exercises and stretches that have all contributed to improvement. I’m not sure which are the best and which are the least important but I do know, the moment I started working out by back over the last 4 months, I’ve seen tremendous results. The upper body is crazy how every muscle kind of works together, and usually working on the back will help with everything else.

* **Deadlifts**\- This is an exercise I’ve always been hesitant with, since it’s such a complex movement that needs good form. Start light and work your way up. It’s an amazing back exercise that will impact you pretty quickly. And it works legs, which is a bonus.
* Wall Slides- A movement that could be done at home which can feel pretty intense after a decent number of sets if you have bad shoulders like me. One of the best simple movements you could do with nothing but yourself.
* Band Pull Aparts- A game changer to open up your tight chest. Alternatively, you can use a door frame and open up your chest with that method too.
* Scapular pushups- A great way to start mitigating scapular winging.
* **PULL-UPS**\- Quite possibly, the best way to start activating your serratus anterior, scapula and overall back. I couldn’t do a single pull-up for 20 years, and over the last 3 months, I can do them now. Work your way up if you can’t do pull-ups by doing negative pull-ups. Best part about pull-ups is you can get a pull up bar for your home so you can use it every day!
* Foam-Rolling- This one is interesting. I’m not sure how much it has helped me, but myofascial release is definitely a thing so I would recommend it. Really work the roller into your back and breathe.
* Using a lacrosse ball/tennis ball to loosen tight pecs/pec minors. I personally think this is a really important routine everyone should do. Tight pecs are a huge culprit of rounded shoulders.
* Shoulder dislocations- A little tricky to explain but works great with a stick/band. Refer to around 4 minutes in this video to understand (there’s other fantastic exercises for hunchback too here): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfSCZbb9MOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfSCZbb9MOY)
* Strengthen rhomboids and lats with rowing movement excercies and lat pulldowns respectively.
* **Facepulls-** This exercise is also huge, since it starts working your posterior deltoids and helps bring shoulders back.
* Personally, I had some left shoulder issues with a weak rotator cuff and strengthening the rotator cuff has helped my shoulders as well.
* **DO NOT sit slumped or walk slumped with your shoulders forward.** Walk and stand with authority with chest out and shoulders back. Might be tough to adjust to when beginning, but it gets natural as time goes on. It also will exude confidence eventually when you get comfortable.
* Try sleeping on your back. I think this one is the toughest, and I still struggle with it sometimes now, but it does make a difference. Don’t use massive pillows or super thick ones either. Sleeping on stomach is a huge no-go, something I did for so many years.

Some notes to keep in mind are again, **be mindful of your posture**. Don’t bring your shoulders forward and remember to walk with authority. When sitting, keep good back posture, especially when looking at screens. This is tough, since it can get painful sometimes during long sitting sessions, but take breaks and get up if you’re starting to get sore. When I worked this summer at an internship, standing desks were a thing, and they were game changing. Obviously, this might not be feasible for everyone, but do take breaks and stand up and walk, do a plank or something. **Avoid heavy chest exercises and pushing movements like bench press, overhead press, etc, if you have awful posture initially.** Ease into them lightly. I finally started getting back into benching after a long time, since my posture is getting a little better.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it, my journey so far into the world of posture. One of the most important things I’ve learned throughout the last couple years is that posture fixing is a damn grind. However, years (in my case, almost a decade) of bad posture can be corrected if you’re diligent. You’re not going to see results immediately, and that’s OK. But as long as you’re still going at it and working on it gradually, you’ll notice a difference. Keep in mind, my posture is still a work in progress, but I’m getting closer to my goals. Never realized how much good posture can alter your mood, boost confidence and just overall help you enjoy life more. Oh and a sidenote, avoid at all cost those things they call “posture back braces” or anything like that. I have one myself that I used for a week and realized that it can help make you look better for maybe an hour, but that’s about it. In the long-term, it’s not going to do shit and just probably keep those muscles even more dormant.

I’m not going to include a TLDR because if you’re serious enough to want to change your posture, a simple TLDR isn’t going to help. Although, I will say that building back muscle will certainly be a huge factor. Thanks for reading, and I hope that you got something out of this! Feel free to ask questions if you're unclear about something.

a272x9,31,2018-12-01,Just deleted my league of legends account [long winded story],davidjohnmeyer,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/a272x9/just_deleted_my_league_of_legends_account_long/,"As the title states, I've just deleted my League of Legends account. I changed the password, created a temporary email address and moved the account over to it. Its a service that deletes the email for you, so essentially unless I manage to guess the 20 character password I randomly typed, the account is unrecoverable. 

I've been meaning to quit this game for a long time. I'm 29 years old and have played since the middle of season 4. I was in the military at the time so I had a lot of free time. It was really fun for a while until it started to take over. I used to do so much more with my free time. But for a while now, league has completely dominated my life and thoughts. 

What's more is that I'm married, and have two kids. For a year or so my wife and I had an agreement, one hour (guaranteed) a day. That worked for a while until it became a burden on her and she asked me to either moderate or quit. I've ""quit"" probably 3 times in her eyes but have tried (and failed terribly) to quit on my own more than 20 times. It was just too easy to reinstall, and so I kept coming back. My family basically took a back seat and I would spend every moment that I wasn't around them living a second life, playing this game, watching videos, trying to plan how I could get better. On the outside, I'm a good son,  loving father, devoted husband, keeping my house and family in check and on track to a brighter future, but on the inside I feel sick and rotten for robbing the people closest to me of the benefit that my true nature and potential would be. 

League took bonding time away from my wife and kids, it killed any desire I had to follow passions and do the things I used to love such as reading, running, singing, and travelling. In school I went from an honor student to basically being okay if I just passed the class with a C. I saw the consequences which a direct effect on my future when I missed out on an internship at Intel because my GPA was .1 lower than the cutoff. Hell, just this morning my wife took the kids out to allow me time to study for my statistics final. And what did I do? I spent 3 hours playing league. After all of this, I started to believe that I really had no choice but to continue playing a game that I started to hate. I even fell into a depression for around a year, and am just starting to get over it (after some therapy). I'm really ashamed with myself that I have fought with this so long and that I let it get so bad. But I think I'm finally in a place to actually be done with this. I've never felt as strongly as I do right now about quitting for good. So I plan to ride that wave to a better place.

I struggle with an addictive personality, and there was a time around 2.5 years ago that I was fighting with my wife a lot about my alcohol consumption. With alcohol I learned a lot about how to hide it, and that ""skill"" was easy to adapt to league of legends as well. I ended up quitting alcohol and have been sober since, however, quitting league has been far more incredibly hard on me. I can't tell my wife all this because in doing so I would have to admit that I had been continuing to game for the past 6 months when she think I've been ""clean"". But I'm ready to move on with my life and take it in a better direction. I want to actually be the person that people think I am, and the father, son, and husband I was designed to be. For the first time in several years, I'm hopeful, I'm ready.  


Thanks for reading this, I know its long winded but I just had to get it down. If you've done or experienced something similar maybe some of you could share your story or thoughts? Feel free to leave a comment."
a279h7,0,2018-12-01,Hooked up with someone who's in an open relationship and need some boundaries!,Throwaway-69-420-xxx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a279h7/hooked_up_with_someone_whos_in_an_open/,"Hi everyone,

I (F 25) matched with this guy (M 25) on a dating app 2 years ago, when I was living in city A. We had interesting conversations but never ended up meeting up because we were ultimately looking for different things at the time- I'd recently gone through a bad breakup and wanted no-strings physical things, and he was in an open relationship and wanted more of a 'friends with benefits' situation. I never really thought twice about it- he seemed like a nice guy, but I'm trash at the 'sex friends' thing and would likely eventually want more than he could/is willing to give.

Fast forward to now, I've since moved to city B for grad school, about 2.5 hours away from city A. I'll be moving back to city A in May for my final internship of my grad program, which is 10 weeks long. I then hope to find a job in the area and stay in city A for a while. This past month, we matched again (he'd broke his phone previously and made a new account). He messaged me and said he was disappointed to lose my contact info, that it'd be great to hang out, some other flattering things, etc etc. I asked if he was still with his GF, and he said yes but that things weren't going great (I recognize this could be a lie to make me more willing to see him!)

We grabbed coffee, talked about the education system, sex, family, our lives now, etc, and I ended up going back to his place and sleeping with him. In short, it was fun, and he seemed to be as into me as I was into him. He offered to come visit in city B sometime, and I said I'll also be in town over winter break at some point if he'd want to hang out again.

I told him the next day via text that I was feeling weird. I told him I had a lot of fun, but also don't want to hang out again with him also being in a relationship. He said he'd contact me if something changed, and that we'd ""likely hang out again in May"" once Im back in city A. He said him and the girl have talked pretty extensively about breaking up, but that it's ""a lot to navigate"" since they share a lease and are just trying to get through the holidays at this point (I don't know the situation but sounds sketchy?).

My dumb ass texted him again last weekend (ugh) and we've been chit chatting over text since. At this point, this is driving me sort of crazy. I feel like I need to know more about what exactly his situation is, whether he's interested in ever having a monogamous relationship (what I'd want), etc. I have nothing to lose by asking, but I also don't want to be insanely pushy? What's going on in his relationship is none of my business, but he's also the one who's reaching out to someone while going through a messy breakup and likely doesn't wanna talk about it for fear of scaring me, or who knows what honestly. Should I just forget about it, or is there even a way to know whether this guy's being honest?? I don't even know if he's interested in dating, is only interested in a friendship with physical stuff,  etc. He said he's ""not looking for anything in particular"" but I feel that's kind of a cop-out! 

Tl;dr Im interested in someone who's in an open relationship, and am debating whether to ask more about what he's looking for, or just cut my losses and forget about it, lol. 

Thanks in advance!"
a27ue3,1,2018-12-01,Should I(19M) text my ex(19F) for proper closure?,throwawayaccbud,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a27ue3/should_i19m_text_my_ex19f_for_proper_closure/,"I recently got out of a 3 year relationship that started Junior year in high school and lasted until the summer before Sophomore year in college. We went to the same high school and started dating right around the start of Junior year, and somehow got accepted to great neighboring colleges. It was great until last summer when we were separated because of internships being in different parts of the country. The internship was a big commitment, and so was the relationship as she wanted me to make the time to visit her and spend time with her. I had to come out and work on weekends too because it was a part of my research project. So we couldn’t see each other the whole time, and it was kind of a “out of sight, out of mind” situation for us. Long distance relationships usually don’t work blah blah, you know how it goes. 

And eventually I told her that I cannot do both, and asked if she could wait until the summer is over, when we would be reunited. She agreed at first but with time this issue kept coming up. And so that’s how we decided to break up, and we did that through text. I texted her that I could not keep this up, and she sent a short reply along the lines of “I understand. Goodbye.” This was in July of this year, and I have not talked to her or seen her after that. And I am sure that this was our only issue. We were faithful to each other and were each other’s best friends. 

The other day one of my friends told me that they thought she was having a hard time and even made me the bad guy of her story, as she was saying those things on social media. Now I don’t mind if she’s saying bad things about me etc, I just want her to be happy. I had a hard time after the break up, and even though just today I started seeing someone, I understand that for her mental health, it might be best to make me the bad guy you know? I just want the best for her. I wish I could tell her that I want her to be happy and I want her to take only the good memories from our relationship. I wish I could tell her she’s not the bad guy in my story, and that I’m sorry this is the way our relationship turned out. 

I know that she’s still healing and that she might be and probably is in a different stage than I am. Is it a good idea of shoot her a text saying how I feel? Would it make her feel better and heal faster, or would it stir up negative emotions in her and work against my intentions?

Thank you for reading. "
a286zw,1,2018-12-01,Not sure what I (24M) should do about my mixed feelings for my girlfriend (25F).,blatantest_throwaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a286zw/not_sure_what_i_24m_should_do_about_my_mixed/,"I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible.

I’ve been dating my longtime girlfriend for almost 6 years since we met at the beginning of college. And for the most part, things have been great. She has a lot of traditional qualities and really chill go with the flow personality. We get along great and she understands me like no one else. The only problem is, prior to meeting her I was inexperienced with women, she was my first for everything. This always left me with burning “what-ifs” in my mind. Especially since
 my value and reciprocation from women has gone up significantly since I hit my 20’s. So needless to say I’ve had these doubts since 2014 minimum. I had to intern in a state far from where we lived, during the summer before senior year of college. We had to temporarily do long-distance, and through the duration we fought every. single. day. It got worse and worse, until it culminated with her trying to “trap” me. She sent me a text with a written note, where she requested that we take a break. And I willfully agreed to it, but then she said it was a loyalty test. She then proceeded to argue that “I needed to fight for this relationship. And I acted like I didn’t care.” amongst other things.

However, at the same time, my confidence was soaring through the roof. I met a great group of friends and a really great girl that summer. I know I shouldn’t have been flirting, but physically this girl was as beautiful as it gets. Her personality was good too, but retrospectively, its hard to really know someone in a few months. As the summer neared the end, we had an emotional breakthrough. I admitted I wished I wasn’t in a relationship so we could pursue something, and luckily she felt the same way. I agreed to break up with my gf and we’d see where things went, as we would try to do pseudo-long distance.

So I went back and did exactly that. The day I came home from the job I broke up with her over FaceTime. I never mentioned the other girl, only bringing up our fighting and growing apart. Things seem great right? New exciting girl in and crazy gf out. But as soon as I got back to college, my confidence sunk down to rock bottom.  I convinced myself, that a girl that looked like that, would never actually like me and that I’m not good enough. I fed myself a bunch of thoughts to make me bitter about her. I told her it wasn’t going to work out. And cut it there.

Afterwards, I went back to my old girlfriend. Somehow I convinced her to get back together with me. I didn’t bring up the new girl, which yes, I know is fucked up. I was able to have my cake and eat it too. But this set the scene for where I am now. That senior year, I was just super complacent, just doing all the things I used to do with my girlfriend. But I didn’t really care, I just fed myself the thought that “Everything is ok”. I wasn’t really happy but it was better than being alone. That year I just kept getting more and more depressed because the job search wasn’t working out and I was just talking to less of my friends. It felt like I was devolving into someone else.Long story short, after college ended I couldn’t find another job. So I had to permanently move to the state where I interned to work full-time. Since then, I’ve been lonely and somewhat depressed. In the past 2 years of being there, I haven’t really made any new friends and I’m slowly watching all my friendships back home decay. I’ve been doing long-distance which has been OK, because without my gf I’d be truly alone. This time we haven’t fought at all, due to the gravity of our breakup. We have plans to move in together in 6-8 months.

 All this pain, is multiplied, by the fact that the other girl is working in the same building as me. Due to circumstances, we have to see each other semi-frequently. It sucks that we generally avoid each other and our rare conversations are like pulling teeth out. It doubly makes me feel like shit that she seems to be killing it socially, while I’ve literally been a shut-in. It’s crazy how we were so close, and now we’re basically strangers. And it’s all my fault.

But after months of just hating myself and internalizing shit, I think I’ve finally reached my breaking point. From a mental health perspective, I’m slowly getting better. I’ve accepted that I don’t want to keep pretending that everything’s ok with my gf. But the opportunity cost of being forever alone is equally terrifying. To make matters worse she keeps bringing up our future. Her picture of our life is having a two family house, two kids, suburbia, etc. I pretty much don’t want any of this. I don’t wanna deal with the headaches of homeownership. As for kids, I feel like that’s something to address after I accomplish some of my dreams. The reality is, it seems she wants to get these into effect sooner rather than later. 

Everyone I ask says I’ll never find someone as loyal as her though. My girlfriend has put me as the focal point of her life. She puts all her interests aside for mine. As you could expect, this makes leaving her really difficult. I’ve got super comfortable with her outrageous agreeableness. Additionally, I have fears of meeting shitty women, cheaters, etc. I just can’t seem to take the plunge, and I’m just wondering at this point if I should give up. 

Any advice, Reddit? Should I stick it out with my gf because she’s willing to put her interests aside for mine? Am I in too deep? Or should I get my shit together, with the risk of being alone forever?"

What skills do you have to have and use in communication? Is the department good and does it get enough funding? Are there enough opportunities like internships available? 
I’ve heard WSU was good for communication but I live in Western Washington so I want to go somewhere far away enough to get away from home but not so far that it would be hard to get home. I don’t think I can/should go out of state, or anywhere more than 2 or so hours away. I also have the college bound scholarship that covers 4 years of tuition at a 4 year public university in state, and partially covers some private universities. 

CWU so far is my first choice, I’m also considering western but my GPA is 2.8 so I might not get in there, but I’ve taken advanced classes in high school and have a 1070 SAT score which I think is just good enough to get accepted into CWU. 

I visited CWU and WWU last year and felt more of a connection with CWU and it was sunny there as opposed to when I got back home it was raining. I’m also looking forward to going somewhere that actually has snow and not just rain, I’m pretty sure it was raining when I went to WWU.
 How are the dorms at CWU too? At least for freshmen. I’m considering trying to get into the honors program but it’s only a thought, I’ve always taken advanced classes but of course my GPA is low, mostly because for the past couple years I’ve had mental health issues. I really want to go here so I’m trying to find reasons to go rather than reasons to not go. 

I’m also considering doing something business related but that’s mostly because my parents want me to. I don’t know a lot about majors and minors but maybe I could do something business related as a minor? I suck at math and science, I’m only really good at English so I’m worried about business because I know some of it requires math. Some of my friends are taking an Econ class right now and they always talk about how hard it is. My parents want me to study something that will give me opportunities and a good career path but I also want to do something that I’m good at that interests me. 

I just want to go somewhere where I can be happy and successful as long as I work hard. Are there any work study opportunities? I know Ellensburg is a small town with not a lot to do that isn’t nature oriented but I mostly stay at home anyway so hopefully it’s not that bad. I like watching movies and hanging out with friends and online shopping is something I can get into, Seattle I know isn’t far away. I think Central will be good for me, but hopefully it doesn’t get tiring or boring after a couple years? I’ve been worried because I heard that CWU can be under funded and the acceptance rate is high so it’s not as prestigious as some other universities but hopefully that doesn’t make it a bad university. It’s not like I can get into much more selective universities anyway, but some of my more successful friends also want to go to CWU. Some of them want to go to eastern, but it doesn’t really interest me. If anyone knows more about western and can compare that to CWU that would help. I really hate rain though, and I’ve heard Ellensburg was sunnier, I could be wrong though. Thanks for any responses and for reading all of this, I know it’s a lot. 

I know the majority of the student body is white but hopefully I won’t feel too out of place, the high school I’m from is very diverse and liberal, and I have heard the farther east you go in Washington the more conservative it is which I’m a little worried about. "

I'm so sorry this is so long.

**Background:**

We've been dating for 6 years you guys, and have never had an issue with communication before. Prior to this fall, I was doing an internship abroad for a year so we were long distance. LDR was hard but we managed - we would FaceTime at least once everyday, even if it was for only 5 mins, and I don't think staying loyal was an issue for either of us. He visited me twice even though he's tight on cash, and my love for him during this time only grew.

He graduated from university in June (while I was gone, although I came back for it) with lots of debt and was unfortunately rejected from the professional schools he applied to. It was a sad and heartbreaking time for all of us, but the field and the schools he applied to are extremely competitive and it's completely normal for successful applicants to try multiple times before getting in. In fact, two of our closest friends who also graduated with him and applied also got rejected.

After he got over the initial disappointment, he seemed fine and him and his buddies were already planning all the things they'd do during his year off before applying again for this upcoming cycle (I am also applying this year fyi). He seems excited and is really trying to broaden his horizons and develop his character through various extracurriculars, and I couldn't be more proud of him! 

**Current situation:**

I got back from my internship this August and we got our first place together now that I have way more money. As I have no debt, I pay 70% of the rent/utilities and all groceries and living necessities, with him also paying for his car expenses and his phone plan. I don't think this a reason of contempt for him because we discussed all the numbers before, along with a 15 year plan. Living with him is great, but for the past 2ish months, he's become increasingly passive aggressive, and it feels like it's exclusively directed to me. Some days he's randomly surprising me with flowers or playing his guitar for me like when we were younger. Other days (more often) it's like he can't stand being in the same room as me and I have no idea why. I'll wake up to him fuming or just in a crappy mood and ask what's going on/say let's talk, and he'll say no everything is fine. 9/10 times this happens right before I leave for class so after asking twice, I'll just leave. A few days ago for example, he was pissed all morning and and just said it's nothing. After I got home, we fought and it was because I recycled his school agenda from last year. He got mad for not asking first because there was a Subway coupon in the back (btw I could go and get him one as our school has them every year). 

Yesterday we went out for lunch and he was in a good mood, so I tentatively brought up his recent behaviour. I tried my best not to sound accusatory or come across like I was trying to pick a fight. He blew up at me out of nowhere saying  I've stopped caring about him and that when things get bad I just leave. He said he loves me but deserves someone who won't go and will stay with him until he opens up. I explained that I'm trying to but I can't read his mind and I need him to talk to me. I asked what's really going on and he said there's no ""bigger problem""; he just needs me to be a better girlfriend. That was the end of that conversation, and he's barely said 2 words to me since.

It's gotten to the point where I've learnt to just drop things because he clearly doesn't want to talk about it, even after asking multiple times, and I don't have as much time as him currently and frankly, I'm stressed and tired too. I just feel so hopeless and I don't know what to do to fix our spiralling relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Lately, my boyfriend has been getting angry easily, but will always say everything's fine when I ask what's up. I finally brought it up and he says I need to be trying harder as a partner.**"

**About me:** I am in my junior year of college for Mechanical engineering. I plan on moving on after I get my bachelors to get a masters in engineering management. I do have an internship currently which doesn't allow for phones in the building so I wont be able to respond immediately all day every day.

I love to cook with my favorite recipes including: Pasta, homemade pizza, chili red, and rice. 

I also really like to play strategy, computer, and tabletop games. 

I love to watch anime. My favorites to watch are: Avatar the Last Airbender (it is an anime), Attack on Titan, Lupin III, Black clover, and I have started getting into Sword art online (don't judge please).


**Kinks:** I would prefer not to discuss kinks early on as I believe any relationship should be built on trust and understand and not just on kinks. However, I will forewarn you that I am into DDlg and a couple of dark kinks.

**About you:** I would love it if you were between 18 and 25, and you were either in school or working. "
a2aidz,1,2018-12-01,Canadian student going from a TN to J-1 for two internships,ImJustPro,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/a2aidz/canadian_student_going_from_a_tn_to_j1_for_two/,"Howdy,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Canadian university student who has been fortunate enough to land two offers for tech internships in the Bay Area, and I'm a little concerned about the visa situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Company 1) Sponsors a TN visa. This internship would be from January-April

Company 2) Sponsors a J-1 visa. This internship would be from June-August.

&amp;#x200B;

My main concerns are:

* Going from a TN to a J-1: My understanding is that your visas are cut as soon as you leave the company. Does this mean I should have no issue with applying for the J-1 immediately after (or possible before) the TN is completed?
* Company 2 is aware of the situation and said they may be able to transfer the TN visa from company 1, instead of sponsoring a J-1. I've [read](https://bdzlaw.com/change-or-addition-tn-employer/) that this is possible using [Form I-129](https://www.uscis.gov/i-129). Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm wondering if its easier to simply apply for the new J-1 visa instead of completing this form
* I've read [here](https://j1visa.state.gov/programs/intern/), for J-1 internship visas that the potential intern should be *enrolled in and pursuing studies at a foreign degree- or certificate-granting post-secondary academic institution outside the United States*. The way my school (and most Canadian schools, I think) works is by 3 semesters. Typically you study for the Fall/Winter and have the Summer off. In this case, for company 1, I would be skipping a semester (Winter) to do the internship. For company 2, I would be taking it during the summer which I normally have off anyway. I would then return to my studies in the Fall. I'm wondering what their definition of *enrollment* is for this? Am I eligible for the J-1 visa in the summer if I wasn't in school the previous semester because of company 1? Note that these internships were sought out personally and are not a part of a school co-op program.

&amp;#x200B;

I truly appreciate any advice or knowledge you may have. I'm considering seeing an immigration lawyer about it.

Thank you for your time!"

&amp;#x200B;

I am posting because I am under a lot of stress. I am a senior undergraduate physics major at a public school and I'm currently applying for grad schools. Monday was real weird because I met with one of my research advisors who is a senior scientist (pretty old. Think 60's) at a national lab and I've been working with him for about 1.5 years. I was mostly doing statistical analysis/ data analysis and everything was going pretty well until this summer. My advisor gave me a project to complete before he left for hip replacement surgery so he was out of work for a solid 1.5 months out of my 3 month summer project. While he was gone, I did my best to make this program work but it produced crap results. One week before he came back, he forgot to send off an email to a colleague to help supervise me. I met with his colleague but neither of us could figure out why this particular program was producing crap results. This project was observational astronomy and I have no experience in it so I didn't even know how to ask the correct questions in the beginning of the project. I stared at this for many hours and I would try to read scholarly articles about observational astronomy on the internet. My advisor returned and put me in touch with a colleague who suggested I code up a ""diagnostic"" program. By then, I only had about 2 weeks left in my internship. I couldn't complete it on time and he allowed me to continue working on the project throughout the Fall quarter. His colleagues would insist I follow their instructions to the teeth and my plots would come out wrong which frustrated everyone. I decided to take matters into my own hands and carefully read the papers they were referencing to. By this time, I began gaining more astronomy intuition for this project and realized that they gave me the wrong files to run my code. My code was running fine the whole time but I was given the wrong files. I finally had that break through about three weeks ago and I am currently finishing the original project. I am currently applying for graduate schools for astrophysics and my advisor wanted to talk to me in person after I asked him if he could write a letter of recommendation. I stressed to him that he really doesn't have to if he is so busy or does not want to. I was very hesitant to ask due to how slow my project was going. We met up and he said he was happy with my plots and happy that this project is making a lot of progress. Afterwards we got lunch and he said that he doesn't think that I am cut out for astronomy/astrophysics at a PhD level. I ""don't ask good enough questions that a scientist would ask"" and I will never ""be someone to solve impossible problems"". He said he was willing to write a letter of recommendation though but doesn't think I am good enough for a PhD program and said I should think about it more. He then said ""don't put too much weight on my opinion though."" I thanked him for his honesty and told him that I will get back to him later.  I don't know what to think at this point. I am currently finishing a first author paper for my research group at my university which is sort of related (computational astrophysics). My other research advisors at my university institution think that I am very ready and I have given many talks about my home institution research. I started my research at my institution by diving straight into the deep end. My university research advisor gave me guidance by providing textbooks, arxiv papers, asking the post-doc questions, etc and now I am publishing a first author paper. My university advisor says that I'm more than ready for a PhD program. I don't know what to think at this point. My national laboratory advisor provided very little structure and gave very little feedback to my work. I had to constantly guess whether he was happy with my work or progress. He would tell me to follow his instructions to the teeth and would get annoyed if I asked too many questions. But if I did follow his instructions to the teeth then he would also get annoyed that I don't ask any questions. I really don't know what to think at this point and I feel too stupid to even try a PhD program. My university advisors really want me to apply to places like Princeton, UC Irvine, etc for astrophysics but my national laboratory advisor says that I am not cut out for a PhD in any of those places. I know that I am not a genius so I need a bit more guidance than the average MIT or CalTech undergrad. I should have taken astronomy courses before taking up an observational astronomy project. I don't know... I want to take a gap year and find research under someone else but people say that if I apply next year and my national laboratory advisor isn't a letter of rec writer then that will be a big red flag. I feel very stuck. I am going to finish the project for my national laboratory advisor regardless because I need to prove that I can. Sorry for the wall of text."

Local is 93410     

I recently built a beast of a gaming and deep learning PC. Sadly, I can't afford to buy a higher refresh rate monitor to use it, and most of my deep learning now happens at work, where we use the company servers.    

Also, the GPU was bought directly from the NVIDIA gear store as I was working there. I've been playing Overwatch on it, and I'm downgrading because I need only 60fps(tank main D:). I bought it for 550 new(the founder's edition costs $100 more due to more premium parts, cooling, and imo better looks).
Most of the parts are new, except for the mobo+cpu that I bought from /r/hardwareswap. The GPU was bought in March, and was installed in September since I didn't have the rest of the parts and didn't have time to game during my internship.     

The CPU is an i5 6400 under a 212 evo and has never seen temps over 40C, and the GPU has only been gamed on for ~20 hours or so. Overwatch tank main with a 60Hz 1080p monitor :(.        
The mobo is a Z170 Gaming M5 with 2x PCIe16x slots and SLI enabled. Also, 2 m.2 slots.      
I'm flexible on someone buying the peripherals as I could probably still use them, but I'm trying to sell them as well as my RSI doesn't allow me to use regular peripherals anymore. (trackballs work wonderfully).

a2bxj3,0,2018-12-02,"I am about to loose the love of my life, please help!",goldrunner1996,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a2bxj3/i_am_about_to_loose_the_love_of_my_life_please/,"In September, our new flatmate sarah (23f) moved from another city into the flat a good friend peter (22m) and I (22m) have been living in together for 3 years during our bachelor studies. I have only been visiting both of them on the weekends, because I currently am an intern at a company in another city. 

Sarah and Peter had a rough start. Peter developed ""romantic"" feelings for her that she couldn't give back. However being a very warm person she was unable to go cold on him, such that he continued to be very persistent in his approaches. Sadly Peter has a very distorted image of what love is (possessive and materialistic) and hurt himself as well as Sarah (not physically). Finally Sarah decided to move out again, which was also what I was suggesting her to do. 

During the weekends, Sarah and i got closer, had deep conversation (often about the situation with Peter, but also other topics) and just spent lots of good time together. She helped me with some difficult decisions and thereby helped me to grow and figure out my priorities in life. One evening, at a party, she was leaving early and we hugged for an unusual long amount of time. So I asked her about her feelings for me and she confessed that she fell in love with me. We kissed that evening and for both of us the whole world just seemed to be fine for the first time in a long time. The next weekends were wonderful, we were together 24/7, cuddled, took long walks, talked, had sex and overall just had a very good time (she still lived in our flat at that time, but had already decided to move out prior to confessing her feelings). At the third or fourth weekend, on a Sunday evening when I was about to leave the city, she said she was ready for a relationship and I told her I was too.

On Wednesday of the upcoming week, she called me and under tears told me that she just kissed another man. I was devastated and never wanted to see her again. In my mind it was over. Somehow, however, she managed to convince me to come back for the weekend to talk (at this time she already moved into her new flat). At first I was very cold and distant, but eventually we talked about our innermost fears and desires and got very close again. On Sunday, everything seemed to be fine again, we decided to proceed to work on our relationship at a slower pace but we were full of hope.

During that week (last week) I developed gnawing doubts about that decision and felt myself chained to an emotional roller-coaster. Then on Wednesday in a state of sleep-deprived depression, I called her and told her about my doubts, and my feeling of being torn apart. I quite literally told her that ""in one moment I would give everything to be with her whilst also wishing to never have met her. I will never ever forgive myself to have said that. This probably was the single biggest mistake that was made. She said that she was quite confident about us during that week and me calling her that night really put her of track. The next day i called her, told her that I was deeply sorry about what I said and she told me she was shocked more about my feeling of being torn apart than whatever I said that night and that she hates herself for causing these kinds of feelings in an emotionally stable person like me. 

After the next day, I somehow found inner peace, clearness and unity and a sense of what had to be done to fix everything. Since that day I knew I wanted to be with her, and that her kissing some other guy changed nothing about my feelings towards her. I wanted to tell her just that, but she said she was not ready to talk. I visited my parents this weekend to get some rest and parently advice. Sarah and talked the next evening for about two hours and I told her that I was sure that we could fix our relationship and that everything would be fine. She was/is in a really bad state of mind but nevertheless we had a good conversation, remembering all the fun we had and talking about the universe and how eventually everything would be okay, no matter what. We decided to meet next weekend and proceed to figure things out. At this evening I was very confident that we could indeed figure everything out. But now she takes very long to reply to my messages (which previously took her no longer than 10 minutes) and because of the way she texts, I am worried that she has already made the decision to not keep seeing me.

Has anyone been in a somewhat similar situation or tips on what to do? She is the love of my life and I can't loose her yet and knowing that she is hurting because she is worrying to hurt me is eating me up.

Names have been changed. 

Tl;dr: I am about to loose the live of my life, because she kissed another man and I said unforgivable things I did not mean. Please help! "

&gt;In the mindset of a small right wing colonial lobby, maybe. Again, if  the colonial provisions of the treaty were so traumatic, why didn't  Hitler make a serious effort to recover Germany's colonies?

Again: it's about the symbolic meaning. At that time it was unthinkable to be a great power w/o colonies. And because you quote Hitler: The removal of the colonies inspired Hitler to look for other colonies in the East and he actually **did** make a ""serious effort"" to aquire them.

&gt;Lol, no they were not. Unless I was unaware of a large French population  living in Syria, a large Italian population in southern Turkey, and a  large British population in Kurdistan? And who can forget the Polish  minority in southern Ukraine, the Italian majority in Istria, the Serb  majority in Southern Macedonia, and many more

Yes, the right of self determination was often ignored by the Allies. That doesn't change the fact that the new distribution wasn't more unjust than before.

&gt;Literally all three of those those treaties included reparations. You  can go to the wikipedia page and ctl-F ""reparations"" if you don't  believe me

Thank you for confirming that you are just copy-pasting from the internet w/o verification of the sources. Neither Austria, Hungary nor Turkey ever paid a single Cent of reparations. No sums are mentioned in the treaties. It was postponed to a later date and then canceled. That's why ""reparations"" is written in quotation marks in the Wiki-page for St-Germain.

&gt;Can you point to the moment that Allied armies had invaded Bohemia?  Perhaps you can inform me of where Romanian armies were in 1918? Can you  point to how they just ""confirmed the status quo"" when Greece hadn't  even declared war on the Ottoman Empire

No, because Bohemia and many other regions segregated themselves. That's why I wrote that the treaties largely just confirmed the status quo. There was no way that Austria could keep Bohemia in a treaty as the local population had already declared affiliation to a different country (same happened elsewhere).

&gt;First, that's literally what happened to Germany, so why is Germany's  peace deal uniquely harsh while Russia's isn't. And there were many,  many ethnic Russians in those areas ceded. And Germany planned to  outright annex some of the areas, not create nationalist states.

I never said that Versailles was harsh because of territorial losses. Besides the creation of the Polish corridor and the loss of Upper Silesia, the territorial losses were rather mediocre. It were other regulations which made the Versailles treaty so unique. And yes there were also ethnic Russians living in areas ceded. That doesn't change the fact that it was done according to ethnic boundaries. As I said: there is a reason why the Western border of Russia is following the border of Brest-Litovsk.

&gt;Yes it did! Did you do literally any research before writing your  comments? Here's a quote, again just from doing a brief search on  wikipedia: ""The Soviets agreed to pay six billion marks in compensation  for German losses.""

You are again confirming that you are just copy-pasting from the internet w/o verification of the sources. The compensation payment of **6 billion** mark you are mentioning wasn't part of the Brest-Litovsk treaty (March 1918) but the later Soviet-German Financial Agreement (Aug 1918), a treaty to compensate for confiscation of German property. And also **to emphasize what you are comparing** here: as a result of Versailles Germany should pay **269 billion** mark!

&gt;All the neutral ports refused to take the German ships, and the Germans  agreed to the revised internment. It wasn't ""immediately"" done, *the Germans sailed the ships to Scapa Flow themselves*!

The Entente had the right to choose the neutral port where to intern the fleet. Of course just by chance the Entente couldn't find one. The German fleet sailed to the Firth of Forth thinking that the ships will be investigated if the armaments have been removed (a regulation of the armistice) and then be interned in a neutral port. Of course the Brits interned them in Scapa Flow instead w/o letting them leave. The Germans had every reason to feel fooled.

I'm a graduate student, and between class, working full-time, and an internship, my fitness has had to tack a backseat. Before the semester, I was regularly lifting 3-5x a week, but lately it's been down to a measly 1x, maybe 2x. I just don't have the extra time to go to the gym as I'm regularly working 7 days a week plus schoolwork, and I'm hesitant to start running outside again (I listen to too many true crime podcasts). So for xmas, my husband picked up a squat rack, bar, bench, and plates off of craigslist for the beginnings of our very own home gym. I can't express how excited I am to be able to pop downstairs and bust out a few reps without worrying about who's going to be on the ONE rack in my gym. 

What has been your experience with switching to a home gym? Do you work out more often, less often, about the same? Any equipment that's a must have?  

Finally, instead of buying a set of dumbbells, can I just buy handles and use the plates from the weight set? If so, any recommendations?

I was browsing any rooms to rent near the area when I saw a $500 per  month post which I was interested and contacted the person. I was shown the place and everything looked fine. We reached an agreement and rented me his extra room for $500 a month, everything included, for 3 months. From mid May to mid September (this is important)

However, right away I realized I hated the place the first day. I live in Texas, which is pretty hot. I was never told that the A/C was to be turned off when we were both out of the apartment, so when we arrive from work the inside was a crisp 85-90 degrees. It was the summer. The A/C took all night to get to a temperature of 75-80 degrees. Sweated every night btw. No big deal, I didn't care. Just put up with it. 

However, around the second month, I was asked if I can help with electric bill because it was summer and light bill is higher, I was like, ""why not?"" So I said I'll help out. Big mistake. From then on I was requested money to help for light bill. Again, I said why not. Usually $100. No big deal. 

My last week staying there came up, I thought that's it. Nope, more money was  wanted, $150 for those two weeks for the light bill, when I confronted the person, saying that I couldn't even leave the A/C on, suffered every night with sweat, plus, I would leave on weekends to stay with my family, and that I didn't even have a TV in my room so I couldn't have used that much  electricity and that my kindness was being taken advantage of they replied, ""$150, no further discussion"". 

I was mad. So I told the person I was paying them my next check because I was broke (college student) and gave the person $70 (all I had). Decided to not pay him after I left. I feel bad, that's not necessarily like me. AITA????"

You're in charge of creating a DC Cinematic Universe from scratch, how would you do it? What characters would you focus on? How would the movies go? What would your general outline for the Universe be? Honestly go as in depth as you'd like!

I'd love to hear ideas and start a discussion of having a blank slate with everything - even audience perception and storylines (and casting, if you're so inclined).

Even if you wanna just focus on one movie or a trilogy that's okay too.

Like for example I'd kick it off with a Superman Film based on Superman: Secret Origins. I'd change some stuff but the idea would basically be showing Clark crashing on Earth and showing him developing his powers while he grows up like in Man of Steel. I'd absolutely keep the scene where kid Clark is in school and freaks out because of his X-Ray vision. He's now a grown up, and moves to Metropolis, getting a job as the new Reporter of the Daily Planet. We meet ~~Dana White~~ Perry White (silly me &gt;&lt;), Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. White is trying to save his Paper, Lois is trying to uncover Lex and the US government as corrupt and the Jimmy The Intern is depressed he is only an Intern. 

Meanwhile Lex is developing Weapons for the US Government. He's using Kryptonite (given a different name at the start or just called Element X or something) for energy powering weapons and such. During the film an outstanding soldier - John Corben - has a date and sleeps with Lois, but is shipped out the next day. Later we see him waking up in a lab with Lex explaining he was caught in IED explosion and his Heart and other body parts have been replaced. His heart is replaced with Kryptonite and becomes Metallo, the final villain of the film.

I think Secret Origins would be the perfect way to start a Superman trilogy, and even a DC Cinematic Universe and can go in more depth if anyone wants. What do you guys think?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am 30yo and have a Bachelor's degree in Software Development and 2.5 years of experience, which I guess still only qualifies me as a Junior Developer. I am not sure if this is sufficient for H1-B nowadays?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I apply for jobs directly in the US or try to find a German company that has some project in the US?  Some people suggested you need a lot of references to get hired in the US, but I worked only at one company apart form internships. And my personal blog where I talk about the stuff I know shows my  picture and name and job applications in the US are anonymous.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you go about this? What are my chances?"
a2evcp,3,2018-12-02,What's up with the people that spam random people at a university with poorly written and non-specific emails asking for sponsorship in a PhD program?,[deleted],labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/a2evcp/whats_up_with_the_people_that_spam_random_people/,"I get these fairly often, does someone tell these people this is a good idea? I just got one from a guy from Pakistan. Here's what I'm talking about:

Dear Sir/Madam hope you are finding well. I am (name removed) from Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan. I am interested in your field of research work. My field of research work is Describe in my resume. So I am humbly request to you plz recommended my resume or provide me opportunity in any Chinese Agriculture university/ Lowa state university/Kansas State of university for enrolled in Ph.D Agronomy. I am waiting for your kind response. Plz rec commend my resume &amp; provide me opportunity for Ph.D Scholarship in Agriculture through Chinese scholarship council &amp; forward my resume to respective departments. Plz once again I request to you pl z don't neglect my resume in any stage. More ever I have no visa, no acceptance letter etc thats are required in the processing of admission in any university. I was a Student of M.Phil Agriculture Department Of (Agronomy) Faculty Of Agriculture Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan KPK- Pakistan and extensively work on (weed management in cereal crops) and (Integrated Weed Management Strategies In Wheat Crop (Triticum aestivum L.) in Islamic Republic of Pakistan. I am also having professional experience in different organizations.  

I turn to you at this time in search for a supervisor for my PhD studies/research in the field of weed management, integrated weed management, cereal crops, efficacy of moringa leaf extract (MLE) as potential growth promoter for agriculture crops, Sunflower crop etc.

................................................................................................. . . I just need an acceptance letter for PhD scholarship under your kind supervision. I would be very happy and honor for me if I will join your research oriented team.

I am writing in response to advertisement for the Ph.D. studentship in Agronomy, Crop Production, Agro meteorology, weed science at China Scholarship Council (CSC) in any Chinese Agricultural University, as advertised on http://laihua.csc.edu.cn. I have completed an MSc (Hons) Agriculture/ M-Phil degree from Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan. The Ph.D. student position at Any World Agricultural University, is of extreme interest to me, since it would be delightful to work in a University whose Agriculture research programs have such an outstanding reputation in the industry and also in the world.

I believe that my existing academic experience as a graduate and postgraduate student have prepared me to be a highly qualified individual to carry on further study as a Ph.D. student. I have gained solid knowledge in Agronomy, Crop Production, Agriculture Metrology, Plant Breeding and Genetics and a number of relevant subjects. During my postgraduate study worked on Integrated Weed Management Strategies In Wheat Crop (Triticum eastivum) under irrigated and water stress condition at Gomal University DIKhan, one of the foremost institutes in this field in Pakistan, I also did my internship in Agriculture Research Institute (ARI) Ratta Kulachi DIKhan KPK Pakistan one of the foremost institutes in this field in Pakistan. where I worked on Wheat effect of planting time on wheat production including SDS PAGE and I am also interested in Grassland monitoring &amp; assessments, Rangeland watershed management, Watershed assessment &amp; management, Grassland fire ecology, Ecology of invasive species, Principles of forage Quality, Grassland plant identification, Grazing ecology &amp; management, Grain science and industry, Agricultural meteorology, Crop Production, Plant Physiology, Principles of cultivar development, Molecular approaches, Tissue Culture, Genetic Engineering, Metabolism and Signal Transduction Pathway, Forestry, Dry land farming, Sunflower, canola, Rice, Sorghum, Sugar Cane, etc.

I also see myself as a passionate future researcher with capability of working independently and cooperatively. For independent working, I have the ability to effectively review previous researches in a systematic way, and accurately emphasize on the important parts relevant to my research. In addition, I have a keen sensitivity to my work. I am quick to spot new phenomena, and correlate them to the previous work. For cooperative working, I highly value the importance of communication with supervisors, colleagues, and researchers. I am eager to learn from their experiences, and meanwhile, I am always willing to help anyone by sharing my experiences.

I think I am a good fit as a Ph.D. student and truly look forward to work under your Supervision for further study on “Efficacy of Moringa Leaf Extract (MLE) As Potential Growth Promoter for Agricultural Crops.”

”. I would love my work to be a contribution not only to academics but also a benefit to the researcher and farmers as well.

My updated resume is attached for your kind review.

 

I would really appreciate if you could consider my application/request.

My CV shown in the attachment reflects my scientific aptitude but even if you require any additional information, please let me know.

Thanking you in anticipation

Best Regards

a2g58s,59,2018-12-02,[B/S] One beginning.,Kitty_Luvin,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/a2g58s/bs_one_beginning/,"Since I joined Reddit I have been asked why I haven't posted anything about my history.  I have tried to explain that I would be violating the age restrictions.  I have decided, however, that I will post this story about the circumstances leading to my becoming pregnant with my son.

My older brother had finished college and came home but had to complete an internship to officially graduate and receive his degree. He hadn't been home since Christmas and we (I) were especially excited and anxious.  When he got here he had brought some karaoke equipment with him, which lead to having an impromptu home coming party.  We invited our cousin and his best friend, my best friend, and of course our younger brother and sister were here.  These people already knew of my relationship with my brother.  Dad was gone on a cross country long haul and as it turned out was gone almost a month.  So although I was sleeping in his bedroom I was sleeping alone.  

The party was a blast.  Of course we visited some of the booze that dad kept in a cabinet.  My cousin also brought some beer.  :)

The singing, or our terrible attempt at it, was horrible but funny and we laughed and enjoyed the night.  Some dancing was being done.  A little later my brother sang the song ""Because you loved me"".  He came to me and took my hand and sang to me.  He actually sounded very good.  I was thrilled.  As he sang and looked into my eyes I'm pretty sure everyone in the room could hear my panties drop to the floor.

Now, with my brother being gone and dad on the road most of the time I had become lax with my birth control.  I am convinced in my heart that was the night I became pregnant.  It was a wonderful long night.  So getting pregnant wasn't planned but it wasn't defended either.  8 months and 3 weeks later we had a strong, healthy, beautiful, and ""loud"" baby boy.  The true joy of my life.  "

I am starting to stress about this, but not sure what I should do! 

I currently have a year and 3 months left on my lease and have 32k our of the 36k miles on the car. I do not want to lease again, and would like to roll it over into a nicer used car, but not sure what the process is when ending a lease early. 

Looking for any information about early termination, fees, or what I can expect to owe Ford for getting out of this early! Any advice or insight would be great. I do understand I will probably upside down on a vehicle, but it is .20 cents a mile over 36,000, which is coming quick. Thank you !! "
a2ifbl,43,2018-12-02,Atheist partner wants me to convert to Judaism?,evie_quoi,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a2ifbl/atheist_partner_wants_me_to_convert_to_judaism/,"Edit: These comments helped so much! My guy and I had several serious conversations about how religion and his culture fit in to our lives and he decided marrying someone Jewish isn’t that important to him. He also decided to try and do his post-doc in the city where I live. We couldn’t come to a compromise about circumcision (my argument that I’ve handled more dicks than he has and therefore know more didn’t go well, haha), but we decided if we have children we’ll just hope for girls. He’s started asking me more about what kind of rings I like. Couldn’t be more in love with this guy, so thank you all for the great advice and information!

Original post: My boyfriend of a year comes from a modern orthodox family, but identified himself to me as an atheist when we first met. I was raised atheist and tolerate others’ religious practices, but don’t agree with organized religion.

I love my partner and could easily spend the rest of my life with him.  On the way home from Shabbat the other week, he dropped the bombshell that he won’t marry a non-Jewish partner. Hint hint. 

Marriage is a loooonnngg way off, but it’s important to me that this is an option as I won’t have children outside marriage (my parents weren’t married and it resulted in a terribly painful custody battle) - and I want kids.

I won’t convert, I won’t circumcise my children, and I won’t raise my children Jewish. There’s no room for negotiation here.

We both want kids, but his family is very oriented towards appearance and prestige. My family couldn’t afford those values, frankly, so it’s very foreign to me. I thought our values were aligned and now I’m not sure we would be able to successfully parent together. Class differences, religion, heteronormative lifestyle expectations - it’s a lot.

He’s leaving the state this summer to complete a year internship and 2 years of post doc. He’s the first serious parter I’ve had after being raped. I don’t want to lose him, the love we share is so tender and precious. But is it worth battling through a years long LDR, disagreements about my spiritual choices, and how I interact with his religious community? I don’t want to end up single as my biological clock winds down (I’m 27 currently), and I don’t want to waste each other’s time.

Has anyone else been in a relationship with such serious compromise on the horizon and made it work? Is it wiser to go our separate ways and hope I find another deep love with someone more culturally similar? How do I even begin to process my atheist partner saying he won’t marry a non-Jew?

Any help is so appreciated - thank you!"
a2j7xe,7,2018-12-02,"Roblox is more than a ""stupid game"". It's a good platform for children and beginners to learn how to program, code, and design.",Flomosho,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/a2j7xe/roblox_is_more_than_a_stupid_game_its_a_good/,"As of recent memes Roblox has been seen as a stupid game and is mocked for looking bad or whatever, but it's pretty good at teaching children and beginning coders at how to model, design, code and program, letting them progress further into the coding world.

Take a game like Phantom Forces, a CoD/Battlefield parody and has landed itself as one of the most played games on Roblox. One of the developers, Litozinnamon (Harrison Yuan) used his skills from his previous game(s) and helped created Phantom Forces. This helped him get an internship at Roblox where he programmed with other Roblox engineers. He now goes to college at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

Say what you want about Roblox, but it's a great stepping stone for those wanting to get into the coding world."
a2jjco,1,2018-12-02,Advice needed for BA Bio / Computational Biology,sadbeeping,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/a2jjco/advice_needed_for_ba_bio_computational_biology/,"Hi, I will be graduating May 2020 (hopefully) and I am looking into job research and internships. It would be ideal to not do any more school, but I must, I am thinking about doing Master's degree. I feel lost and really don't know what to expect from having BA Biological science degree with computational biology concentration. 

Frankly I don't know what I'd do as a computational biologist; the kind of only reason that I did computational bio was that I wasn't passionate about any field and it was too late to change my major. This might be a lot to answer so here are some of more specific questions that I want to ask:

1) Is graduate school absolutely required? If it is, what field is better in terms of salary and job market?
2) Is there any recommendation of companies that I should look into? I am international student studying in USA, so I don't know what companies are there.

And any other advice you can give to lost bio major student is welcomed. Thanks in advance."

a2koiq,5,2018-12-02,Opinions on gap year options after high school,dankferretbitch,gapyear,https://www.reddit.com/r/gapyear/comments/a2koiq/opinions_on_gap_year_options_after_high_school/,"So this is my first time posting, or even having a Reddit account after browsing for a few years, but I need some advice. I'm debating on a few options for after high school, including no gap year, 1 year off, or 2 years off. In my years off I would be traveling the world curtesy of my parents offering to pay for it all. 

Some background first though is sorta important in this decision. 

I'm a junior in high school now, and I'm really serious about photography. I have an internship under a photographer in my area as well as working freelance for family portraits. I'm not sure what type of photography I want to get into for sure as a career yet, but I just know I'm going to be involved with photography.

I have a few options for what I want to do after high school, and before I go into 2 years of community college and then transferring after.

My first option is taking no gap year at all and going straight to cc. When I graduate, it's already decided that they are moving out and leaving the house to me, regardless of what happens. My parents encourage my photography as well as my love for traveling, and agree that a gap year is a great learning experience.  But, they have also said if I choose not to take a gap year or two, the money that would be spent on traveling would be used to build a photography studio in the house for me to use while I attend community college. If I could not take a year off, I could work and could save a lot of money, and also would be less reliant on my parents money (which is pretty apparent in their willingness to pay for all of this). The downside to this would be that I'm not sure if I would even want to travel after college, and I feel like I would just jump straight into trying to get a job and finding a photography agency. With that much like life stuff already done, I don't think I would even be able to find time to travel. 

My second option is to take one year off, and travel to about half the places I want to go. It would be a great experience culturally and for my independence. The only problem I have with this is that so many of my friends have told me that it's really hard for them to find the motivation to go back to school after taking a gap year, and knowing myself I feel like I would be the same way considering my lack of motivation for school related things even just now in high school. 

My third option is to take two years off, spend more time in each country, and have literally the experience of a life time. I would have two years to see and be apart of so many cultures in interested in, as well as doing photography in amazing locations as well. Again though, especially after two years I think it would be hard to find motivation to go back to college. Another problem I would have is reestablishing myself in the community for being a photographer. Although I don't want to pursuit specifically freelance photography as a career, it's would I would prefer to do to make money as a start in college.

a2ksrq,1,2018-12-02,Helping Spouse Through Depression and Suicidal Thoughts?,worriedhusband5456,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a2ksrq/helping_spouse_through_depression_and_suicidal/,"I come here seeking advice regarding my spouse. She has had depression since high school, and we are both in our mid-20s (I am 25 and she is 24). She goes through normal bouts of what we dub ""random sadness"", and I am usually able to help her feel better, although never completely during these phases. She sees a psychologist once ever few weeks, and she regularly takes medication to treat her depression. 

Life has been stressful for her as of late; she is in her final year of grad school (Social Work), and attempting to complete all of her papers on top of her internship responsibilities has been emotionally draining. She is also worried that she will not be able to find work that is specifically related to what she wants to do post-grad school (more on the program side of things rather than working with clients directly). 

The stress of grad school, worries about the future, and her depression have taken their toll. Some days, she is in what she calls a ""normal state of equilibrium"", whereas other days she bursts out in tears and questions whether or not life is worth living, even indicating that she wants to kill herself. Her overall concern is that 1) she hasn't been consistently happy or emotionally stable for longer than a month at a time since high school and that 2) this will never change. 

We've been together since 2013, and I've felt like I've been able to help my spouse get through the bad emotional phases, but they've gotten worse recently (especially with the aforementioned stressors), and with the end of grad school coming up in the middle of 2019 and the proceeding job hunting endeavor, I am afraid that her emotional state is only going to get worse. My biggest fear in life is that my wife will commit suicide, and my fear is that this fear could become reality. 

What do I do? When my spouse describes why she has a negative outlook, and why she believes she will never be *truly* happy, I try to use logic and reason, but it doesn't work. I try using empathy, making appeals to the fact that life is stressful now but that, after grad school, there will be less stressors that she will lack agency over and that, overall, things will get better, but this doesn't work either. 

I know that this sub-reddit is primarily for those who have depression to seek support from each other, and I apologize if this isn't the best forum to ask this question, but if I am allowed to ask: what are some good strategies to help those going through the roughest patches of depression (especially when outside factors exacerbate the depression), and if someone talks about hopelessness, and even suicide, what can be done to provide reassurances? Perhaps an even more important question: what can I do to prevent escalating stress? For example, if I ask my spouse what is wrong, and I don't get a coherent answer, prying is not the best solution, but what is? Sometimes what I say seems to help, but other times it appears to make things worse, but saying nothing at all would be the worst thing of all, I think, as I don't want to come off as emotionally detached and having ""given up"" on her.

Thanks for those who respond, even though I know that you are going through your own mental illness challenges. Once again, if this is an inappropriate place to post this, I would be more than happy to post it somewhere else. "
a2ky0k,0,2018-12-02,I [M23] am falling for my best friend [F23]. I can't lose her,FaceTheDream,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a2ky0k/i_m23_am_falling_for_my_best_friend_f23_i_cant/,"**TL;DR I am falling for my best friend. She is my closest friend by a long shot and I am super afraid of losing her if she doesn't feel the same way. I have no idea what to do so I don't ruin our relationship**


So my best friend Kelly and I met a little over a year ago during which we were both in unhappy relationships. That helped us get super close super quick, in a way we were each others support. Since then we have helped each other grow, we've both been working at the same company as interns and have since been offered positions once we graduate university. 

To put it in perspective she graduates this December, and I graduate this May. Since we met there really hasn't been a single week where we haven't hung out alone. Before the end of the summer we had a group that we would also hang out with on a weekly basis, so I'd probably see her 2-3 evenings a week. Also because we work at the same company we would usually have lunch &amp; message each other throughout the day. 

During the first few months of this everyone thought we were dating and while I had feelings for her, I was just out of my first long term relationship and didn't want to date anyone. She brought it up one week when tension was high - to put this in perspective no matter where we went people would think we were a couple, the department store, the restaurant, etc. There has never been anything physical between us. We honestly just click really well. She asked me if I liked her and I told her no, I was a little shocked when she brought it up - in hindsight I should have said yes. She agreed that she didn't have feelings toward me either. To put it in perspective  a little earlier in that conversation, I was telling her about my apprehension of moving countries/states to look for work and leaving everything behind (friends, family, etc) and she said ""well I would come with you"". 

Anyways since then we've both slept with other people and honestly up until the end of the summer I was 100% content with her &amp; I being life long friends. That changed when all of our friends left at the end of the summer. The company we work for hires interns from across the country and most of our friends were not from where we lived. So naturally when they left and we went back to school - we would just hang out together. A month ago we went on a short trip together to a nearby city and just got high and ate bomb food. This is the second trip we do alone, and we have both expressed that we should do trips like this again.

So everything up until this point may make you think ""dude she likes you"". The reason I find that hard to believe is because she'll say something like ""We should go on a trip to X"" and then say ""I wonder if friend Y would be down to go too"" or ""Lets go clubbing together"" and then she'll ask me who we should invite after I've agreed. Also lets not forget that we've both made-out with other people in front of each other. 

Before I wrap this up - I know you might be thinking I've been friend-zoned. And possibly, but realistically I don't know what to do. Becoming slowly become less dependent on her is great in theory but that would totally backfire. Sometime during the summer I started growing close to this other girl, lets name her Ashley. Ashley &amp; I started doing folk-dance classes together (something that Kelly wasn't into) and to make a long story short I got super close to her. Ashley would take time away from Kelly &amp; our group of friends but I would still see them once a week. Kelly got super upset and honestly a little passive aggressive. We grew a little distant but honestly I understand - Kelly and I were doing fine and had a routine going and I started messing around with it and balling on plans for some other girl I wasn't romantically interested in. (It was partially my fault, I cancelled on a concert all of us had planned to go too, to go on a last minute trip across the country  with Ashley) Ashley and I ended up having a little falling out when she found a boyfriend and since then Kelly &amp; I have gone back to being closer than ever. 

Honestly I could go on and on about our experiences and reasons I think she likes me, and other reasons I think she doesn't like me. The truth, is she is my closest friend by a huge stretch. I have gone on dates, made friends and I have fun - but none of that is nearly as fun as hanging out with her. The thought of losing her is the most gut wrenching feeling in the whole wide world, I'm at a loss for what to do. She has more times than I can count that the two of us are gonna be life long friends - and that is something I have never ever had. So I'd like to say that is what I want but I also realize that the likelihood of her and I staying this close when she gets a boyfriend are slime to none. 

Should I just give up on Kelly? and how do I go about doing that?

Is there anything more I can do than just apply online? I am aware of how highly competitive JPL is - what can I do to increase my chances?

Is it true that most companies finish their talent search from Aug-Dec or can I still land a decent entry level position by applying from now until May? I did have like 3 interviews earlier this semester, but they either haven't gotten back to me in weeks or directly rejected me and I feel i dun'goofed my chances. 

Quick Rundown of my candidate profile is I have a 3.7 GPA, 1 internship at a somewhat small chemical manufacturing company where I did R&amp;D not really engineering though, 2 years of academic research, desk job freshmen year, Vice President of student org, and logistics lead on another org. I believe my weakest point is my lack of strong engineering industry experience.

As of lately, I've been mostly applying online and through my university's board. If I find an HR email, I try to send them an email expressing interest in the position. I go to my school's career fair but most of them just tell me apply online. Ive been applying any location, various differnt kind of positions but no luck.

Are there better ways to land an entry level job than from what I have been doing and what should I be doing differently?

I do want to apologize for negative energy or coming across as whiny, but a lot of people are telling me cheme market is terrible and it's really starting to get to me. I always though hardwork in getting decent grades and some experience would help me, but I am not so sure anymore"
a2lvm7,4,2018-12-03,Quitting weed for a reason,that_one_asian25,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/a2lvm7/quitting_weed_for_a_reason/,"I don't have anyone to really speak my mind to, so here goes my rant. \[TL;DR at the bottom\]

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, I quit smoking/ vaping/ consuming weed, and it's been great.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an engineering student, and I was recently accepted for a summer internship that will most likely require a hair test. The O&amp;G plant I will work for said that I would have my drug screening around March of 2019, so I've given my self three and a half weeks of lee way, which I really really REALLY hope is enough to pass. Coming from someone who smoked nearly everyday, I was scared that this would be a rough transition, but in fact not so much. I actually haven't really thought about smoking or have the urge to smoke. I even hangout with my friends who smoke and even live with roommates who all smoke. The smell of weed lingers in our apartment at all times, but I scoff it off no problem... which was surprising.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about it recently and I think it's because I finally have a set goal and a reason not to smoke. Before I would take short, week-long t-breaks but I knew deep inside that there's no reason not to smoke, and I would succumb to my own pressures. But now, it feels SO good to be sober. My mind is clear, I'm not always drowsy, and I have time for the other hobbies I've been putting off for so long. But overall, I think the biggest outcome of this break is that I'm finally not depressed. Writing that sentence alone was tough because I guess I never wanted to admit that to myself while I smoked. Sitting around all day doing the same thing over and over and over again got to me when I smoked. The only thing I could do at that point was think about myself and everything I believed to be wrong, and that wouldn't stop. I would get into these cycles that eventually led to me hating myself for no good reason. Now, the camera I've had laying around and the longboard that hasn't been ridden on have seen the sun again, and I finally have distractions. I don't mean distractions in the bad sense, but something good and enjoyable that relieves me from thinking about what could possibly be wrong. Writing this rant allowed me to finally notice that all the ""bad things"" I would muck over were absolutely nothing to worry about. Just another one of those instances that you gotta move over and learn from, and that is exactly what I've done and learning to do. And it feels so fucking good.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to lie the first few days were bumpy. I would sit around like I normally do, and I would think, ""huh... I could be smoking now."" This would inevitably bring me down, and I would ride along the depression rollercoaster yet again, but in time it stopped. The hobbies I've come along have taken over my life again in the best way possible, and I feel like I have a purpose in life again no matter how small it is.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who is having a hard time quitting, i suggest learning what other redditors have for interests. Thankfully, I've already found some hobbies in my past, but recently I dove deep into the world of headphones and hi-fi, and it really sparked my love for music again which was always a huge part of my life. These kinds of transitions take time, and soon you'll get past it too.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I've found meaning in my life since I've quit and I'm happy again."

Then Higher Ground came out and I couldn't get enough. 

It was a summer of obsession, Summers Gone, In Return, My Friends Never Die, official and unofficial remixes, the singles off A Moment Apart. Life was good. 

I was happy.

I listened to A Moment Apart non-stop the week after it came out. As school got bad, and my life started falling apart, I kept listening to it, Summers Gone, In Return, My Friends Never Die, official and unofficial remixes.

The time between Line of Sight and A Moment Apart was the last time I was truly happy.

I saw ODESZA live, and it was the most magical night of my life. A life preserver to keep me from drowning in life. It's been over a year since then and I still cherish that night as much as I did then.

But to me, listening to ODESZA, thinking back to that night, remembering how each track of theirs made me feel at some point or another, it gives me hope. Hope that maybe I'll be happy again at some point. Maybe life will get better soon.

Because at this point I am drowning in everything life has thrown at me. All I have to get me through it is A Moment Apart, Summers Gone, In Return, My Friends Never Die, official and unofficial remixes.

I want to thank the boys for creating such beautiful music, I don't know what I would do without them. "

Hello! I intend to do a PhD in computer science, and pursue a research career in industry/academia. I have heard that ETH folks *expect* the incoming bachelor students to have a high GPA (one of the main criteria?!). Nevertheless, I feel that I have better chances if I apply  to [MS in Cyber Security](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/studies/master/master-cybsec.html) (compared to [MS in Computer Science](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/studies/master/master-cs.html)). I noticed that there is a [Direct Doctorate Program](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html) as well (basically, the initial two years, i.e MS, is fully funded).

Do you think that I should apply to MS in Cyber Security or Direct Doctorate Program? Is it possible to apply for MS in Cyber Security, and get scholarship too? My last resort is to just apply to both the programs. I do not know the background of students who are currently  enrolled in those programs, and therefore, it'd be really helpful if you  could provide more information regarding the same (or point me to the relevant people)."

One point that was mentioned the networking and personal development you receive from the exhausting work schedules and friends you make at DCP. But that still confuses me. DCP seems like a great program (albeit an exhausting program) that really pushes people out of their comfort zones. But how does DCP boost your resume if you were to get a career in Computer Science,for example. DCP emphasizes on their site that its program accepts students from all majors, but how exactly would DCP help a Biology major? Film major? Dance major?

I also learned about Disney's Professional Internships and how some alumns from DCP apply to the internships. How would DCP boost your application for the Professional Internships?

Btw, mad respect for those in DCP because yall are really sticking to what you are passionate about. I'm just curious how skills in the role of a custodian, attendent, watercraft, character performer, merchandise,or etc. would transfer into your career goals.

Has anyone tried this combo in a low dose? Will the phenibut diminish the positive effects of microdosing?"

&amp;#x200B;

Would you like to know more about me? Here's my story: I was born in Russia and I live in Italy since I was 7. I graduated two years ago in Communication and Marketing. During my studies, I decided to specialize in Social Media Management. I was totally amazed by this creative and engaging way to reach and connect with people. Also, I've always been interested in travelling so I took the chance to go abroad and do my university internship in Social Media Management in an ONG, in Brazil. My role was to create social engagement and to develop digital communication initiatives while trying to increase the organization's fundraising profit. Once I graduated in 2016, I moved to Australia where I started working as a Marketing Consultant in the food business. I practised my communication skills and created social media content and marketing strategies by collaborating with the other members of the marketing team. After this inspiring and beautiful experience at the end of 2017, I went back to Italy. Here in my city in Padua, I did a course in Digital Marketing that ended with an internship in a communication agency. My role was to oversee social media content and manage the social media calendar for high-profile companies. I really enjoyed working in a creative field like that, it was an amazing journey that strengthens my communication and Social Media Management skills. Once I finished my internship, I've decided to run my business ( [www.lol-sox.com](http://www.lol-sox.com)) because my biggest dream is to become a digital nomad. I am enthusiastic about the progressive transformation of the job market thanks to the introduction of smart working and I would like to be part of this changing by enjoying what I really love to do: Digital Communication. There are many good reasons why I truly can be the right candidate: I am a hard worker who knows the importance of being constantly updated about the fast-evolving world of Social Media and Communication. I am a quick learner, and I am confident with tools like Word, Excel, Spreadsheet, Asana, Facebook Business Manager, Facebook Insights and Analytics, Buzzsumo, Hootsuite, Buffer, Hubspot, Google Ads and Google Analytics, Canva etc.  I can excel in creating and keeping deadlines, I have strong organisational skills and I am fast in decision making. I do my best to improve my skills day by day because what I believe most is that discipline and organization is not something a person just achieve but a skill that needs to be practised on a daily basis."

a2qx5y,5,2018-12-03,"My [F22] BF [M22] Won't Make Time or Effort to See Me, but Blames Circumstance. Is He in the Right?",throwaway48122056,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a2qx5y/my_f22_bf_m22_wont_make_time_or_effort_to_see_me/,"I've been with my boyfriend for 7 months now. Almost all of them have been super happy except the last 2 months. See, in September we started being long distance of 1 hour. (Hamilton to Toronto). He's studying in university, while I'm working for in Toronto.

What was different in our relationship in September? Well he was starting a retail job and he was living without his brother for the first time (His family lives in London). Why was this great?

Both of our parents are Asian, but my BF's parents are overly strict. To the point where they are in a city an hour away, yet have controlled my BF from their home. They utilize my BF's brother to find out when my BF goes out, when he comes back home, etc. It's super excessive. This is important to the story.

As Septemeber and October rolled by, we spent 4 days together each month. Life was great.

As November rolls around, my BF starts to become overwhelmed. Being in a dance team put him severely behind academically. Then in November, his retail job started giving him 35 hour work weeks. He's struggling, but not telling them to give him less shifts! So my weekend visit was him working everyday with 8 hour shifts. I fit in the cracks, I understood his situation.

This past weekend however.. There was an event on Thrusday he invited me to. What I thought is that I'd come Thrusday, spend the night Friday as well, leave Saturday.

My boyfriend had other plans however. He was to go home Friday after his shift at 6pm, so he could go shopping on Saturday with his family. I asked him why he couldn't go home Saturday morning? Reason? His mom. Going home Friday would inconvenience his brother by making him wait hours, so Saturday made more sense for him too.

But his mom objected so hard to the change, for not reason at all. My BF protested, but ultimately he couldn't win against her. Because she's taught them to obey so well. His mom is a recurring issue. To which I told him, you are letting her act like this.

You all might say, it's one day. Calm down woman. I agree, it's one day.

Except in December he has disclosed that he cannot see me even once. So this one day is the last. Then starting January, he's doing a four month internship in Gatineau. One hour distance turns into to five hour distance in a snap.

So let's explore December a little bit. Exams end for him on the 15th. Surely, he has tons of time after that to spend with me, before he moves.

So here's where the upsetting part comes: Every single day that he's not spending with his family, he has made available for his retail job. He didn't even reserve one day for me. I was in literal shock. And for those that will ask: money is not a problem.

Quality Time is my first love language, and gift giving is my second, which he never put effort into either. Since our relationship started, I always tried to make him feel special. Whether that was buying him flowers, hiding cute love notes around his room, getting him macaroons after he had two midterms in one day, randomly sending him Calvin Klein Undies, list goes onnnnnn.

I've done so many things, and after doing a few. You wonder, he gets gets gets, doesn't he feel like doing something back for once? We talked, I even gave him examples, it doesn't have to cost anything! Leave a sweet note in my room one day!

Then we'd go through the motions of this entire talk once a month. Recently, I've given up. Because the only response I ever get is: I'm trying, I'm trying. I'm tired of this word! What has come out of your trying?

I guess I spoke about so much bad, but he does have everything else I've ever wanted in someone. He always makes me laugh, he's incredibly progressive. He agrees to modify our religion's sexist marriage ritual (very taboo).  We agree on so many fundamental things: how to spend money, that we want to live together before marriage. We fit together so perfectly.

And he used to make time for me everyday, when we studied in the same semester :( So I looked past the gift-giving aspect. Now, I feel like he's not appealing to any of my love languages anymore. And I feel unloved. Everything I've written here, I've told him, and he blames everything else except himself (his mother, his job). If he does blame himself, he calls himself an awful boyfriend. But never actually takes action.

I'm at my breaking point. After countlessly explaining to him, and no action. I've given him an ultimatum. Give me four days in December, otherwise we have to leave each other. But even this feels wrong, I have to demand him now? And his response was ""I'm trying"".

Even the prospect of losing our relationship didn't do anything. On one hand I love him, and I feel like he's the one. On the other hand I don't feel like he listens to my needs even when I try to handhold him through them. If he can't give me time now, what's the guarantee he will give me time after four months? Please give me your perspectives.

tl;dr: Long distance (1 hr) BF hasn't made the time to meet with me since November. Recently sprung that he will not see me at all in December, after which he is moving to Gatineau (5 hrs distance) for four months. His exams end on Dec 15, he's devoted the rest of the month to family and his retail job. He does not need the money. My concerns are repeatedly met with ""I'm trying"", and no action. Not sure whether to stay for the next four months of longer distance, hoping we will be happier after that."
a2r4qy,98,2018-12-03,I get made fun of for being Zero Waste,cabbagerosequilt,ZeroWaste,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/a2r4qy/i_get_made_fun_of_for_being_zero_waste/,"I started trying to curb my waste this summer while I had an internship at Virginia Tech. Each day when I walked to the cafeteria, I saw all the perfectly good things international students at the school were throwing away because they couldn't take them on a plane. Just by picking things off the top of the dumpster pile, I got a gold end table, two heavy-duty 30ft extension cords, a surge-protector, two space-heaters, a mini-fridge, a new and unopened camping tent, a $25 Starbucks cup, and a couple of other things. Using my dumpster dived (and thoroughly cleaned) Starbucks cup was the beginning of a new era for me. Since then, I have cut my garbage production down by 75% or more and I consider myself to be working towards Zero Waste as a busy college student. 

My boyfriend, although he doesn't understand it fully, is supportive of my sudden awakening. Two of my friends, on the other hand, are not. They actively make fun of me for the things I do. They're a-holes about a lot of things, so I really don't consider them to truly be my friends, but due to current circumstances, I have to deal with them for the time-being. Some things they have done include: mocking me about my views on climate-change and humanity's role in it (I'm an environmental major) when it was *completely irrelevant* to the conversation; randomly telling people I'm speaking with that I want their clean glass bottles/jars (in a way that sounds like I want their used ear swabs) when I had made no mention of anything related to my lifestyle or wanting the jars; making a HUGE deal in a crowded grocery store over me using my own bags to get bulk items; and mockingly asking if they can put X in the recycling bin I set up in my room. 

I haven't lectured them on being less wasteful or been high-and-mighty about my environmental views or been annoyingly hippy-ish, so all of this has really been uncalled for. Before they started bullying me about being zero waste, I would excitedly tell them sometimes about the things I was working on or had learned (like friends do) cause it made me happy! Now I don't talk about it at all/hide the things I do because they give me so much crap. I have a hard time firing back because I'm not good at sticking up for myself (thank you, narcissist mother) and I really actively try to be a kind, understanding person, but they're pushing me over the edge.

So I need some advice: How can I defend my views and choices, while also not stooping to their level or ruining the ""friendship""?"

a2s0wo,1,2018-12-03,Bankruptcy or debt snowball? 47k in debt with a $3500-4300 monthly net income. Stuck and not sure how to move forward.,Abeefyboi,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a2s0wo/bankruptcy_or_debt_snowball_47k_in_debt_with_a/,"In the past 4 years, wife and i managed to accumulate 47k in credit, auto, and personal loan debt. During this time, she took a break from college and quit working due to some significant mental health issues (they're getting better), so she has stayed home with the kids (we have a  3 month old and an 8 year old), I finished grad school and worked in a paid internship for a year, was hired with same company for another 1.5 years, and found a new job with a new company that I've been with for about a year. I've also had a part time job for evenings and weekends that I can usually get an extra 300 to 800 take home per month. We dont own a home, we rent.

The debt is 9k personal loan, 15k car, and 23k spread across 5 credit cards. We used the cards for emergencies and irresponsible spending. Neither of us are good with money obviously. Credit score used to be 780, now it is about 680 due to one missed payment (I forgot to pay), 1 inquiry, and a 90 percent credit utilization.

I learned about the debt snowball this past year and have desperately been wanting to do it but things have been crazy since i spent the whole year working and saving like a madman for this baby that arrived 3 months ago. Our debt snowball would take us a little over 2.5 years if we paid 400 extra a month towards debt. Soooo....

The wife told me yesterday that she thinks we should file bankruptcy to get a fresh start and free up our income so that we can start living easier and doing more things for the family/provide a better life for the kids. I strongly disagree and told her we should do the debt snowball for a couple of years, and that I could work a bit extra to fast track it. I want to live on beans and rice but she is worried about the kids and what they will miss out on. Our budget is so strapped now it wouldn't really be much different, we would just have a bit less going to entertainment. Shes also worried the snowball would take us forever since we would have to save cash for christmas and birthdays. Again, I disagree. I feel that bankruptcy is a terrible option unless it is really needed, and since I've never missed a payment because I couldn't pay it, I believe we can pay back the debt if we work together and change our habits and sacrifice.

Sorry for such a long post, but I wanted to be thorough. What do you all think about this situation? I would love some feedback. Thanks in advance.

a2sahd,1,2018-12-03,Dealing with my best friend has become an emotional rollercoaster and I’m not sure if I should get off the ride.,Torrent-State,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a2sahd/dealing_with_my_best_friend_has_become_an/,"This feels more like a rant but I do want advice, if there is a better place to post this let me know.

I (M) met my best friend, I’ll call her Violet (F) two years ago when we became lab partners in our sophomore chemistry class. After a while we talked, hit it off and became really close friends really fast over a lot of mutual experiences. Both of us had no real close friends at the time so we bonded really fast, but she may have had it worse, as for all I know I may have been her only friend for that time. 

Throughout the year I had three groups of friends that I would normally hangout with, one was a pair of girls that I met in my English class, a group of guys I would play Xbox with (6 total), and Violet.  During this time me and Violet were exceptionally close, we would talk everyday, see each other almost three times a week, and make memories that I would consider to be some of my favorites. We went to a lighthouse and took pictures on top, an aquarium a few miles away, and a picnic at a local park. Throughout all of this, I really fell in love with her. She was funny, she knew everything about me and vice versa, and she seemed to enjoy my presence, which made me feel better about myself. Sadly she never had the same feeling and that hurt, but I moved on and continued the friendship simply because she was so much fun to be around. 

I could go on for days about the memories we used to have, but at this point I’m not sure if they were actually as amazing as I remember them to be, or just a fantasy I created to cope with my attachment.  The point of this to to explain why I’m still here. 

Almost a year ago, I introduced all of the friends that I had to each other in a New Years party at my house, everyone got to know each other and all of them became friends. In almost a month, I went from three groups of friends to just one massive group of friends. Almost all my friends got along and we did lose a few but the ones that remained became some of my closest friends today.

 Around this point is where the dust starts to pickup and the sandstorm starts to form. Throughout the course of the next months, Violet would go on to date most of my closest guy friends, From one convoluted and confusing relationship to the next, she dated 6 guys in maybe 7 months time, 3 of which were my closest guy friends and the other 3 were their friends. Throughout all of this I’ve tried my hardest to maintain my friendship with her, but it was a challenge. 

To try to avoid bias, my guy friends were classic nerds. Never talked to girls, never had any girlfriends or any friends that are girls until New Years. They weren’t really experienced in dating and all of them made complete fools out of themselves with her, all doing some insane attempt at what they considered love. Obviously this caused major issues with all of my friends as more then once cheating was an issue with them. I say them as it wasn’t really her fault, more like the guy wasn’t able to control his hormones. I’m seriously glossing over a lot of drama and other events over a period of a year but I’m trying to avoid having to make this 8 pages long for each individual breakup. 

During the time when she was dating all of my friends I began to notice that sometimes when we were all hanging out, she would act like she didn’t like me whenever her boyfriends were around. Sometimes I would try to talk to her and just get blatantly Ignored because she didn’t want to talk to me. It happened multiple times where I would go someplace with her, one of her boyfriends would show up and in almost 6 minutes I’ve been boxed out of the conversation and would have to sit there awkwardly while they act like I don’t exist. 

As a high school senior I’ve only lived 17 years on this planet and I haven’t really made very many memories and probably haven’t lived through half of the shit that anyone reading this has gone through, but I have to say that the time last year from February to May were some of the worst times of my life. Due to a convoluted and outright ridiculous chain of events that I can’t even bother explaining, I took the fall for one of Violet’s failed relationships in an attempt to prevent my friend from being ousted from the group. The next months were a living hell for me, all of my friends up and abandoned me, even the ones I never thought would. Even the girl I was attempting to help refused to talk to me anymore. It’s one of the worst feelings I’ve ever experienced, to wake up and dread not only every part of your day, but also dread the future. Not only the next week or month, but when your at the point where it feels like you’ve lost everything and there’s nothing you can do about it. Everyone I knew turned their back on me. It’s something that haunts me to this day, most of my friends I see everyday but I can’t unsee what they did. Every time I see any of them, I can just hear myself thinking about how they wouldn’t be there for me when things go wrong, and to know that you truly can’t trust someone to stick up for you or at least stand by you makes it difficult to be their friend. How can I explain my best friends that they’re the reason I’m depressed. That’s not something you can just blurt out. 

Violet of course never answered me when I called her, never asked how I was, and never bothered to look at me anymore. Of course, being the train wreck on wheels, around late May some new Drama occurred and everyone moved on and forgot about me, so I was allowed back in. The first thing she said to me after three months of ignoring me was “we hanging out, bitch” 

After this all I can’t see her the same anymore. Most of the time I see her face and all it does is anger me. Like I get flashes of pure anger whenever I see her. It’s like that feeling you get when you look at someone you hate but for the life of me I still can’t say I hate her. I can say without a doubt that the joy I felt before is gone. She also never said sorry. That’s the one thing that amazes me. She never said she was sorry. I had to force her to apologize by bringing it up almost 4 months later.  It felt like one of the biggest betrayals of my life was just totally trivialized by the phrase “we hanging out, bitch”. Like one part of this friendship can detach and reattach at will and the Violets part of the boat just doesn’t even notice, until it inconvenienced   her. What a perfect summary of our friendship. 

Maybe it was karma or maybe it was just a coincidence but over the summer the game flipped. after the sandstorm had past and the dust settled, people caught on to what she was up too and she got basically kicked out of the whole group. No one talks to her anyone, and at least 70% of the group seriously hate her guts, some of the girls even threatened physical violence if they ever see her again. The other 30% dislike her with varying degrees of intensity. Some are indifferent, some prefer she stays away. 

Meanwhile Violet has started seeing a therapist and is trying to get help but it’s a difficult situation. It’s senior year and everyone’s worrying about college applications and internships we can barely see each other, especially her. Something I didn’t say but for all of Violets flaws, she is extremely hard working. She’s the picture perfect version of a shy girl that gets all of her work done, always gets 100 and is always studying. I believe she’s applying to Cornell and I bet her 100$ that she would get in. That’s how confident I am in her intelligence. She’s easily one of the smartest people I know. 

For the past 2 months I’ve been talking to her and trying to help her make new friends, while simultaneously trying to get my old friends to forgive her. I’ve managed to get the indifferent people to agree to hangout with her, and sometimes they even ask about how she’s doing and stuff like that since I’m the only one that talks to her anymore. 

I feel horrible when I think about her because all I can think about is the time when my friends left me and I was completely alone. It was easily the worst thing that’s ever happened to me and for the life of me I can’t imagine what must be happening to her. She’s not the type of person to go out and directly ask for help, because she would feel like she doesn’t deserve it. She also rarely cries, and the two times I’ve seen her cry were seriously tragic times, one of which wasn’t that long ago. Thinking about her going through what I went through kept me by her side. She used to tell me about how sad she was and how alone she’s been for the last two months which practically broke my heart. I feel horrible that my “best friend” is all alone, and could be really depressed with no friends to speak of. I’ve been trying to help her make new friends and in the beginning it seamed like it would work. 

But as the weeks progressed it seamed that she was becoming progressively more and more distant as time marched on. Eventually I discovered that she has a new boyfriend, let’s call him Greg, and they’ve been dating for maybe two weeks. See this is where I went “ah, now it makes sense why your distant, now we can work around this” and I attempted to work around this new issue. But now it seams like I’m some sideshow attraction that she can participate in whenever she chooses too. For the last week she’s been visiting me every other day during gym because I can’t participate due to my medical conditions and she has lunch. During this time we talk about current events and how she’s doing, but doing maybe 40% of the conversation, she’s on her phone texting Greg. Keep in mind she’s not answering my texts at all and comes close to ignoring me. Now I understand that he’s her boyfriend and I can’t expect the same treatment, but for someone you call your best friend, the least you could do is maintain a conversation without having to talk to someone else in the middle of it. 

 Furthermore, for some reason, every time she comes to my gym class now, she has to describe her previous lunch plans she made with other people and how they canceled so now she has time for me. This happens a lot where I finally get her to do something and then she explains to me about how her better plans fell through and now she has time for me, but twisting it in a way to make it seam like she’s the one who’s inconvenienced. I’m not sure why she’s doing this but it’s making me feel like some kind of optional activity for her that she can participate in whenever she wants and I have no say over anything because she never answers my texts or calls. 

Now after all of this I’m really starting to wonder if it’s really worth the effort to stay friends with her. Because sometimes she does care, she wrote me a nice letter in a heart that told me about how much she values me as a friend and how she’s sorry that she can’t talk ever, but in the same day she ignores me for her phone or lies to me about her plans. I fear that if I leave she’ll have no one that cares about her and she might even do something really stupid, I even had to call her mom once because I was having a panic attack after she called me crying. But on the other hand it feels like I’m just some tool she uses whenever she’s in-between boyfriends to maintain her self esteem. It feels being best friends mean two different things to each of us, and to her “best friend” just means the default person you hangout with because you have no one better to hangout with.  I don’t know if I should continue fighting to keep us together or just let go and let her drift away. If this makes no sense I’ll just delete it and resume my endless cycle of hell.

I used a throwaway account because she follows my main, apologies to those it may upset."
a2tvtl,4,2018-12-03,Do I have a nDad?,trottol,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a2tvtl/do_i_have_a_ndad/,"Hello everyone,

I (24F) have been wondering about my dad who could be narcissistic. So first I am going to list all the things that make me think he might be so, and then some thoughts on my doubts.  This turned out to be a very long post I have tried to make sign posts do it can be skimmed.

1. He is always angry- he comes home and I know that within one hour, he would go around the house throwing his head around (as if he was head-butting), visibly angry about god knows what. When he's home I would say he would be like that 70% of the time unless he's sleeping or exercising. He doesn't necessarily yell all the time. Usually he just yells insults at whatever thought or thing has made him  angry. E.g. he can't find something, or something falls, or he can't use his phone/computer (the phone gets the blame not him). But being around him when he's alone at home is extremely unpleasant, and I just stay still and tense the whole time.
2. He is often complaining about how people around him treat him like shit and disrespect him. Most of the time he just says it as a generic statement but in my personal experience this one example sticks out. I had a good friend and her friend from overseas over at my house for two nights. One of them was a friend of a friend and I didn't know him before he arrived. After a couple of nights, once my friends leave, I go on a little trip out of town with a guyfriend who is going back home to me and is going to stay at my place. My dad comes to pick us up and I can tell he's angry. I ask how's it going and he lashes out on how my friends were incredibly rude because they had never acknowledged him and that it was my fault for bringing people like that. He was especially mad at the friend of the friend that I didn't know. This was not true because also they had gotten him goodbye presents and they didn't manage to say farewell because he was sleeping. The reason why it struck me, was because it was incredibly humiliating in front of my friend and I also knew that those previous guests had never meant to disrespect him.
3. He loves to parade his achievements from work and exercise. If he did a PB of pull ups or something, he will send a message asking me to guess and then telling me the number. Sometimes he sends me (and to the rest of the family) videos of him doing this. In the family we just sort react with a 'cool, well done', but definitively not enthusiastic. I believe our reaction is due to the fact that he does this everyday. The thing about this is that he always says how he achieved something, but that at the same time it's not enough or that the achievement is useless because nobody appreciates it.
4. So the day can either be about his achievements or about how people around him (especially at work) have failed him and that he has always had to do amazing things in the horrible conditions he was put in. To be fair, he works in a hospital and some of the stories he tells are at times real absurd, but he would rather tell us, get angry (head-butt all the way through the day), and when you try to empathise he would just refuse it.
5. He has mood swings. He can be angry and then he can be happy in a hysteric way for no reason at all (usually happens around meal times).

So far I have described his behaviour when he brings the stuff that happened to him outside/at work in the house. I shall now describe

1. He likes to ask trick questions, especially about my field of expertise. When I tell him that it's complicated to answer and it's hard to generalise, he pulls out some answer that he read somewhere on the internet.
2. I am writing my thesis at the moment, and he told me he could write a thesis in my field of expertise but I couldn't write one in his.
3. When we argue it becomes non-sensical. Last time went like this. He asked me, whether I knew what was the position in his contract. Of course, this was a rhetorical question (which after this I realised it's a red flag). From this he started saying that despite all of his achievements and work he wasn't given a raise in his position. I told him that if he wanted the promotion, he could enquire about it rather than wait for his supervisor to change it for him. From this, he implied that I was telling him that he was an incompetent piece of shit (that were his words that never came out of my mouth). And then we started arguing, I don't even know about what, the only thing I know is that it turned it and accused me of not having brought him a gift for his birthday. To be honest I didn't do a gift to either of my parents this year because I have been tight on cash, a little overwhelmed with my own life and I would have rather waited for Christmas to do something I thought to be proper.
4. When I told him I got internships in some really hard and cool places to get in (the UN), he told me that this was good because I was going to get lots of money to do nothing.
5. He is very rude towards my (mentally healthy) partner. He barely says hi when he enters the room. I don't know exactly why he doesn't like him, but my guess it's because he doesn't consider my partner to be 'manly' or because my partner  is not of his same nationality.

To the family in general:

1. When my mum asks him to do something that is a chore he throws a tantrum, he doesn't necessarily insult her, but he will make it visible how upset she has made him with the request.
2. When he fixes something, he loves to parade it around by drawing attention.
3. Tells my sister that if she fails a class at school, then he will not pay for her uni.
4. Tells me that me and my generation are the 'real thinking' generation and that my sister's is useless.
5. However with my sister will play the part of the partner in crime to gang up against my mum.
6. At dinner if he's angry or thinking his own thoughts then won't listen to anybody's conversation.
7. Has definitively cheated on my mum since I was a kid.

How do I feel around him:

1. I always feel guilty, like I have to fix something when I am around him.
2. I feel guilty about spending his money.
3. When I snap I always feel like I need to reassure that I didn't mean to snap and that I care for him.
4. I always feel like I don't have to say anything because it could potentially be a trigger.
5. I want to be around him the least amount of time as possible.
6. When we eat all together I try not to look at him in the eye, out of fear it could trigger some response out of him.

The sad thing is that he wasn't always like this. Or at least, as a child I don't remember him being so angry. But once the process started it has only been getting worse. I don't know maybe I am wrong?

Do you think he could be a narcisistic dad?

Either way I am grateful to have found this community."
a2uhz0,18,2018-12-03,Anyone here worked for Dynetics?,Jk1123,HuntsvilleAlabama,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntsvilleAlabama/comments/a2uhz0/anyone_here_worked_for_dynetics/,I am an EE student and am thinking about applying for an internship at Dynetics. Can anyone tell me about working for them? Are they a good company to work for? 
a2vtbb,0,2018-12-03,"I am an intern, about to get a full-time job offer. My performance lately has sucked. Worried that management will lowball me because of that?",pfthrowaway852,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a2vtbb/i_am_an_intern_about_to_get_a_fulltime_job_offer/,"I am a college student, and as part of my program, the school offers a paid internship program.  You work for a real-world company for 8 months to gain experience, the company gets a tax credit, it's good stuff.  The internship itself is 8 months long, and the way the school structures the internship, you end up working for 8 months straight, then going back to school for the final four-month semester before you graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

During the internship, I found the company to be a great fit, and the found the same with me.  So much so that they asked me to remain on part time when I went back to school, and floated the idea of going full-time once I do graduate, which has firmed up to the point that HR is definitely working on the paperwork.  Perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this semester has been a disaster.  Not only am I working 30 hours plus attending a full course load of classes with related studying/assignments, but I lost a parent in September, and have been suffering from depression from that, and the stress of work and school combined.  As such, my performance in the last four months has been really, really poor compared to what I was doing from January to August.  I was kicking ass back then and lately, I am not being very productive.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I am nearly done.  I have two assignments due in the next week and then finals next week, and then I'm 100% done and will be able to focus up, clear my shit, deal with my parent's death, deal with my depression, just fix my whole shit.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I am paranoid that my company is going to give me a crap job offer due to my crap performance, even though this is a recent development and not indicative of my past or future performance, and I know how much developers in my position in my company should make.  Do I proactively meet with my manager and basically point out the fact that my life has been a garbage fire while I've been back and school?  Wait for the job offer and see if they do give me a low offer, then counter?  When I counter, do I offer the fact that I know I've been doing poorly lately and will get everything back in order?  I genuinely love my job and I will be able to do so much better so soon, but if they lowball me because I had a shitty four months, I'm going to be so demotivated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any thoughts."

For this season, 20 castaways, divided into tribes by age, travelled to the Austrian Central Alps to compete for the title of sole survivor! 

Enjoy this season, it was really fun!

[**Austrian Alps - Battle of the Ages**](http://brantsteele.net/survivor/nicaragua/r.php?c=pfsiMANX)

Also, next season is game changers! I'm thinking of doing a champions vs contendors theme, a tribe of winners vs a tribe of people who haven one, but I might not. Depends on how many winners I bring back! Anyway, I would love it if you guys gave some cast suggestions. I'm definitely thinking some old school people like Odessa, Aiden, Danny, Sunada, Kelsey, Dakota and some new school people like Jack, Blaire from this season, Bob, Li-Soo, Winnie and Rita. Please give me all of your suggestions, I really appreciate it!  

&gt;!I really liked this season, it was really fun! To start of, we have the Pauline, Buff, Penny alliance narrowly taking control of their tribe, and the four girls on the Jung tribe blindsiding Berty after he practically votes himself out. The Quila blindside was great with Trey flipping, really set him up as a power player for the rest of the season. After the swap, I thought the new Jung tribe was going to be really interesting, since no one really trusted eachother and everyone was in different alliances on their original tribe, but that tribe for the one time they went to tribal was fairly original tribe strong, which was countered by a great play by Aunt Meggie. But the new Alt tribe really exceeded all expectations, with Blaire playing her idol for Penny for some reason, and a new cross tribal alliance forming. But then the next vote Blaire, Matt and Trey blindside Penny, who Blaire played the idol on last time! This was either a great or terrible move by Blaire. They gained trust in Penny so they could blindside her next time, but she also wasted an idol. After that, I was surprised to see the old Jung at Alt tribe turn on eachother. The merge vote was interesting, with A.Z. wasting is idol on Georgette, and Johnny J going. The next episode was great, with Darryl blindsiding Georgette with his idol, but unfortunately he still went the next vote. Then Oliver idoled A.Z. out, but Oliver then just went home the next episode. The Ari blindside was great, didn’t see it coming, especially Aleran turning on Ari, her number one ally, and Aunt Maggie going against her alliance. However, Aleran turning on Ari caused her to go next. Then Trey went, which was sad. I liked Trey this season, he was great pre-merge, but definitely dropped down a bit post merge. At the final four, after Blaire lost the challenge, I thought for sure she was going, but Buff got blindsided! In the final three, I thought Blaire had it for sure. She was a strategic and physical force, but Aunt Meggie snatched the title which really surprised me! I thought Pauline and Blaire had played better games, since Aunt Meggie was on the bottom of so many votes, but she did make some good moves to survive like creating the alliance with Buff and Pauline, and her FTC must have been great.!&lt;

&gt;!Overall, really fun season! My favourites were Aunt Maggie, Blaire, Pauline and Trey. Looking forward to game changers!!&lt;

a2z3ms,1,2018-12-04,Antwoord op vragen van het lid Moorlag over dreigende acties bij Tennet,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/a2z3ms/antwoord_op_vragen_van_het_lid_moorlag_over/,"^(Vragen van het lid Moorlag &amp;#40;PvdA&amp;#41; aan de minister van Economische Zaken en Klimaat over dreigende acties bij Tennet &amp;#40;Ingezonden 31 oktober 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1. Kent u het bericht 'TenneT laat cao-ultimatum verlopen, vakbonden komen met verrassingsacties'? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2. Hoe hebben de cao-onderhandelingen, in een bedrijfstak waar doorgaans via de weg van overleg en onderhandelingen nieuwe cao’s worden afgesloten, kunnen uitmonden in een impasse, een ultimatum van de werknemersorganisaties en dreiging van collectieve acties?   
&amp;nbsp;    
5. Deelt u de mening van TenneT dat het bedrijf met een andere arbeidsmarkt te maken heeft dan de regionale netwerkbedrijven? Zo ja, waar bestaat dit verschil met betrekking tot de arbeidsmarkt uit en rechtvaardigt dat dat TenneT een eigen cao nodig heeft? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Tot 1 mei 2018 maakte TenneT deel uit van de bestaande raam-cao voor &amp;#40;regionale&amp;#41; netbeheerders. Nu TenneT als de netbeheerder van het hoogspanningsnet andere kenmerken heeft dan een beheerder van het regionale net, onder meer door de internationale context waarin TenneT opereert en TenneT’s grootschalige offshore activiteiten, acht TenneT het efficiënter om een eigen integrale raam/bedrijfscao aan te gaan. Hierdoor ontstond een nieuw uitgangssituatie die voor een nieuwe dynamiek tussen de gesprekspartners zorgde.    
&amp;nbsp;    
3. Wat is de actuele stand van zaken met betrekking tot de onderhandelingen over een cao voor het personeel van TenneT?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik begrijp dat TenneT voornemens is in gesprek te blijven met de vakbonden. Ik kan niet vooruit lopen op de uitkomst van eventuele verdere gesprekken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4. Heeft de Nederlandse Staat als 100% aandeelhouder van TenneT Nederland formeel of informeel invloed op deze onderhandelingen? Zo ja, waar bestaat die invloed uit?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Cao-onderhandelingen zijn een zaak tussen werkgever en werknemer. De aandeelhouder heeft hierbij geen formele rol. Dit neemt niet weg dat ik graag verneem wat de uitkomsten van de gesprekken tussen de werkgever en de werknemers zijn.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6. Acht u het mogelijk dat eventuele acties van het personeel de leveringszekerheid op enigerlei wijze in gevaar kunnen brengen? Zo ja, waar denkt u dan aan? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
TenneT heeft mij laten weten dat de publieke belangen, waaronder leveringszekerheid van elektriciteit, niet in gevaar zijn. De beschikbaarheid van elektriciteit is van vitaal belang voor Nederland en dient ten alle tijden gewaarborgd te zijn.   
&amp;nbsp;    
7. Kunnen collectieve &amp;#40;verrassings&amp;#41;acties anderszins publieke belangen schaden, welke stappen worden gezet en welke voorzieningen worden getroffen om de publieke belangen te borgen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
TenneT heeft intern vastgesteld welke processen binnen de bedrijfsvoering vitaal zijn. Dit zijn netveiligheid en markt gerelateerde processen, oftewel de elektriciteitsvoorzieningsprocessen. Voorafgaand aan eventuele acties zal er een veiligheidsoverleg plaatsvinden tussen TenneT en de vakbonden om te borgen dat de leveringszekerheid niet in gevaar komt. Als zodanig, heb ik samen met TenneT dan ook geen reden om aan te nemen dat de publieke belangen in gevaar zijn of dat er aanleiding is om voorzieningen te treffen voor het additioneel borgen van de publieke belangen.

a2zgi7,2,2018-12-04,Do you ever feel stuck with Yoga?,alwaysapractice,yoga,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/a2zgi7/do_you_ever_feel_stuck_with_yoga/,"Hello yogis of Reddit, 

&amp;#x200B;

So a little background on me: I've been practicing yoga for about 6-7 years. I'm a doctor (intern) and I'm certified in Hatha yoga 200h. 

I had a wrist injury 2-3 years ago which in addition to everything that was going on in my life at the time made me stop practicing asana and most forms of self care (meditation, yogic philosophy...) 

After what seems like a 2 year long emotional roller-coaster, I feel finally ready to get my life, my body and my lifestyle back in order. Needless to say I feel I have lost so much of my identity these 2 years, I'm overweight, unhappy, my physical practice is that of a beginner, my body is weak and unbalanced, and so is my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, now that I'm determined to get things back in order, I kind of feel stuck. In the sense that I need to go the yogic route. I feel pressured to practice asana to heal my body, to practice the teachings to balance my mind.... but the truth is my intuition is telling me to go about it other ways: (Gym, meditation, study buddhist and zen teachings...). 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that eventually I will go with what my intuition is telling me. But how can I stop feeling resentful of Yoga? I feel like since I'm a ""teacher"" I should embrace this opportunity to practice as a beginner so that I can be a better teacher to my beginner students.... I feel that since I know and believe in the healing power of yoga I should go that route. But the truth is I just don't want to, for now.

Is it because I'm resentful or pushing back because I feel pressured to do so? or is it normal to have a falling out and then come back to the practice (or not).

This will be quite long, so I will post a TL:DR at the end, which is posted under the break. I will also be including summaries of conversations, because some is just irrelevant. Some information has been changed in the .0004 percent chance she has a reddit.  


So slight backstory, I am a recent college graduate, and my mom is a student at the college I was attending.   


So my mom had a tupperware party a few weeks back. There was a girl who was supposed to come to the party, but couldn't. Since she couldn't, she stopped by my house to drop off her order to my mom. I ended up walking into the living room from my room and saw her. So I had a slight conversation with her and my mom. This was the first time I have ever met her, or talked to her in general for that matter. She leaves, sends me a friend request on facebook, and I message her right away. This was around 7 PM, and we talked until 1:30 AM. We talked about potentially making plans to hang out, and decided for the next day.  (November 14th to be exact). She comes over around 5 PM, and we literally sit and talk for hours, until about 1 again. She did drop the hint that she had class with my mom last semester, and creeped on me slightly, but I had a girlfriend at the time, and she didn't want to send me a friend request. Anyways, we had dinner and watched movies. She ends up staying the night because the roads got bad. We end up hooking up. Wakes up in the morning, we cuddle and talk, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

We text for about a week, and everything is going great. We would literally text in the morning until night almost daily, talk on the phone, FaceTime, the works. So I may be attached a bit too early, and that might be my issue, but I have a HUGE attraction to this girl, as she has most of her stuff together and she is very sweet and gets along great with my mother and father.

One day I texted her asking what she wanted from this who relationship fwb thing, and she essentially says she doesn't want anything because of her upcoming internship that could be hours away. Okay I am fine with that, upset but not worried, as I would still wanna be friends.

Another day, she brought it up to me and said she enjoys me a lot and would like to try it and see what happens. ""I would want to be with you""

Awesome right?

&amp;#x200B;

I ask her when we are going to hang out, and she says eventually. I get she is busy with school, so I am not worried. The Sunday after thanksgiving, she randomly shows up to surprise me, after asking my mom if it was okay with her if she came over at around 8 or 9, because she was coming home from visiting family. My mom happily says yes, because I told my mom I genuinely like this girl. She studies with my mom for a few hours, and afterwards we watch a movie in my room, and she leaves to go home. Everything is still going semi smooth at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

We made plans that evening to have me stay the night at her apartment this past Wednesday. We talked Monday and Tuesday, but not as much (again, I am assuming school stuff). Wednesday comes, and I go to pick her up, we go to dinner and go to the store so I could get some allergy medicine. (Here is where it gets iffy for me). We go to her apartment, and she says she wants to drink a little. Okay, that's fine, so we drink a little, she gets a little drunk, and we play candy land. After candy land we go to her bed, watch a movie and go to bed. When I wake up, she is studying, so...

 I say ""Hey, I know you have stuff to do, so text me later."" 

she said ""okay"".

summarization of next text messages, I thank her for hanging out, and apologize for overstaying since she had school stuff. no issue from her. I text her goodnight, she read it and nothing. I text her the next morning, read again. Then I text  her later and ask if we are okay, she responds and says ""yeah I am just busy and stressed"" again, perfectly fine with that, just wanna know.

Fast forward to Friday night, my mom asks me to text her to see if she is still coming over to study. So I do, and she says yes, but she can't hangout as she has to study. Okay perfect, I get it, as I just graduated. I am in my room when she gets here, but I go out and say ""Come say bye before you leave."" She does, gives me a kiss, and a hug. I text her when she leaves saying ""let me know when you get home"" and read again. Then I ask if we can make plans one day next (Now this week) if she can make time. read again.

Then I send a text saying I know she is stressed and busy, but I don't wanna bug her, or add to the stress but I wanna know what is going on. Read again.

&amp;#x200B;

Then comes Saturday after 3 days of being ignored. I go downtown to the bars with some friends of mine (guys) and we meet up with some mutual friends (girls). I post on my snap story a video of two of the girls singing and having fun and laughing, and then I pan to my one buddy. She comments

""interesting"", and then cue argument of how it isn't okay that I am hanging out with girls downtown. I stated how I haven't heard from her in days, and I thought I did something wrong, and she said that she is just stressed and she gets like this (not answering her phone) when it comes to schoolwork. She said it'll be like this until the day she takes her last final.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL:DR   
There is a girl that my mom has class with, that I have hung out with, stayed the night with, and actually have feelings for (after about a month), who has essentially been ignoring me for 5 days now since I stayed at her apartment. She also got mad at me for posting a video on social media of two of my female friends while I was at a bar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit, am I being weird or are there a ton of mixed signals?I also don't want this ""relationship""to have an influence on her and my mom in regards to schooling. My mom is clearly a non-traditional student, and this girl has helped my mom quite a bit.   


Any advice or anything for that matter would be great. "

a30vkw,3,2018-12-04,Armenians help,ANCAgrassroots,ANCA,https://www.reddit.com/r/ANCA/comments/a30vkw/armenians_help/," 

Armenians help. 

That's who we are. That's what we do. 

We lend a hand, and we don't run from a fight. 

It's always been like this. From the time of your parents and grandparents, all the way back to our earliest history as a nation. 

We've seen the results: Against great odds, today we have a democratic Armenia, a free Artsakh, and a powerful Diaspora. 

Here in Washington, our community's investments in the ANCA have paid big dividends, building us into an effective national lobby - respected by experts, trusted by friends, and attacked by our enemies. 

Thanks to you, we're a ""second army"" of the Armenian nation, waging policy battles across the American political landscape for Armenia's security and Artsakh's survival. 

That's the good news. But with Turkey and Azerbaijan escalating their attacks, our pro-Armenian advocacy is needed more than ever. 

Just check out the recent video (on the ANCA FB page: ) of Erdogan doubling down on Armenian Genocide denial - to the point of suggesting it was Armenians who committed genocide against Turks! Here's the link: https://www.facebook.com/ancagrassroots/videos/372220063527023/

Clearly, the stakes are high, and the risks are real. 

It's true that Armenia's making progress, but Erdogan's Turkey is spinning out of control, Aliyev's Azerbaijan is driving the region toward war, and U.S. tensions with Russia and Iran are on the rise. 

On top of all this, starting January, more than 20% of Congress will have little first-hand knowledge of Armenia, and will know even less about the threats that Erdogan and Aliyev pose to our homeland. 

We need your secure online donation today to help educate more than 90 first-time U.S. Representatives and Senators about our homeland and heritage. 

Thankfully, the ANCA's engineered to thrive amid change. In the best of both our Armenian and American democratic traditions, we're leveraging local grassroots activism to drive bipartisan advocacy strengthening the U.S-Armenia partnership. 

At the same time, we are pushing back aggressively - on Capitol Hill, in the State Department, and across Washington - against the toxic lies that Turkey and Azerbaijan tell about Artsakh and the Armenian Genocide. 

Just this past week, we supported a delay in the confirmation of a new U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan to give Congress time to review a reckless proposal to sell U.S. arms to Baku. 

All this work takes time and resources. And, because of your past support, we are off to a strong start. Much more needs to be done, which is why, this Christmas season, I am asking you to give as generously as you can. 

We don't need to match what Aliyev and Erdogan are spending, but we do need your help. So please invest today in our defense of Armenia and Artsakh with an end-of-year Christmas gift. 

With your renewed support, we'll start 2019 with momentum on all of our policy priorities: 

  \-- Generating bipartisan American support for a secure Armenia, a free Artsakh, and stronger U.S. relations with Armenia's new government. 

  \-- Educating Americans about the Velvet Revolution and Armenia's truly remarkable progress in promoting democracy and fighting corruption. 

  \-- Publicizing the benefits of increased U.S.-Armenia commerce, a bilateral Tax Treaty, Social Security Agreement, and non-stop LAX to EVN flights. 

  \-- Ending U.S. enforcement of Ankara's Armenian Genocide gag-rule, putting America on the side of justice for this still unpunished crime. 

  \-- Appropriating U.S. funds for Armenia's economic growth and Artsakh's development, especially de-mining and rehabilitation services. 

  \-- Holding Azerbaijan accountable for its cross-border aggression against Artsakh and Armenia, through cease-fire monitoring technology. 

  \-- Securing millions in U.S. debt-forgiveness and technical assistance in exchange for Armenia sustainably reforesting to pre-1990 levels. 

  \-- Reinforcing the religious connections that people of faith across the American heartland feel with Armenia, the world's first Christian nation. 

  \-- Advancing fresh initiatives, like a $140 million Millennium Challenge Corporation compact for high tech programs in Armenia's public schools. 

  \-- Challenging U.S. sanctions on Iran or Russia that unduly, unfairly, or improperly impact Armenia, America's friend and regional partner. 

  \-- Supporting Armenia as a safe haven for tens of thousands of Armenians and other at-risk Christian refugees fleeing violence in the Middle East. 

  \-- Getting full credit in Washington for Armenia's membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace and participation in global peacekeeping. 

  \-- Leveraging coalitions with faith-based groups, ethnic organizations, human rights advocates, and allies across the American political spectrum. 

  \-- Providing free housing and training for recent Armenian American graduates starting political, policy-making, government, and media careers in Washington.

We are especially proud of what we're doing for our youth: Our Hovig Apo Saghdejian Capital Gateway Program, with a 93% success rate, has launched hundreds of Armenian American careers in our nation's capital. We've trained hundreds more as pro-Armenian advocates via our Leo Sarkisian Summer Internship. Both operate out of the Aramian House, our landmark, eight-bedroom property in downtown Washington that provides free housing for participants. 

The progress we're making today and the investments we're making for tomorrow are possible because of you. If you're a first-time giver, please help at any level you can. 

If you've given before, please considering increasing your contribution or signing up as a sustaining, monthly donor. 

Whether you support the political advocacy work of the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA - not tax-deductible) or the educational efforts of the ANCA Endowment Fund (tax-deductible), you'll be proud of the difference you're making for our community and cause.

One day my boss tells me to go replace some computer monitors and store the old ones in a small warehouse we have. I replace the stuff and as I get to the warehouse I notice the only free spot I have for the monitors is the top shelf, wich I cant reach on my own even more carrying a a 5-8kg monitor. I tell him that I cant reach it and he tells me to get the ladder to get up there and as im telling him I still wouldn't be able to reach it he tells me ""Idc how you do it, just do it"" so I go back and as prepare to go up the ladder I notice it has some parts broken. I go to the office again to tell him that the ladder is broken and he just  screams saying ""idc just put everything back where it was when you finish"", without even hearing me.

At this point im pissed. I could climb onto a lower shelf and put small stuff in the top one so I put all the mouse pads in the top shelf knowing he would have to use the ladder to go get them and I got place to the monitors (playing tetris helped) by putting them in a way where u kinda had to take them all at the same time or meticulously take each one and I also put the ladder back where it was.

Some days later, everyone quiet when suddenly you just hear a loud banging. He went to get the mouse pads, broke the ladder and when ""falling"" he grabbed onto a monitor bringing that and 2others down to the ground.

I never felt so good
He prob wont get fired cuz he has been here for long."

So I currently am a post-baccalaureate-part time grad student in UNC at the Information Science program. I graduated undergrad with a 3.1 gpa (sigh I know) in May 2018. After I got an internship over this summer and applied for the post-bacc program so I could take 2 Info-Science grad classes this semester (which I'm almost done with!).

&amp;#x200B;

After this semester I plan to study for my GRE as well as take 2 more courses for the 2019 Spring Semester than apply to the program in April! I currently work full time as a Software Support Engineer in Raleigh as well so when I apply I will have 7 months of professional experience. So if I get accepted I will quit my fulltime and go into the program to take a full semester. I also am potentially getting a letter rec from my professor in the Info-Sci program to hopefully help me in this process.

&amp;#x200B;

So after next semester I will have:

\-4 classes completed (1 semester load, so into the program I only have 3/4 semesters left)

\-7 months of work experience

\-1 letter rec from a professor in the program

&amp;#x200B;

So what are my chances? I know my gpa is not up to par, but will taking courses and hopefully getting a high GRE be enough? I do not want to be overly optimistic, but it is my dream to do the grad program here. Thank you so much!"

a34dg9,1,2018-12-04,18 y/o had to take a leave of absence from college due to concussion/mental health issues looking for advice on how to proceed. (More details below),guacamolepaperclip,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a34dg9/18_yo_had_to_take_a_leave_of_absence_from_college/,"Hi everyone. I am an eighteen-year-old who just graduated high school. In September I left to go to college for the first time and quickly realized the school I had to choose was not for me. Most of those around me agreed and it created a very negative environment and I spent most of my time smoking weed (which I regret). On top of that, I had a severe concussion causing me to not be able to attend classes for multiple weeks carrying through Thanksgiving break. 
   

The concussion greatly affected my already existing depression/anxiety, and I decided since there were only two weeks left in the semester that it would be best to withdraw from classes and head home to recover. The school offers a service where, due to my medical issues, I can come back next semester and just retake the classes again. The issue is that my family has severe financial struggles. The cost of going back next semester is roughly 9k and on top of that, we have to move so my dad will already be struggling for money (single parent). This combined with my previous discontent for the school has made me think it would be best to take next semester off to get a job and apply to the local state school for next fall where tuition is almost 2k per year (est with financial aid). 
   

This is where the need for advice comes in. To be honest, I, like most other 18-year-olds, have no clue if any of the decisions I'm making are correct, or are good for me in the long run. My area of interest is tech/cybersecurity and I already have two summers worth of experience as an IT intern, but looking for internships next semester all require current college enrollment or more qualifications than I have. Should I try to secure an internship in my field of interest or is it best to get any job I can find to help ease the financial burden on my parents? Or should I just take students loans and go back to the school I disliked for the rest of the year? Another idea I had if I was unable to get the internship was to try studying up on my own and earning an A+ certificate. I will give any additional information requested and am extremely open to advice. 

Thank you

a36j7p,22,2018-12-04,Being gifted is not a quality of your brain. It merely states that you process information quicker and more efficiently than others.,Gedachteganger,Gifted,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/a36j7p/being_gifted_is_not_a_quality_of_your_brain_it/,"*In other words being gifted is a ‘quantitative’ capability, meaning you have more neurons (to receive information) and more axons (to do something with that information) than an average person. For example an average person’s brain processes 23.000 signals per second, a gifted brain could be able to do double that. What being gifted doesn’t tell you is the quality of your brain. Autism’s and personality disorders are examples of one’s brain quality. 

Hi, I’m new here and read a few posts and concluded that a lot of people are struggling with their ‘giftedness’ just like I did. So I thought to chime in. 

Until very recently I thought I was the world’s laziest and cold hearted sob. This will be a long (LONG) and (for me) cathartic story. Keep in mind I’m not a professional, everything I write is my experience and interpretation of information given by my therapists. To remind you of this fact, I’ve started several paragraphs with an asterisks(*). Feel free to ask me in the comments or pm.

I’m 29 years old and recently I’ve concluded that I’m gifted. To help whom it may concern, I will tell you my life’s story. This will illustrate the problems I’ve come across and how I now deal with them.

———

Last year I was doing my final internship in order to graduate. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to complete it. That triggered the worst, first and strangest panic attack. Heart beating 202bps, sweating, cold hands and feet, dizzy, hyperventilating and completely calm and rational... called my doctor, whom arrived at the same conclusion I did and told me to “take two of these”...

I pursued other careers and studies and didn’t finish any. I have no real hobbies, I have 5 close friends whom I try to see at least twice a year but don’t always succeed. I’ve had a troublesome childhood with somewhat abusive parents and minor substance abuse. At this point I slipped in a severe depression and admitted to myself that I had a problem and that I needed professional help to deal with it. 

So I went to my doctor’s who referred me to a mental healthcare provider. After my intake I got 3 possible diagnoses. Autism’s, personality disorder or gifted. I was assigned a team consisting of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a system therapist, psychomotor therapist and a diagnostician. After some testing they’ve concluded that I didn’t have any autism’s and that I some markers for narcissism and OCD, but to few to definitively say ‘this’ is what’s wrong with you. But in order to treat me they thought it best to treat me for the markers I was exhibiting and for 10 months I was told to be a narcissist with OCD. 

This treatment didn’t feel right, I read the DSM-V and wasn’t convinced. So I asked if they ruled out giftedness. Because I read online that gifted people often are misdiagnosed as having autism’s or a personality disorder. And given my somewhat inconclusive test results... “No, we didn’t test you for that, being gifted is not something curable and therefor untreatable. We can work with the markers you have.” 

*I had narcissistic deflection because of an unfortunate childhood and this was my coping mechanism. And my need for clarity and the way I rationalize everything was some form of OCD. And the fact I had anger issues were due to these 2 things. 

These were their other arguments not to test me for giftedness...

I lost all confidence in the people that were treating me. Sure I have personality traits that at the moment inhibit me from having a full life. But I strongly believed that to become wholesome again I needed to understand why I am the person I am today. Which meant to have a definitive answer whether I’m gifted or not. 

I quit my treatment, because I felt they couldn’t provide with the help I needed. Furthermore my time being there made me insecure to a point I couldn’t even recognize myself anymore. 

Luckily within my network of people there was a therapist specializing in gifted children. She couldn’t treat me, but if I needed some information to help clarify things she would help me. The first thing she said to me: “Being gifted and having a personality disorder are completely separate things. Being gifted is nothing more than having more neurons and axons.”

*You receive and act on more information than the average person. So there is need for more structure/clarity. Chaos is frustrating and if you can’t solve that you’re likely to express that with intense emotions like anger or depression. 

At that moment I broke down and cried. Something I rarely do, but I was so relieved to speak with someone who understood me. 


-I disliked school, because it’s slow and repetitive.
-I have few good friends, because having friends is exhausting (also very nice and love the ones I have to bits, but exhausting😉)
-At a young age I already liked wine, cigars, the symphony and disliked loud ‘dumb’ music. 
-I avoid people I know I can’t have a conversation with that extends beyond: “Hey, how you doin’?”
-I have little longtime interests or hobbies, but am curious about nearly everything.
-I can be wildly interested or passionate about something one moment and its gone the next. I’m the definition of monkey see monkey do, once I see things I can replicate it no matter the degree of difficulty. That’s also the reason I quickly lose interest in things. Which makes me the poster boy for ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’.
-I was the worst teenager, I would question (and combat) every irrational rule set by my school and parents. 
-There was ‘minor’ substance abuse from my teens to early twenties. 
-I have the nose of a bloodhound.
-I’m an expert in body language, but e.g. not really able to really comfort a person in need.
-To a degree I have an impeccable memory. 
-I do nothing without a thought-out reason. (Remember Sheldon? He sits in that particular spot, because he can see the television without distortion but also have a conversation. It’s warm in the winter, but not to warm. It gets a breeze in the summer etc. I’m like that, with everything, always. Happens in a split of a second.)
I am different.

*These are markers for being gifted. And these things also made me doubt the diagnoses of narcissism and OCD. “But this is what my ‘team of professionals’ told me so it must be true, right?!” ... Luckily I didn’t give up and found somebody who’d really listen to me and confirm my suspicions. 

*Giftedness states a quantitative capability, while a personality disorder or autism’s reflect the quality of your brain. Therefor being gifted and a personality disorder(or autism’s) aren’t mutually exclusive. For instance a normal person can see a smile and think that person is happy about something. A gifted person can look at that same smile and notice other (micro)expressions like no wrinkles around the eyes, posture, intonation etc. and conclude that the person is rather depressed and trying to hide his emotions as to not burden you, by ways of smiling. Both the normal and gifted person see the smile and can make a conclusion on the amount of information they get. Whereas someone with autism’s or a personality disorder isn’t able to see the expressions at all. To even further clarify: First person’s a car, second’s a bus and the third is a boat. All are modes of transportation, where one just holds more passengers than the others, but there’s one wildly different than the others. 
And that wildly different one could be a dinghy or a freighter. See what I’m getting at?

Now knowing this and having accepted that I’m gifted -on it’s own- doesn’t really help me with the problems I was facing. Mainly the fact I don’t finish things, get angry very quickly etc. So I went on to find someone to help me with that. 

This last person was able to complete the narrative with just 2 sessions and as of Nov 13 I’m confident again, therapist free and ready to start living again.

*A normal brain processes 23.000 signals a second, whereas a gifted brain could be much more. With that in mind there are 3 phases you go through in life. First is a ‘we-phase’ this is where you’re imprinted with information like who your parents are and that parents no matter what mean security. Here you basically become a copy of your parents which ends around 5 years old. The second phase is a me-phase, where you develop your individuality and the ability to create. During this phase you become you. This phase ends with your sexual activity, around 16/17. Now you’ve entered the third phase which again is a we-phase, but now is the phase where you’re trying to find a life partner, build a home and have children etc. 

So I wrote about abusive parents. Yes they were abusive but not really in a sexual or violent way. (I am non native, born and bred in the west) First of all my parents don’t share their feelings, so I copied that. In their culture it’s better not to stand out and to blindly obey your parents. So by the time I was developing my individuality I was forced by my parents to do what I was told, there was no place for ‘me’. And the fact I began to question irrational rules and disregard my parents was a recipe for major disaster, resulting in extreme shouting matches, fists through doors and the occasional physical altercations. And now I’m in my second we-phase. I didn’t know who I was and what I really like to do, so I don’t finish things. I wouldn’t talk about my feelings with my partner. And whenever I don’t understand something I throw a tantrum. 

*So it works like this. Your Brain receives a signal, that signal triggers a Feeling (feelings are internal) how you respond to that feeling lies in your Past. And the past dictates the corresponding Emotion (emotions are external) 

I receive and act on a lot of information because I’m gifted. I’ve experienced angry parents more intensely for example. 

* When your young you develop coping mechanisms to make sure things don’t hurt to much. These coping mechanisms are very basic fight, flight, freeze responses. These were useful as a child, not so much as an adult...

So I’m a fighter. I am very much my own person, it’s not that I don’t enjoy learning, but school’s just boring and slow. E.g. as a little boy I get calculus. Sure I understand that 3 times 6 equals 18. Can we please move on? But I’m bluntly denied and my feelings are disregarded. I Have to ‘practice’ , what I Needed wasn’t up for debate... I feel I’m not acknowledged and that when I try to talk about it I get ignored. E.g. So whenever I’m faced with something I must do because someone says so, I get angry and tell ‘em to go fuck them selfs. 

*All these feelings need to be expressed through emotions, if you do not do this, you’ll keep them bottled up inside which will result in stress, anxiety, depression, aggression, physical discomfort, etc. 

This explains why in my teens I was abusing substances. I had all these bottled up feelings I didn’t allow to express and to cope with the stress I turned to substance abuse. When I quit all that, all those feelings came rushing back and with no adequate coping mechanism I got panic attacks, anxiety and a depression and got very quickly, very angry...


This man told me to stop depending on my child coping mechanism and become an adult. And to do that was pretty simple. When I get triggered, take a breath and try to define what I’m feeling and instead of immediately getting angry or something, search within myself what happened in my past that I have this strong feeling about and share that with the person that caused me to feel this way. This way you grow understanding and even better: little by little you are letting feelings out of the bottle and are decreasing pressure!

So now with all that information I’m able to accept who I am and I am able to explain myself to others. “Yes I don’t talk a lot when I’m in a group. No, that doesn’t make me weird. I just never feel like I belong and I don’t really like small talk.” Instead of getting angry because someone thinks I’m weird... 

I know I’m prone to depression, I am not average, I can’t deal with stress, and because I’m gifted I should plan my life accordingly. And that’s okay. 

Since then I haven’t had a neuropsychological test to determine my IQ or anything and I don’t feel the need anymore to do so. I know I am, because it feels right.

*You are your best psychologist and everyone needs a helping hand once in a while. So find someone who talks With you instead of At you. And when you feel you’re one the right track and your loved ones agree, you know you’re doing something good. 

You have reached the end.
Congratulations (if you read this on the toilet, I bet your ass is really cold by now😂)  and in all sincerity:

Thank you.

(I'm not referring to long term gains and unrealized gains). This year, I'm on track to generate anywhere between $45,000-60,000 in passive income. (I make estimated tax payments for this).

&amp;#x200B;

This past summer, I landed my first paid internship that was located in New York City. (I'm not a resident of New York City - I live upstate. I sublet an apartment for the 2 months I was there. Mentioning this since New York City has an additional local tax whereas my county does not).

&amp;#x200B;

I allocated 0 allowances for both state and federal on my W-4. According to my compensation summary from my employer, my total compensation and benefits was exactly $4,933.07. I added up my paychecks and they summed up to $3,557.84. So that leaves about 30% withheld?

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time contributing to Roth. Since I have other monies, I'd like to contribute as much as allowed.  I've heard that you contribute after-tax dollars. But since my total compensation was less than the federal maximum, how much am I allowed to contribute?"

I have no friends excluding my Discord group,  and I'm more or less content staying in my room if I'm not at work/school. My older sister, who was also an **INFJ**, was my only friend/confidant to whom **actually** understood but this marks the 3rd year since she passed away. Now, all I have are my books, writing, maladaptive daydreaming, music, and art to keep me company. I can't seem to connect with anyone these days who only care about one-night stands, endless drama, or being plain shallow. Having *huge* trust issues due to toxic people from my past just puts the cherry on top, 🍒. But if I don't fit any of those categories then there's something wrong with me as others have kindly pointed out. *""How can you make friends/get a boyfriend if you don't go out to parties?""* 

I'm in therapy/taking antidepressants so while I've made progress this year, my social life is still a massive wall I can't, or may not want to, climb over. I've given thought to doing Meetups in my city but today has pretty much doused that potential flame. 

Is anyone else currently struggling with this? Even if its just one, **ONE** person, who can accept me for me and still encourage me to continue improving, not pretend to be someone I'm not."
a37eao,2,2018-12-04,9-5,unhappypatient,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/a37eao/95/,"I don't know what this post is, just hoping I'm not alone.

I physically cannot do 9am anymore. I have timed myself - all but bathroom stuff (tmi, and the worst part) - to the minute and generously, anticipating delays. From door to door, jogging to the train station, waiting, riding the train, jogging to work, and getting to my desk one or five minutes before - it's forty to forty five minutes. I know how lucky that is. 

Forty minutes to wash my face, brush my teeth, and cover the acne. An hour before that to actually see straight, head throbbing with fatigue, pulling me downward - I guess for blood pressure to stabilize.  I have to sit down multiple times while preparing for work. The most unpredictable thing is the physical stuff, the humiliating stuff, going to the bathroom before I'm stuck mid commute worrying about pissing myself stopped 15 minutes in a station. 

It sounds so small - it isn't. It gets worse and worse with time.

The older I get, the more painful it is getting out the door in the mornings, the more impossible it is, despite setting my alarm clock earlier, getting the same amount of sleep, trying to drink coffee by a certain time to pee fifty times by a certain time...the whole time I go through a horrible stupor and a mini depressive episode. I wake up every morning feeling like someone has kicked the shit out of me the day before, muscles twisting, head pounding, and I collapse as soon as I get home, neck cricked, lower back and feet sore, carpal tunnel from the sides of my neck down to my fingers. I wake up with it. And I feel like as soon as I get home, it's time to shower and go to bed in an apartment my family has made filthy. (I'm the maid, basically.) 


The back, leg,hand and feet pains that come with work are also crippling me and make it hard to get out the door because pain is exhausting and makes routine tiredness at my job so much worse.

And I'm lucky, I get to sit...in a shitty office chair. I'm finding midday even wearing a bra is so painful I want to dig it off of me middway.  

I do not need to be told how pathetic this is, because I know how mediocre this is, what a loathsome character trait this is to people. This has literally destroyed my life and I am more ashamed of it than I can describe, because people think...what a worthless piece of shit, why can't she do this one thing that's so easy that the most belligerent, horrible employee to the boss does?

...But it's not easy. If it were - I wouldn't be admitting this or struggling with something that makes me hate myself beyond description - the weakness, the self-sabotage - because I know exactly how pathetic it is. In the last five years, I have realized - particularly if you're not valuable - there is nothing more loathsome than tardiness, and ""tardy"" specifically related to the standard starting day of 8:30-9am. 

I have no idea how I made it to school at 8:30 am other than being healthier. 

It's painful. I am so tired in the mornings. I am so tired all the time, and between feeling my age and health problems in the last year that make it so much worse - it's a gauntlet of failure. I am already unemployable but this is the thing about work that truly makes me want to kill myself. It is not an understatement to say not being a morning person and having this level of stamina has ruined my life. It's quicksand. Every morning I wake up dead, sore, enraged, and then depressed. I am tired and depressed all day, no matter what I eat (food makes it worse, actually, lunch puts me out). Cup after cup of coffee consumed. 

This problem made it easy not to intern (so did being crazy and having no fucking idea how to look for a job, of course). That means - no employment after graduation in my case. No entry into employment, no skills over time, no knowledge gained about a field and a *path*. Horrible bosses and companies where they are dying to let someone, anyone, go at any given time.

In my observation, lateness - even if you stay late - completely washes away any virtue of competence. And I'm not doing anything special, so, sure. 


I am not cognizant despite three cups of coffee (so I can spend that time hustling and worrying about shitting/pissing myself while stalled on a fucking metro) until I would already be physically on the train. It's actually gotten worse and more painful in the last year, when I wanted to cry on the commute to work because I knew my bosses were tolerating it but silently making mental notes I didn't come in at 8:30 like the coworker that started stealing my work.

I have some ideas how to fix it but I also know a health problem is related to this. 

If you relate to this...pathetic confession, I'm listening. I suspect I am the only person brazen enough to admitting this, that isn't a drug addict or someone whose work life is suited to being a night owl.

I'm not a night owl anymore. I'm not a morning person.

I'm someone completely extraneous to and allergic to 21st century urban capitalism, down to the last muscle. "

And then she said she thinks she knows me. Right when she mentioned that I knew who she was. We had a laugh about it. And then  as we went our separate ways in the parking lot we said nice meeting you.. see you around.

So previously I had inquired about an internship where she works.  Shortly after I was directed to her via email to get information about the organization. Then we had a pleasant email exchange that that left me with a favorable impression.

I’m in a fix about whether or not to take it, so I’m listing out the pros and cons, so you guys could help me decide/give me advice on the situation:

PROS:

1) Well known company, can open many doors

2) Never had a real internship before, and really need some kind of work experience before I graduate (did research/took classes the past two summers)

3) Impossible to get a summer internship at such a company (I’m not a stellar student, and to top it off, I’m an international student and it’s 10 times more competitive for me, and summer internships are 20x more competitive)

4) The exact area I’ll be working in (biologics) is right up my alley

5) I’ve always wanted to go to grad school but my grades are suffering/I’m starting to find industry to be nicer than I thought; and taking time off school might help me figure my life out.

6) I can use the off semester for completing my minor 

7) The mentor seems fantastic, and from what he mentioned it seems like I’ll learn a lot.

CONS:

1) My school only offers certain courses in certain semesters so the courses I need to take in Spring 2019 will only be offered Spring 2020, so I’ll be in school an extra semester (and I might need an extra semester any way because of my minor/electives)

2) I’ll be with a different cohort of people (the year below me), and I find engineering classes kind of hard to survive without a group of people. It’s going to take me a while to form a new network. I’m also not the best at making friends.

3) I’ll be taking the courses in the sequence a year later than I should, which means I might not remember everything/anything 😂

4) The location of this co-op is in the middle of nowhere (a small town in Massachusetts), and I don’t know how hard it’s gonna be for me to survive for 6-7 months.

5) It’s till June 28, 2019, which means I can’t find a summer internship that spans the rest of the summer.

6) I have so little time to figure out the logistics of this. 

So overall the job seems like an excellent opportunity, and I have literally 2% chance of getting any kind of job when I graduate without experience (highlight: As international student I need to be extra-qualified to get any kind of job). But the cons are also not completing surpassable.
So here are my questions:
1) Do you thinks the pros outweigh the cons?

2) Has anyone tried delaying a co-op to a later term?"

President Xi has envisioned a future for the Healthcare Industry in China, to grow the biomedicine and high-performance medical devices sector. However, after a key National People's Congress session, President Xi, Vice President Fan, and Minister [Ma Xiaowei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Xiaowei) of the National Health Commission have been conducting domestic visits of national health institutions, and pharmaceutical companies to gauge the mood of the industry. The results were unanimous and helped the Central Government point out several key hurdles to jump over, when aiming to reach the sector goals for Made in China 2025. The following issues will be addressed:

* [Chinese Consumer Worries on Vaccine Quality](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/world/asia/china-vaccines-scandal-investigation.html)
* Need for increased attention and industry oversight by the State Food and Drug Administration
* Patent Streamlining for Chinese Pharmaceutical Producers
* Need for Public Access to Pharmaceuticals
* Instituting Standards to Separate the Traditional Medicine Market from the needed Western Standards
* Growing the developing Dietary Supplements Market
* Strict Enforcement of Hospital, Equipment Quality Standards
* Joint Corporate-Higher Education Research Development Investments
* Programs for Medical Education Institutions
* Wages in the Chinese Medical Industry
* Low quality, and unhealthy baby formula

###Dealing with the Issues in the Medical Industry

Since the beginning of economic reforms in China, the Medical Industry has boomed in China, and currently is growing at an unprecedented rate, and the fact of the matter is- the US Medical Industry is physically incapable of keeping up. This has put a significant pressure on the Chinese Medical Industries and Healthcare system to provide for the future of not only China, but the world. Although China has made significant leaps in healthcare and medicine, many problems have surfaced as a result and to truly say it is a developed industry, changes have to be made and professional standards have to be enforced.

After the [vaccine scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/world/asia/china-vaccines-scandal-investigation.html) that swept China in 2018, sure their was re-compensation and punishment delivered, however the core of the problem has not been addressed-vaccine quality. This has shown the State Food and Drug Administration's failure to properly inspect the quality of these vaccines. This is also not the beginning of it, the SFDA has repeatedly failed to provide Chinese consumers with confidence in the product they are purchasing. The SFDA does not label products as approved, does not investigate the manufacturing process, does not verify results of tests, does not take samples of products before they are shipped out into the public, and does not differentiate between traditional and western medicines. All of this has compounded into one of the greatest failures at the hands of the Central Government. The results were shocking to Ma Xiaowei, VP Fan, and President Xi, although they all noted that they too would purchase Western over-the-counters due to their usefulness, quality, and ease-of-access. To mend this issue, the National People's Congress has instated the following reforms to guide the SFDA in the medical industry to their true purpose:

* The National Health Commission has analyzed a 155-page analysis into the vaccine scandal and has stated the NHC will be managing and overseeing the enforcement of the following reforms.
* The SFDA will be expected to label Chinese Traditional Medicine as ""Traditional Remedies- Not Tested by the SFDA, Trust at One's Own Risk""
* All Chinese Companies presenting new products to the SFDA must outline their ingredients, their purpose, possible side-effects, and results of their product
* The SFDA will be testing current and new vaccines, pharmaceuticals to ensure they do what the manufacturer says they do, actually produce the intended results, the ingredients and side effects are accurately labeled
* All Chinese Companies will be expected to provide documents upon testing of the exact production, research, and experimentation process of the new prospective product, so the process can be mimicked for integrity
* The SFDA after testing and confirming a new product will be expected to label the product as SFDA Approved
* The National Health Commission will only be allowed to uses products that are SFDA Approved
* Foreign Medical Products must undergo the approval process from the SFDA.
* The SFDA will begin inspecting products that end up making it to hospitals to ensure the quality being delivered to patients is of the same quality that was approved
* The SFDA will levy violations against companies that falsify their products, research, or any part of the approval process, and demand that the product and research be turned over for termination
* The SFDA will prosecute individuals involved in falsification processes, and cannot guarantee the integrity of their process.
* The SFDA will take over the patenting process for medical products, technologies, etc, to take the burden off of the Central Government and make the process stream-lined.

China has a desperate need for an ease-of-access, over-the-counter pharmaceutical industry. Chinese citizens, as well as abroad professionals have levied a large amount of incessant complaints that finally led the Chinese Central Government to take action. Medication of any sort is extremely difficult to come by in China, in fact there are only [three venues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry_in_China#Comparison_of_Chinese_and_Western_pharmaceutical_companies) to directly come in contact with medication, none of which includes a local drug store. The Chinese Central Government has come into contact with several medical professionals that have expressed interest in receiving government funding to get drug store businesses of the ground. As such, the Central Government has agreed to help with the development of the following private companies:

* Dr. Sunshine (Products for Soon-to-Be Mothers, Young Families, with a focus on early childhood from birth, to 5 years old) - Selling an assortment of clothing, toys, early-child and infant medications, first-aid items, medication for pregnant mothers, pregnancy tests, household child-proofing items, baby food, baby formulas.

* Jiating Drug Stores (All-ages, All-purpose products, medications, and first aid supplies)

* Yeye Household Products (Products and service items for middle aged- elderly people)

* The Good Doctors (English-based drug store servicing English-speaking individuals, housing foreign, and domestic products)

* Blue Sky Clinic (Local 24 hr Urgent Care centers)

* Miss Doctor (Female Doctors and Services for Women)

* Happy Hearts ( e-pharmacy )

One of the major problems plaguing China is the lack of quality baby powder. This is a massive embarrassment to China, as all of the used baby powder, and formula is imported from abroad. What this tells the National Health Commission is that China is unable to feed its newborns, which is completely unacceptable. The Ping-An Good Doctor Corporation will begin collaboration with Qinghua University in Beijing to develop a universal baby powder and formula that can be produced domestically in China, only after receiving approval from the SFDA.



###The Future of Chinese Healthcare and the Medical Industry

One of the larger more looming concerns, hospital and equipment quality, will be the primary issue to solve by the National Health Commission. Their is a vast gap in hospital quality between the extremely well developed and maintained conditions in the First Tier Cities, such as Beijing, and Shanghai that has not been carried out to even the most remote standards in the countryside. Some hospitals in the countryside have been responsible for infecting other patients, lack of quality treatment or care-giving, and in some cases, entire buildings will collapse. The National Health Commission and the Chinese Central Government find this completely unacceptable conditions and behavior. The Chinese Central Government has drafted a list of structural conditions to ensure that hospitals nationwide can meet the same basic standards that a developed nation might expect. Some of these standards include, mold removal, hospital and clinic specific building codes, among many other standards. The goal of these new regulations would be to bring the provincial hospitals up to Beijing standards, and supervised by the National Health Commission. The National Health Commission receives funding from both the Central and Provincial Governments, make this expectation easily attainable and more than reasonable. Other regulations under these conditions will include the maintenance of medical technologies, and the maximum dates that a piece of equipment can be serviced until a new piece of equipment is to be purchased.

It is no question, that China has some of the world's most skilled medical professionals, however there are three problems that plague medical professionals- education, wages, and requirements. While most of the Western world has developed residency requirements for their professionals, China still has yet to identify it as a professional requirement. Due to this, China has announced it will be instating a 5-year residency requirement for doctors, and a 7-year residency requirement for surgeons. Only after completing the residency will medical prospectives be able to take the National Medical Licensing Examination, and receive the approval of the Ministry of Health- a requirement to be a medical professional in China. Individuals operating without having passed the NMLE and not holding an official registration number by the Ministry of Health will be indicted for malpractice and fraud.

The Central Government has analyzed that there is absolutely a need for medical professionals in China, a dire need at that, just refer to the population and the story tells itself. Chinese people are avid smokers, drinkers, and key parts of their culture also influence unhealthy behavior, despite the modern efforts within Chinese culture to promote health (which has been extremely successful among the elderly and the youth). If there is demand, the National Health Commission, as well as their private counterparts are willing to pay- however there needs to be the proper educational requirements. As it stands, Chinese citizens can become nurses after the completion of Grade 9. This is an extremely haunting reality in China. Vice President Fan has advocated for the increase in education requirements for the medical industry to ensure proper skilled labor, however these efforts alone will not be enough. As a result, the National People's Congress has proposed the following:

* A minimum of a Bachelor's in a medical-related field is required to become a nurse.
* A minimum of a Master's Degree in a medical-related field for a physician
* A minimum of a Doctorate in a field related to field of practice for a full-fledged Doctor/Surgeon
* Government-mandated curriculum for a Bachelor's in Nursing (based on the qualifications of the nursing exams)

The People's Republic of China has also instated a University-Industry Research Proposal to fund skill-based rather than theoretical education at higher education institutions. This has called for the creation of the Medical Research and Development Center at [all major medical universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_China). The Medical Research and Development Center will become part of the graduating requirements for medical students at the Bachelor-level and continuing even after graduation. Here, private medical technology companies will work in conjunction with the university, receiving funding, and set students on projects specific to their major. China has a clear goal to develop medical technology and cures, and the universities are the best way to kill two birds with one stones: Qualified graduates with vast skill sets, internship opportunities, bridging the gap between the working world and the educational field, developing of new technologies to feed the industry, and increase the pay for medical professionals. This is the most important step to bringing China up to a domination level of worldwide medical knowledge. Also, this will increase the integrity and demand for domestic labor, and shutting out the dependency on foreign professionals, and foreign products. In addition to the Medical Research and Development Center, the Central and Provincial Governments have agreed on instituting scholarships to make the funding of higher-education a realistic option for any citizen regardless of where in China they come from. 

* The Sisterhood of Pink Coats: The tell-tale infamous designation of a female Chinese nurse, is the pink coat. The Central Government would like to create this program for those who aspire to become a nurse. The Central Government will cover the entire cost of their education, and give them research funds for the MRDC, to increase interest in the medical field.

* The Helping Hand Educational Fund: This is a scholarship for medical students who have a big heart. Those who will undertake a medical internship with Chinese nationals working with the United Nations for one-year minimum will receive all of their expenses paid for by the Central Government, and entire study plan, even through Doctorate, guaranteed by the Central Government.

* Rising Star's: Minority students with exceptional grades on the Gao Kao will be put in a pool for a scholarship, of which 1,200 university applications will be selected, and will have their education funded, as well as housing and food covered. The agreement is that upon graduation, they will serve an internship with the National Health Commission in their home province to improve local conditions and provide access to the national health coverage program.

* The Medical Students Alliance: The Chinese Central Government will cover exceptional and promising projects formulating in the MRDC up to $100,000, and cover the education expenses of those involved with the project. Upon completion of the project, it will be presented at a National Health Commission Conference to the National People's Conference.


###A Healthier China, A Healthier Tomorrow

The Chinese Central Government has announced, in addition to all the international research already going on, it would like to set a goal to find the cure to some of the major diseases and illnesses currently deemed as incurable. China will be looking outward for international cooperation on the following projects.

* Cancer
* Alzheimer's Disease
* Ebola virus
* HIV/AIDS
* Noro Virus
* Sickle cell disease
* Marburg Virus
* Development of 7 New Types of Anti-Bacterials that will combat Superviruses
* Epilepsy

The National Health Commission has set a goal to cure 5 of the mentioned diseases, in addition to the Development of 7 new anti-bacterials, by 2040.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently completing an internship in a master's program for counselling and I'm having some issues with hypothesizing and conceptualizing clients.  I'm still in the early stages, granted, but I tend to get overwhelmed with the details of clients and have difficulty seeing the big picture.  My supervisor will ask me what I believe is going on or what the next steps should be and I sometimes haven't a clue where to begin.  I've begun asking clients how I can best help them in session more, which is useful, but I still tend to get 'stuck in the mud' when they divulge about stories from their past and the many issues that cause them distress.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any resources or advice on not getting bogged down by the details and engaging in productive case conceptualization/hypothesizing?

Thanks in advance!"

a39pph,5,2018-12-05,"I’m (23/f) losing attraction &amp; falling out of love with my boyfriend (24/m) and, I want it to stop",rheumatisticwerewolf,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a39pph/im_23f_losing_attraction_falling_out_of_love_with/,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over a year now. We have the same interests, his friends/family adore me, and we get along amazingly (I can count on one hand the times we’ve fought). But, today I realized that I might have fallen out of love with him. I just don’t understand how this happened so suddenly and I want to fix it because I truly want a future with him. I’ve never experienced this before either and this is my 4th long term relationship.

He does some things that make me cringe so hard and they didn’t use to. First is his pet name for me. I hate pet names but I let it slide when we first started dating. But it’s a very “baby talk” name and I’m embarrassed when he uses it in public, especially when he sings it in a song to me (yes he does that). Second is the fact that he doesn’t brush his teeth. He says brushing his teeth causes his gums to bleed but, I also know the dentist has diagnosed him with pre-gingivitis...which is probably from him not brushing his teeth regularly up to this point. Whenever I sleep over, I have to make him brush his teeth with me at night and in the morning. I’ve talked about this with him and nothing changes. I’ve dated guys who brush their teeth 2x a day and have had worse breath than my bf but, it’s still gross and brings me to the third thing. I don’t enjoy our sex life. I’m his first girlfriend and I hate kissing him (his breath is bad). Yeah he’s had sex with girls before but, he’s terrible at oral and rarely orgasms. Fourth, he’s never held a part time job before, only internships. So, when he graduated recently, he couldn’t find part time work or a full time career. I’ve never cared about what someone does for a living but for the love of God do something, literally anything to be employed somewhere and get yourself out of the house. He wakes up after noon, goes to the gym, and plays video games. I’m not sure when he looks for a job in between all of that (even though he claims he’s been trying). I get it, post grad life is a hard adjustment and he’s figuring it out but, why can’t he just work part time in the meantime? Fifth, he can be super annoying. He does this thing where he’ll give me “zert-berts” or “raspberries” (basically pressing his lips against me tightly and blowing air through it like a farting noise) and it drives me insane. Sometimes, I feel like his mom and other times I feel like his big sister with the stuff he does to annoy me. I guess he thinks it’s cute and doesn’t take me seriously when I tell him to stop. Sixth, I’ll be speaking and he’ll suddenly become super passionate about a topic, he’ll get very loud, interrupt me, or talk over me. It makes me feel like he doesn’t care about me &amp; what I have to say.

But, I want to stay with him because I care about him so much. He treats me wonderfully, always opens up the door for me and walks me on the inside of the street. He talks me up to everyone he meets. He can pick up if I am uncomfortable in a conversation (I’m shy and very awkward) and he’ll tell the person stories about how I taught him so many things and all of the memories he cherishes of me. He’s handsome, funny, smart, cares for me, and builds me up. He knows everything I like and pays attention to all of the little things just like any girl would dream of. He’s sweet, loyal, a good compromiser, sticks to his word, and puts my needs very high. Guys like him don’t come around often and I know he wants a future with me. I want one with him to and I know I was at one point just as crazy about him as he is about me. I don’t know where it got lost or how to fix it. If you’ve gone through this or have any advice to make this work, please let me know.

TL/DR: I’m falling out of love with my boyfriend who is amazing (minus some annoying/cringey things he does). How can I fall back in love and make this work?"
a3aiph,268,2018-12-05,Had an Active Shooter Situation in the hospital last night,UsuallyEmpathetic,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/a3aiph/had_an_active_shooter_situation_in_the_hospital/,"I'm not sure exactly what point I'm going for here--mostly just support, I guess. I'm still trying to process all this.

I'm working night float for our service. Last night the hospital had an active shooter event. All of a sudden there was a flashing alert on all the computers for an ""**Active Shooter on Campus. RUN, HIDE, FIGHT**"" with a general location. My first reaction was WTF, and I kept re-reading it, expecting to see a 'this-is-just-a-test' disclaimer. I grabbed the intern, ran out to the nurses station to confirm it was real--all the nurses are freaking out. I grab the charge and ask, ""WHAT'S YOUR PROTOCOL FOR THIS?"" (Because I sure as hell don't have one). I mean, what the fuck are we supposed to do about the patients?

Someone came up with ""I think we're supposed to close the patient doors,"" so we ran around and did that, someone grabbed the safety manual. There's no other mechanism to lock our unit down.

Somehow, I think I became *de facto* in charge (*picture a short, relatively un-athletic gal with coke-bottle glasses and a high pitched voice calling the plays to understand how truly ridiculous this was*). Luckily there was only one sick patient on the floor who was on the stable side, so I got all the RNs and techs into the resident workroom while we tried to figure out an exit strategy. Both of our main stairwells descend right to the general area the active shooter could be, and all of this took enough time that it probably wasn't safe to move anymore. We committed to hiding in our coded-door resident room, barricaded the door with the HIPAA shred box, the printer and the mini-fridge, turned the pagers and phones to silent, got everyone on the floor. We probably only sat there for 15-20 minutes, but it felt longer.

Maybe all of you in bigger cities or at trauma centers with a lot of numbers see this more often, but **I cannot remember the last time I had been so scared**. Like there's that ""oh shit, oh shit"" moment when you're running to a critical patient, or right before a code when you see things going downhill. But I can't remember the last time I had been this afraid. I had a room full of fifteen 20-something nurses and techs and an intern and I felt responsible for every last one of them. I don't think I was even thinking about the patients--these RNs and techs have a great relationship with our department in general and with me personally-- all I could think of was ""how the fuck do I get these people out of here?""

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually we had the all clear. Turned out the shooter hadn't entered the hospital (shot himself outside after his victims got away), wasn't in any way connected with hospital personnel, and all staff and patients were safe, which is obviously the best possible outcome for a shitty situation. I work with a great bunch of RNs and techs and felt very lucky to be working with a great team--the kind that would have worked together if shit had actually hit the fan. I had my usual stress response (cry in a call room for 5 minutes), called my parents so they wouldn't freak out in the morning, and on we went with work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to think. I've become used to some of the daily, minor injustices of life as a resident--asshole patients, crappy call schedules, co residents you can't trust... I was never expecting this. I can't even imagine what things have been like for those who work in Chicago and the Bronx where doctors have been killed in the last year. There's an inherent unfairness to this--we shouldn't have to be scared to lose our lives at work. That's the only real thought that sticks in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have similar experiences? Is this simply more common than I thought?"

a3b8jl,61,2018-12-05,**[clinical] Sick v Not Sick? That is the question!,emmgeezy,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/a3b8jl/clinical_sick_v_not_sick_that_is_the_question/,"How often has your resident asked you, ""but is he sick?"" after you see a patient...You're probably thinking - of course he's sick - he's in the hospital! But that's not always the case. Knowing the answer to this question is a skill, one that takes years and taking care of loads of patients to develop, but that you are expected to be able to do starting from intern year. I posted this in r/residency with good feedback so I figured I'd post it here as well. Here's some brief advice that I hope will help you identify the ""sick"" patients going forward, I hope this helps:

1. Think about all of the patients you've had who've been transferred to the ICU and/or gotten intubated - these people usually end up intubated, no matter if their primary issue is respiratory failure or not. Really try to remember these patients and remember their faces. I can picture a slew of them as I'm writing this. They often look confused and terrified simultaneously, their skin may be white/gray and clammy with shock, they may look like they're suffocating or drowning to death, and if they're with it enough they frequently have that ""impending sense of doom"" we all hear about. REMEMBER THIS LOOK.
2. Are you being called to evaluate the patient for escalation of care (home to ER, ER to wards, wards to ICU)? Because if so, SOMETHING. HAS. CHANGED. And whether or not you think they're ""sick enough"", they're sicker than they were before, so please take your colleague's judgment seriously.
3. Quickly evaluate the patient from head to toe, and just give 10% mortality for each organ system that is down. Chronic organ failure doesn't often result in rapid ""crumping"", however it is a bad prognostic sign as you're starting with a worse mortality before you even evaluate the acute issue. Remember, this is all about change from BASELINE. Here's how I go head to toe:  

   1. EXAM:  

      1. Brain - being confused is enough! AMS is a BAD sign
      2. Heart - tachycardia is enough! hypotension, certainly; brady not good either!
      3. Lungs - if you're on more than 2L NC, that's not normal, if your O2 requirement is increasing, that is bad, if you're tachypneic - why?! please evaluate this patient's belly, belly breathing will NOT last forever!!!
      4. Abdomen - even if their belly is just newly distended - call the GI system out until proven otherwise; distended abdomens can kill people (whether they're ileus, SBO, perf'd bowel, retroperitoneal bleed, or retaining bladder), they WILL aspirate when you lay them down, NGT STAT! also, if someone is throwing up or pooping blood at you, please recognize that they are sick; if someone has or could have a history of varices, THEY WILL BLEED, please recognize these patients; SO MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN EVAL THE ABDOMEN PLEASE DON'T FORGET
      5. Kidneys - called for decrease in UOP? that not normal
      6. Extremities - any new swelling or rashes? that not normal either (please turn the lights on for this exam), cold? BAD!
      7. General - things that are generally bad include the ""O sign"", the ""Q sign"", white/gray/\*diaphoretic\* face (often MI or acute blood loss), tripoding to breathe, holding belly in pain, saying ""I'm gonna die doc, I'm gonna die"" - no bueno
4. Since you have been called to see this patient, there has been a change from baseline, in this case, I always order a new STAT rainbow of labs (CBC, CMP, Mg, Phos, Coags, Trop, CPK, LA, TSH) w/ an ABG, EKG, and CXR/KUB. ALWAYS. The labs from several hours ago no longer apply to this patient because SOMETHING HAS CHANGED.
5. After you have done all of this and identified the issue, one of the most important things is the order of your interventions that you will do next. I often see people on non-rebreathers (THIS IS NOT A TREATMENT, THIS IS JUST SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE PATIENT WHILE YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE RT TO BRING HI FLO OR THE VENTILATOR). The main thing to think about is - how quickly can I reverse the problem? Few things are reversible within 30-60 minutes (maybe flash pulmonary edema - in someone who can pee, some COPD exacerbations - in pts that haven't received treatment yet, a seizure that isn't going into status epilepticus, etc). Most things take time! Sick people who need time often - not always, but often - need to be intubated. If you're planning on intubating someone - please think about what to do first to prevent disastrous intubations. Hypotensive w/ an unreliable BP cuff? Place an a-line. Distended abdomen? Place an NGT. But do NOT delay intubation if you do not have time\*. As my medical school trauma attending used to say, ""DO NOT BE AFRAID OF THE BLOWER"".

Alright, so that was a lot! But if all you take away from this is the head to toe quick evaluation that's enough! Please let me know if you have any questions or experiences where you wonder if you or someone else should've done something differently. I am more than happy to talk through a case with you. I hope y'all find this helpful! Good luck out there!

&amp;#x200B;

\*Disclaimer: I don't mean for you to intubate the pt yourself, I mean for you to call someone to evaluate your pt for intubation."
a3ciat,1,2018-12-05,The Sexy Intern,PaulWit,u_PaulWit,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PaulWit/comments/a3ciat/the_sexy_intern/,"# Working as the only White

Anne was a young French  woman of 20 years old studying economy. During spring, she had to do an  internship to end her year and validate her classes. 

She found  one in a company specialized in music, especially Black music. They were  not producers but helped young and promising artists to start. Her job  was to spot these artists and prepare a file about the company could  help them and get money from it.

What she noticed her first day as  an intern is that she was the only White girl… and the only White at  all. She was not surprised since the company was about Black music, but  why do they have hired her in this case?

Talik was the boss, a  very tall, very well-built Black man who did sport every day at midday.  The other employees were Black women, some only a little bit older than  her and doing quite the same job.

They warmly welcomed her and in a  few days she knew everything of their lives or of the boss life. They  gave her the surname “Ivory” because she was beautiful and white as  ivory. It felt weird to be the one who had a surname. She was more used  to hearing White people giving surnames to their Black or Brown friends,  but anyway, it was with no ulterior motive.

Progressively, Talik  asked her to stay later and later in the office. He also allowed her to  come later in the morning. After two weeks, she was now working alone  with him for one or two hours in the early evening.

It was weird  because the other girls were avoiding the subject of the boss, telling  her he only wanted her to learn from the best. They were also teasing  her a lot about how awesome he was; how much they would love to work  late if it meant being roughly fucked on his desk…

## An Intern who has a lot to Learn

Anne  was quite excited by all these words and thoughts. For sure Talik was  awesome, a very good-looking man for her. He was in his thirties, was  confident, had money, knew how to speak to women, was… Black…

She  never tried, how could she? Her father was so racist it was out of the  question. Never a Black guy could have come home, never!

But… this  time, she was alone, no witness, no family to watch her, only her and  her boss. She felt aroused about it, about the possibility to be a slut,  to get laid with him, right now, only following her basic instinct.

She  was wearing a tight jean and a skin-tight black vest top. She did her  hair, checked that her jean was closely fitting her ass, stood up and  walked toward Talik’s office. He was working in a different space only  separated with translucent panels.

He raised his head as she was entering in his office, a horny look on her face.

“What do you want Anne?”  
“I don’t know, and you, what do YOU want?”  


He understood she was not here to discuss work. She already had her boobs raised, her tits barely visible through her top.

“You are sure you want to go down this path Anne?”  
“As long as you are with me…”  


He  stood up and went closer, putting his big hands on her thin waist. They  looked at each other for a moment before he came closer and kissed her  neck, smelling her young White skin and her perfurme. She let him wrap  her with his strong arms and sit her on his desk, her legs around him.

They  kissed, he did very well, he had experience. He seemed to know so well  the fair sex, she was giving all her barriers up, ready to follow him  where he would like to lead her.

He removed his shirt, unvealing a  dark muscular torso which aroused her as she was touching his pecs.  Then he unzipped her tight jean and pulled hard on it to get her almost  naked. He also removed her delicate panties, revealing a young, soft and  wet White pussy.

“I will fuck you like you had never been Anne”.  


She  believed him the second she saw his Black member. A huge Black and  thick snake, something she had only seen in some hardcore porn videos.  It urged her to take it, what she did before masturbating that massive  African-American phallus.

Talik continued to undress her, removing  her top, and then brushed her soft small boobs. A pure White girl ten  years younger than him, the perfect pussy to fuck hard.

Once his  cock was as hard as a rock, he pushed her on his desk to have access to  her sexy and wet pussy. He ate that piece of White meat for a long time,  like somemone starving who would have found a free restaurant to eat  in. He licked her labia, fingered her, she was moaning like a bitch in  his office, her little White body waving on the desk.

Then he took  his Big Black Cock in his left hand and penetrated her tight wet White  pussy. He dipped his glans in her vagina, covering all his cock of her  come. Her pinky labia were stretched wide for him; it was like he was  fucking a virgin pussy.

He went deep in her, then out, deep, out,  hard, deep, out, harder, deeper… He was screwing her cunt, the cunt of  her young White intern who wanted to play rough. He was now teaching her  a lesson, don’t underestimate a Black man appetite for a White pussy.

Her  legs up and wide-open, he fiercely finished that intense fuck with some  hard thrusts before cumming deep in her young womb. He properly filled  that fertile womb with more than ten big spurts.

Anne was tired,  exhausted, breathless. Totally naked on his desk, she felt him pulling  out. She also felt her pussy now full of his Black sperm. She was so  dirty now, she had been brutally fucked by her boss and then  impregnated, all this because she was aroused and tempted by him. How a  slut she was!

a3cntt,5,2018-12-05,"To her, one step forward is two steps back",Warriorette12,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a3cntt/to_her_one_step_forward_is_two_steps_back/,"I recently realized my nmom has a pattern of being nice and lovely and laughs with me when we talk until I get a false hope that she isn’t so bad, and then when I trust her enough to open up to her, she tries to tear me down. This is especially problematic for me because I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and am being medicated, but she doesn’t seem to understand (or care) that being medicated doesn’t mean I can’t have low days or randomly have anxiety attacks or get triggered. This means if I try to open up and let her know if I’m feeling rough, she says I’m either using my depression/anxiety as a crutch to get special treatment, gives the ‘everyone FEELS like they don’t want to go to work, but they still go’ speech to say that I’m just using my depression as an excuse to be lazy, or implies that my mental health issues make me a failure.

 I’m a 20F in my final year of undergrad in the UK now, for context.

Yesterday, I thought I could talk to her about a panic attack I’d had last week over a presentation I had and wanted to say I felt like I handled it well; I’d just left the classroom and walked up and down the hall until I felt calm enough to go back, instead of leaving the class entirely. I also told her that I’d been working with my personal tutor to get my mental health issues documented so that my lapses in attendance or need for certain safety nets, like extra time for assignments, aren’t flagged as unexcused.

She blew up at me. She asked why I was suddenly asking for special treatment and that my thinking about asking for help means that I’m mentally slipping and that I’m unable to cope with classes or my work (I have been missing class here and there but I always let my professors know why and I have not missed a single assignment so far). She said that if I’m not coping, she’s going to talk to my dad about pulling me out of university entirely (she also threatened this over the summer when I was late a few days of my three month internship). She said that talking to my professors about my issues is only letting them know that I can’t handle anything and gives them a reason to discriminate against me when I need references for grad school. She said that no workplace would want to take someone like me because I could be a hazard.

 I tried to tell her that my asking for help feels like an improvement because in past years, I felt too low functioning to take any initiative to go out and ask for help, but I’m well enough to do so now, but she said that I’m clearly not doing well if I need to ask for help because I managed just fine in those past years even though I tried to tell her that my ‘managing’ left me so fatigued from trying to hold everything together that I was left even more depressed at the end of the year. I asked her if it was about my grades, and she said it wasn’t about my grades.

 I remember in my first year, I was so depressed and near suicidal, I finally told her how depressed I really was so I could get medicated in the first place. I still did well academically that year and she praised me for doing well in school in spite of being suicidal. Last year, my medication (and my making a few friends and getting a boyfriend) stabilized me emotionally and I did better than in my first year grades-wise, but she completely ignored me then. This inconsistency confuses me but I guess that makes her right about it not being about my grades?

I have no idea why she’s so adamant on my dropping out and going back home to the US. A jaded part of me thinks she’s only doing this cuz she sees that I’m actually happy here, but I also don’t like thinking she can be that malicious. I had enough courage (or was irritated enough) to tell her that I thought she was treating my success as a failure just to put me down. She paused, said “I’m sorry you feel that way”, and changed the subject. She also said, “You’re an adult and I trust you to make your own decisions, but what you do know lays the foundation for who you’ll be later” which really sounded like she was implying I’m setting myself up to be the failure she clearly thinks I am.

I just feel so drained and frustrated thinking about that conversation."
a3dpvs,6,2018-12-05,I’m never going to be able to work with people,jon131517,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a3dpvs/im_never_going_to_be_able_to_work_with_people/,"So since high school (in uni now), I’ve always been the type to carry group projects, and to want to get shit done early. Until I finally found someone in college who shared my mindset, I hated group projects because I was the only one doing anything. Then I met my boss on my first internship, who taught me that a little confidence, even if you end up sounding like a dick, will get you anywhere. And his philosophy of “I am merely a reflection of what you show me”, which is quite useful. Second internship, I negotiated my hours to get a day off when they tried to change my contract. I still worked from home that day to keep up, but I saved myself the 2.5 hours of driving, and I would have costed them overtime out the wazoo if I’d stayed all day week, anyway. Now, first semester of university, I have 2 classes with big term projects in imposed groups. There’s one where I spend my time reigning in a team leader who’s too gung-ho, and the other where I start pushing a lazy team, then walk on eggshells after getting too much resistance, borderline intimidating, and it was clear that there’d be no opening for dialogue on their work ethic. Of course, the former was done early, but the latter was finished at the last minute. 

However, I’d told my group at the beginning of the semester that “I’m not touching anything you give me at the last minute”, and then last weekend I had to help a friend move on Saturday (who happens to be the person who got my gf and I together, so I owe her one, on top of just helping because she’s a good friend) and work on Sunday, with the presentation and report due at 8:30 Monday morning. So I told them last week that I wouldn’t be available, thinking that’d light a fire under their asses, and I made the document (we were working in drive and learned the hard way that it’s incompatible with word) so it’d be easier for them to insert what wasn’t done, since my part is done. Now it’s worth mentioning that I’m studying in my second language, so someone had to correct my parts before I made that document, which wasn’t done. 

Come Friday: “Jon I’m missing annexes” “Jon why are there blank pages in the report?” “It would be nice if you could stay while were printing” So I answer in class to keep them moving that the annexes are missing because they’re not my sources and therefore not my problem; the person who used them should’ve screenshotted them, and that the blank pages was so double-sided printing wouldn’t look weird and that no, I warned them that I was unavailable, and that I had other work to do that night that I’d put aside for that project (2 group labs in other classes).

I didn’t touch messenger all Saturday. I get on on Sunday on break and see “Jon is this a mistake or a term? I corrected your mistake” “Jon why did you leave space for this, I couldn’t find it” “Jon you can’t put that in the PowerPoint, it looks unprofessional”, so eventually I tell them “enough is enough. You’re gonna be engineers in 5 years, and I warned you I wouldn’t be available this weekend. That drawing has been done for over 3 weeks, if you’d been bothered to look. Now I’m at work, I think you guys can figure it out. I’m sorry for being direct with you, but you guys started work on this yesterday, while my parts have been done for ages, I hope you can understand my patience wearing out”. The guy who was trying to provoke me with the “hey look, you made a mistake!” was crying while he watched 3 of us present, it was 3 minutes too short, and it looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute. But we got an 84. And now there’s a story of a site visit a guy had to do, and he took the 1 toll bridge out of the 6 in the city to get there, even though it’s way out of the way, and he expects us to pay his toll even though we agreed at the beginning that “you choose how you get there, we’re not gonna pay the transportation, even for site visits”.

My mom says I’m going to have a lot of trouble working with people in the future, but I just hate being the only person in a group who can take things seriously, take criticism, and be held to his word. I’ve just started uni and this experience makes me very excited to finish just so I can leave these fuckwads behind.

Rant over."
a3dx6q,123,2018-12-05,First Time with my Boss,thegeekyperve,cheatingwives,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatingwives/comments/a3dx6q/first_time_with_my_boss/,"Five years ago I took a transfer (and promotion) with another branch with my realtor company. It wasn't too far away from where I was currently living but my husband and I made the decision to move. It worked out for him as well because the police force in the new city was looking for a new captain.
My first day was fantastic. I met everyone in the office all were welcoming and friendly and since that first day all of us have become good friends. Then I met my new boss. Tall and handsome, his white hair and goatee stood out the most to me as I am a sucker for older men. When he smiled and shook my hand, his dimples made me blush as well as his wrinkles on the sides of his eyes. At 63 that man was very sexy.
My first week past. I sold a few houses started to build up my portfolio. Brian (my boss), was always flirting and joking around. That first weekend hubby and I went to his house for a BBQ. Janet (Bob's wife) is older than him by a couple years and a very friendly woman. Brian and hubby got along amazing as well.) The following weekend we hosted a BBQ at our ppllace with a few coworkers, Brian and Janet.
A month later at the office I had a meeting with Brian in his office to go over projected sales and current /pending sales. The door was closed as it usually is to save off and interruptions. I sat in the office chair across from Brian. I was wearing a long black dress, black 2 inch black heels and a white dress shirt.
 As we talked I found myself getting wet as I talked to Brian. His rugged older man good looks were very appealing. Suddenly as I was showing him some projected sales graphs, my laptop screen went dead. It wouldn't turn back on despite my failed attempts. So, I walked around to his side of the desk to show him the spreadsheets I took in with me just in case.
  He moved his hand up to point to something and accidentally brushed his hand against my ass.
""oh, sorry about that."" He apologized as he pulled his hand away.
""that's ok, I enjoyed it."" I smiled and continued talking about the spreadsheet.
""it's that right."" Brian smiled back looking at my ass that was slightly bent over his desk.
He put his hand back on my ass as I talked. He began feeling the outline of my thong through my dress. My breathing got harder at his touch he touched me.
Suddenly his warm hand was under my dress feeling along my thong from the whale tale down to my pussy.
""your very wet aren't you."" Brian observed as he rain his finger up and down my covers pussy.
I looked at Janet's picture on his desk. 
""What about Janet? I asked enjoying his caress.
""We haven't fucked in six years."" He said. ""once she hit 60 she lost interest.""
Brian wheeled his office chair behind me then lifted my shirt exposing my thong covered ass too him.
""My God."" he took a deep breath in, then suddenly I felt his mouth on my ass. Kissing and licking my ass cheeks. I dropped the spreadsheet on his desk and put my hands down as I moaned at his kisses.
As he licked and kissed my ass cheeks, he moved the fabric of my thong to the side and slid two fingers inside me.
""Oh fuck"" I quietly whispered as his fingers entered me.
Brian's tongue found my asshole and started rimming and tongue flicking it which caused my first orgasm. I covered my mouth with my hand to stop myself from crying out.
Brian continued to finger me and lick my asshole for another few minutes until he stood up off his chair and I heard his zipper go down on his dress pants. Then I felt his cock against my ass. It felt huge so I turned around and looked.
 My eyes widened when I saw his cock. He was fucking huge. 10 inches long and almost the thickness of a Pepsi can.
""Omg Brian!"" I whispered as he smiled back at me.
""Will that do?"" he commented back.
I reached out and grabbed it with my soft hand causing him to moan. It was even heavy in hand.
""hubby is only 7 inches."" I said as I leaned in to lick and circle his cock head.
""God yes."" he moaned as I began to lick and suck him. My mouth stretched around his thick shaft. He held my head grunting and moaning as I blew him.
Suddenly he stopped me, pulled me up and bent me over his desk. He moved into position behind me. I was dropping with excitement.
""Ready?"" he asked as he moved his cock up and down my pussy.
I nodded yes. Then he moved in closer and slowly entered me from behind. I came instantly as his thick cock stretched me. He wasn't all the way in when he started thrusting. Christ, I was so full, it felt amazing getting fucked by that huge cock.
My wet pussy and our quiet moans were all you could hear in his office. We could hear coworkers and customers outside the door.
Suddenly Brian pushed his cock all the way in causing my second orgasm as his cock hit my gspot. I started shaking on his cock and tears filled my eyes as I tied hard not to cry out.
Brian's hips were slapping into mine as he picked up a a rhythmic pace fucking me with long thrusts. I came a couple more times as his big cock stretched me.
He put his hands on my shoulder and started fucking me harder.
""you like this you little slut?"" he said breathlessly behind me.
""fuck."" I whispered back
""Your pussy feels so good."" he replied back.
Slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap his hips loudly slapping into mine.
""I'm going to send you home too sore to fuck hubby you little slut."" he was grunting behind me.
""Fuck my married pussy."" I said as another orgasm came over me.
""Your a nasty slut aren't you? His words driving me crazy
Slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap
'I'm such a bad wife getting fucked by my boss."" I whispered as my body shook with each thrust.
With a deeper grunt Brian pulled out of my pussy and jerked off onto my ass sending warm Cum on my thong, and ass.
Brian collapsed in his office chair breathing heavy. I turned and looked at him. His semi hard cock sticking out of his pants.
""Wow, that was hot."" I said as I fixed my thong and dress.
""Your telling me."" Brian was still breathing heavy heavy. ""I wanted you since you walked in those doors the first time.""
""Me too."" I confessed back.

We have been fucking each since. Including one time he made me lick his cock clean after fucking a young 20 year old intern. That's a story for another time. "

The concept of yourself is hard to grasp. To conceptualize and construct an identity can be difficult.  Oxford dictionary defines Identity as; The characteristics determining who or what a person or thing is.

I am not going to solve ""Identity."" I want to help improve the perspective of ""Identity."" There are many aspects you have to look at when tackling your ""identity."" Who am I? Who should I be? How do I determine what my ""Identity"" is? How can finding ""Identity"" help me? What is the purpose of ""Identity?"" Part of the human experience is to, establish your ""Identity."" 

""Identity"" is the idea of establishing who and what you are in your existence. The culture and society that you exist in, helps shape this process. When you look at the aspect of yourself, the ""who you are,"" is not the definition of what others define you as. The ""who you are,"" is the definition you define yourself as. The more you learn about yourself and the existence around you. The more you will understand yourself in the existence you experience.

One of the biggest questions someone will face is, ""who am I?"" Nothing is ""concrete"" to establish the answer to this question. We look for the answer outside of ourselves, when you should be looking inside and outside yourself. 

Everyone is unique in their own existence. If you thought exactly like another person, then you would be that person. The uniqueness of someone comes from; the biology, action, experience, ""spirit,"" and perspective of a person's existence. If you jumped as hard as you can, you will have a different jump then the person next to you. How you jump will be different. How you decide to jump will be different. The ability to jump will be different. This is what helps define the uniqueness of ""you.""

There is no right or wrong answer to what you should exist as. A person will usually choose characteristics that optimize the preservation of ""self."" Ultimately, you have the ability to choose the ""self"" you want to exist as. A person chooses from a variety of characteristics that create an ""Identity."" How will you love someone? How will you interact with someone? How will you create or produce something? You get the idea. 

Your environment will influence the decisions on this process. If you were to sing when you talk instead of using an appropriate speaking tone, then you might have someone ask that you stop singing when talking to them. Even though you enjoy singing, it may influence someone in a negative way. You might decide to go ahead and talk to people in an appropriate speaking tone. You would decide to change something about yourself, to accommodate the environment around you. If you did not, then the negative reaction might affect future social experiences negatively.

This intern would affect your decision on how you interact with the environment around you. Which influences the ""Identity"" you choose to exist as. Which is why someone would look outside of themselves to find their ""Identity"" instead of within themselves.

Even strictly looking within yourself, is not the solution either. If you are only looking within the ""self,"" then you have no basis of establishing anything. You have nothing to compare to. No contrast to decide what you like, and what you do not like. Existence is part of the ""self"" perspective. If you have no experience of what love is, how would you even know what love is? How would you even understand hate? How would you even understand the contrast between the two?

Contrast is a ""key"" component to understanding the concept for what a characteristic means in definition. The biology of what makes you up, will also influence the decisions you make, when it comes to how you perceive your ""Identity."" If you are naturally more aggressive than your average person, then you are more likely to choose characteristics that reflect that aggression. An understanding of what surrounds that aggression, will help with not becoming a ""victim"" of that aggression. The Idea that your ""Identity"" does not need to be restricted to your biology.

When establishing what your ""Identity"" is, you must understand the ""reality"" and imagination of ""Identity."" You Imagine yourself as something, but the compromise of your external and internal; will create an outcome, of what you experience as ""you.""

Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, where as imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."" 

Everything starts from the perspective and from the imagination of ""self."" Understand that you will always be adding and subtracting to your ""Identity."" You are always changing. As you grow and learn, you adjust your 'identity;"" to reflect the changes of your external, and internal. What is important, is you establish a core aspect of yourself, that you see as your ""Identity."" As you grow and learn, you adjust characteristics that surround that core ""Identity."" When the core perspective of your ""identity"" is compromised, you do not have a solid enough foundation to build on. This causes issues like, ""Identity"" crisis. The key is to be ""stead fast"" in the core ""Identity"" of yourself, once the core is established.

So how do you establish a core ""Identity"" to yourself? There are aspects of yourself that you need to take into account when it comes to establishing a core. I will elaborate in part 2 of, ""The Identity' of Yourself."" Understanding that others do not define you. You define yourself. Is a core principle when it comes to finding your ""Identity.""

The ""human condition"" does not define you. The sum of your choices in ""Identity,"" of self; helps define the ""Identity,"" of the ""human condition."" The sum of all identities, is the identity of the ""human condition.""

There is Hope in Humanity.

a3ehw4,5,2018-12-05,LOW FPS Different Explanation,reflextions,PUBATTLEGROUNDS,https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/a3ehw4/low_fps_different_explanation/,"Alright guys so I'm going to do my best here talking about a obviously very problematic issue for some folks, low fps. I just want to put it out there that I am really trying to help some people who are a little more novice with pc gaming. 

There are many many posts on this sub about how to boost fps with setting and other sorts and this is not one of those posts. I see many many people on this sub who are newer pc gamers which is amazing. I think pubg has a similar affect league does and did where the game pushes people into becoming part of the PC community!

I worked for HP as an intern for almost 2 years just taking it calls and fixing people's shit. To keep it very simple a lot of people do not know how to keep a computer ""clean"". What I am getting at here is a large portion of us get very very respectable fps in pubg. Because of this it really makes me think it's more user error than pubg in most cases (I know not all). I have tons of friends with lots of different specs. Non of them and I mean non of them get the terrible fps half of you are getting out of your rigs. 
I am making this post because I saw a guy say he has a 4670k, 8gb of ram, and a 970. He dips bellow 60 always. That is the exact same specs I ran for a while with around 90-120 fps and the worst dibs in the 60 while hot dropping.

The reasons I truly believe a lot of you have bad fps is because your computers need to be working properly in the first place. Several things outside of pubg can cause performance issues.

Windows updates
Malicious programs
Driver updates
Anti virus
Low disk space
Corrupt os
Probably more too

All those things can weigh down your performance and cause your hardware to run worse than it should. 

If I were you I would just go on YouTube and search your cpu and gpu specs and check what fps others are getting in pubg. I bet a lot of you will find other people get 20 or 30 more fps with the same specs. If this is the case please dm me and I will personally try and help you clean up your rig and get you gaming better.

Here is a link of a fx 6300 and 1050ti at all graphics levels at 1080p 
https://youtu.be/05Fv-kYOwGQ

TLDR: Many users playing pubg get bad fps on decent or even good specs. People blame the game and not there rig. Look up your specs in pubg on YouTube and compare. If your lower than the benchmarks consider cleaning up your pc."
a3enmo,9,2018-12-05,What should I expect from an Engineering Intern interview at a Biotech startup?,TrippyTricks,biotech,https://www.reddit.com/r/biotech/comments/a3enmo/what_should_i_expect_from_an_engineering_intern/,"Hello! 
I am a 4th year undergraduate student studying Biomedical Engineering. I have an interview on Friday with a small but successful biotech startup (10-15 employees, recently received ~$4 million in NIH funding) and I have no idea what to expect as nobody I know is familiar with the industry and I have never had a formal engineering job (I worked in a lab but there was no interview).


I would appreciate any insights anyone has to offer, but my primary questions are: 


The job description includes several programming languages, should I be prepared for a technical interview?


How much do Biotech interns (generally) get paid at startups?


Thank you so much in advance! "
a3ewjy,1,2018-12-05,"Imagination Into Creation, Through Existence",LloydHumancondition,u_LloydHumancondition,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LloydHumancondition/comments/a3ewjy/imagination_into_creation_through_existence/,"#                              Imagination Into Creation, Through Existence

Imagination is one of the most powerful ""tools"" that is given to someone. It takes imagination to create anything into existence. The ""tool"" of art. A ""splash"" of this, a ""splash"" of that, and creation happens. Imagination is the true form of freedom. Freedom of the mind.

Great minds of history stress on imagination. They understand the importance and power of what imagination can do. Good and bad, a true reflection of the spirit inside.

“Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you desire, you will what you imagine; and at last, you create what you will.”  
― George Bernard Shaw

""Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."" -Albert Eisntein

Humans are good at using their imagination. We enjoy every aspect of it. Both in the undiscovered and discovery of imagination. It brings beauty out in a way, it can move the ""soul."" Every human being adds a piece of their imagination to the world, in one way or another. Without imagination, nothing would exist. Even existence took imagination. Imagination is a reflection of your existence. It took imagination to create you. Why have imagination as a part of you, if it did not matter? It's the true expression, of the ""you"" inside.

Science is what ""grounds"" existence. It took imagination to explore science. A compromise of imagination and existence, to equal reality. Imagination can be expressed in the true form of the mind. Art, music, sculptures, writing, design, are examples of true expression, of imagination. The world is a canvas for the mind to ""paint.""

**Law of Attraction**

Law of Attraction is another ""tool"" that is used, whether you realize it or not. The mind is a powerful organ. The Idea is, you attract what you think. The more you think about something, the more you attract it. This plays a lot on the sub-conscious and conscious. If you want the Law of Attraction to be more effective, you have to understand the dimensions of it.

The conscious level works on focusing your thoughts on a specific goal or idea. The mind likes to wander. You have to discipline your thoughts through consistency. Eventually, you will find it easy to think about your goals or ideas. You do and are what you think. You have choice in your thoughts. By thinking about your goals and ideas enough. You will find yourself putting action behind them.

The sub-conscious works in a different way. By consciously thinking about your goals and ideas. You will find that you surround yourself with what you think. Intern, this will put influence around you that will affect you on a sub-conscious level. Putting related items or people around you that support and influence your goals and ideas. Will affect the sub-conscious more directly.

By mastering both of these concepts. You will find reaching your goals and ideas, will become easier. Successful people use Law of Attraction as one of their fundamentals for success.When you add Law of Attraction to your imagination, you will nurture the potential of ""you.""

**Creation of Imagination, Through Fear**

Imagination can bring out the worst in humans. Not always in a way you might think. The imagination of fear, can be created into existence. In the same way, the imagination of want, can be created into existence. Fear works on the conscious and sub-conscious of an individual. If fear is in control, then fear will manifest itself through the individual. If an individual controls fear, then fear can not manifest itself through that individual.

When an individual is afraid of something in truth of foundation, through the Law of Attraction and imagination into creation. That individual will produce the fear in their external as absolute truth. If enough individuals are afraid of the same thing, then the imagination of fear will become stronger. Those individuals will have a higher probability of producing that fear into existence.

Example: if a quarter of the world believes that something will happen through fear. That truth in fear, on foundation, will become inevitable. Sub-consciously and consciously, the individuals will start to produce that fear into reality. Since their foundation of truth was in the fear, there was no other alternative outside that fear. If those individuals controlled the fear, then that production of fear would not happen.

**A Better World Through Imagination Into Creation.**

Terrible ideas and concepts, have put fear into the ""world."" The power of this fear creates tension in foundation. Instead of controlling the fear, humans take it as truth in foundation, and nothing can be done. War is a symptom of this fear in tension. When the ""world"" decides to stop letting fear rule it, a new ""chapter"" can begin in a way that is outside of fear.

If everyone was to stop letting fear control them, then humanity can create a better world outside of fear. One that is through the imagination into creation, for something better. That tension in foundation will start to ease. Only then, will humans find peace and prosperity. In an existence that allows an individual to express their imagination in it. The sum of all expression in one direction, can imagine into creation, the true potential of humanity.

a3fccf,24,2018-12-05,I Finally Listened to all the CBB Episodes!,Kyle_Singler,comedybangbang,https://www.reddit.com/r/comedybangbang/comments/a3fccf/i_finally_listened_to_all_the_cbb_episodes/,"Well, not technically all, since I haven't listened to the tour episodes yet, but I digress. About two and a half years ago a friend suggested I check out this hilarious podcast called ""Comedy Bang Bang."" After listening to the most recent episode at the time (Ep 397 - My Silly Moss Man), I thought to myself ""meh."" But I decided to give it another try and listened to the next episode. As I began to understand the type of humor I realized just how hilarious this podcast is! I was hooked, and after listening to a few more of the recent episodes, I made the decision to go back and listen to every episode starting at Number 1.

1. For the next two and a half years (with a couple brief hiatuses) CBB filled my morning and evening commute. After listening to 576, I have finally listened to the entire series of CBB episodes. Of course, now it's time to check out the tour episodes, U Talkin' U2 2 Me, R U Talkin' R.E.M. RE ME?, and all the other great 'tent out there. I just wanted to make this post in appreciation of this hilarious podcast that has provided me with countless hours of entertainment and opened my eyes to lots of great comedians out there.

I wanted to end this off by listing some of my favorites from CBB! Please note that this list is not just personal taste but is the correct list for CBB, and if you disagree with any of my rankings you are wrong.

**Favorite Episode:** 131 Mayor of Hollywood

*One of the many great Zouks/Daly episodes, this episode has goofs and gaffs abound. Between Scott and Zouks' annoyance at Chip Gardner's interruptions, Zouks laughing hysterically when he and Scott share the same dream, side by sides,* [*zapstraighttoit.com*](https://zapstraighttoit.com)*, and international waters this episode has it all!*

**Favorite Guests:**

**1. Ernie Bread**

*What can be said about Ernie Bread that hasn't been said already? Although a late addition to the CBB universe, he's appeared on such classic episodes as the 2017 Holiday Spectacular, Ernie Bread Part 1, and The Ernie Bread. His wildly popular appearances on the show have been a huge contributor to the show's success.*

**2. Andy Daly**

*If you couldn't tell from my favorite episode, I am a huge fan of Andy Daly's work. His resume of characters, from Don Dimello to Dalton Wilcox, could fill a CBB Best of! Always quick on his feet and always hilarious, if you see Daly's name on an episode you know it's going to be good.*

**3. Paul F. Tompkins**

*Again, what more could really be said about ol' PFT? Heeeee's been on the show since the beginning, and has been CBB's most consistent contributor. Through his great character work CBB has been able to create great content for years.*

**4. Jeffrey Characterwheaties**

*While he has had success with minor characters such as Gutterballs or Kareem, most fans will know Characterwheaties for his character of Jason Mantzoukas. A commentary of hyper-masculinity, Characterwheaties has captured the hearts (and the laughs) of CBB audiences with his vile, disgusting, foul-mouthed, sex-addicted, and egless character Jason.*

**5. Jon Gabrus**

*Gabrus is another guest where if you see his name on the list, you know it's gonna be a grepisode. While critics have complained that he is too one-dimensional, that dimension sure brings a lot of laughs! His work as Ginovanni ""Gino the Intern"" Lambardo has brought many hilarious moments to the podcast, such as when he regaled listeners with the story of being fucked repeatedly by Catholic priests, or when he recites the Long Island rail lines.*

**Favorite Hosts**

**1. Cyber Thug.**

*It's been a while since Cyber Thug took over a CBB ep. Even though it's been years, I'm sure the fans will never forget all the hilarious moments that occurred when Cyber Thug and his buddy Miles Archer popped into the Indie 103.1 studio and hijacked an episode!*

**2. Paul F. Tompkins**

*If he's one of the top guests, you know he would also be one of the top hosts! On occasion, in a rare out-of-character appearance, PFT has stepped in to take over the reins of CBB as host. And my, what reins they were! Who could ever forget a host PFT turning to guest Tig Notaro and saying ""Tig, I'm gonna ask you to shut your mouth!""*

**3. Jimmy Pardo**

*An experienced comedy podcast host, Jimmy graced the listeners off CBB with 3 different Pardo-sodes! His quick wit and handling of phone calls from Doug Benson is second to none, and a catalyst for plenty of CBB hilarities!*

**4. Scott ""Skittles"" Aukerman**

While he has hosted the majority of episodes, Aukerman has never really been able to grasp the role of a host. While he has great Hollywood connections and has been able to bring on a multitude of interesting guests, I wish he would quit making dumb jokes and puns and just let his guests talk! However, despite his flaws, CBB is still able to march forward in a fury of laughs!

&amp;#x200B;

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading and remember, please don't joke about I, Robot this Christmas."

Charlie was having a shit day, a really shit day. He'd just got home from work and needed to de-stress. He poured himself a tall glass of Jack, kicked off his clothes and grabbed his laptop. He sat down on the sofa naked, opened his mac and went straight to his favoiuret porn site.

Charlie was a hard worker, he was smart and he was dedicated. He grew up in a rough part of town, his dad left him young and his mum had died when was in college. Now he was 27 and working at a top management consultancy. He loved his job mainly because it paid well, but he hated most of the spoilt brats he worked with. None of them had to work as hard as him to get there, they all came from rich families who paid for the best schools and collages, Charlie did it all himself.

In a way that made Charlie feel superior to them, he knew they couldn't have made it the way he had and that gave him a lot of strength. Today was different.

For the last month Charlie had been tasked with mentoring a new girl at work. Charlie was a nice guy to most people but there were certain kinds of people he just couldn't stand; the lazy, the fat and the entitled.

The girl he had to mentor at work, Sue, was all three.  Sue was fat, most people would call her chubby or rounded but Charlie was a Gym freak and to him she might as well have been obese. Some of the guys at work talked about possibly fucking her because she had curly red hair down to her shoulders, a huge chest, pale skin and bright green eyes.

When Charlie looked at her he just saw fat. Sue was also either lazy or stupid as fuck. Charlie had spent weeks repeatedly teaching her how to do simple tasks and she would keep fucking up. If it was up to Charlie she would have been fired on day one, but Sue was the daughter of one the company's biggest clients so that wasn't an option.

Charlie leaned into his laptop clicked into the search on his favouiret porn site and typed in “FAT STUPID REDHEAD” he scrolled down the list till he found a video that matched the way he felt “Chubby Pale Redhead Pig Destroyed by 2 Niggers” as he clicked play he saw three black guys slapping around a fat red headed girl, normally Charlie would only ever watch porn with one type of girl, tall thin and blond, but after the day he'd had at work he wanted to see a fat redhead like Sue get hurt by some of his brothers. Just as Charlie went to put on his big headphones he heard his phone ringing in the bedroom. He put the headphones down and ran to grab it.

The call was from Yuan, one of the only non white guys at his office, he wanted to know why Charlie had left the office in such a huff. “It’s a long fucking story bro” Charlie began telling Yuan about Sue, not only was she fat and stupid but the bitch had been ruining Charlie's life.

Charlie was behind on his work because he had spent so long helping her study for the company's internal exams, and despite all his help she was still failing them. If she failed completely Charlie would lose his bonus because he’s responsible for her training! - Yuan consoled him and told him he could speak to his managers - “That ain’t the half of it bro” Charlie went on to explain how hard it had been for him to get a flat in the building he lived, it was upper class and white, he was the only black tenant and despite most of his pay cheque going on rent he could only afford a second floor flat.

Sue’s daddy had rented her a 20th floor penthouse in the same building. So not only was this bitch ruining his performance at work he had to put up with 'chatty' Sue on the subway every morning “oh my church group this, my friends just bought a ferrari that, daddy is getting me so and so, this fucking bitch ruins my commute to work, my day at work and my fucking commute back” he told Yuan. “And that not even the worst” Charlie continued to tell Yuan how today Sue had told him she was thinking of quitting, she told him how after finding the fucking easy entry exams for work too hard she spoke to her ""daddy"" and thought it was a good idea for her to travel with friends across europe and get a job when she was ready. Charlie had wasted a month helping this stupid fat brat and it turns out it was all for nothing. By now Yuan was laughing. Charlie let loose on the phone bitching about Sue until he heard a knocking on his front door. “Yo dude some ones at the door I’ll call you back in a bit ” he put the phone down and grabed a towel to cover his naked body.

Charlie opened the door expecting it to be a pizza guy at the wrong door, instead it was Sue. She looked like she was dressed up to go out, she was wearing a dress far too tight for her forcing her fat breasts to bulge out, she had covered her face in makeup and straightened her curly red hair “Hi Charlie, I’m so sorry i don’t mean to disturb you I just wanted to thank you for how kind you have been at work and the doorman gave me your door number.” Charlie thanked her and got ready to slam the door when Sue started to go on and on “You know i really liked working with you but I think it would be better for me to grow as a person travelling with friends then get to caught up with a career at this point in my life” everything she said made charlie hate her more, all he could think while she spoke was how fucking spoilt she was. As she babbled on, Charlie realised he would have to let her in “Hey why don’t you come in and grab a seat on the sofa - let me just put on some cloths on”

Charlie pointed to his living room and sue walked in, he turned and walked to his bed room grabbed his phone and text Yuan “fuck my life - will have to call you back later bro - bitch just turned up at my door”. He walked over to his closet and put on some shorts and a T.

Charlie walked back to the living room and stopped completely frozen when he saw Sue sat in front of his laptop. She wearing his headphones and tears were streaming from her eyes. Charlie had left the porn on, his mind and his stomach started to turn - he was going to get fired, he'd shown porn to the 19 year old christian daughter of a client. Charlie ran into the room and yanked the headphones off Sue’s head, as he did the headphones jumped out the socket and suddenly he heard a voice from the laptop speakers “TAKE THAT NIGGER DICK YOU FAT PIG”, he slammed the laptop shut but it was too late. Sue was in tears and Charlie was fucked.

“I’m so sorry - you weren't meant to see that”, “I forgot it was on”, “Please don't tell my boss” Charlie was panicked, Sue just sat there for a moment just crying, finally she said “You were watching that because of me weren't you”, “OH GOD NO” charlie responded, “Yes you were, you think i'm a fat red headed pig who should get treated like that”. “No no it's not that at all” Charlie tried to deny it but he knew he was caught, he had reacted with such annoyance when Sue told him she was leaving - he was too smart to say anything directly but Sue knew Charlie found her annoying. “I’m a stupid fat pig” Sue said before covering her face with her hands” Charlie stood silently as Sue cried, he was sure this was the end of his career.

After a few minutes that felt like an eternity, he heard Sue say: “I try to lose weight” in a quiet sob. “What” charlie responded. “I know I’m fat, but I try to lose weight, i just can't stop myself eating!” Charlie didn't know what to say but Sue continued “I know I’m fat, I wish I wasn't, and I know I’m stupid, thats why I quit you know, I don’t want to go travelling I love this city but I couldn't hack it in the office.” Charlie was stunned and juat stared at Sue in silence. “I’m fat and I’m stupid and I do deserve to be punished don’t I ?” “No No you don't, you're fine, you're smart, you're really good looking” Charlie said desperately trying to make the situation ok “NO IM NOT, IM A FAT FUCKING STUPID PIG” Sue screamed as she looked up at Charlie. Her eyes were bright green and glazed with tears, her face was covered in her running make up. then in a quiet voice Sue said ""willpunish me Charlie?"". Charlie stood silently in disbelief.

Sue lent forward and opened the laptop. The video continued playing and Charlie saw a large black man strangling the red headed girl, a voice from behind the camera said ""this is how niggers treat a cunt like you, say you want it bitch"" as Charlie reached to slam the laptop shut again he herd both the girl in the video and Sue say ""I want it"".

The voice from behind the camera spoke up again ""tell me your a fat good for nothing cunt"" almost instantly Sue responded ""I'm a fat good for nothing cunt"" the video zoomed out and the girl was stood one man strangling her from behind and two more stood either side of her naked body. The voice from the video said ""what the fuck are those hands for grab them cocks bitch"" the girl from the video still being strangled by the man behind her reached out and grabbed the cocks either side of her. At that point Charlie felt Sues hand grab his cock.

Charlie couldn't understand what was happening, Sue still had tears running down her face but her eyes were locked on the video and her hand was stroking his cock through his shorts. In the video the man strangling the girl suddenly and forcefully threw her to the ground ""get on your knees bitch"" he said grabbing the girl by her hair and positioning her for a blow job. Charlie then watched as Sue got on to her knees in front of him her face still turned to the video her hand still stroking his now hard cock. ""Hold your head up bitch"" said one of the men in the video as he yanked the girls head back and lifted her chin. Then the other men Slapped the girl across the face. ""Say thank you sir"" one of the men shouted at the girl.

Charlie looked down and saw that Sue was no longer watching the video she had lifter her chin and closed her eyes - she was waiting to be hit. Charlie was too stunned to do anything untill he herd Sue say ""please Charlie, punish me"" still confused Charlie slapped her gently the kind of slap that wouldn't hurt.

Sue opened her eyes looked up and said ""please Charlie punish me like the video"" something powerful came over Charlie this time and he smacked Sue hard, so hard she almost fell on her side, but instead she repositioned her knees looked up at Charlie and said ""thank you sir"" Charlie smaked her again, and again she thanked him. Suddenly all the shock was gone and the pent up rage that Charlie had felt earlier came rushing back, he kept smacking her, harder and harder and she kept thanking him - all while stroking his dick.

Charlie's mind refocused, he did hate her and she did deserve to be punished. Charlie turned to the video and saw the girl choking as one the men held her head and the other forced his massive dick deep down her throat. Charlie looked down, Sues checks were red, her puffy eyes were closed, she was clearing expecting another slap. ""Open your mouth"" Charlie said. Sue did as she was told and Charlie felt completely in control. He pulled down his shorts and revealed his now rock hard cock, grabbing it with one hand he slowly placed it just above her mouth. ""Lick it cunt"" he said. Almost instantly he felt her soft warm tongue caress the underside of his dick. He closed his eyes and tilted his head back. Suddenly a voice from the video said ""this bitch got owned"". The video was over but Charlie was just beginning. He'd watched videos like that before but had never done anything like it in real life and now he had a 19 year old knelt before him following his every instruction.

Sue continued to lick Charlie's dick, from the head to the balls she licked it like a giant black lollipop. ""Are you my whore?"" Charlie asked ""yes sir"" Sue responded ""what can I do to you?"" Charlie asked ""anything sir"" Sue responded. ""Stand up"" Charlie said. Sue stood before him still at least a foot shorter than him and her face now covered in smeared make up. Charlie knew he was in control now but what if this little bitch went running to daddy at some point. ""Stay there and don't move"" Charlie turned to walk into the bed room, he came back a moment later with his phone. ""Listen you cunt, I know a spoilt fat bitch like you is gonna run and scream rape, so I want some insurance"" Charlie said pointing at his phone. ""When I press record you look into the camera and say your name that you're a stupid fat cunt and that you want me to use your body as punishment for how fucking disgusting and pathetic you are"". Sue nodded and looked directly into Charlie's phone, Charlie nodded his head as if to say he was now recording ""My Name is Sue Muller and I'm a disgusting fat cunt who deserves to be used by because I'm so fat and ugly and stupid and pathetic, I want this, I deserve this, please sir use me"" Charlie smiled, put the phone down grabbed Sue by the neck ""if u tell anyone about this I'm going to mail that video to your your whole fucking church group - you get me?"" Sue nodded.

Charlie looked her up and down. With a hard dick the fat bitch didn't look so ugly, but he wasn't going to tell her that. He moved his hand forward and grabbed her belly and started shaking it. ""How much must you eat you fat cunt"" before Sue could answer Charlie smacked her face. This time she wasn't ready and the blow took her by surprise, she stumbled back a few steps. ""I would never hit on a fat cunt like you in a bar"" Charlie said looking at her. ""Please sir punish me"" Sue replied.

Charlie pushed Sue back on to the sofa he grabbed her red hair and pulled her face towards him. ""Your gonna swallow my whole fucking dick"" he said as he pulled her hair. ""You eat so much this should be easy"" he said pushing her head on to his cock. Charlie was a big guy and he had a thick 8inch cock. He'd slept with a few girls but none of them had ever managed to swallow his whole dick. He grasped the back of Sues head with one hand and grabbed the bottom of her chin with the other pulling her toward him. Sue didn't resist at all in fact Charlie could feel her open her jaw as wide as she could. Charlie pushed forward and felt the head of his dick slide along her tongue and into her mouth, he could feel the soft wet warmth of her mouth envelope his dick as he pushed in deeper. he pushed his dick into the back of her throats and her lips locked around his shaft. He looked down and saw the fat bitch had managed to get at least six inches deep. He slowly pulled his dick back enjoying the feeling of every groove in her mouth and the soft sucktion of her lips as he drew back. For a few minutes Charlie slowly pushed his dick back and forth, before he knew it he his grip had loosened and Sue was moving her own head back and forth, lovingly sucking his dick.

Charlie was in no doubt this girl knew how to suck dick, her tongue was rolling around in her mouth flicking the end of his dick, it felt amazing. Soon though the attention Sue was giving his throbbing cock wasn't enough and with a sudden jerk Charlie grabbed her head from behind, he thrust his cock powerfully forward and to his surprise without any resistance was able to force himself all the way down her throat. Charlie pushed in as far as he could, till he could feel Sues nose buried in his stomach. He held her head tightly against him, no one had ever managed to swallow his whole dick like this and finally Charlie understood why guys talked about deepthroating so much. He tilted his head back and enjoyed the feeling of a tight wet throat surrounding his cock. Soon he felt Sue to start to move around her hand flew up and began hitting his leg. He pulled his dick out suddenly and released her head. Sue fell back gasping for air, her eyes running she looked up and said ""Thank you sir"".

Charlie continued fucking Sues throat till she begged for air, releasing her and then starting again. every time Sue caught her breath looked up and thanked him. After the tenth or eleventh time Charlie started to feel his muscles tighten he knew one more thrust and he would explode in her mouth. He wasn't ready to cum thou, he wanted more. This time when Sue looked up and thanked him Charlie responded ""Good little cunt, now it's time for you to do some work, I know you love to eat to let's make you eat something good for you for once"" Charlie moved and sat down on the sofa he slid down and spread his legs, grabbing and lifting his balls. He looked down at Sue who was still knelt exactly where he left her ""eat my fucking ass hole you fat white cunt"". For the first time Charlie saw her hesitate but then she assumed a position kneeling further down infront of him and moved her face so it was half hidden from his view and began to tentatively lick under Charlie's balls.

Charlie had never managed to get a girl to eat his ass before, a few had licked his balls but none had ever pushed their tongue deep into is ass, he enjoyed the slow licking Sue gave him, the way she played with his balls but just like the other girls she was staying away from his actual ass hole. Without warning Charlie swung one of his feet back and struck Sue in the head. ""I didn't tell you to lick my fucking balls cunt I said lick my ass."" Suddenly Charlie felt Sue bury her head between his toned cheeks and her toung began circling his hole. ""Stick that tongue in my ass butch"" Charlie shouted striking the back of her head again. This time Sue understood, she pushed her tongue as deep as she could licking in and out, at first she was hesitant, but after a few minutes she became ravenous. Charlie sat back holding his own legs and enjoyed his cleaning.

After a good cleaning Charlie used his hand to push Sue back. ""Enjoy your dinner bitch"" He said as he slapped her face. ""Yes sir"" She responded. ""Well now it's time for my desert, stand the fuck up"". Sue stood ""take your cloths off... slowly."" Sue slowly began to undress by now she was covered in her own spit her dress littered with wet patches. As her dress fell to the floor she lifted one foot onto her toes and moved slightly to the side in an attempt to pose for him. Slowly looking her up and down Charlie shook his head and said ""disgusting"". Sue broke the pose and began to undo her bra as she pulled it away she exposed the largest breasts Charlie had ever seen. Then she grabbed her panties pulling them down by leaning forward as her panties reached her knees Charlie lent forward and grabbed her by he hair whispered in her ear ""I'm gonna help you burn some calories you ugly bitch""

Charlie positioned himself and Sue so she was straddling him, his hard dick pressed up against her pussy. ""Your gonna ride me, your gonna ride my dick till I cum deep inside you."" Sue smiled and said ""thank you sir I want your nigger dick so badly."" As she lifted her body Charlie grabbed his dick and ran it down her cunt pressing it down trying to find his way into her. Her pussy was soaked, he could tell she wanted this and so did he. He brought his dick to rest and told her to slowly move down on it. The head of his dick slipped into her as she let out a moan.

The next morning Charlie woke up to the sound of his phone ringing, he reached over grabbing the phone - fuck it was already 11:30. On a normal Saturday morning he would have already been back from the gym. He saw the caller ID was his boss, fuck he thought, that stupid bitch must have snitched. Charlie panicked but answered the phone. ""Charlie you fucking hero"" his boss screeched down the line ""well done boy - all that work you put in with Sue paid off big time, I just got a call from her dad, apparently he had breakfast with her today and all she did was rave about the company, about our team and about you, the fucker is hiring us for two more contracts and he wants you to be lead on them"" the excitement in his bosses voice was obvious, ""I just wanted to call and tell you how pleased I am Charlie, this is gonna mean a big bonus for you my friend, take Monday morning off - enjoy your weekend and come see me in the afternoon we need to talk about your bright future with the company Charlie, well done my boy well done."" Charlie thanked his boss ended the call. Then he noticed a message on his phone from Sue he clicked and read ""I'm sorry sir, I ate to much at breakfast, when shall i come down for my punishment"" Charlie hit reply and wrote, ""NOW."""

In the middle of the semester, I focused on two of my most difficult classes, and slacked in a GEP which I rationalized by saying ""ultimately a combination of A's and B's in CODA will be better for me than an A in the GEP class."" I only took this class because it was open and my advisor said I should just ""take a class I think would be an easy A."" I realized it would not be an easy A after the deadline to change a class for credit only, so I'll be getting a thicc F in it (the cost for a realistic chance at getting into my major). I know it'll look bad to have an exclusion in such an obscure class, but I think it would be better to have a high GPA early on. Another hard thing will be telling my parents about the grade. I don't know how to tell my parents that knowing my grades does nothing for me but stress me out. They won't employ me, or give me an internship, so why know it if they're just going to stress me further? They think I get bad grades because I don't care :/, which as a college student couldn't be further from the truth."

I don't know whether this is the right place to ask but I'm currently doing my internship at some place. In the end I have to make a report/paper. 

One of the things that I did, was the validation on the absence off-target effects using primers. In the end I got my sequences and I actually found a lot of papers using all different ways to present their data. 
I was actually thinking showing my chromatograms and then zooming in on the intact off-target sequence. But as I'm using sequencher I am not able to show the +/- 300 bp sequence on one line. 

Does anyone have a solution for this or know another way to nicely present my chromatograms  (showing an intact predicted off-target sequence)?"

My life is good. I have a boyfriend. We love each other and we are moving in together soon.

My life is good. I love my family. Even though we have our issues, everyone goes along great and I just became a proud aunt. 

My life is good. I have an apartment and enough money to support myself. I'm not rich, but I am able to go out every once in a while of buy myself something nice.

My life is good. But why the hell do I feel like this?

Why do I think I'm not enough because I got one C and didn't graduate Cum Laude?

Why do I never think I work hard enough and why am I scared to apply for a PhD because of my mental health?

Why do I hide my depression, my scars and my bald spots from my boyfriend, when all he wants is to help me? Why do I keep pushing him away?

Why do I wear a mask when I'm with my friends, and feel like no one really knows me?

Why do I distance myself from my family? No one knows about what I do, what I feel and what i go through. I got them to the point where they stopped asking. And why am I happy about that?

Why do I spend so much money on alcohol when I know its a trigger for me. Why do I want to be triggered?

My life is good. It has been good for 23 years, but sometimes I hate it."

As the darkness recedes, and the sun rises, shining through the long night, the he in reality is reborn.\
A roaring black dragon, the lighthouse and demonic eye by the sea, the rainforest before Chichen Itza, the beasts in the Colosseum...... the real world's gaudy projections that form in the world of the consciousness reflect places hidden, out of the light's reach - the countless sins of the human heart.\

""Are you an alarm clock!"" Zhou Sheng couldn't take it anymore.\

With a train whistle, a departure from Ying city. Light flooded into the carriage, a view of faraway rivers and clusters of mountains. Fast sleep, it's as if entering a vibrant dream.\
Zhou Sheng was asleep, he tilted his head, resting on Yu Hao's shoulder, covering the both of them was his jacket. Yu Hao inhaled the warmness from Zhou Sheng, gazing out at the long winter night beyond the windows. The glass windows reflected his and Zhou Sheng's silhouettes as they sat snugly together.\
In this life of his, he never felt himself so close to love.

For those who weren't aware, Fei Tian Ye Xiang was the ""Wall of Plagiarism"" that caused JJWXC's anti-plagiarism policy to become a joke. His behaviour has actually been pretty good after he turned pro, but it's tough to live down a title like that.

Huai Shang's Po Yun sequel, Yin Bing's (literally means drinking ice, but figuratively means being full of terror) contract was announced on its own long ago, just that Huai Shang hasn't settled on its name, plot, much less was actually writing it the last time it was mentioned.

Of the Big 4 of BL fiction writers, three (Fei Tian Ye Xiang, priest, Huai Shang) are with JJWXC while Shui Qian Cheng is with iQiyi. iQiyi as mentioned bought IPs from JJWXC and Tencent iirc"

This means if I try to open up and let her know if I’m feeling rough, she says I’m either using my depression/anxiety as a crutch to get special treatment, gives the ‘everyone FEELS like they don’t want to go to work, but they still go’ speech to say that I’m just using my depression as an excuse to be lazy, or implies that my mental health issues make me a failure.

 I’m in my final year of undergrad in the UK now, for context.

Yesterday, I thought I could talk to her about a panic attack I’d had last week over a presentation I had and wanted to say I felt like I handled it well; I’d just left the classroom and walked up and down the hall until I felt calm enough to go back, instead of leaving the class entirely. I also told her that I’d been working with my personal tutor to get my mental health issues documented so that my lapses in attendance or need for certain safety nets, like extra time for assignments, aren’t flagged as unexcused.

She blew up at me. She asked why I was suddenly asking for special treatment and that my thinking about asking for help means that I’m mentally slipping and that I’m unable to cope with classes or my work (I have been missing class here and there but I always let my professors know why and I have not missed a single assignment so far). She said that if I’m not coping, she’s going to talk to my dad about pulling me out of university entirely. She also threatened this over the summer when I was late a few days of my three month internship because she said that it proved I was unreliable. She said that talking to my professors about my issues is only letting them know that I can’t handle anything and gives them a reason to discriminate against me when I need references for grad school. She said that no workplace would want to take someone like me because I could be a hazard.

 I tried to tell her that my asking for help feels like an improvement because in past years, I felt too low functioning to take any initiative to go out and ask for help, but I’m well enough to do so now. But she said that I’m clearly not doing well if I need to ask for help because I managed just fine in those past years even though I tried to tell her that my ‘managing’ left me so fatigued from trying to hold everything together that I was left even more depressed at the end of the year. I asked her if it was about my grades, and she said it wasn’t about my grades.

 I remember in my first year, I was so depressed and near suicidal, I finally told her how depressed I really was so I could get medicated in the first place. I still did well academically that year and she praised me for doing well in school in spite of being suicidal. Last year, my medication (and my making a few friends and getting a boyfriend) stabilized me emotionally and I did better than in my first year grades-wise, but she completely ignored me then. This inconsistency confuses me but I guess that makes her right about it not being about my grades?

I have no idea why she’s so adamant on my dropping out and going back home to the US. I know if she talks to my dad, she’ll exaggerate things to try and get him to agree with her and they pay for my tuition so I think they could withdraw me if they really wanted. I had enough courage (or was irritated enough) to tell her that I thought she was treating my success as a failure just to put me down. She paused, said “I’m sorry you feel that way”, and changed the subject. She also said, “You’re an adult and I trust you to make your own decisions, but what you do know lays the foundation for who you’ll be later” which really sounded like she was implying I’m setting myself up to be the failure she clearly thinks I am.

I just feel so drained and frustrated thinking about that conversation. What should my next steps be, given that this threat is over my head for the second time? My education is everything to me and I really don’t want anything ruining the path I’ve set for myself.

a3ix71,3,2018-12-05,I need help,SharingIsW0rthIt,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a3ix71/i_need_help/,"Hello Reddit Community,

I would like to share to you my story and hopefully get some help as to what I could do with my life. Firstly I would like to clear up something. While I am depressed, my life is not particularly bad when I logically analyse it without considering any feelings to it.

I am generally open guy shy with girls of course but i guess they consider me cute enough so I have had some experience with relationships. Recently beat my longtime record of 1 week relationship to 2 weeks! Hurray! 

I consider myself intelligent enough to have moved to a more advanced country than my birth one but I still have a lot to learn and there are many things about every kind of aspects of life that I have yet to discover. I am currently doing my last year of Bachelor degree in Software Engineering but I only chose it because I dont know what i wanna do so it was my default choice. My parents split up when I was little, but my mom is such a treasure to this world that I am so lucky to have her. I have a brother and a sister that I can trust and rely on although I do not talk to them that often. I am lucky enough to have a roof over my head, a decent computer i can play games on and some good income despite me not being employed. I have awesome friends that i have met over 10 years ago that I still talk regularly to this day.

However, I am not happy. My sleeping regiment is all over the place, I eat once a day, barely drink water, I am always down, I can barely do my school assignments to graduate. I feel like everyday of my life if something bad can happen It will happen. When I moved away from my birth country almost 4 years ago to come here it was a nice change of pace but it kept me distracted for an year or 2 but my old depression has slowly creeped on me again. My good friends that I've known for over a decade are studying in another country and we've had very few physical meetings although we talk everyday online and play games whenever we can. But since I can't hang out with them I feel like I am have always been unlucky enough to never been around them and my life keeps going into a direction where I will never live around them so I could actually start having a more outgoing social life. Don't get me wrong though I am not antisocial. I could more or less hit it off with anybody in the world. I have friends here but not a decade old friends, friends that you could say hey remember that one time 7 years ago... the friends here are the kind of friends you'd have very few interactions after your paths separate again.

1 Month ago i went for 2 weeks vacation to their country and it was like I was a different person especially the first few days when I didn't think that soon I will have to come back here to my miserable life. I met a girl there and we clicked and we sort of lowkey dated for the 2 weeks i was there and of course we had to brake it off since i had to come back and both of us didn't like long distance. And once again life just finds a way to fuck me over.

The education i am currently doing is not making me happy either. I can't see myself doing a 9 to 5 job for more than 6 months. I could barely get through an internship that lasted for 6 months without feeling so fucking bored and annoyed by it...

And I can't change any of this by myself. I feel like I am in a prison of my own life not being able to be happy because I am not rich enough to just move. I am almost almost completed with my education. Everybody ive talked to about this just tells me to graduate since im almost done but I can barely handle myself right now and I can't imagine how I will be in  about an year.

I've talked with everybody who is close to me about my depression and none of them are able to help me, not even my mother.

TLDR I don't like my education its making me miserable, the fact that my friends are all not close to me is making me miserable, my love life sucks and all the chances i've had to have some sort of relationship have been ruined by the means of distance or some other stupid crap. My life feels like an orgy that I've organized and I'm the only one being fucked in my own organized orgy. And the cycle seems to be unbrakeable since I don't even have the resources to make any big decisions in my life right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am honestly just slowly and steadily thinking that suicide is probably my best option. The way I see myself no grown up person is like me. In 7 years when I'm 30 if I have the same stupid outlook of life  and i am still working in this miserable field of education i don't see myself even being slightly happier than I am now. I really need help to see what the hell is wrong with my life how can I change it what can I do?

a3j3jm,0,2018-12-05,Can't perform simple multiplication or division? Come work for us!,NambyPambyMSP,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/a3j3jm/cant_perform_simple_multiplication_or_division/,"We had an unfortunate experience just before the Thanksgiving holiday, which caught both me and my business partner a bit off-guard, and nearly cost us a new client opportunity, so I wanted to run it by the masses here to see what your prerogative on the topic may be.

During a routine sales meeting/walkthrough with a new client, the 24-year-old Tier 2 guy we brought along with us was thrown a softball question from the client (business owner) regarding how big each IDF rack cabinet would need to be.The answer to this question is partially based upon how many patch panels would be needed to accommodate the number of users and devices located in each wing of the building, so my business partner asked the Tier 2 guy how many patch panels would be needed.  The answer to this questions, as you might imagine, is relatively straight-forward: just multiply the number of network drops in each office by the number of offices in each wing (they're all identical), then multiply that product by the number of wings, then divide that product by 48 and round up to the next whole number.

This guy has been involved in many build-outs over the past four years, and fully understands how to figure out the answer to this type of a question, so we weren't worried in the least... until the tech opened up to the first blank page in his notebook and stared at it as if he was having a minor stroke.  We all thought he was just doing the math in his head, which all of us had already done and were ready to spit out, but after about 45 seconds (which is a LOT longer than you probably think it is when everyone is sitting around a conference room table staring at the guy closest in age to having been in school), he looked up and painfully said the words, ""I left my phone in the car.""

Yes, that's right... the 24-year-old Tier 2 tech with a degree in MIS, actively responsible for managing the network infrastructure for several of our clients, COULD NOT PERFORM SIMPLE MULTIPLICATION OR DIVISION USING PEN AND PAPER, and required GOOGLE (yes, not the calculator app, but GOOGLE SEARCH) to perform the equation 40 x 4 x 4 / 48.

As you can probably imagine, the meeting didn't last much longer, and it was a pretty quiet ride back to the office.  The partners here are now re-evaluating every single element of our hiring process, contemplating how critical each individual requirement (or lack thereof) may be, even in some of the most unanticipated situations.  Clearly, we all made the incorrect assumption that a MIS graduate (or even a high-school graduate / intern!) should have no trouble completing simple long multiplication and division with pen and paper!

So, do you screen/test for basic mathematic skills when hiring new techs, or is this just a sign of the times?  What other seemingly obvious skills do you check for that others (like us) may assume that the candidate possesses?

EDIT: AGAIN, there was NO EXPECTATION that he do the math in his head.  He had a notebook and pen with him, he opened the notebook and put his pen to the paper, attempting to figure it out, but he had no idea how to multiply or divide numbers without GOOGLE SEARCH.  Literally, ZERO expectation of head math.

A bit about me - currently a senior in college (21 years old), majoring in Information Technology and Informatics with a minor in political science.  My major and overall GPA's are 3.81 and 3.33 respectively, and I have VERY varied work experience (last summer I worked 3 jobs 2 of which were internships and currently I work at a contracting company to put support myself while working another internship).  Additionally, next semester I am starting another internship with my States Attorney Generals Office (I don't know if I'm allowed to disclose which state - just to be on the safe side), while still working at the contracting company.  A lot of my friends have had their sights on law school since the beginning of their college careers, and I just feel that I am figuring this all out a bit too late with my cumulative GPA being a bit on the lower side (by law school standards at least).  Is it worth my time to apply, or should I focus on another direction?

TL:DR - Want to apply to law school - but a somewhat low cumulative GPA and my lateness is holding me back.

Should I be concerned or is this just postgrad anxiety?,safefortemoc,UXDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/a3ji6i/ux_hiring_cycles_should_i_be_concerned_or_is_this/,"I’m going to be graduating in a few weeks with a BS in Computer Science. I believe I have a strong resume (did a UX Designer internship with a pretty prolific travel tech company in my city, currently finishing up my senior project with an AI startup), but I’ve been applying here and there for UX Designer jobs but haven’t heard much back.

I’ve spoken to a few recruiting agencies and they told me I shouldn’t really be concerned, since I’m not planning on starting work until the end of January/beginning of February anyways. I want to take the month of January off after I graduate to enjoy my postgrad life for a while- spend time with my family, travel a bit, have no obligations, but seeing some of my peers get offers is starting to give me a bit of anxiety. I guess I’m wondering if any reddit UXers could give me some insight on typical hiring cycles in the industry, and if I’m in an ok place to start actively looking for jobs near the beginning of February rather than January. Should I be worried about my lack of callbacks at this point? Or is the UX job market pretty flourishing to where I can just relax for a bit and focus my efforts when it’s time? "
a3jp0w,13,2018-12-05,I learned a lot about spiritual experiences I've been having and wanted to share,hlfempty69,awakened,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/a3jp0w/i_learned_a_lot_about_spiritual_experiences_ive/,"My name is Jon.  I just turned 30, I’m a PhD student studying Counselor Education, six figures in student debt, and I’m a Licensed Professional Counselor Intern in the state of Texas.  The reason I’m writing this article is because I’ve had spiritual experiences for the past decade that have helped guide me, which may also help provide insight to some things.  I’ve been seeing strange lights and crafts in the sky for the past decade, with and without people and substances, and I finally learned what it all means.  I’ve experienced more than I could mention in this article, and have learned and been shown more than many are comfortable with.  My purpose for writing this article is to bring awareness into what I’ve been experiencing, and it is real regardless of the beliefs of those that will view this.  I would also like to encourage other experiencers to come forward and create a conversation so that none of us feel alone.

I was raised Jewish and also have some American Indian ancestry, and I used to not think that these facts played a role in all of this.  I’m a very spiritual person, and I’ve had to become one to survive what I’ve been through.  I found solace in researching what I had seen and had an unquenchable desire to discover the truth.  I had no idea at the time that truth was trying to show itself to me.  In March of 2008 when this started, Ancient Aliens had just started on the History Channel (probably not so coincidentally).  The ancient astronaut theory appealed to me and I began to wonder whether or not the light that guided Moses through the desert or the chariots of fire in the sky referenced in multiple cultures could be what I was seeing.  

There’s a full write-up of my encounters on Reddit, but it wasn’t until this year that I had an encounter that gave confidence to the ancient astronaut theory.  I met a girl near the beginning of 2018 that I instantly fell in love with, and we were almost inseparable.  Since what I’ve seen is a part of my life, when it comes to romantic relationships it’s something I have to bring up at some point.  She said that she wanted to see what I had been talking about and I informed her of the possibility that what I’ve seen could be responsible for us being here.  At about 11:45 P.M. on the eve of Mother’s Day, we went east of Lubbock near McAdoo, TX where the windmills are.  We pulled off into a field and leaned against the car facing south, and it was a beautiful night.

There was one light in the sky that didn’t look like the rest of the stars, and we were both fixated on it.  It suddenly increased luminosity and started growing until it had this beautiful giant powder baby blue aura around it.  Imagine holding a basketball out in front of your face.  It looked like how the star over the manger had been depicted, and I also learned it bore an identical resemblance to the Blue Kachina of Hopi prophecy.  The light started dimming down, and then I noticed a few large, fluffy looking lights southeast of us.  They looked like big out-of-focus illuminated marshmallows, and it appeared as though there were three smaller lights breaking off, or “blossoming” from each large one. 

Very slowly, the large lights hid within clouds and encircled us, and the large lights were equally spaced in front of the clouds, which were overcast outside the circle and the sky above us was completely clear.  It appeared the smaller lights had arranged themselves into a grid, or dome-like pattern above us.  It was like a cathedral of stars and remains the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.  There was a bright light at the top center, maybe 1000 feet up, and when I nudged her to look up, it was like a wave started from the top center of the dome.  The wave flowed like a burning leaf, and as the light passed each light in the grid, it refracted a fluorescent purple, almost like a peacock feather.  The wave reached the clouds and the large lights hidden within them faded, and the smaller lights drifted outward like jellyfish and disappeared.

I look around and notice a light in the field we were standing a few hundred yards to the east of us.  It was glowing LED white, looked to be 10-12 feet tall, and was in the shape of a pinecone that was skinny side up.  To be honest, someone in Biblical times might’ve described it as a burning bush.  We asked each other if it had been there before, and agreed it hadn’t.  After 30 or so seconds looking at it, it began to rise slowly and then at about 20-30 feet off the ground, it came straight for us, fast.  She couldn’t handle it and had her face in her hands crying, saying she wanted to go home but doesn’t remember any of it.  I felt the need to make her feel safe so we got in the car and headed for the main road.  There was more that happened that night but it isn’t incredibly prudent to include.

The morning of Mother’s Day after the encounter, I couldn’t sleep and she had to.  I had recently learned that the crafts from my first two encounters flew towards the Moundville Mounds in Moundville, AL after they flew over me in 2008 and the connection was fresh in my mind.  I was gifted a couple hundred books by a regular at the restaurant where I waited tables before I moved to Lubbock, and I never read one.  I had been at the same house for five years and just so happened to stock a particular book on the shelf where I would see it.  It’s called “Black Elk Speaks”, and it’s a dictation of Black Elk’s (an Oglala Sioux/Lakota) story.  He was a medicine man that claimed he had an important message for the world.  It was about 6:45 A.M., the golden hour, and I decided to tuck it under my arm while I walked my roommate’s boxer to clear my head.

I liked to walk Tyson without the leash because he listened at crosswalks, and we saw some strange things happen with nature.  There was a coffee shop five blocks from the house that opened at eight, and I decided we’d go to the park a couple of blocks away to wait.  We get a block from the coffee shop and there were two trees in front of this house full of dove.  Right as we were about to cross, the doves start crying, shrieking.  We look over and out from behind that house slinks a grey fox with a dead black kitten in its mouth.  We watched as this fox made its way to our side of the street trotting with pride, got within 20 feet of us with Tyson off the least, and acted like we weren’t even there.  The whole reason I went to college was so I could create positive systemic change, particularly in the prison industry, and I saw parallels of predation in that metaphor.  I ponder the whole way to the park and sit down to open Black Elk Speaks, and to my amazement I find everything I had seen for the past 10 years contained within it.

Black Elk knew that if he had been honest in 1930 about the connection that all tribes have, the connection that I have, it would’ve been rejected.  He had to play to how he knew the public needed to perceive him, so he disguised his experience in metaphor and spiritual language.  I immediately knew that Black Elk’s description of the horses in the sky taking their stables was what I had seen.  I was shook, and I felt I had to talk about it.  I made many calls and emails to a few Cherokee people in Oklahoma because that’s the tribe I’ve been told my ancestry stems from.  My girlfriend and I go to Tahlequah a couple of days after Mother’s Day and had a meeting with a few people.  I won’t discuss what was said, but it is true that almost every American Indian tribe believes their creators came from the stars.  What I now know is that Black Elk Speaks is a spiritual breadcrumb trail that’s been left for all of us.

I’ve sought closure about what I’ve seen since it started, and my mother has shared encounters but my father was under the impression this has all been something mental.  A couple of hours after our meeting, two crafts flew by during the daytime in Tahlequah.  They looked like hard-boiled eggs cut in half and smoothed on the bottom, and after they left I got excited and called my father.  I thought I had illustrated the connection since they showed up in front of the whole town.  My father showed up to Lubbock a couple of days later, but before he did some strange things happened.  My girlfriend at the time didn’t remember crying the morning of Mother’s Day, and she doesn’t remember this.  We were sitting on my couch and I was pretty spiritually elevated.  Her tone changed to a really soft and engaging one, and she leaned in and told me that she was Mother Nature, and that I was the king of Israel.  I was a little shocked and didn’t say anything, and then she asked me to come outside with her.  It was nighttime and we sat on my front porch, and she told me she could make lightning bugs dance while she hummed a song, and she showed me.  If what she told me was true, it would make sense why my life has been such a series of close calls and coincidences.

The next morning, my father showed up and I agreed to go into a psych ward at Covenant Hospital (go figure) for him.  I knew what I had seen was true, but that didn’t make it any less difficult to deal with.  I openly shared about what I had seen and my father was insistent I go to another facility in Houston for six weeks, supposedly one of the best.  I’m named after a book called “Jonathan Livingston Seagull”, and there was a copy on the bookshelf, an old one.  The only other time I had seen this same print was at my grandparent’s house, and it was my father’s copy.  I open it and find an excerpt written inside that reads “Jonathan Seagull was born to be an instructor, and his way of demonstrating love was to show something of the truth to a gull who only asked to see something of the truth for himself…thank you for that, Merry Christmas”.

My name is Jonathan William Buchalter.  Jonathan means, “Name given by God”, William in German means “fierce protector”, and Buchalter in German means “bookkeeper” or “accountant”.  The fact that I’m named after a book that deals with spiritual ascension and teaching others and have found multiple books that have led me to this really doesn’t seem like a mistake.  I feel that it’s possible that the collective creative will of humanity potentially puts some of us here to help us understand how things work.  That may sound like a broad claim, but there’s plenty that I haven’t shared that backs it up.

I went with the motions trying to rebuild my foundation and eventually ended up back in Dallas, where I was born.  On November 5th, I met a guy that I became quick friends with that told me I should come to Sedona, Arizona because there’s people like me there.  We stayed with his father and my buddy took off after a couple of days but his father let me stay for two weeks.  I met two healers in Sedona, one of whom has the same connection I do, just a couple decades further along.  I also learned that the Hopi have a prophecy called the True White Brother who is accompanied by two knowledgeable aides, which I found interesting.  I was supposed to start a new job November 26th that got pushed back to December 10th, so I chose to investigate what I should use that time for.  I decided that I should go visit South Dakota, per the advice of a Lakota elder I received a while back.

I made an account on couchsurfing.com and only reached out to stay with one person, and they accepted.  They just so happened to be the great-grandchild of Old Hollow Horn who rescued Black Elk when he was injured during the Wounded Knee Massacre, which still blows my mind.  I sought and found spiritual guidance that led me to many realizations, and so much of how this has all come together illustrates how creative intelligence can work.  It’s pretty amazing how alike the Lakota and Buddhists are in their belief systems, and I’ve done a lot of research that indicates “star people” are considered spiritual guides in many cultures around the world.  So why are so many people afraid of these beings?

Fear has always been an effective strategy for excluding what’s new, but I hate to break it to you, this isn’t new.  If we’d each do our own research we’d find instances of visitation throughout history.  Since the 1970s, there’s been a warming up to the idea of disclosure, and many creative minds have exhausted themselves producing the best representations of a universal spiritual connection to this force, but why did they do it?  Is it possible Spielberg is a contactee like me and has been channeling?  Was “Arrival” by Denis Villeneuve a subconscious precursor to disclosure?  This certainly seems to have been a gradual process, and the public has gravitated to the idea of it.  When we collect spiritual belief systems from different cultures, they all start to paint a picture that suggests I may be right.

The Lakota have a phrase “Mikatuye Oyasin”, which basically means, “We are all relatives”.  Their philosophy talks about how everything is one, and everything tries to be whole and find balance.  In nature, round is everywhere, which provides interesting insight into how everything we build is square and rigid.  It’s as if the society we’ve created has become unnatural and is working against us.  I’d encourage people to research what percentage of the population were farmers or producers before the industrial revolution.  I don’t think we were meant to spend most of the daylight hours of every week doing work that advances our material agendas and ruins our bodies from sitting.  I don’t think it’s a coincidence that it is very difficult to find spiritual people in high places of business, and I have met more happy homeless people than happy millionaires.  I have a lot of theories and other knowledge about what I’ve seen that I won’t get into because there’s something more important I need to say.

Of all of the research I’ve done, perhaps one excerpt from the Bible can help you understand what I’ve learned.  In John 10:34, Jesus said “Is it not written in your law?  I said, ye are Gods”.  I learned that what I’ve been seeing are the thunder beings of American Indian lore, and they’re likely what put us here.  They can act as spiritual guides and assist medicine men in acting as conduits of the creative energy that comprises all things to heal.  There are people today around the world capable of doing what Jesus did.  I would encourage everyone to do his or her own research before dismissing what I’m saying.  What I now know is that if we are all fragments of that same creational intelligence, then we are basically it, and so is everything.  That would also mean that it’s us in the driver’s seat and not some all-knowing man in the clouds, but we can still seek and be guided by that creative intelligence itself.  Once we understand our own divinity and develop ourselves spiritually, the external fixes we medicate with to make ourselves feel better are no longer needed.  We become empowered, conscious, and realize we are masters of our own destiny.

After traveling the country seeking guidance and meeting many amazing people, I took a step back and looked at society.  So much of what we do is aimed at achieving security while not pursuing freedom, and we don’t understand how much that contributes to our mental state.  I see people burdened by life’s problems without the means or willingness to speak up and change it.  A lot of people almost have this resigned, powerless demeanor with how they view the world, but most of us want to improve it.  I also understand that everything that I’m saying can come with societal consequences, but I’ve put up with worse than y’all can throw at me for the past decade, and this is too important to stay silent.  People are afraid to use their voice because they don’t want to threaten their livelihood, and that shouldn’t have to be a choice.  I know, as do many of you, that what is going on in the world today is not right, and we are encountering difficulty preparing for the consequences that are coming while still contributing to what’s going to cause it.

Words can’t express the love I have for everyone and how much I want to see us flourish and prosper, and that love becomes heavy once we realize what’s coming.  Though my experience is different than yours, it has taught me what’s important…us.  The things that we have prioritized over each other have only hurt us.  When was the last time someone asked you how your day was?  When was the last time you called your family to say you love them?  When was the last time you really felt comfortable and at peace?  I’m here to tell you from personal experience that the solution isn’t external.  Our spirit, which is a collective one, can only be fed with itself.  We are all in this together regardless of what we choose to divide ourselves with, and everyone will feel the consequences that are going to compound unless more drastic action is taken.  We can’t let the science that proves we need to take action fall to the wayside.  If we don’t bring accountability to this world, no one will, and that is the truth.  I love you all and hope my words have helped improve your day in someway, and I’m willing to share about my spiritual experiences, stories, thoughts, or just listen to anybody that wants.  We need connection, and I offer myself to everyone as a start. "

I have a southern accent, and I don’t really want kids. So that really narrows down the choices huh? Lol

I like tattoos and piercings. Don’t have any though? If that makes sense. And most girls I date are shorter than me, but I don’t mind either way. My friends have a running joke that I only date tiny girls with blue hair, but who knows?

Kinda just looking for the right person to make smile. 

Well if I haven’t already shot myself in the foot, feel free to message me. Kinda shy and awkward at first. And I suck at flirting."

I am female 20 who met someone on tinder who is 21 male.

I made a tinder a little while ago to help me get over my ex. We broke up more than 6 months ago. At the time I wasn't over him yet so I wasn't looking for anything serious. On tinder, I met a guy 21 male, and we started talking. I told him about my ex and the whole break up stuff, how i'm not completely over it and he understood I didn't want anything serious. We kept talking and then starting having lots and lot of sex. We go out and eat and go on dates. I am starting to realllyyyy like him. He has showed my how much I've been missing out on because I was tied down by my relationship. I've been trying new things and become so much more happier lately because I have finally and completely moved on from my last relationship. I really like this new guy but we have no future together because he has an internship in cali over the summer for 3 months. We talked about it and he said he can't do a long distance relationship it would be too hard (I don't really agree because he's coming back so if we really liked each other we can do it right?)

Basically in summary, I am completely over my ex, I now like this guy a lot but we have no future. Can someone give me advice on how to not like him too much/not fall in love with him? I don't want to stop talking to him, so I just need advice on how to not be devastated when he leaves.

However, if yall have any tips to change his mind on maintaining our relationship for 3 months pls lmk as well lol

&amp;#x200B;

p.s I've known him for over a month, nothing too serious yet I'm just starting to really like him. We hang out almost everyday. We are exclusive but not dating."

**The Purpose of a Resume**

The purpose of a resume is to effectively communicate your assets like, an outline of your skills, abilities, job-related interests, years of expertise, and accomplishments. whether it’s a paper version or an electronic one, your resume is a self-promoting tool to sell yourself to your prospective employers. It should also inform the potential employer of your career objective (the job you’re seeking) and communicate in an exceedingly precise manner the advantages you will bring to the work and the organization if employed.

**How long should my resume be?**

The answer to this question depends on the variety of things. However, not too way back job seekers were told that a resume should never exceed one page. however, with changing times the factors for resume length has also changed. The new criteria are that if you’re a student, new graduate, entry-level applier a one-page resume should be lots and for a professional with less expertise (5-10 years), you might write a two-page resume to include all relevant info and work history. but for experienced candidates, you must include all the relevant details from your background, like your accomplishments and experiences which will results in a multi-page resume, that is completely acceptable.

**How should I order my resume?**

It is suggested to accumulate the help of an expert resume writer if you’re troubled to pull your resume into a cohesive format, getting no or very less response to your applications, or you’re simply starting out and don’t have any plan how to construct one in a way that will instantly get you an interview call. There are several skilled resumes writing services that may end your miseries. So, how you should choose one?

* Review their website to examine if it’s truly legit. the site should mention the value and supply a comprehensive idea of how the service works. look for testimonials or endorsements by the clients. you’ll be able to also check on LinkedIn and Google the company to check online reviews. Avoid scams.
* Check if they provide competitive evaluation and look at your pocket to see what variety of facilities you’re trying to find.
* A professional resume writing service can use each a form and a phone interview to assist you to get the most effective resume and prepare you for a job interview.
* Check if their resume writers understand how applicant tracking System (ATS) work and the way to optimize your resume with relevant keywords so it’s ATS-friendly.

**Do I need to alter my resume for each application?**

It is very important to tailor your resume to every job description, so it responds to the precise needs of the duty you’re applying for. you just cannot send a generic resume to any job that you notice interesting because it can kill your possibilities of obtaining employment. Tailor your resume to match the skills and requirements the recruiter is searching for. this can help your resume in standing out from the competition. A tailored resume gives you the opportunity to indicate the employer exactly what you’ll be able to do for them and highlight the stories they might care about. according to the study by [Mintopps](http://mintopps.com/), recruiters pay only six seconds looking at a resume before deciding whether to reject the applier. Therefore, your resume should make your case in almost no time.

**How to tailor your resume?**

**Ways that you’ll be able to tailor your resume include:**  
Read and check out to understand the job you’re applying for – It all starts with the job description. completely browse the duty description and highlight all the points that you simply assume are vital, such as the points that are mentioned repeatedly or something that’s slightly out of normal along with those who you could speak to with your expertise and skills. you cannot tailor your resume properly if you’ve no plan what the job entails.  
Check your resume – Check your resume once thoroughly reading the job description to see if you've got the skills and experience that the job demands. Craft your resume with the information you’ve gained from the job description and place it at the top. whether it’s your current position, or some specialized certifications or freelance work, make it the primary section of your resume.  
Make sure that important keywords are listed – Recruiters use ATS to scan your resumes, therefore, check that that it contains the relevant keywords mentioned within the description.

**What not to put on your resume**  
Do not embrace these things on your resume:  
**Private info –** do not embrace any personal info on your resume apart from your address, email, and phone number. Bear in mind that it’s prohibited in India for employers to think about your birth date, sexual orientation, political affiliations, marital status, or religion when looking at your application. therefore, leave them out.

**Typos or factual errors –** confirm to proofread and check for any grammatical errors before submitting your resume. also, make sure to mention your correct e-mail address and phone information otherwise you might never hear from your potential employer ever again.

**pictures and Graphics –** Most hiring managers prefer traditional resumes over seeing pictures and graphics on them. they want to see the facts, what you’re, what skills you possess, your achievements, etc. The visuals can distract them from these crucial facts and details. but in inventive fields like graphic designs, technology, advertising, etc, hiring managers like resume graphics.

**Content in headers –** Recruiters generally cut and paste from your electronic document by doing select-all and pasting into a data system, within which case the header and footer may not be selected. the solution is not to use the word processor header and footer but to create your own at intervals the page. this implies shrinking the word processing system header and footer space and expanding the conventional page space.

**How to write a Resume to search out a Job?**

**Design Layout:** Don’t run over the edge with elaborately adorned templates. look for an adequate area and a font size no smaller than 11 points. There are 3 general formats for making the proper resume: chronological, functional, or combination. Your work history and the style of job you’re applying for can verify the layout vogue.

[**Contact Information:**](http://mintopps.com/contact-us/) create it straightforward for recruiters to attach with you by providing your contact info close to the header.

[**Career Objective**:](http://mintopps.com/current-openings/) A resume objective is often one or 2 sentences long. the most effective objective is one that’s fitted to the job you’re applying for. It states what sort of career you’re wanting, and what skills and experiences you’ve got that makes you perfect for that career.

**Showing off Your Skills:** Don’t create recruiters search for the foremost basic info on your resume — embrace a table of your key soft and hard ability and skills set up top. guarantee your highlighted skills show why you’re an honest match for the job.

**Academic details:** Mention your academic details that include in short regarding your education degrees or certifications and additionally include activities like clubs, athletics, theater, and internship projects.

**List Your Experience:** This phase should embrace every company you’ve worked for, your title, the dates you worked there, and several bullet points that depict your key achievements and responsibilities.

**Include other Positions:** Don’t be afraid to include positions that aren’t specifically associated with the one you’re applying for, particularly if you’ve got restricted work expertise. you’ll still use it to indicate the abilities and qualities you wish to be highlighted.

**The Extra Stuff:** Add some shading to your resume by adding ‘Additional Experience’ space toward the end. include organizations/ clubs, volunteer expertise, awards you’ve won, and even fascinating hobbies or activities.

**Declaration:** At the top embrace the declaration that the above mention info is faithful best of my data and belief. I take the responsibility of any mistakes in data if occur in future.

**Keep It Concise:** Limit your resume to 1-2 pages mostly.

**Reviewing your resume**

There are several services which offer to review resumes to create positive that you land your dream job. you’ll be able to ask your friends, relations, professionals you’re on good terms with, your mentor to review your resume before submitting.

The cover letter and resume combination remain the keystone of a perfect and successful job search. These reasons job seekers invite “How to put in writing a canopy letter and resume and what to place on Resume?” to search out employment.

Here is the sample of the resume that facilitates the job seeker to understand the way to write a resume to find a job. Also, [post your resume](http://mintopps.com/contact-us/) to find a job opportunity in India.

**📷****How to write a cover Letter to search out a Job?**  
Many ask what we should tend to create and attach a personalized cover letter. and the answer is ‘Yes’, the customized letter is a one-page document and will be submitted along with the resume. Even when an employer does not specifically request one, ensure to always send a customized cover letter. the only time you’d like not to send a cover letter when not to ask to send. ensure to follow all points of the work listing to find a job.

**Cover letter includes:**

Contact info  
Include both the employer’s and your contact info one by one or either one aspect of the page.

Content  
In the 1st paragraph, begin by telling the employer the position you’re applying for and how you get to know about the opportunity. the rest of this paragraph should briefly present introduction about you, as well as degree, the realm of studies/expertise, and your career objective in terms of however they line up with the objectives of the corporate. you’ll be able to additionally embrace detail about something in your resume that wants clarification. as an example, you’ll be able to make a case for concerning career shift or an extended gap in employment.

The second paragraph should respond mainly about the job description mentioned by the hiring manager. Depict concerning previous job experiences, skills, and abilities that allow you to meet the company’s needs. to make it simple, you’ll be able to virtually include words and phrases from the work description and responsibilities in your cover letters. Do some analysis concerning the company, and try to find out what they’re doing — and why — given the current condition of their industry.

In the third paragraph, make a case for how you’ll be able to fit into that pattern, and facilitate drive the company forward and accomplish any objectives you speculate they will have.

The last paragraph is that the “call to action.” Inform them that you’d love to get interviewed. Tell them that you’ll be in touch with them in a week if you don’t hear back. thank them for spending the time for reading your resume."

a3lek3,7,2018-12-06,I’ve finally hit rock bottom,youwish85,MultipleSclerosis,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/a3lek3/ive_finally_hit_rock_bottom/,"Hi everyone. This will be only one of the few times I’ve posted on reddit, and also newly diagnosed, so please forgive me if I make any errors, or say something that isn’t allowed. I will start off by saying, I have been through some pretty tough and terrible things in my existence. Things normal people couldn’t begin to imagine the feeling or agony of it all is. (Present company excluded) rare blood disorders, flatlining during surgeries, I could go on, but you get the picture. With that being said, I can 100% say that the path to  MS and Ms itself is the absolute worst thing I have ever experienced. 

In December 2016, I started having headaches. I had always had them off and on but these were different. Accompanied with numbness and tingling in my hands, face, forehead tip of my nose, toes, legs (one or the other). But I would also get the weird arthritic like muscle spasms predominantly in my hands, but sometimes in one of my lower legs or feet. My doctor at the time was an angel. She ordered some blood tests and an mri brain scan. My labs showed my vitamin d level was a 4 guys...a 4. They couldn’t believe I was able to function and thought that to be the culprit until my brain scan came back showing 10 lesions on both hemispheres on my brain. It was listed as unspecified white matter disease but the mri technician felt strongly enough to call my doctor after hours to tell her it indicated a demyelinating disease. 
While waiting for my neurologist appointment I had a particularly stressful day the following few weeks (it’s impossible to see a neurologist quickly around here)  while driving my normal tingles started, except this time, I was finding it difficult to move my arms and legs. I felt shaky and numb. For my safety and everyone else’s I moved my foot off the gas as best I could as more or less drifted into a vacant parking lot. I slumped over and was able to put the car into neutral and just sat there trying to make sense of what was going on. My fingers were shaking but stuck in position at the same time if that makes sense. I could not call or text anyone. At that time, not knowing what spacisity was, it only felt like odd partial paralysis. What truly scares me after all this time is how it’s able to hit me so quickly without much warning. After what felt like forever, I started gaining some finger movement back where I was able to call my husband and get help. 
Neurologist #1 - this woman testing me for some of everything. Temporary paralysis syndrome, stiff person syndrome, any indication of any off the wall viruses I had never heard of. EEG, Psychological testing, certain enzymes in my blood, certain antibodies in my blood, a full work up blood panel on EVERYTHING. Y’all. It all came back negative. So her prognosis was to send me to a neuromuscular specialist 
Neurologist #2 - Another MRI with and without contrast. Same results. Same lesions except the picked up on som lesions on the frontal lobe and found a rare thornwaldt cyst. (I’m a magnet for anything rare it seems) this man wanted to focus on testing me for EVERYTHING that mimics MS. At first I agreed. Because why would I want to get saddled with this? I’m sure done of us ask for it. At that time I was cautiously optimistic. The episodes weren’t super frequent at that time. This place is supposed to be the major leagues of neurology! Even though it was 3 hours away from my home. So. 3 hour one way trips for testing every 2-3 weeks. Let’s do this!...right? 17 tubes of blood were drawn EVERY visit. He was convinced it was my previous rare blood disorder. Nope. Those levels came back fine. So he has tested me for every possible thing you could ever think of in my blood. Half of them I can’t even pronounce. Lyme disease, viruses you get from only leaving the country, that flesh eating virus, even though my skin in fine. Ugh. The test where the electrodes shock the crap out of your nerves and contract your muscles. Every test has came back negative. The last straw was where he requested from my insurance company to do two skin biopsies from my leg, send it off to a special lab for them to test the nerve fibers in my chunks of skin for neuropathy. Because he was convinced! Came back negative I still owe money for that even though he assured me insurance would cover it all.  I stopped going Bc his diagnosis was headache syndrome after I told him my symptoms were getting worse and I kept having this horrible squeezing feeling around my chest, arms like someone was squeezing me tight and I was having shortness of breath. I fell into a deep depression from having to drive alone to all of this appointments because my husband has to watch our 3 children. Through all of this I have never felt more alone. I had 3  jobs and I’m a full time student. . I teach, I had an internship, and I worked part time for numerous car dealerships doing secretarial work. I haven’t seen the neurologist in about 8-9 months. But in the past 4 months I’ve deteriorated pretty quickly. The weakness in my legs (mostly one but sometimes both) sometimes leaves me with an inability to get out of bed. I’ve noticed stress is my primary trigger and I don’t have much of a support system at all. I’ve had to be rushed to the ER twice in the past month for this where they are certain this is MS. When I did call to make an appointment with the #2 Neurologist I had been seeing turns out it was a bingo moment. His nurse informed me he doesn’t specialize in MS. His specialty is headaches. UGH. The FRUSTRATION!! So My primary dr was just as annoyed and  made another referral to a neuroimmunologist who specializes in MS. Tonight scared me the worst. All along my back had been in pain all day but I thought it was where I was favoring one leg all day. In a instant, my speech started slurring and my entire jaw, lower part of my mouth and neck was completely stiff. As well as my neck and back. My head had the sensation that I had a helmet on for some weird reason. Anyway. They wanted to keep me. Ct scan seemed okay. They gave me injections after injections. I feel a little better but man am I sore EVERYWHERE. This is so new to me. I’ve never experienced any of this. I’m not even 100% educated on everything. I am in dire need of support guys. Because I’m not sure I have anyone else to get it from. I know my experiences cannot be anywhere close to what you guys suffer but this is pretty much the only place I knew to turn. Thank you all if you read this far. My apologies for it being so long. It took me quite a while to finish writing it. "

The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

4)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

5)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo

a3lqj3,1,2018-12-06,Unemployed for almost 2 years. Need advice on how to get back in the job market.,IagoAugustos,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a3lqj3/unemployed_for_almost_2_years_need_advice_on_how/,"I'm 25 - about to turn 26 -, I finished college on International Relations. I was an intern at that moment and when the college finished the company wanted to hire me as a full-time. I was working at sales (business to business) and managing accounts, earning 1k and from my home to work took me 2h (very stressful on the subway+walks). It turns out I refused the job, mainly cuz the owner/director used to push 1 employee agaisnt the other and was always promising some good changes just for us to get motivated and any never really happened.

So after college ended. I started applying for Trainees on big companies (I'm currently under some selective process in 2nd and 3rd phases) but odds are I won't get the job since there are about 5-20 opportunities and about 10k ppl competing for them.

Sometimes I work with my parents, but I really don't like the job there, they run a small company and work about 12h per day. I don't even get paid cuz I still live with them and they pay everything for me without complaining.

So I started a pos-graduation course on Project Management and at the same time I'm trying to study to apply for public services but there are high competition as well and I need to study the laws and such that I never studied before. I feel really sad and lost. I see ppl with 19 yo doing really good financially. I'm a total loser I know. I speak English, Spanish and Portuguese, but that does not seem to help to find a job. (I refuse job offers on sales department)

Just need some insights and advice from more experienced ppl. I want to have a solid career on any ""OK"" company but IDK if I have already lost the timing for that.

Actually I just want to be independent and have a good income to live on my own

PS: English is not my 1st language. I don't consider working to my parents as a fixed job, since I try to avoid working there.

TL;DR: Since I finished college and refused to accept the ""promotion"" on the company I was intern,  I've been unemployed working sometimes with parents in a job I don't like. Graduated on International Relations and pos-graduating on Project Management. I want to have a solid career on any ""OK"" company but IDK if I have already lost the timing for that. I feel terrible. I just want to be independent and have a good income to live on my own."

I haven't graduated yet, though I've signed my accepted offer, and I'll start upon graduation after finals. 

I knew during my sophomore year I really needed an internship that summer doing ANYTHING related to have any hope of having a chance of a decent internship after my junior year. I took a job at a wastewater treatment plant with their college summer help program doing menial labor. I cut weeds, painted, swept, whatever. This also gave me an opportunity to network. I was able to talk to the plant's controls engineer and help him pulling cables and doing other stuff, I worked under the maintenance group so I worked closely with machinists, mechanics, operators, and engineers. I worked my butt off. I knew it was dumb work, but I also knew I could have an opportunity for a real engineering internship next summer if I proved myself capable.  

I applied for an engineering internship there for the following summer which I didn't get, but I was offered a co-op position in the maintenance and reliability group. I was really torn about this, meaning I would have to postpone graduation, and not be with all of my friends through the rest of junior and senior year. I would have to wait a whole year to be able to take the classes that were only offered in the winter. Considering I knew I was in college to eventually get a job, I decided that this was the best way to do that was by avoiding the ""need experience to get experience"" loop. I did it and it was the best. I loved maintenance, and the cool things I was able to do, and this helped me see that engineering is a lot more than what's on the diploma. This helped me develop a well rounded skill set as someone with a chemical engineering  background, working in a civil engineering dominated field, doing something that's traditionally a mechanical engineer's job. 

After the co-op ended after 6 months I had a few months to kill so I found a job as a temporary machine operator at a manufacturing facility where I was able to learn about manufacturing, and lean six sigma. This also helped me understand operators, which is huge when employers are looking for engineers to hire, how do they handle and communicate with the operators. 

Back at school I had a gap semester to work on generals before I could take the classes I missed because of my co-op, this semester was great, I was able to get classes out of the way that allowed my senior year to be much more laid back, but more importantly I was able to get another internship before graduating. I hit the career fair hard. I know a lot of people hate it, and I do too, but it's kinda fun because this is where you're able to brag about how awesome you are, and the recruiters want to talk to you. I was able to get a summer internship at a small independent refinery, which was an amazing experience. 

Before the summer even ended I was researching companies, and linking people on linkedin, in contact with my university's career center trying to find alumni who I could network with. Again I know this sucks but networking is 90% of the battle. I had a lot of interviews, but only one offer, at a cool company but in the middle of absolutely nowhere. I was torn, to take the job or not. I asked the company for more time to decide, and I was able to get the offer at the company I really wanted to work for in the location I wanted to be. 

To sum it all up:

1) Get as much experience as you can as early as you can. Even if it means swallowing your pride. It will be worth it. 

2) Network, network, network. As much as it sucks, it's who you know more often that what you know. 

3) Don't be afraid of alternate paths. I was unsure about maintenance and I loved it. Don't be too picky. You can learn from any job. 

4) Hit the career fairs hard. Smile,make eye contact, stand tall, dress well,  be eloquent, practice your ""elevator pitch"", link with the recruiters, go to dinners, its more important than 1 or 2 hw grades.

5) Persevere. It's really hard to find a job, but if you prepare it will all work out. It will seem that some of your classmates will be getting all the interviews, or whatever, but even those guys will be getting mostly rejected. 

I wish someone had sat me down when I was a freshma and told me about some of these things, I would have done a lot more and I wouldn't have had to work as hard as I did at finding internships and eventually a job. If you're older in the program or a grad student a lot of these principles still apply, I know a lot of grad programs allow for internships. Take advantage of that.

a3ocas,2,2018-12-06,AITA because I was honest with my wife about feelings i had developed for someone else?,[deleted],AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a3ocas/aita_because_i_was_honest_with_my_wife_about/,"Background: I'm a stay at home dad married with two young boys. I'm recovering from cancer and driving uber at nights. I'm going through a bankruptcy to eliminate my medical debt and alleviate our family of my previous debts incurred when I was going to be the breadwinner before getting sick. Wife is breadwinner now because of my health until things get better.

During November I had developed a connection with someone who showed me respect and admired me and liked me. It felt nice to be wanted and important to someone again. I started having strong feelings for this person (they ultimately did not want to reciprocate btw and nothing happened.)

The exchange however led me down the road of considering things like polyamory. When I realized how strongly I felt all this I told my wife basically everything. I asked to have an honest discussion about all this.

She became hysterical but worse she became emotionally unstable. She would agree to talk about it then she'd accuse me of cheating then she'd start laying ground rules for this alternative relationship then she demanded I end it then she discussed the pros and cons philosophically....And rinse and repeat like this every ten minutes for three days straight.

For the most part I just stood my ground and argued logically and rationally. Finally we had an argument where we both pressed each other's buttons. She went to bed. I got pissy and threw my Hanukkah gifts in the yard like a child. I was rude and made noise as I left to go drive uber in the middle of the night. I was a dick I'll admit that.

I came back late like 20 min before she had to leave for work so I could watch the kids. I made her uncomfortable on purpose...Again I know I'm a dick on this part I know and I feel bad.

She ignores me all day via text and is like ""I want space"". Which just annoyed me because I wanted to resolve the issue since I could see it was important to her. After my little temper tantrum I was ready to just capitulate and be like, ""yknow that whole polyamory thing? That other girl? Yeah fuck that you're fine you're good enough. And I'm sorry.""

But she came home wound up. She wouldn't hardly talk at all. She took the kids for a walk. She came back. My son did something he wasn't supposed to and I yelled at him harsher than I should have. I was sleep deprived and she was hovering with all this tension and it came out poorly and I feel bad for yelling at him so loudly.

Well at that point she snaps. She says that her and the kids are going to dinner. I say they're not she says they are I say they're not...Back and forth and getting louder.

I step between the kids and her and say ""no they aren't you can go to dinner on your own if you need space, I can feed the kids here at home.""

She moves for them and I say over my dead body. She bursts into tears and threatens to call the police. The kids are running around screaming and crying. Everything is hell and chaos. She starts pulling them out the door I pull back. Neither of us hurt the kids or each other. She gets in the car and leaves. I call the cops.

They take my statement and tell me that she is at the police station giving a statement. Our statements match so no issues.

Later a whole Armada of police come to the house she has her unit commander, a family advocate, a fleet of police. They're locked and loaded. Scared the shit outta me. They escort her to pick up items for the night and wisk her away to a hotel.

She ignores all contact that night. Next day she says she wants a 90 day separation, counseling, therapy for me, and anger management courses. She'll decide when I can see the kids and when I can come home.

None of these things are legal and I have NOT consented to any of this. I think separation is just a way to practice divorce. I think it's a horrible idea personally. How can I devote myself to her and make things up if I have to simultaneously focus on the possible upcoming legal battle which I have no way of winning since I'm bankrupt, sick, without a home, male, and the car I use for work is hers? I'm so beyond screwed it's not even funny.

A couple of days in and I'm in a different place on an air mattress. I've had nothing to eat for days I've barely slept. Like how am I supposed to ""man up"" when I'm dangerously sick and without resources to do anything. Like I have less and being asked to do more now.

Am I the asshole Reddit? Is she? Are we both? Are we neither? 

Reddit I'm hurt. I don't even know if I want to survive this to be honest. It's killing me. And I'm so desperate to talk to anyone that I'm telling an entire internet filled with strangers.

In three years I went from promising aerospace engineering prospect with sports cars a beautiful wife and kids to sick and dying, family and I had a fall out after they mishandled my sister's addiction and she died...Then that same family kept me away as my aunt died of cancer at the same time I got sick. Two friends committed suicide. The VA denied everything I lost all my savings everything I worked for. My internship crashed and so did my education. My wife got a job and we moved and I've been. A stay at home dad this last year and now...Here we are.

Am I just a big fuckup Reddit? I wanted something good and different in my life from the three years of hell and now I'm about to lose everything I have left.

What's the point Reddit?

AITA and do I need to just suck it the fuck up and ""man up"" or die trying?"

a3ohmv,3,2018-12-06,[RO] An older woman.,LoudDBlog,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/a3ohmv/ro_an_older_woman/,"This is an awkward story, and a real one.  
I met a lady named Gem through Tinder, and she was really the only good relationship I got out of that app.  
We matched. I got the notification and I went to check her profile. She was a tall, blonde woman, blue eyes, round face, sharp Scandinavian features. She was a big woman. She wasn’t my type I thought.  
She was 34.  
I was 22 at the time.  
That was interesting, to say the least. She was a beautiful woman. I would have not thought she was anywhere on top of 30. She had a PHD, was an amateur fencer, and she was quite bright. I was intrigued.  
However, I was at an awkward place at the time.  
I had recently left a relationship with a woman that I thought I was going to end up marrying. A three-year-old relationship. My longest relationship at the time. I wasn’t at my best.  
I was, at the time, trying things out with my current partner. We were talking everyday, but we were also in different countries. We had more than 6 hours in time difference between us. To see her I had to take a 14 hour plane trip. We thought we wouldn’t commit just yet. We were finding our way. We had talked about it. We made that choice together. We did end up committing. That’s another story.  
I am an incredibly monogamous person. I wasn’t on Tinder for sex to be honest. I was on Tinder to meet people outside my circle. I am fully aware that sounds like bullshite. Some of my coworkers thought the same when I told them in confidence. It wasn’t bullshite. I wanted to befriend different woman and talk. I missed talking face to face, and enjoying a dinner with someone of the opposite sex. I wanted psychological intimacy without the physical, at least at that time.  
It was an awkward situation.  
I am an up front man. If I started talking to someone and we eventually ended up meeting, I would tell them I wasn’t here for a quickie straight away. I would tell them about my long distance relationship and my situation.  
Gem took this better than I thought. It was over coffee. We met at the centre of the city. She was at an awkward place herself. She had focused solely on her career for more than a decade. Ever since she left university. She had dated, but never committed. She said she understood where I was. That was interesting.  
She was an industrial engineer. A good one. She was the daughter of migrants, first generation, and as such, she was held to a really high standard in terms of her education. The money her parents had, was not much. She couldn’t waste a second of a lesson. That would be throwing her parent’s money away.  
Her company was undergoing some problems and she was on a reduced schedule, 35 hours a week.  
To anyone with any sense of balance, this would have been awesome, but she wasn’t the balanced kind.  
If you suddenly take cocaine away from an addict, he’ll go into withdrawal.  
For her, work was everything. Work, religion and fencing, that was her life. When one of those things was taken away, she got bored. Boredom is a slow killer, and that’s why she was looking for a date. She had focused on her fencing for a long while, but physical activity only gets you that far.  
Another interesting fact about Gem. She was a devout Christian.  
That was a problem for me, since I had experience with very religious women, and it wasn’t something that I wanted to go through again.  
On our first coffee, after we got both of our situations explained, we talked religion.  
I’m not a Christian per se, but I’ve read the book, twice. I’ve also read the Tora and the Cur’an. Religion fascinates me.  
We talked about the old testament, and how God seems a much harsher figure there than in the new testament. We talked about the figure of Jesus, and Mohammed, whom she had very little knowledge of. She listened, drew parallels between both religions easily. At one point, I entertained the possibility of religion as a method of control.  
She said something wonderful about that.  
“I am not going to disagree.” Ice blue eyes fixed on mine.  
Finding a person willing to accept the flaws of their chosen lifestyle with grace is not something that happens every day.  
We dropped the religion talk, as it was getting a bit serious, and I told her a few of my funny stories. The one about the croissants, she had a laugh with that one. Told me that I should write it up. Funny enough, [I did end up writing it up](https://medium.com/@LoudD/best-croissants-ive-ever-had-579f7df4d153). She thought it would be quite a hit. When I posted it, [it was](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/a0tu2d/hm_best_croissants_ive_ever_had/). She was quick to laugh and we had a similar sense of humour. We thought it was a pretty good talk over coffee at 4pm.  
We kept meeting over coffee. Once every two weeks or so, and we texted infrequently.  
I kept in touch with my long distance partner and we would talk every day. I always told her where I was and when I was going for coffee with Gem.  
In over two months, Gem and I shared nothing but words over coffee. I was not interested in anything physical and Gem said she understood. However, the age gap was starting to show after a few months.  
Some of my conversation can still be considered a bit immature. I’m a kid at heart. Some of this she enjoyed, but some of this bored her. She stepped up the game and invited me to dinner.  
The restaurant was in one of the oldest buildings in the centre. It overlooked some of the most iconic parts of the city. It was her treat, she said. The thing about dating a woman that has a decade on you is that the pay gap shows. I was working at a big company, an internship, barely made the minimum salary working 25 hours a week. She didn’t mind putting out of her pocket but I felt… lesser? I’m not sure how to describe that sensation. I’ve always thought that a good 50/50 is the best way to go about paying things, however… She was making a lot more than I was.  
I arrived to the place wearing a shirt and tie. One of my first attempts to look nice since I left things with my ex. She was wearing an elegant blue dress, v neck and skirt ending about a hand after the knee. She was looking beautiful.  
I felt like an elephant in a cathedral. I was not used to fancy. I still ain’t.  
The talk there didn’t feel like our usual coffee afternoons. We would usually dig up some politics, or some old story of ours and the chat would organically shift from one topic to another. Not that night. She wanted to talk investment banking, where she was putting her finances and such. Something that I frankly had very little knowledge of. She ordered this white wine, I didn’t ask, it was amazing. We were both two cups down when the main course came in.  
The main course gave us a chance to quietly enjoy each other’s company. It was a relief not having to pretend that I was enjoying the conversation. Normally I wouldn’t, but she was buying dinner.  
We finished our main course talking about the views and how pretty the city looked from there. We finished the bottle right before the second course came in. She ordered another.  
The waiters took the first course away and she started yet another… controversial topic to say the least.  
She was thinking about buying a bigger house. She didn’t quite say this but I inferred she was already thinking about moving in with someone. A place that would have extra rooms to be filled in the next couple of years. She said she was about to be moved to a managing position, or so her boss kept insisting. She wanted to stay in town, even though her parents were from other parts. She had too many plans and I was adrift. I really wasn’t enjoying this dinner. It was a pity on my eyes, she had been such a good conversationalist up to this point.  
I decided to take the conversation elsewhere. I focused on another couple. They were 50 and they were quite… cheesy. The man was kissing the lady’s hand and she was making these posh “Oh darling!” noises that were driving me insane. I started to pretend I was the woman, comically extending my left hand like I was a queen about to get my hand kissed by a lord, on my other hand I was extending all of my fingers, grouping the middle finger and the ring finger together, and putting them close to my mouth while I made an exaggeration of a “oh!” face.  
She started laughing, chocked on the wine and made a huge mess.  
Second course got to the table. We were a bottle and a half down. Food was superb and I was looking to avoid any “please marry me now” topics from there on. We managed to avoid those, mainly because as we ordered desserts the wine hit me.  
White wine is like an old lady with an umbrella, you think she’s harmless until she swings the thing, hits you in the head and down you go, like a house of cards.  
At that point of the night Gem was looking for easy laughs. Wine made it a lot easier and I’m quite the clown. We left the restaurant at 1 am.  
“Your parents are away on holiday… right?” she asked.  
“Yes they are! I’ll get home, I promise!” I replied. I was quite drunk by then.  
We got in a cab and she dropped me at my place. She walked me to the door and we said goodbye. When I got home I couldn’t fit the key through the keyhole.  
I called her, laughing like a hyena, asked her to come up to help me. It was a battle I could not win alone.  
She arrived to the reception area:  
“Cadet Gem reporting for duty!”  
We laughed while we tried to fit the key through the hole. Not an easy task.  
We managed to open the damn door and we cried “YES!”  
We were super proud of our accomplishment. I thanked her and wished her well in her own battle at her doorstep.  
“You will be fine soldier, we couldn’t have done this without you.” I said.  
“Well, I could come in and spend the night…”  
Remember how I said that I was monogamous and I wasn’t interested in sex? Well… I was very drunk and…  
“You could, but you’re not gonna.” I said as I slammed the door in her face.  
\---  
I was drunk but I was still me. She shouldn’t have been trying to tempt me out of something that I clearly stated from moment one I didn’t want to do. She of course didn’t quite see it the same way. At least right away. But I wasn’t giving up on our platonic relationship so long as she was fully aware of what the terms were.  
\---  
End of part 1.

a3pb4p,8,2018-12-06,When it rains it pours,forestwake,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/a3pb4p/when_it_rains_it_pours/,"Two days ago was an absolute low point for me, I broke down like I never have before. I knew deep down that I had to quit and I’ve tried before but this time the stakes were higher. If I didn’t quit and get my act together I knew in a year I would fail out of an excellent top 25 college, would have to move back home and be an absolute laughing stock.  

But today was different. I got an acceptance email for an internship this summer at a bulge bracket bank. I also found out that I was approved to study abroad in London in the fall of next year. I know the only reason I was accepted to both was because of a start up venture I began in high school that grew and become rather profitable. I’m saying all of this to let you all know that it is possible to turn your life around, starting with one small step at a time. I also want to say that the feeling from accomplishing something you’ve worked for feels infinitely more fulfilling than getting high and feeling like you’ve accomplished something that in reality is all in your head. 

Finally and most importantly I want to speak on the concept of hope and the importance of having hope during the process of quitting marijuana. I think many people begin using marijuana as a way to have fun and relax but slowly the complex changes and the relationship morphs into using marijuana as a crutch. The crutch could be for anything really, feeling bored? Smoke. Feeling alone? Smoke. Feeling sad? Smoke. Smoking creates a barrier between yourself and your real emotions, it separates them and makes it much easier to suppress them. We all know what happens when people suppress emotions, they will come out eventually and often times it’s an incredibly intense, uncomfortable and dangerous situation . Marijuana is delaying that from happening thus allowing more emotions to be suppressed. From the hours spent on r/leaves the one common denominator that I have found was that people feel hopeless, their future seems dull and they do not believe in the possibility of a better tomorrow. Believing in the possibility of a better tomorrow is utmost in quitting, it is the bedrock of recovery. 

Hope allows for motivation and motivation allows for action and finally action allows for change and recovery to occur. 

I want to post soon about the ways to find hope to begin the process soon, if you’re interested let me know.

I understand it's a hard course, but it is way too difficult. It's not a weed out course, this is a course that juniors are taking, as well as seniors trying to graduate. I guarantee there's a lot of students out there who are relying on passing this course to graduate and now can't graduate on time because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry, but the average on homework assignments should not be around 50%. The average on tests is low, and that's normal for harder classes. However, the most recent project was released and I was above average with a 40%. I spent probably 40 hours on that project, testing every single case, asking TAs for assistance, getting feedback, saying my test cases were valid, only to end up 3% above average. No project should have an average of 37%, that's an issue with the course. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's going to be a lot of people that comment on this saying this is a complaint or that it's just how it is, and yes, it is a complaint. I spend almost all of my free time on this course, and I'm barely above average. This class is single-handily going to lower my GPA, which unfortunately could be the difference be the difference between getting an internship. Something needs to change about this course, as I have friends that took algorithms at other universities and they're amazed at how shitty our curriculum for it is and how low our average is. Their averages were in the 70%.

He's been in neuro ICU ever since, and it's been very touch and go. 

He has been in an internship with the local Ford dealership while in high school, just doing basic recalls and oil changes. He's loved every minute of it, and calls me all the time to tell me how it's going. 

At the time of the crash he had only been there about 2 months. However, the manager of the dealership and a lot of his co-workers have been coming to the hospital and sitting with my family every few days. It's not a quick drive either, over an hour each way for most of them. 

Today, 3 of the higher ups from Ford came and visited him, brought him some posters and stuff to hang up in his room. They sat and prayed with our family. They genuinely seemed concerned and caring for my brother, someone who had only just started working for them, and I thought that was absolutely amazing. 

I'm in no way endorsing Ford products. I drive a Volvo and my entire Family either drives GM based products or Toyotas. But with all this negative news lately about American manafactures, I thought it was really amazing to see some very high up corporate people from Ford come and just show their support for my brother.

Sorry, I just thought y'all would like to hear some positive stuff, and I kinda needed to vent as well. So thanks for reading, and thank you Ford "

Back story: I have a bachelors degree and 4 years of lab experience in the biotech industry. 3 of these years were in a bio repository and the last year was in sample management for a bio analytical company. Between my internships and class work, my most notable skills are Flow Cytometry (through many hours of shadowing), next gen sequencing, PCR/qPCR, and cycle sequencing. 

I have a phone interview tomorrow for a lab associate position in Flow Cytometry with a well known CRO that is very hard to get into. Even a phone interview is hard to get. I have good chances of getting it because they are mainly looking for exposure to the techniques and knowledge of the theory. 

The roughest part of this is that the hours are 11-7 with a fiancé at home and it is a 10 month contract temp job. I think I could work with the schedule but the temp job at the moment has no indication of permanent hire, I will ask during the interview tomorrow. I feel like it could be a foot in the door in which I could apply to another position there towards the end of my contract or I could take the experience and find another job. 

What do you guys think? Would you take a position like this if you were in my shoes?

Been a long time lurker, haven‘t even had subscribed but I enjoy the stories posted, mostly because I witness similar stuff all the time. 

About me; I‘m in my early 30s but I look very young, especially as a Credit Officer from one of the biggest banks in Switzerland. Now you see why I want to be sure my identity won‘t get revealed and I apologize for any english mistakes (partially because I‘m writing on my phone or because I‘m too lazy - long day).

My job is to approved big or ‚too big‘ credits, special loans and pretty much any form of money a firm, corporation etc. wants/needs. We usually have our strict rules for when it‘s possible to approve or not, but the Credit Officer, which is in casu me, can approve in certain situations that practically almost never apply. But being a ressource strong bank we grant the credits for „important“ clients that we profit a lot. So technically we‘re breaking the rules to make more money for our clients. 

The personal consultant of this very client had set a meeting with or client, in which I asked to join, because normally the credit should have been denied, but since it is a big client I wanted to gather all the facts and hear the client out and mostlikely accept his request. The personal consultant is a super chill dude, who‘s 47y old and looks way older than me and really knows his shit. He‘ll be called P in this story and the client, the controller and financial director representing his firm, C:

We both get to the meeting early and wait in the conference room for the client to show up. He comes in, 5 min late but who cares, big client. He knows P so he shakes hands with both of us and doesn‘t ask who I am. I just think ok, the man has no time to waste, so whatever. They both start to talk and discuss the important stuff, I just take notes and listen. I had instructed P to tell the client in a very polite and easy going way that the credit was way over the capacity of what we could give him and so he does, when C interrupts him mid sentence and shit goes down:

C: „We have been your client before we both we even worked here and every request was always accepted. I thought we were friends and this how you treat your friends you damn soulless and greedy ass (yeah he said exactly that). How dare you bring your intern (assuming me) to a meeting like this in the first place?!“

See, I’m really not short tempered at all, but it happened to be a shitty day with the stocks being low and me having to work on multiple complaints about basically everything, so I just didn‘t have the nerves to stay polite. I just closed my note book, put my pen back into my inside pocket of my suit, which is usually a sign my coworkers understand as ,now it‘s my turn‘. Doesn‘t happen a lot, but I wasn‘t having it at all.

I start to explain why the requested credit ‚should‘ have been denied in the way every 5y old would get, ending the sentence with:

„And every fucking intern of my bank knows that shit because they actually learned that in University unlike you.“

C, completely confused and red as a pepper stared me down speechlessly. I was straight up just pissed how a client would even think of talking that way to one of my workers and then call me an intern, not even knowing who I am. 

Me: „You know if you let P just finish, you would walk out this door with XXXX€ (big number I can’t tell) more in your credit account. But you had to insult the one person that actually decides whether or not you receive it and that‘s me, ‚Me‘ the CO of this bank. According to our policies and the one of the national credit comitee we are not allowed to give out that much money to you, except if there are special circumstances, which I don‘t see.“
He perfectly knows that we have these rules and he also knows that, we do give credits like that to subjectively important clients. 

I signaled my coworker that we were leaving, stood up and looked C in the eyes. He seemed even more red than before but now he had a pretty desperate look. Now, starting to cool down a little, I let my coworker lead the way out and wished a nice day, letting C in the conference room alone. While on the way out I threw in a: „Greetings to ‚His boss‘, haven‘t seen him in a long time.“ 

Since I am the CO and my decisions are 99.99%  undisputable, because we really don‘t have to accept these kind of requests, no one will ever take me on for that, because I was just following the rules. 

You can imagine how amusing the call from his boss was for me. 

tl;dr - Client requested a too big credit for a project, which he normally would have gotten denied, but I, credit officer of a big bank, can always grant it for special circumstances, lashes out on my coworker in a meeting I joined. Client had no clue who I was, insulting first my coworker and then me, leading to him not getting the credit for his firm, he otherwise would have gotten, because as he argumented „we should just follow the rules.“

Edit: a few mistakes corrected and a clarification for why it‘s compliance"
a3ru2p,2,2018-12-06,"Graduating Computer Science Student, just finalized a bodily injury settlement from auto accident",malekhai,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a3ru2p/graduating_computer_science_student_just/,"Little overview:

I was struck by a truck in a motorcycle accident earlier this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Motorcycle had been purchased in January with the intent of paying off the loan over the summer to build credit and to replace my aging vehicle as my main transportation through most of the year. Motorcycle was totaled so I moved up my plan of picking up a new vehicle, which ended up around 36k before a 4k down payment (through insurance reimbursement and savings)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be graduating from a local in-state university in the next week or so with a bachelors in Computer Science. Haven't signed a job offer yet, but have a fairly strong resume from a 3.5 year long internship and a few different interviews coming up

&amp;#x200B;

Student loans total around 23.5k at roughly \~4% averaged, but is subsidized so interest won't start accruing for another 6 months or so as I understand it

Car loan is around 30k left at 0.9% (72 month, \~$450 a month payment)

&amp;#x200B;

Settlement is for \~29k after all legal fees.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My current thought is student due to higher interest and using the leftover to assist in move from home post-graduation. Paying off car loan would allow me to reduce insurance rates (At \~$150/month at the moment). A third option is to look at investing it, but I think I'd prefer just get one of the loans out of the way

&amp;#x200B;

Which option does it make the most sense to pay off first? Student or car?"
a3ru8s,7,2018-12-06,Received a phone interview for government job,[deleted],usajobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/usajobs/comments/a3ru8s/received_a_phone_interview_for_government_job/,"Hello all,

Today, I obtained a phone interview for a government job, GS-13 level.  The phone interview is Monday.

This would be a great job to have.  I also seem to have an ""in"" for this job.  A manager for a past internship emailed me today saying that the hiring manager for the job was asking about me.

I would like to know what an average timeline looks after the phone interview round?  Does it take a while?

Also, I have applied to other non-public sector jobs and I seem to be closing in on another job.  It's not final yet however.  But I want to be sure I make the right decision and end up with atleast one job instead of ending up with nothing.  I would really like a shot at this government job however I am unsure if it would be a slow process.

I am posting to see what I could expect going forward for this government job.

I'm a junior student at a prestigious school and I have landed a software internship with a fortune 500 company and will be developing in C/C++ during my internship. 

From what I understand C++ is the language of choice for algorithmic trading at HFT firms due to its performance. 

Do you think this experience will be enough for me to land a development job at a quant firm as a software developer after University if I become proficient in C++? If not, what else do I need to know?

a3t1fc,2,2018-12-06,Info Technology Program?,BaneTheGame,UNF,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNF/comments/a3t1fc/info_technology_program/,"I told my adviser that I wanted to do an Information Science major and get into the Cybersecurity field, and they showed me a course diagram for Information Technology and told me it'll be changed to Cybersecurity in the Fall. This made me choose that, but I feel like I won't get as much out of it as doing IS.

&amp;#x200B;

From my observations in the tech community, IT does not seem to be as respected as something like CS, and many think of a support desk or office computer guy when they hear it. However, I showed the diagram to someone and they said it looks like it has much more cybersecurity material than they expected from an IT program.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone in the IT program or in the school of computing have an opinion on it that they could share or compare to IS? I'm kind of interested in IS as well, but it'll take me 3 years instead of 2 with IT. And what kind of internships or work opportunities would I be likely to get with IT from UNF?"

I tried getting internships but Ive only been rejected so far. My news reporting professor thinks I should go straight for a job but I don’t think I have enough experience for a set job just yet. 

Three people I had class with already have reporting jobs, and we all just graduated this past June. They knew what they wanted to do in the beginning so they have a lot of experience and practice already. I was never on their level.

I’m not sure what to do at this point. I thought about going back to school because we have a good program and I could get more experience, but it’s a lot of money. Going straight for a job doesn’t seem like a smart idea, at least in my head.

a3tylz,110,2018-12-06,Some things i have noticed while recruiting...,Just__another__smith,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/a3tylz/some_things_i_have_noticed_while_recruiting/,"I have been involved in recruiting lately and here are some things I think candidates should know, these are personal opinions, and some may seem obvious but it seems like some reminders and/or an opinion may be helpful.  I mostly look at people with 1-3 years of experience, so mileage may vary on my comments.  Generally, it seems that candidates over inflate their abilities and experience, which I know is because they are trying to look like a good candidate, but it is highly prevalent and actually makes me skip some resumes.  Almost every candidate is easily stumped when asked basic questions about the work listed on their resume.

Interview things

\- Of course be on time, haven't see that as an issue.

\- Wear a suit.  2 candidates were dressed nicely, but were really just business casual.  While it doesn't ""matter"", I noticed.

\- Bring copies of resume, and offer it at the start. (especially if you have passed an exam or something has materially changed).  Prepare a written list of questions so I know you are serious and prepared.  I see candidates without it and i cant always tell if they are winging it or not.  Take down names, get business cards ect.

\- Review your resume and be prepared to give an example and detail of every project you have listed.  I'll be asking about similar functions in the new roll to check knowledge base and see if you can clearly explain the topic to me.  If we spend the entire interview talking in depth on one single topic that is 100% fine with me.  At entry level, depth is much more appealing than breadth.

\- Make it clear that you working here is a win win.  At the entry level jobs, I hear this is a better career move, the clients are more interesting, better exam support ect, all true but that is how you benefit.  Tell me you'll work hard, learn fast, and become a ~~work horse~~  analyst.

&amp;#x200B;

Resume things

\-Others may disagree, but an objective or summary or mission statement is 100% useless to me.  So is a list of adjectives like Hard Worker, Driven, Knowledgeable, Strong Project Management skills, Independent, ect.  Even if it is true, it looks/sounds fake.

\-I saw more than a handful of 2 page resumes...it just needs to be 1 page.  List out exams on one line, I don't need dates when you passed (put year if you can make it look good), use that space on job history or internship or anything else. Exams and college don't need to take up half the page as those are just check boxes. Take off your HS and College sports.  I would probably even delete clubs/groups unless it is related to job and you had a leadership or mentoring roll (ie. act sci club president, tutoring, TA ) even then I would ask how truly valuable it is.

\-Be very knowledgeable about what you put under your work history.  THIS SHOULD BE THE MOST ROBUST SECTION! I'm going to ask you questions and you need to know relevant terminology, process (ie. what data do you need, calculations overview, outputs), estimations, how it was used or presented to the client, ect. Don't put something that you can't speak to.  I found multiple candidates say they just did a small piece and didn't really know much about a topic on their own resume.  I had one candidate tell me an RDS attestation, which he said he was the analyst on many cases, was to ""make sure there was enough money in the plan"". HA!

\-DO NOT put advanced, seasoned,  experienced, etc if you are not that! I will find it, I will grill you.  I know you are entry level, and that is fine, I'm looking for personality and growth not experience.  Almost every candidate had something to this effect related to SAS, SQL, Excel or consulting.  All but one candidate had experience with it outside college projects.  It is a bad look to have ""Proficient in SAS"" when you have never done a real project with it.  Same with excel, unless you can code macro's, build and manage models, you are likely intermediate at best.  It is one of those things where the more you know, the more you know you don't know. Just put excel, uses index/match, pvt tables, etc.  Similar comments with consulting experience, unless you have an active speaking roll, don't put it.  It is good to know that you went to meetings, but that seems like more of a conversation topic.  I would be more interested in increases in responsibility, projects or training you lead, an updated procedure document you drafted, etc.  If you have been somewhere for a couple years I'm looking for how you grew in your roll, contributed to the team, and took on additional responsibility.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank for the warm response, and dealing with my spelling...I just want to comment that it isn't my goal to grill anyone and I don't get joy out of it, in fact I find it super awkward, but at the end of the day, it is my job to find the right candidate which is ultimately why I wrote this post.  

I also wanted to include a note I wrote to my manager recommending the candidate to maybe give more context as to what I would be looking for: She will come in a little behind from a knowledge base, but she was polished, genuine, and respectful in the interview. She passed 2 unsupported exams at XXX in a non actuarial role, and I feel she is highly driven to make the career change.  I think she is very willing to work hard and catch up, and will quickly make contributions to the team. (She received an offer and accepted.)

I also just wanted to highlight this comment I made, as it is the main take away:

I think the main point of my post is just have a reason for everything you put on there and a way to put yourself in a positive light, if you can't take it off. You're essentially handing me the questions you want me to ask, so why ask a question that you cant answer. "
a3u6al,1,2018-12-06,"My (21NB) best friend (26F) has confessed that she loves me, but I don't love her. Now she won't leave me alone",cinncinatis_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a3u6al/my_21nb_best_friend_26f_has_confessed_that_she/,"So, yeah, this happened. So a bit of a backstory so you can have a better understanding. 


 I've been with this friend of mine, let's just call her Emma for the sake of privacy, ever since we were kids. She's obviously five years ahead of me, so she went threw life earlier than me. I was there for every break up, and every phase of her life. She never got out of the goth phase. Anyway, she graduated college and is now working full time as Veterinarian, and has lived a single life for a long time. I work as an intern for a psychologist. 


Now onto the main reason why I'm typing this out, she invited me to her house a week ago just to watch AHS and have a few drinks. A few meaning quite a lot. 


We were having fun, and got a bit drunk. More or less talking than watching the show. Things were getting more weird when she start making sexually tinged comments towards me. I felt uncomfortable and a tried to ignore it, but she kept pushing, then I snapped at her and asked her why she wad acting like this.


Then she just goes off on a tangent and says that she's loved me for a long time and that she's felt this way for a long time. I was flattered, but I didn't feel the same way. I only love her as a friend. I told her this, but it was like she ignored what I said. She tried to kiss me, but I pushed her away and told her that it was best that I left. So that's what I did. 


I went to bed as soon as I got home and just forgot about what just happened. I figured she was just had too much to drink. 


The day after, I wake up to a spam a messages and notifucations. 17 messages from Instagram and 14 messages to my phone number. All of them from Emma. All of the messages don't really matter. One of them said to come back and that's all I really read. She meant want she said, and it only got worse from here.


She would text me in the middle of work, and ask if there was someone else at work. There isn't, I like to keep work relationships professional. I said no, but she didn't believe me. Every day was something different to try and make me feel guilty. She would use our friendship as an excuse to be with her and how that's the ""sign."" Whatever that means.


 She would stalk me at work, and purposely schedule appointments at the office I worked in just to talk to me. She would drag on arguments in the office and just completely ruin the flow of my work schedule. It would get so out of hand, that my co-workers would cover for me whenever I was busy and say I wasn't in work. Luckily, that kept her away. 


The final straw, was when I was on a date with a woman I actually had romantic feelings for. It was on our days off, so I'm sure this was bound to happen. On our way to call a taxi, (forgive me, I don't have a license yet) I see her car pull up on the side of the street from where we were standing, rolls down the window, and asks who the girl was that I was dating. She made accusations that I was cheating, when we were never dating in the first place. She then tried to lie to the lady I was taking out that we were dating. 
She literally tried to lie in front of my face, but I lucked out and she knew better. I'm a very loyal person, and don't lead girls on like that. 


I didn't feed the situation, got in the taxi and left. 
She didn't follow us, thank god. I was through with these arguments she was causing, and done with her ruining my social life. Every day after that, was just another text that only told me that she was not getting the hint. It's getting to the point where it's harassment. I tried blocking her number and social media, but she comes back with a new number after a week of silence. I need outside help, and I don't know what to do. If anyone can give some kind of advice, it would be appreciated. Thanks you in advance.


TL;DR: My long time friend has confessed that she loves me, but I've told her that I don't feel the same way. Now she's harassing me non-stop, and now I don't know what to do"
a3ui82,9,2018-12-06,I suffered through the worst high school drama of almost anyone I know. Now I love even the most mundane adult responsibilities.,EnsuingPiracy,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/a3ui82/i_suffered_through_the_worst_high_school_drama_of/,"Note: I would put a TL;DR, but there's too much to summarize. Feel free to pick a sample few sentences to read and you'll get the idea. High school felt like shit flying at me from every direction all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Within my family: My father was absent and living in a different country. His girlfriend (my step-mom) had terminal brain cancer. My mother had the worst case of undiagnosed anxiety I had ever seen. (To give you an idea: she had a phobia of Chinese people, because years ago she accidentally shined a laser into the eye of a little girl who happened to be Chinese, sending her on a helicopter ride to the children's hospital. She refused to visit any therapist except her religious therapist, who was a total quack). She was also fanatically religious, to the point where when my sister left the church at age 12, my mom bullied her until her eating disorders and compulsive exercising became so bad that she attempted suicide at 14. This sister, who is now in her 20s, is known locally for her acting in TV shows, and for the fact that she sleeps with married men for money. While she tells jokes about her sex life at stand-up comedy nights for the whole world to hear, my other big sister (the oldest) speaks in front of congregations, which needless to say created a lot of tension at family reunions. And my little brother developed drug habits as early as 8th grade because of the pressure to achieve at school. As for me, I was closeted, both as a bisexual and an atheist. When I was 17 my mom tried to kick me out because I corrected her pronunciation using the ""wrong tone"" (I can't imagine what she would have done if she knew I had slept with other men and didn't believe in God). My mom convinced herself, at one point or another throughout raising me, that I had autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, Asperger's syndrome, passive aggressive personality disorder, a learning disability and sociopathy... and when she brought me to psychiatrists to seek a diagnosis, she got frustrated when the psychiatrist would inevitably say ""there is no clinical possibility your son has this"". And even though she has no education with regards to mental health, she maintained that I still had all of those disorders because she ""knew me better than the psychiatrist"". 

&amp;#x200B;

At school: my mom worked at my high school, which fucked all my interactions with my teachers. The coursework I did was equivalent to 1^(st) and 2^(nd) (sometimes 3^(rd)) year uni courses, and at the end of senior year I had 15 exams over 2 weeks. The high school was a small independent school, and completely corrupt. Nobody even considered me for any scholarships because a girl in my class was the assistant head of school's daughter, and she got nominated for 3 $100 000 scholarships (one of which she wasn't even eligible for), an accelerated med school program, a summer lab internship, and the junior year biology award. When I approached the head of school about my panic attacks (I was having 1 or more a day), she pretended to be a qualified psychologist (she was nothing of the sort), and actually made the problem worse. Several teachers yelled at me in front of others, even after they knew I had mental health issues. The university counselor was so incompetent that he literally fell asleep while teaching classes. He was the head of school's husband. On top of all that, I was expected to overachieve in extracurriculars. I played in youth orchestras, spent my summers playing violin 7 hours a day at violin camp, won my way to provincial competitions 3 times, and played violin to accompany several shows (mainly musicals). At school I played in concert band and jazz band. I also was expected to excel in distance running, but not to the same extent as violin. I did hundreds of hours of volunteer work. And during summer of senior year I did an engineering/business enrichment program at a university half way across the country. All these expectations added to my anxiety and panic attacks, and I didn't really have access to a therapist because there was no school counselor, and the only place my mom would send me was to her quack religious therapist... which probably wouldn't have helped.

&amp;#x200B;

Within my friend group: my best friend tried to kill herself twice during my junior year. She was found on the side of the road with no pulse and rushed to the hospital where she was in a coma for a few days. My ex girlfriend dated the son (or nephew? we're not sure if it's his parents or aunt and uncle or both) of Mexican drug lords. We didn't find out until he went back to Mexico and we saw the Snapchats of his little brother doing coke and heroin, but until then, he seemed fairly unassuming (all he would do was send Snapchat streaks and watch a LOT of porn. Like I've never met someone who watches so much porn. I don't know why my ex was attracted to him, but to be honest, so was I. Weirdest love triangle ever.) Also, a girl in my class broke up with her boyfriend by pretending to be a lesbian, whereupon she stole my ex's boyfriend at the time (new one, not the Mexican one) after getting wasted at the grad party. And then that dude she totally cu\*ked by pretending to be lesbian started dating this really... shall we say... domineering girl, who openly told everyone that she was only with him to take advantage. She was this Japanese girl who was one of the top judo competitors in the country. Everybody tells me I should have found new friends, but my graduating class had only 22 people in it, and I had no time to do that! And everyone in my class hated each other because of the competition anyway. I only talked to half of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm taking a much needed gap year, and the drama has mostly fled from my life. I've found a job, a great therapist to work on my anxiety with and I'm slowly finding the friends who are worth hanging out with. Since I live in a medium-sized town with high crime rates, I've also found some friends on Reddit. Finally, I feel like I'm free to make my own decisions, instead of depending on irresponsible adults who can't think objectively to do it for me. If I end up going a few extra thousand dollars into student loan debt because I cut a few people off, I think it'll be worth it. And even if I fuck up, at least I'm not dealing with other people's shit. I love doing things like vacuuming or paying bills and working because things are finally in my hands."
a3ujyo,0,2018-12-06,The power of nofap isn’t “superpowers” it’s enforcing good habits.,TheGreatThrowAway27,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/a3ujyo/the_power_of_nofap_isnt_superpowers_its_enforcing/,"Hi all, five months ago I hit an all time low due to bad choices and bad luck. I keep everything to myself, and a few close trusted friends and only felt truly myself during mediation (shout out to headspace, seriously this app saved my life). I try to do nofap during that time in hope that the “superpowers” would help me out however I struggled, I ended relapsing 4 times a week. Still a big improvement from 1-2 times a day but still wasn’t ideal.

During No Nut November. I made it a mission to get though it, no matter what. The memes honestly help me the most, just scrolling through reddit and see the “superpowers benefits” that people were experiencing was really enjoyable and good reminder. If all you had to do was not jack off for a month to be able to  read minds and fly wouldn’t that be a good motivator? After a week the urges were bad but I was so tired from my new part-time job that I was able to fall asleep without masturbations. If the urges were really bad, I would just hump my bed. I’m not really proud of this but it did the job, I never nutted just exhausted myself and I guess helped me practice my stokes lol After week 3, I decide to make my bed after I got up. I don’t know what the hell possess me to this. For context, I’m 22 years old who lives with his parents, I would NEVER made my bed, even if my parents made me. They would literally  come into my room and encourage/ force me to make my bed when I was younger. I think they just gave up on me after a while, I never saw the point. But I was suddenly doing it, just wake up, make bed, brush teeth, as if I was doing it all my life. 

During my part-time job, I usually spent my time just listening to my favorite  podcast or music while I’m working. I got my library login from my city library and download an app called “Libby” to listen to audiobooks thanks to a /r/Frugal post. I thought this would be a good way to keep myself entertain after I finished listening to the latest episode of my favorite podcast, instead of killing my battery listening to the same old songs on Spotify. Oh boi I underestimate the power of books, listening to audiobooks has open up so much doors and knowledge. The 1st book I listen to was Malcolm Gladwell’s David and Goliath. It was so inspiring to listen to story of people who were complete underdog becomes successful, met their goals or come to terms with their personal Goliath. This was especially impactful for me, as I was still dealing with the aftermath of mine. I continue to listen to new books every week.  During the last week of No Nut November, I got a phone call from a company that I really wanted to intern for, they want to interview me over Skype interview the very next day. I didn’t expect them call me so early, I thought I would heard back in January but they called me in Novemeber! I prepare for the interview all night and called out of work sick the next morning. During the interview I was nervous as shit. I was being interviewed by three high profile individuals from the company and only found out about it 24 hours prior, the questions weren’t horrible but more thought-provoking. Finally one them ask me and I quote “The hardest question of this interview; What do you do in your free time?” I replied without hesitation, “Reading.” This shocked them, I guess they didn’t think Millennials still read books. Technically I don’t read books I just listen to it but I was still able to talk about another book I recently finish reading called Blink by Malcolm Gladwell and was able to give my thoughts and takeaways from it. Two days ago I accept the offer for an Summer internship from that company.  Though No Nut November has ended and I still haven’t masturbation, I have no need to. It may be possible this would have still happen without nofap, but I wouldn’t know. I do know that this path I’m going on and it’s much better than the path I was on five months ago. It dawn on me today that superpower of nofap isn’t flying or some Gandolf shit but it’s the power of enforcing good habit, starting with nofap. My newest habit is doing push up every morning, I don’t have enough money for a gym membership so hopefully this will help me get in shape using the app “Just 6 Weeks” to guide me. 

tl;dr Nofap help me get my shit together by enforcing good habits and may be the reason I landed my dream internship. "

I am  a student, recently getting his first internship. To make a long story short - I have to learn how to use powershell to do certain things. I would just like to ask if anyone could point me towards materials I should use to allow me to do this.

Also - If anyone knew anything specifically about how I would go about writing a PowerShell  script that would return users with admin privileges on any computer.

Thanks for the help!"

To other schools I’ve been applying as an actuarial science major, but I wanted to give computer science a chance because I love the logical puzzle solving and creating (in my limited experience) and software engineering seems interesting. 

I just wanted to hear some of the students from the comp sci majors perspective on things like class sizes at SMU, how the profs are, how well the program prepares you for a job (specifically in software engineering), how are the internships, and any advice you can offer me. 

Also if any business majors see this, I know that SMU is amazing for Business, and that’s my other thought, can y’all answer the questions I listed up there from your majors perspective? 

Any response would be appreciated! Thanks mustangs! "

I just got an internship at a company in SoMA and I’m looking for a place to live. The few questions I have are:

1. When to start looking - some people told me to start looking at Zillow and others have said to start looking only a few weeks before I’m ready to move in. If anyone can clarify for me that would be awesome. 

2. Where to look - I’ve looked a little bit on Zillow and apartments.com but couldn’t find much that is affordable. Another website I found is [sf housing services](https://www.sfhousingservices.com/home) but I’m not sure how legit it is.

Any help is greatly appreciated

Note: I am from Canada so it will be hard/impossible for me to see places before moving in

Edit: apparently housing is more than I thought so can someone tell me what to expect in terms of pricing? Of course my own place is preferred but I am ok with my own room in a 2+ person house/apartment "

a3vbwe,7,2018-12-06,Words of Encouragement... :) Here’s to all you LDR’s Don’t Give Up! 4k Miles Apart 3+ Years,ThreeEyedGoat,LDR,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/a3vbwe/words_of_encouragement_heres_to_all_you_ldrs_dont/,"Hi LDR Reddit, so for our LDR it’s been a turn for the better… So it’s been a little over 4 months now since it happened, but we’re engaged! I know it has been a while and doesn’t seem like much, we still have to “tie the knot,” but it’s still significant for me. We’re so close, it’s within reach. 

My fiancé(m/26) and I(f/26) have known each other for 10 years, that’s right, **10 bloody years!** He was an exchange student (Slovak) in the US, we met during our junior year in high school. I’m a Minnesotan. We will officially close the gap after we get married in May next year, and I’ll move to London after I get my EU Family Visa sometime in August/September 2019. Then I will (hopefully) get a job and we can afford a nice flat together.


First, this relationship has not been without its doubts. Not that I have doubted him, it’s the circumstance of events (life) etc. Parents, friends, and others have told me I was wasting my time with my (now) fiancé, they discouraged me from continuing a relationship with him and said it was pointless. How long I was surrounded, in a horrid environment with people around me trying to dissuade me constantly––it was/is an unhealthy atmosphere and living situation. Even once engaged, at first, my mother couldn’t accept it. Skepticism was just always hanging around me in every conversation with my parents even after the engagement.
Aside from that, there are other factors in life that are at play, countries/borders, visas… where to live, how to stay together, how to make it work, where to go. We contemplated many ideas. What about Canada? Easy for him, not so much for me for visas. What about Australia? Easy for me but not for him for visas. What about the UK? Well, he’s already working there, but I have little chance with visas. 


My words of encouragement would be to never give up. Days, weeks, months go by, and you think you won’t make it if something happens. Holding on is hard to do, but trust is essential. If you and your SO are determined and bound together to make it work, it will happen. Others have said you have to have an “action plan.” In a way this is true. I know we never really officially created one, but we had little steps along the way to help us. I did study abroad to help temporarily close the gap for a semester, that helped us really understand what a ‘normal’ relationship was like for a good 4 months or so. Then, it was back to seeing each other during holidays/vacations and one work trip or so. The following summer I did an internship and temp closed the gap again for another 3 months… during which he proposed!


Secondly, all you love birds out there… if you go through tough times with your SO, it can/will happen. Arguments or perhaps, even a break-up. There was a time during our 3 years he broke up with me YES, it happened. He wanted me to have a better life... he thought I would have more opportunities in the US and that a life abroad might not give me what I need in life (career/hobby). During our last planned holiday trip together I reassured him that he was what I wanted in life and that I would find a good career/hobbies that would satisfy my interests abroad, and didn’t take no for an answer… I told him he was the best thing that ever happened to me in my life, and the rest is history! He promised he’d never do such a thing again and said if it weren’t for me, we wouldn’t be together. :) 


**TLDR;** Finally, just a little hoorah to all you LDR’s out there, I have faith in all of you struggling out there, you can do it and officially close the gap! I know me and my fiancé will close the gap soon enough… come August/September 2019 once I get an EU Family visa!"

a3vmzl,8,2018-12-06,A Long Post About Bowser's Inside Story,tuxman05,marioandluigi,https://www.reddit.com/r/marioandluigi/comments/a3vmzl/a_long_post_about_bowsers_inside_story/,"(Note: I will list things in this game that have been in previous games. I know. I've played them all. At least twice.)

I love Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. This post will be talking about why I love it so much, and why it is my most favorite RPG ever. 

It was one of my ***first*** (and favorite) DS games, and my ***first*** ever RPG, which helps.

The premise, or ***plot*** of this game is pretty awesome. Making the storyline a bit darker than usual, and making the overall cause of the conflict an **epidemic** had never been done before (as far as I know), making the game that much more special. Having a MEETING in the Princess' castle about it is as real-world-problem-y as Mario has ever gotten (again, as far as I know)! Here's the other thing. Making two enemies work together to face the bigger, badder enemy is genius on Nintendo's part. Bowser would *never* work with Mario, or at least, not on purpose. I love the idea. Fawful tricks the Koopa, he sucks up the brothers, and he has no idea that they're in there until the very end of the story! Awesome.

The ***characters*** are given completely new personalities or are just great in general. Mario &amp; Luigi are given new voice lines. Princess Peach is given more of a voice, and dialogue. Starlow is introduced, and is the best in that game, even with the Luigi bullying. Toadsworth has more dialogue, Dr. Toadley, his intern, Toadbert, etc. are unique, make sense in their own situations, and separate them from the mass of average toads. Broque Monsieur and Broggy are brought in, which are fun characters. Fawful is a GREAT bad guy, but I'll get to that later. Midbus too. The enemies are different from previous games, so that's cool. But the one character that was EXTREMELY characterized was the Koopa King, **Bowser!** Every single time, in every Mario game, he was the bad guy, with little to no backstory, and was always defeated. All of those things still apply, but now you **play as him.** You play more as Bowser than the Bros. I've heard. He's more of an anti-hero, and this game is the sole reason why Bowser is my favorite character in the Mario franchise. I still like kicking his a\*\*, but I love him. 

Anyway, another reason I like this game is the ***combat***. It feels nice. Letting the bros. double jump on an enemy (jumping twice with the babies in the previous game does not count) is a nice mechanic, and rewards you for good timing. Throughout the game, you never get tired of crushing enemies' skulls with your polished boots. Hammers are a good addition, still, and the counterattacking is *an amazing idea.* The bros.' hammers break if you hold onto them too long, which makes total sense, but was gotten rid of in the next games. The use of two screens is well-executed in this game too. Boss battles are fantastic as well, and are all different from each other without being too spongy. Now, Bowser's fights are just as good, if not better than battling with the bros. Punching enemies fits the character, and feels super satisfying when you pull it off correctly. If you miss, it's still funny to watch him stumble. And the flame! Oh, the flame. I love burning enemies. Critical hits are plentiful with this move. Again, timing is absolute key here. The special attacks for both are cool. The bros. have good special attacks, and progressively become more powerful as the game goes on. The second to last special attack you can get can be devastating to bosses if executed well. I never liked the Bowser special attacks themselves too much, but I appreciated everything else about them. Finding minions imprisoned in cages and freeing them offers dialogue, and new moves. Putting them to work and using them in battles is a great idea! Making use of the touch screen adds variety to the game, and requires even more skill to deal a lot of damage. And Bowser just feels powerful through and through. It's just like the Koopa King to fight with his minions.

The ***music*** in this game is unbelievably good!! They had better do some of it justice in the remake. Composing two versions of the same song is mind-blowing. One outside the body in the regular area, and one inside the body, as a direct upgrade (imo) to most of the pieces. Such an innovative idea, and set a precedent for Dream Team only. So. Good.

The ***areas*** in this game are quality as well. Every place is unique, and has regional enemies. Traversing the areas, although sort of linear, are neat. Bowser smashing and burning his way through, while Mario &amp; Luigi explore Bowser's insides. Nice.

The ***Fawful***. Fawful is magnificent. Major spoilers ahead! (and that's an understatement!)&gt;!First he was just a lackey for Cackletta, in Superstar Saga. He was defeated by the bros. In the second game, he was in the sewers, selling badges for beans to the baby bros, who would be his downfall in the third game. He came to full power, and carried out his master plan of power. First, he would sell mushrooms to Toads, and make them extra thicc, and immobile, to prevent them from ""protecting"" Princess Peach. Then, he would sell the vacuum shroom to Bowser, and make him inhale Mario &amp; Luigi. With Mario &amp; Luigi gone, there would be almost nobody to defend the princess. Knowing Bowser could be a threat, Fawful sends him to a dark cave. In the meantime, Fawful brainwashes all of Bowser's minions, and takes over his castle, renaming it to Fawful Castle. Knowing that Bowser would go back to his castle at some point, he sets up a show, where Bowser is the star. Midbus, Fawful's lackey, gets beat up by Bowser and Bowser is the victor. All part of the plan. He shows Bowser to the feast room, where brainwashed boos feed him fatty foods, and make Bowser extra thicc. Then, he extracts Princess Peach from inside Bowser's body. He puts Bowser on a treadmill, which burns his fat, but makes him fiery! Again, all part of the plan. He gets blown to the underground, and is no longer a threat. They go to Peach's Castle, to unearth the Dark Star. Using Peach's voice, he uses the Dark Star, to set up defenses, just in case Mario &amp; Luigi make it out of Bowser's body. Sucking up all of the Dark Star's power takes FOREVER, so this is necessary. Somehow, Bowser makes it to Peach's Castle, where Fawful vacuums up all of the Dark power from the Star. It makes its way into Bowser, to eat DNA, and become Bowser's equal. All part of the plan. Or not. Fawful was defeated shortly after. Everything up to this point had been to steal the Dark Star, and everything had a plan B. Masterfully crafted by Fawful. He would've succeeded, had it not been for those meddling plumbers. Fawful's story was one of starting from nothing, then slowly, bit by bit, rising to power, forming a master plan. In the end, Fawful was game ended, but his efforts were extreme. He was so close, but failed. Despite this, he had made it that far, and was a better villain than Bowser. That's why I like Fawful. Y'know, somebody made an entire Youtube channel to pay homage to him. One of his minions.... wow. What a guy.!&lt; If anyone says that Fawful is a bad villain, that the game had too much of him, or that this game has no story, they are actually physically wrong. I've made an entire spoiler-filled paragraph. There ya go.

These are all the reasons why I love this game so much, and why it is my most favorite RPG ever. Of all time. It's... special! How many RPGs do you know have counterattacking? No random encounter battles? A cool menu system? Turn-based stuff, where your input really matters? And don't list a Mario RPG, because there are plenty like that. If you know of an RPG that meets the standards above, please tell me. I'm really curious. Also, if you don't like BiS, tell me why. I'll try to be open-minded about it. I know the game isn't perfect, so go ahead! Discuss! Be hyped for January 11! Thank you for reading to the very end! The post took a couple hours, on and off! :D"

Unfortunately, after I graduated college, I found out they want job experience. Which seems paradoxical since how am I going to get experience if I can't get an entry level job. The fact of the matter was that many programmers are self-taught, and the ones that do go to college get a job through an internship. I would have been much better off not going to college, and going to trade school or going through an apprenticeship instead. Now I am stuck with low wage work, a ton a debt, and 4 years of my life wasted."
a3w53h,2,2018-12-06,[22F4M] Quiet Jewish Girls Always Have The Best Tits,Loungette,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a3w53h/22f4m_quiet_jewish_girls_always_have_the_best_tits/,"Now some of you may be wondering: just where the hell did that stereotype come from? Isn't that sorta weird and out of left field? Since when were Jewish girls stereotyped for anything other than big noses and obsessive grandmothers?

Well when you have a sample size of precisely one subject, outcomes are much easier to reach.

For this particular hypothesis, the subject in question was Kate Kleinberg, the nose of whom was actually quite diminutive and wonderfully complicated the remainder of her adorably girlish, mousy face that ensured she'd get carded for alcohol until she was at least forty. Her hair set a similar tone, falling across her shoulders and forehead in bouncy brown strands that would tickle at the tips of her eyelashes just above that set of bright blue eyes whenever she tilted her head down.

She did that a lot, by the way - tipping her head down. If there was one thing Kate had become intimately familiar with over the years then it would certainly be the view of her shoes. More famed for their loud and boisterous New Yorkian relatives on the 'State side of things, Kate herself was more of the silent sort - oh, sure, she was friendly enough once you got to know her, but that in itself was the hardest part. Coincidentally, considering the adjective used to describe her face shape, she was well-known amongst her peers back in high school for squeaking whenever she got embarrassed, which was pretty often. Less often now, in her early 20's, but it was still easy enough to spook her if you tried.

Adorable.

Yes, ""cute"" would probably be the first adjective that would enter the brains of most people she met with the shuffling and the squeaking and the overall aesthetic of such a meek young girl, but it would be lying to say that a number of other choice descriptors hadn't been tossed her way following her post-pubescent years.

For all her shyness, Kate was the farthest thing from an idiot one might imagine - naive and hilariously impressionable, sure, but not an idiot. Aside from the whole ""squeaking"" thing, her most famed moment in high school might've been her uncharacteristically emphatic reaction to receiving a B+ on her Chemistry midterm and, for as much difficulty as she had with looking other people in the face, strangely she seemed to infect many she spoke to with that exact same problem. Every shirt has cleavage when you've got a chest her size, and all those tight-fitting turtlenecks ever did was just showcase it even better! She distinctly remembered going red in the face for the better portion of an hour upon hearing one of her classmates use the phrase ""painted on"" in reference to such a sweater hugging at her bosoms, and had taken to only visiting the gym later at night after realizing just how much attention she was drawing whenever she used the treadmill.

---

So, what plans do I have tonight for the Jewish girl with the big ol' tiddies and atrocious social skills? Well, I'm sure you can at least get a *close* guess, considering the subreddit, but this prompt is ultimately pretty open-ended!

Obviously I'm looking for something factoring in her shy nature, but past that I'm fully open to ideas! I'll list out a couple of possible scenarios below, but keep in mind that they're hardly restrictive!

- Kate's been dragged along for some sort of road trip for either a class, work, or some other reason we come up with and ends up bonding with her trip-mate. Road-head is the ultimate form of bonding.
- Kate ends up getting dragged to her worst nightmare - a party - by one of her more extroverted friends. Since she's not much of a party animal she ends up awake after it starts puttering out and is surprised to have unintentionally drawn some attention. Maybe she gets pushed into joining a couple others in the hot tub, maybe she gets pulled into a game that turns out to have stripping involved, maybe she just gets chatted up by a cute guy that's hanging around.
- Kate's older co-workers at her internship takes an interest in her.
- Being shy and geeky, Kate is inevitably drawn to gaming groups, whether computer-based or classical pen and paper. Of course, a bunch of similarly introverted nerdy guys might not know how to behave themselves around such a good-looking girl.
-Kate is brought to an amateur photoshoot where she is continually talked out of more and more clothes.
- The classic study buddies sort of setup.

And so on! You get the idea, I hope. A lot of the above scenarios are written to be very purposefully flexible on how many male characters are involved and I would *love* if any of my potential partners would be willing to play multiple male characters, but that's completely an optional thing! I'll similarly offer to add in another girl just to slightly even things out, but no more than that and only if there are at least two guys! What can I say? I'm picky and a shy girl getting spitroasted is, like, *super* hot.

Some other kinks and general stuff that I'd like included:

 - Cumplay, the only thing that's pretty much a requirement. Spunk on me. Cum quick, cum a lot, cum on my clothes, cum in my food, just get a lot of splooge in a lot of places, y'know?
- Semi-public, which is basically just as close to public as you can get without getting arrested. Sure, she's shy, but I also mentioned she's *super* impressionable, right?
- Casual stuff. Grabbing her butt or stuffing your dick in her face un-announced, having her blow you while she studies for an upcoming exam, that sort of thing. Could happen before or after the proverbial ice is broken depending on how ""coercive"" you want these scenes to be.
- Casual group, which is basically just, you know, casual stuff but in a group setting! This can apply to people playing multiple characters or only one. For multiple characters obviously double+ teaming, blowbangs, and stuff like that would be loved along with Kate getting passed around a small group of friends or coworkers. In a scenario where you're only playing one, though, they can look but they don't have to touch. Maybe you like showing off to your buddies by having your new girlfriend blow you on the couch while you're all hanging out and chatting.
- Chubby guys! I love chubby guys. And any other sort of generally conventionally unattractive sort of dudes - something about the contrast makes me go crazy.

Again, none of those are required, just some stuff I like including! I don't do impreg, hard gore, bathroom stuff, or bestiality, but *most* other things are on the table, so be sure to ask if you want a kink included! Want to cum on the shy Jewish girl's feet? Then gosh golly, cum all over 'em!

Send me a message if you're interested! I only write in third person, but if you're only playing a single character and want to write in first person, we can work something out."

From the beginning we clicked and connected instantly, I'm normally not humorous but with her I felt comfortable enough to be naturally funny and she always laughs at my jokes. 

She's one of the few persons who finds me extremely funny and hilarious and has said so. She can't stop laughing when I'm humorous.
There are also other indicators of interest like **frequently touching my arm or hands while talking**, finding frequent excuses to get a handshake from me,  frequent glances towards me, holding strong eye contact, initiating conversations with me. 

She has also gone deep into conversation and shared a lot about her, to the point where it feels like we've known each other for almost 6 months and not 1 month! She also asked me (within the first week of meeting each other) to add her on my Instagram and she likes anything I share, we also share frequent messages on Instagram.

However she also talks about which other guys she finds good looking in front of me. Her type of guy does not look like me at all ! Is that a sign she's not attracted to me ? 

Initially I was not a attracted to her (she's not exactly my physical type either), but given that I'm looking to date and kinda craving a relationship, and she seems to atleast like me as a person, so should I ask her if she would like to go on a date with me ? She'll be leaving the Company next week and be moving to another city a 2 hour drive away, so I must make my move fast !

Also I feel that if she's really into me she would be more explicit and ask me to hang out casually atleast if not a date ! Or is it normal for women who really like a guy to still wait for the guy to ask her out formally ?"

I was in two minds - cause the later had me to move states for a few months and we looking out for a new location etc. He however was keen in me taking the corp opportunity as it would help with my career over the long run.

On Wednesday over our lunch meet when he enquired about what my stand was on the internship and noticing that I was quite undecided, he surprised me by mentioning that he is picking up a house for me on rent, so that I could go over to Atlanta and start my role begining next year.

Today he called me and asked me to be ready to check out a few homes he has identified in Buckhead and Smyrna area. What are your thoughts?

Do you feel it would be ok if I bite this offer of his OR is he looking out for something else out of this? Thoughts definitely welcome

a3wqmu,5,2018-12-07,I[25F] have been chasing after a pipedream for the past 15 years. Now that i've let it go i'm left with nothing.,medschooldrea,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a3wqmu/i25f_have_been_chasing_after_a_pipedream_for_the/," 

To preface the country I live in while having an undergrad option of doing medicine I was not in the right place healthwise so I opted to go the post grad route which is also offered at specific unis.

I did something i'm interested in- maths and software engineering for my undergrad degree. I enjoyed both very much, so I brown nosed my way into a research position, completed hackathons, olympiads and internships at big 4 companies you name it. And any time I wasn't studying for my degree I was studying for the entrance exam for medicine. I am not joking- there were times where i'd sleep in my car and take a shower in the morning because I studied too late in the library and wanted to make it to my early morning labs.

So I don't have much of a support system outside of my family. My parents were apprehensive when I told them I wasn't going to accept any of the offers I got lined up before graduation and was going to study full time for med. They quickly became supportive since this has been the ONLY thing i wanted to do since I was 8. I took a relaxed part time job just so i can help around the house ( they still insisted I just study and refused to accept the money)  
I've been through the application rounds for the past 3 years and I've recieved rejection letters after rejection letter because the competition is pretty stiff- I have a 4.0 GPA and scored 85% percentile for our countries version of the MCAT/entrance exam. I guess my interviews also let me down- i'm a pretty ineloquent and awkward person and no amount of interview coaching can get me out I guess.   
I'm a 24 year old who's still living in her parents house. I have no friends beause all I did was study in university and any friends I still \*do\* have from earlier are just so concerned for me. I threw away all my job prospects that came from my degree which is known for being very competitive for the first few years and i don't think i can come back from that- especially not the companies who offered me positions. I don't even think mid-tier companies want to hire someone who has a 2 year gap between graduation and only some open source projects and a bunch of rejection letters to show for it. I've sunk thousands of dollars into paying for the entrance exams alone and flying to different parts of the country for interviews and while i'm so fortunate for the money to not hurt my overall financial position I just think about all the things I could have spent it on. Taking my parents out to dinner for helping me for so long. Not being a massive twat and thinking I was ever good enough to get into medicine.  
The money is \*nothing\* compared to the time that i'll never get back. I never went to any of the social events unless they were networking. I even missed my own sisters birthday because I needed to be doing the entrance exam for the fourth time to edge my score up just a little bit more. I'm 24 years old soon to be 25. I'm such a failure.  
The worst part is the people I hurt. I dragged my parents into this whole mess by asking them if I could stay with them for the past few years while I wasted my life away on this idea that never would be fulfilled. The last few rounds I couldn't even check my emails anymore because I became borderline obssessive and was refreshing for hours on end so my mom took over and would shoo me out of the house and promise to call me if there was any news. They aren't even sad that I didn't get in at this point like they were the first round of rejections- at this point they're just sad that i'm so sad. My siblings have moved out, put downpayments for houses, gettting engaged and I'm still with my parents- unable to get out of bed some days. On facebook, I have friends from hs and uni who have already made it into medicine or are moving up with their software engineer pathway. My best friend who has proofread HUNDREDS of my essays, helping me interview for the PAST FEW YEARS has been blowing up my phone but I can't bring myself to tell her that I failed yet again. I also got her into my mess.  
I don't know if I should apply for one more round. Perhaps sit the entrance exam one more time and push it up to the 90% but I'm not sure how much further I can push it or do some more interview coaching. Its literally like gambling- I know I'm not going to win but there's just that small chance I might. I know the reasonable choice is to sit back and begin to pick up the pieces of whats left of my life. How do i move on from giving up on something i've wanted so bad for so long?  
tl;dr: I am a 25 year old who has failed at something that i devoted the past few years for. How do i move past this.

Or is something really off?",birdkoto,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a3x0pc/am_i_really_an_ungrateful_spoiled_child_or_is/,"I wasn't sure whether I was going to really write and post this, it felt (and still feels) like my parents aren't bad enough to be narcissistic parents and it's all in my head, and I'm overexaggerating. But I figured it would be a good way to get what I'm feeling off my chest, hear other opinons and maybe get some advice on how to deal with my situation? I'm so sorry this is so long.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents never sexually abused me or anything, I only got hit a few times as a child and teenager, and they have always provided for me financially. If anything that's the one thing I can say never lacked in my life, if I wanted a toy or electronic device I most likely got it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have financial support, don't get me wrong. But I grew up feeling like I was walking on eggshells, I could never be honest with my parents about how I was feeling or what I was going through or open up to them because they would mock me, use that information against me later on, say other people have it worse, or a mix of all three. Even worse if I tried to talk about something that perhaps they did, it always quickly escalates into them yelling at me, getting angry, saying I'm ungrateful and useless. It's never their fault.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that really took a toll on me growing up because I was struggling with my sexuality, and while I've come to accept myself I'm still in the closet, knowing full well it wouldn't go well if I came out while still living under their roof because they make homophobic remarks on a daily basis. Throughout the years I have found a support network in my friends and boyfriend, but my parents have always said friends will leave you the first chance they get and the only people you can trust are your family members.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents both went to the same local college and did the same major, and they practically forced me to follow their footsteps. They say they never forced me to get into that major, but when I got fed up and asked to transfer to a different one they got aggressive and my dad threatened to pull the plug on supporting me financially. He said, word by word, I should finish this major first and then pay for whatever course I want with my own money (keep in mind I live in a country where college isn't as ridiculously expensive as it is in the US and they have free colleges as well).

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm stuck doing a major I never liked in the first place, and god I wish that's where things ended. He makes me work and help him out at his clinic, in fact I've been doing that for years, and while at first I was fine with helping out because hey, acquiring experience, and he initially said I would start making money sooner than any of my classmates, he now says what I do isn't enough to warrant me getting paid, and when I started looking into getting a real internship at another clinic, or even a part time job to get more independent he once again started threatening me. So I either work for him for free and do a major I don't like, or I risk losing all his support and god knows what else he might do. But because I'm not getting paid or have a paid internship or job I'm forced to hear my dad brag about how back in his day when he was in his second year he was already working, how my mom paid for all her books and materials herself, how they never got financial help from their parents to go through college, and both my mom and dad love talking about how easy my major is (after all, they went through that as well), which feels very unmotivating because I've always struggled with my grades and got held back a semester as a result a couple years ago, and to this day they still rub that in my face. It's not like I wanted to get held back. Hell, I want to finish college and move out as quickly as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

It really does feel like no matter what I do it won't be good enough, so why try in the first place? I feel like that with regards to my own appearance, I /am/ fat, I'm not denying that, I've been overweight my whole life and my family, with the exception of my mom who keeps a very restrictive diet, are all heavy themselves. Literally all my dad ever talks about is how I'll be pretty if I lose weight, that I should lose weight, that I'm getting fatter, and it's funny because although my self esteem is as low as the grand canyon, the more he says that I should lose weight to look pretty the less I feel like losing weight. Funny how that works. One time he brought some ice cream so we could have it for dessert after dinner, gave my brother and I a cup of ice cream each, then when I was in the middle of eating it he came back to the kitchen with a scale and literally forced me to get on the scale. After seeing my weight he was like 'Oh, you weigh that much and you're still eating ice cream?' of course I couldn't finish it after that and just went to my room, and of course my mom got mad at me for not finishing it. Look, the thing is I do have an issue with binge eating and I tend to use food to cope a lot but I never do it around my parents, and it's not like they would help me if they knew about that because when I was doing really badly mentally, having breakdowns and suicidal thoughts and opened up to my dad about how I wanted to go to a therapist he told me he doesn't believe in that sort of thing, and that my life is too good for me to have any issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I always sort of assumed my mom was better than my dad in that aspect but one time we invited some relatives over for a barbecue on the rooftop area and it was chilly so I put on a sweater and she yelled at me saying she knows I hate my arms (I do, but that caught me off guard considering I never talked to her about it) but that I should lose weight instead of hiding them, and then it turned out she was the only person at that party wearing short sleeves. 

&amp;#x200B;

The icing on the cake I guess is the fact that despite being in my early 20s I still get treated like a literal child. Seriously, my 15 year old brother gets treated more like a human being than me. I'm not allowed to go anywhere by myself aside from college, I have to ask days in advance and multiple times to be allowed to hang out with friends, and when my parents travel somewhere I'm always forced to go along even if I don't want to go because apparently I can't look after myself or be by myself even if it's just a couple of days or weeks. And if I don't do something as soon as they tell me to do it they take away my laptop, phone, and any other electronic devices I have, or they turn off the wifi but that's really not so bad. Hell, at some point my dad was doing that every day for literally no reason, he just took them away at night and made me sleep on the floor (on a mattress but still) in his room. That's never happened to my brother, not even once. They act like I can't do anything, either, if I try to do something and I maybe have some difficulty or don't succeed at first they get frustrated and start wanting to do it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to block a lot of memories out so these are mostly things that happened this year or last year, I feel like I'm heavily dependent on them and I desperately want that to change and to move out, but maybe I really am just ungrateful and should be happy with my current living situation and parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you managed to read this far I want to thank you for your patience, and I would really love to hear your thoughts

The interview went very good, but I don’t know what I could say to get more time to do the other interviews. 

How can I politly say that I have a few interviews left without saying it as if they are not good enough, so that they maybe don’t want me any more?

A few times. His girlfriend found out every time. She was always mad, but never broke up with him. The last time it happened, he said and did some things that made me really angry. That was the final straw. I finally realised that this person was an asshole. A selfish coward who only did what he wanted and never truly cared about me (or his girlfriend, for that matter). I had always felt like I was only some sort of Plan B to him, and I finally realised that I'd been right about that. I finally decided that I'd had enough. This person would never give me a functioning friendship or a relationship, let alone love. I completely cut ties, I blocked him on every social media platform I could think of. Even though it was hard in the beginning because I still missed him, I haven't looked back.  


That was one and a half years ago. Since then, my life has only gotten better. I finished my BA and started an MA, and I got an internship in my field with decent pay. I have a boyfriend that I'm head over heels in love with and who treats me as if I were the most precious thing in his world. We've been dating for over a year and we're moving in together next year.

So titelt sie zum Thema Rente *„MILLIARDEN-ÜBERSCHUSS – Es klingelt in der Rentenkasse“*. Und weiter schreibt man Zitat *„für 2018 zeichnet sich ein Überschuss von vier Milliarden Euro ab!“*. Natürlich erwähnt man in seinem Artikel auch die steigenden Einnahmen, und erwähnt auch steigende Kosten durch das neue Rentenpaket usw. Denn all das steht aktuell genau so in der offiziellen [Presseveröffentlichung ](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/Allgemein/de/Inhalt/4_Presse/infos_der_pressestelle/02_medieninformationen/01_pressemitteilungen/2018/2018_12_06_bvv_buntenbach.html)der Deutschen Rentenversicherung. Also kann man der BILD keinen Vorwurf machen?

#### Alles bestens in der Rentenkasse?

So schreibt die staatliche Rentenkasse gleich zum Beginn ihrer aktuellen Mitteilung, Zitat:

*„Aller Voraussicht nach werden die Einnahmen der Rentenversicherung in diesem Jahr die Ausgaben deutlich übertreffen. Wir erwarten für das Jahr 2018 einen Überschuss in Höhe von rund vier Milliarden Euro“. Insgesamt werde für das laufende Jahr mit Einnahmen in Höhe von 306,3 Milliarden Euro und Ausgaben in Höhe von 302,3 Milliarden Euro gerechnet.*

Da bleiben doch keine Fragen mehr offen, oder? Denn die Beitragseinnahmen steigen um 4,6%, so schreibt man es weiter. In weiteren Absätzen geht die Rentenversicherung auf Mehrkosten des neuen Rentenpakts und die Haltelinie des Beitragssatzes ein. Alles technische Details. Entscheidend ist aber: Der unbedarfte Bürger, der die Presseveröffentlichungen oder Artikel in Zeitungen liest, denkt sich dabei: Hey, super. Die Einnahmen steigen um 4,6%, und durch Beitragseinnahmen hat die Rentenkasse 306,3 Milliarden Euro Einnahmen, bei Ausgaben von 302,3 Milliarden Euro. Dann ist doch alles bestens, das Rentensystem ist gesund und solide aufgestellt. Richtig? Falsch!

Wir haben schon [mehrmals](https://finanzmarktwelt.de/rentenluege-reloaded-linke-tasche-rechte-tasche-volumen-um-32-milliarden-euro-erhoeht-107441/) in den letzten Jahren und Monaten auf diese große Rentenlüge hingewiesen. Aber kaum wurde sie deutlicher offenbart wie in dieser Veröffentlichung. Denn die Rentenkasse nimmt dieses Jahr keine 306,3 Milliarden Euro durch Beiträge ein. Alleine 2017 hat der deutsche Steuerhaushalt 67,8 Milliarden Euro an die Rentenkasse überwiesen, als Subvention, damit die Rentenkasse nicht sofort pleite ist. So geht das jedes Jahr, und jedes Jahr wird diese Subvention höher um das stetig größer werdende Loch (viel zu wenig Einnahmen um die Ausgaben bezahlen zu können) zu stopfen.

#### Gigantische Subvention

Wenn die Steuerlast langfristig immer höher wird, dann haben wir längst ständig steigende Rentenbeiträge – die werden dann lediglich als Steuern getarnt, und das Geld wird intern beim Staat umgebucht. Laut Rentenversicherung soll der Transfer aus dem Steuerhaushalt in die Rentenkasse im Jahr 2022 bei über 80 Milliarden Euro pro Jahr liegen – das ist ein netter Anstieg nach 67,8 Milliarden Euro in 2017. Also wird die Rentenkasse dieses Jahr wohl ca 70 Milliarden Euro Zuschuss erhalten? Also nichts da mit „Voller Rentenkasse“ oder 306,3 Milliarden Euro Einnahmen! Wenn man 70 Milliarden Euro Transfer aus dem Steuerhaushalt auch als „Einnahme“ verbucht und sie mit dazu packt in die gesamte Einnahmensumme von 306,3 Milliarden Euro, dann ist das einfach nur eine große Täuschung der Öffentlichkeit. Nach dem Motto „schaut her, wir haben das Rentensystem doch im Griff, läuft“.

Nobody from the world above has been here for thousands of years. It's not really a dungeon anymore, it's something nobody really expected to find down here, many, many levels below the ground. An ancient machine full of flickering lights and ominous noises. Its slowly shifting cogs and moving panels make it seem breathing, alive... What is powering it? What attracted all those creatures to this place? Does it matter? Its wheels and cogs are made of precious metals. Its dimly pulsing lights are tinted with valuable gems. You're not here to admire it. You're here to take it apart. Well, time to get going.

The theme of this dungeon level is **reasons to play**. Tell the world about a game that embodies the worst qualities of its genre - a multiplayer game with a toxic community, a simulator that's just like a boring job, a repetitively and pointlessly difficult rogue-lite, a bland and predictable story-driven action-adventure, and so on. Then tell the world why it's actually good.

You can request any number of games. First come - first served, aggregated by day. Starting the next day after the offer is posted, if you're the only person who requested a particular game, you get it and aren't eligible for any other games that day. If multiple eligible people request a game the winner is selected randomly. People who put some effort in their comment will have more weight in the selection. This repeats until all games are distributed. For Humble Bundle games, I will be sending gift links after receiving a response to my congratulatory DM. A few offers have multiple copies. Locked games will only be sent out after a significant delay, which is shortened when unlocked games get claimed."
a3zmh5,22,2018-12-07,Even JK interns get employee benefits (FANFIC),_thatguyfrombefore_,jkfilms_nsfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/jkfilms_nsfw/comments/a3zmh5/even_jk_interns_get_employee_benefits_fanfic/,"Note: this story is completely fictional and fantasy-based. This fanfic in no way reflects the views or actions of anyone portrayed in the story. ALL CHARACTERS IN THE STORY ARE STRICTLY OVER 18 YEARS OLD.

EVEN INTERNS AT JK GET EMPLOYEE BENEFITS...

The JK crew had just finished their weekly crew dinner at their favourite hotpot place. Everyone was satisfied with their meals and ready to go home after a long week and get some well deserved rest. As everyone stood up to say their final goodbyes to each other and make arrangements (about who's going in who's car etc), Anthony the new intern got up and made his way to Joe and Jess because they were usually his ride. As he approached, Anthony noticed Tiff talking with Joe &amp; Jess quietly, so as to not alert the intern. As the two couples noticed Anthony approaching they look startled for a split second but immediately composed themselves. 

""Everything good guys?"", said Anthony curiously. They all responded with a nervous laugh but Joe took it upon himself to come forward and speak to the new recruit on behalf of the group.

""So Anthony, as sort of a reward for your hard work we were talking about something fun you could do later tonight"", said Joe comfortingly to a still skeptical Anthony. ""Well- ok I'll try break this down like the mudda simple times. So pretty much this Friday night after dinner me and Jess were going to go book a hotel room to have *hesitantly* Well pretty much to fuck ahah."" Noticing Anthony looking increasingly nervous, Joe hurried on, ""BUT tonight, Tiff decided she wanted to try a threesome for the first time which is where she sleeps with TWO guys instead of one. So I'm going over to their house tonight which leaves Jess alone. Well since you turned 18 last week, we even discussed this with your mum and thought it would be good if you went with Jess tonight and she taught you how to have sex. What do you think buddy?""

Anthony's mind was racing as he tried to process everything he had just heard. He gulped as he looked past his boss Joe at Tiff and Case, arms around each other smiling at him. He forced a smile back at them to hide any nervousness. Anthony then looked even further past the couple...at Jess, who was wearing a dress which made it hard for Anthony to keep his eyes away from his ass all night. (Sorry no pic, imagine that grey dress she twerked in and showed off her ass for the first time)

Jess looked back at Anthony, locked eyes, and smiled. To Anthony's surprise she ran over to him and gave him a soft hug while laughing saying ""aww ahah don't look so scared I will take care of you buddy"", as the other adults laughed along with her. Anthony wasn't a kid anymore. In his mind he was a grown man and he was going to prove it tonight. He feigned a look of confidence and said ""sure, can you pick me up tomorrow Tiff? Since you are friends with my mom"". Tiff looked impressed at how manly the intern was acting ""Yeh sure buddy Casey and I will come pick you up, you sound like you can't wait to go!"".

Everyone began filing out the restaurant and into their cars to begin their journeys. The second last group to leave, Jess and Anthony walked slowly to Jess's car, Jess leading Anthony with her soft hands. Teasingly, Jess slapped her own ass with Anthony's hand and acted surprised, ""OH Anthony, Mmm"" she moaned subtedly and instantly Anthony felt himself get a little hard. He let out a tiny laugh but couldn't get any words out as he got in the passenger seat and closed the door. Through the slightly cracked window Isaac again saw Tiff talking to Jess.

-""uhhh what was I gonna say girl- OH right do you have condoms?"" Anthony heard his mom's friend say. 
""Oh yeh it's fine I told Joe to leave some of his trojans in the car"" Jess replied.
""Regular trojans?"" Asked Tiff.
""Yeh?? What else ahah""
Tiff reached around in her bag and pulled out a pack of condoms and handed it to Jess, ""his mom told me to give you these"". Jess quickly stopped laughing when she grabbed the pack and read the box. She looked up at a giggling Tiff in shock. ""Girl- ahah-ahaha you're fucking with me right"" she lowered her voice to a whisper ""extra large??""
Tiff who couldn't stop laughing either simply nodded, gave Jess a hug and walked away to the car with Joe and Case. Jess stood there for a moment before turning around to see Anthony in the car (poorly acting like he wasn't listening), pressed the condoms against her chest and smiled, whispering ""thank you so fucking much god"".

After driving for about 5 minutes, as confused as Anthony as, he realised that this was happening and that he may as well get comfortable. So he begun, ""Ms Jess-"", he was cut off immediately. 
""Ok first of all buddy you definitely don't have to call me Ms Jess tonight ahah, Jess is fine...and by the end of the night you will probably be calling me some naughtier things, so just relax"" Jess responded.
Anthony blushed but continued on nonetheless. ""So anyway, Jess, I was kinda listening to your conversation earlier in the carpark. What's so special about the condom that Tiff gave you? Didn't you say you have some.""

""Well... I guess it won't hurt to cover the basics in the car. So basically every guy's..Sorry I don't know what you call it ahah but you're grown now it's fine, well I call it a 'dick'...every guy's dick looks different and that means size too. Your boss Joe, who I love to the moon and back, unfortunately is only about 5.5 inches. Now I don't know personally but your mom says you are a REALLY big boy ahah, have you ever noticed that?""

Anthony blushed even more, ""I measured it once coz I was curious but I never knew if it was big or not. I don't remember exactly but I think it was like 8 inches or something""

The car swerved into the next lane for a split second before Jess snapped back into it ""Shit, sorry Anthony my bad. I just got a bit of a shock is all ahah. Anthony buddy, let me answer your uncertainties.. you have a big cock ahaha"". Jess laughed it off but on the inside she tried calming herself down ""the kids 18"" she said in her head, ""he may be long but it has to be pencil thin. There's just no way"". Jess bit her lip, ""Anthony... do you mind taking your dick out for a second? OK that sounded really creepy ahah- if that's ok with you that is. I wanna see what I'm working with tonight...or should I say working 'on'."" 

The attempt at a sexual joke flew over innocent Anthony's head but it didn't bother Jess as she kept her eyes on the road, excitedly anticipating a surprise in her peripheral view. She heard a zipper go down. She kept her eyes on the road trying to contain her smiling. She heard Anthony rustle around down there and that's when she began to get really excited only to hear Anthony stop and say ""uhh isn't this wrong to do in public what if people see me?"" 

""That's ok buddy the windows are tinted since Joe and I use this car for-"" Jess stopped herself, ""it's fine Anthony no one will see"". At this point Jess' eyes appeared laser focused on the road ahead of her but it was as if she couldn't see anything else but her peripheral. That's when she saw it; she could barely make out Anthony grabbing a large black object and letting it flop onto his leg. She turned her head to the passenger seat. Anthony sat there looking back at Jess, and on his right knee rested his dark cock which was 8 inches long and was the circumference of a redbull can.

Anthony was still piecing together what was happening as before he knew it Jess was now racing 30 miles over the speed limit, weaving in and out of traffic. In no time at all they pulled into the hotel carpark as Anthony was putting his package away and getting ready to get out of the car. Jess reached over and grabbed his hand signalling him to stop. From this point on everything was a blur for Anthony as he did nothing but follow Jess' orders word for word. Eventually he was waiting outside the car as Jess was reclining the backs seats, throwing away anything in the way onto the floor.

""Ok, get on your back in the back seat sweetie"" Jess said firmly. Anthony began removing his shirt as he asked ""Oh are we having sex here?"". Jess laughed but simultaneously moaned a little as she said ""no not yet buddy keep your clothes on just get on your back"".

Anthony obliged and was now on his back, taking up all three back seats with his legs hanging out the open door. His breathing was heavy as Jess hiked her dress slightly so that it wouldn't get on the ground, and then knelt on the asphalt ground in the open door in between Anthony's legs. Wasting no time she undid Anthony's pants again pulling them to his knees, her hands intermittently rubbing every part of Anthony's body as if they had a mind of their own. Finally she held it. In her hands: a semi-hard giant black cock. At this point neither one of them wanted to say anything so Jess looked deep into Anthony's eyes, pulled her face closer to his cock, and pressed her soft lips against the head. Anthony's head immediately threw his head back in pleasure, he didn't even have the energy to look down at his bosses girlfriend Jess. Jess' lips slowly expanded, moving from a closed mouth peck of the head, to completely engulfing the head of Anthony's penis. Before she had even reaches the shaft, she was holding one a fully erect penis in her hands. ""So fucking hard"" she whispered to herself with a shaky voice.

Jess took off as she was possessed. Grabbing and playfully squeezing his ballsack with one hand, as the other was stroking his shaft in a twisting motion. All the while her mouth was working in unison, going up and down on his huge cock about 5 times each time, each suck being deeper till the last until by the 5th suck she had his entire dick down her throat. She then retreated to the head and swirled her tongue around the head, even teasing the very - and then the cycle continued. This was Jess' signature blowjob technique that made every guy cum within minutes. Of course this was Anthony's first time so after only 3 of Jess' cycles she could feel Anthony's dick convulsing.

""Jess...j-jess"" Anthony called while his eyes were completely rolled back, ""I think im going to cum soon"". Jess laughed at how cute his confession was and completely removed her hands and mouth from anthony's genitals. ""Anthony let me guess...you normally cum in a tissue or towel don't you"".
Despite still looking like he was in a trance, he was able to nod.
""Well that was when you were a kid. Let me show you where grown men cum""

Jess placed her left hand on Anthony's right arm and right hand on Anthony's left arm slowly. She gripped tightly, pinning Anthony down. She took a deep breath and then threw her face onto Anthony's cock, skipping her usual cycle and taking the entire cock on the first try. She gagged as she took her head away and then deepthroated again. Everytime coughing out a mixture of saliva and precum. 

""Ohhhh fuckkkkk omggg"", Anthony was now moaning louder than he had been the entire time, matching Jess' moaning. ""Oh FUCK I'm cumming"" he squealed. Jess held her head down on his cock harder than ever before and likewise she pinned down his arms with the same strength. Anthony's whole body convulsed and the two stayed in that position for about 10 seconds. Anthony could now hold his head up and look at Jess who slowly lifted her head, her tongue scraping any cum off of Anthony's shaft as the came up, finally coming off the head with a loud pop and immediately sealing her mouth. Anthony snapping out of his trance asked ""wait shit it's in your mouth?? I'm so sorry here let me get tissues or something"". Jess giggled with her mouth closed then mumbled something which sounded like an attempt to talk under water. ""Huh??"" Anthony said. Jess pulled herself up closer towards Anthony's face and puckered her lips, hinting for Anthony to open his mouth ready for a kiss. She pressed her lips against his, cum flowing into Anthony's mouth. The two passionately kissed as they exchanged saliva and cum until eventually Jess took it all into her mouth and swallowed making a loud gulping sound. Anthony was in complete shock as he stared at his 30 year old co-worker absolutely awestruck. She smiled and pecked him on the lips.

""Come on, what are you waiting for get the bags let's go check in."" Jess said while smiling. Anthony slowly got up out of the car and pulled his pants up.

""Jess...sex is fucking amazing"", Anthony said while in a state of euphoria.

Jess giggled as she had been doing all night. ""Anthony, sweetie pie...you know that wasn't sex right ahaha. We are going to go upstairs,get showered and changed and then...Oh... Anthony honey, you are gonna fuck the living shit out of me.""

a40bq1,1,2018-12-07,[M4F] My favorite intern. The one who wanted to call me Daddy,StainlessInterval,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a40bq1/m4f_my_favorite_intern_the_one_who_wanted_to_call/,"We started seeing each other after she finished her undergraduate degree. She was a diligent intern when she started with us at age 20, and usually dressed conservatively, though her figure was never hard to make out beneath the fitted professional dress. I never made any direct passes at her, but she sensed my interest and often came by my office *just to talk*. The talks were never overtly sexual, but she slowly became more familiar, *closer* each week, til she felt at ease closing the door to come sit on my desk and discuss how our weeks were going, hopes, dreams, and the like.

The way she straightened her back and dangled her feet off the edge of the desk was adorable. She acted as if she were posing for a calendar as she discussed where her degree might take her, how much she would miss how *nice* everyone was around the office... I started to think how much I'd miss these talks and we began to talk more *outside* of work. Text messages exchanged at first were mostly professional, revolving around what she needed to do in the morning, which clients I would need to contact when I got a chance. But the ""good morning"" texts, and ""I'm bringing you a latte"" texts soon became random photos with captions such as ""Do you like my nails?"" or ""How does this lipstick look?"" as if I were her fashion consultant.

Graduation day came, and her time with us ended. The day I gave her a letter of recommendation and everyone wished her good luck in her future was the day that she came to me, with a piece of sheetcake in hand, and asked if I had plans later. I invited her to dinner and picked her up from her apartment almost immediately.

Over a nice Italian dinner, we laughed and flirted, her foot grazing my leg beneath the table accidentally at first, then persistently, gently, from my ankle to my knee up and down. We elected to skip dessert, as there was ice cream at home, if I was not mistaken. The car ride to my house felt warm, though the evening was cool. Her hand found my thigh rather quickly and her cheek my shoulder. My breathing was heavier, and the little *mm* noises she made were burrowing deeper into my mind during the entire twenty minute ride as the sun went down.

We never quite made it to the ice cream, as our lips met just past the entryway and the tension of the past year began to overflow. We tripped and staggered our way into the bedroom, leaving clothing at the bedroom door and ultimately in a heap by the bed. I mounted her at first, sliding easily inside as though the entire time I'd known her had been sufficient foreplay. I told her there were condoms in the nightstand, that we could put one on at the end. She agreed through muffled kisses and moans.

As I rolled to the side and she mounted me, she began a steady rocking rhythm, her hips rolling back and forth over me. I told her I was getting close, and she obediently slowed, smiling knowingly. As the pressure subsided, I nodded and she began riding me quickly again, her hands resting on my chest. We repeated this five times until I was clawing at her thigh each time we slowed to a stop. ""Let me know when you get close next time,"" she purred.

I pressed my hand to her chest, trailing down stomach and coming to rest on her thigh and let out a long puff of air. It was *so close.* ""Soon,"" I said. ""The condoms are right here..."" And I sat up slightly to reach for the nightstand.

She leaned her weight into her hands, and slid her arm behind my neck with her lips by my ear. *No daddy - cum for me right now. Cum inside me.* And she held me there and licked the side of my neck as her hips bucked up and down..."
a40hjb,37,2018-12-07,BIL/SIL fear for their children...but scream at us for not seeing them?,Reluctant_Achiever,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/a40hjb/bilsil_fear_for_their_childrenbut_scream_at_us/,"So, this is likely going to ramble a bit, it's been a year of hell on Earth, but I'll try to keep it coherent.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been married to my DH for 6 years, together over 8.  We have handled crazy making from my family (mom and dad, it's better now with boundaries and lots of limiting contact, and understanding that the crazy goes back generations-- genograms are eye opening ya'll!) for a while, but  the past year has escalated the crazy from *his* side of the equation.

&amp;#x200B;

Full disclosure, my husband is an addict (in case of being ID'd I won't mention specifics).  He is doing beautifully in recovery after a couple month stint at an inpatient facility this year and continued intensive therapy and 12 step involvement-- it was the hardest thing either of us have ever gotten through, but it was necessary to save his life.  I am proud of his work, and am doing my own recovery work and therapy for myself.  His family has addiction all over it, as does mine-- he had no clue about his until this broke and my MIL let slip about her mom, several of his aunts and cousins all dealing with severe (some cases deadly) addiction issues.

Her response to it her whole life was to shove it as *far down* as possible-- rug sweeping applies if the rug is covering a hole dug to the other side of the Earth.  As an ACA she is fairly textbook-- boundaries are nonexistent, disagreements (calm ones, just difference of opinion even) are hostile threats, and appearances are EVERYTHING. So, what does this have to do with BIL/SIL?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, BIL is the GC to the Nth degree-- and a major trigger for my husband.  DH spent his life trying to be him so he could be loved and accepted, but they are polar opposite people.  My DH is the man who cries at the drop of a hat because he feels so deeply, and is artistic, creative, and brilliant at the STEM career he chose.  BIL? Arrogant, entitled, and thinks his word is law because he spoke it, and his family (SIL and  toddler age DS and months old DD) is the most important thing in *everyone's* life.  Side note: they live 12 hours from us, my MIL and FIL live 10 **minutes** away from DH and I.

We have seen MIL and FIL 3 times this year, one of which to see our nephew because we were threatened with hellfire if we didn't (and we love him dearly anyway).  She drives up there about once a month for a weekend trip to see them and ""help them out"".  In fact, she was gone on one of those trips when me and FIL drove DH to rehab-- she sent a text to FIL saying "" give him a hug for me"".

&amp;#x200B;

Because we paid for said rehab out of pocket (don't ask how much that costs), we are really, REALLY tight on budget right now (and I'm a student to boot, working unpaid internships for my licensure), and in the past year we have gotten no contact from BIL and SIL directly at all, but massive amounts of guilt trip by proxy (MIL defending her precious GC and GGrandbabies) because we ""don't make the effort to be a part of this family or spend time with the kids""-- translation: you were in inpatient when DD was born, and you can't just *wait until she is born to leave for treatment after that.* However, now that things have settled, we have attempted to reach out and reconnect with everyone, and save for one letter (sent to the house, not the facility, because that would be acknowledgement of his brother's troubles) announcing the baby's birth (and nothing else, just a picture of her and ""hope to talk soon"") we have had zero contact from them directly, just shaming by proxy.

&amp;#x200B;

From what we gathered from JYFIL, they are afraid of the kids being around him...but they are mad that we can't drive over for visits?  They are upset that we don't reach out more, but they refuse to speak to us? We haven't even gotten Christmas lists for the LO's, but have gotten fingers wagged from MIL that we haven't gotten them anything...when I asked her last week what they needed this year.

What. the. HELL. Am I overreacting to this, or has something shifted that I can't see?  I fear that this family craziness is going to cause a backslide, and all I can do is support and watch and step in if he asks for help, but I'm not letting it take me down."
a40kso,9,2018-12-07,I am thinking about starting my own business in creating/managing viral contests,Luc_ACC,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/a40kso/i_am_thinking_about_starting_my_own_business_in/,"Hey guys, 

I have never posted something before in this subreddit, but I have been reading a lot of good advice here so I wanted your view on this: 

As of right now, I am doing a marketing &amp; sales internship for a cryptocurrency startup. Although their business model is not working that well, a co-worker and I are doing something on the side to earn some extra money for the business: creating and managing viral contests for other cryptocurrencies. 

I recently closed a deal worth 20K, so I'm pretty enthusiastic about it. Unfortunately (but fortunate for me), the company I am working for does not want to continue with this service because it does not fit within their business model. Therefore I am thinking about starting my own business in creating viral contests after I've finished my internship. I do feel using viral contests with tools like Vyper, Gleam, etc. is some kind of trend and can also be of use besides the cryptocurrency industry. Furthermore, I cannot find any other businesses doing this specifically. 

* That is, in short, my view on the matter, but what do you think about it?
* Should I keep focusing on the cryptocurrency market as a target audience or look elsewhere?
* Any tips on becoming an entrepreneur? I obviously do not have any experience...
* Do you know any other companies that specifically focus on managing/creating viral contests?
* Should I gain some more knowledge by reading certain books, etc.?
* Is it right to just focus my self on such a relatively niche market within social media marketing?

I very much would like to hear your perspective on the matter!

a40opr,3,2018-12-07,Having a lunch interview with a potential employer; need help!,ws1173,InterviewFauxYou,https://www.reddit.com/r/InterviewFauxYou/comments/a40opr/having_a_lunch_interview_with_a_potential/,"Some background on me: I have a BA in mathematics with a minor in computer science, and a masters in education. I taught high school math for 3 years before leaving my teaching job to pursue an IT career. I got a job at a restaurant as a bartender in the meantime while I searched for jobs, but I live in a rural area without many it options. Now, 2 years later, I am moving to a city with my girlfriend, and am picking up the search again.

I got a response from someone the other day. It was an email from the CTO of a small managed IT company. He said he wasn't sure if I was the right fit (likely because of a lack of experience), but was intrigued by my situation, and wanted me to give him a call. I called him shortly after and we had a great phone conversation for about 45 minutes. Long story short, he said he has a degree in molecular biology and ended up changing careers too, so he has a soft spot for people in a similar situation. And he also said that he's aware I have no career experience in the field, but also that he highly values workers with a desire to learn, a good work ethic, and a positive attitude (which I can honestly say describes me). He sounded hesitant about me, and threw out a couple of other possibilities like maybe interning there and getting a bartending job to pay the bills... So the next step is that we are having basically a lunch interview on Monday, and he has said at least twice ""make sure you have a lot of good questions for me"". So I guess I'm just looking for advice on questions to ask and ways to promote myself in a way that will get me a paid job there rather than a part time, unpaid internship (although that would still be better than nothing).

a40yy8,2,2018-12-07,My (f27) boyfriend (m28) wants me to wash my vagina out with soap but I don’t want to.,gingerhoney,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a40yy8/my_f27_boyfriend_m28_wants_me_to_wash_my_vagina/,"This is going to be a long post, so buckle up.

I have been dating my (f27) boyfriend (m28) for about four years. We have had our ups and downs. He met me about six months after my dad was arrested and sent to prison on some pretty grim charges, and I started intense therapy to deal with a bunch of issues going back to childhood including a diagnosis of bpd (and possible c-ptsd), but I have worked really hard on my issues and don't fit the diagnosis criteria for bpd any more. I am a very different person. Since then, I have had the beginnings of a successful career in a niche field (where there are jobs), and then decided to go back to school. I am in my second to last year of grad school, and admittedly find juggling school, home life, friends, and all of my side projects pretty stressful sometimes.


In the past four years he has switched jobs and vocations about four times. He doesn't have a college degree (not too far from one), and has quit two college degrees, one university degree, a trade program, and a few other things he has picked up and tried. I was blamed for him quitting college the first time (admittedly I wanted to spend time with him and could be anxious, but he was also trying to work 40 hours and go to school full time to help his parents pay for bills...they had a bunch of financial issues but that is another story). We talked about it recently and he said that he is frustrated that he can't talk to me about not liking his current job because he thinks I will be angry or anxious if he says he wants to leave. This is fair, since it does give me great anxiety and I feel nauseous at the thought of another upheaval. At the same time, I really don't think that he should have to do a job he doesn't like for the rest of his life. I also know that I am someone that needs a degree of stability, and I am currently working towards that for myself and always think about him in my decision making process.


So the other night we were in the shower. He washes my hair sometimes which is lovely. He mentioned that he wanted to buy me some vagisil or dove at the store so I could wash my vagina. About a week before this, I had asked that he never mention this topic again, and that it was a serious issue and really upset me. He had brought it up numerous times, and each time I felt like I was using energy I would never get back. I do not have an infection or any weird smell going on unless I don't shower for days, in which case no one is touching me... If I ever feel like I'm not fresh, I use boric acid at night. I wash around my vagina with a bit of soap, and always make sure to clean myself thoroughly with water. But he just. won't. let. it. go.  He said his ex used vagisil and is fixated on me using it too. When he mentioned it I was upset and asked why he did when I had made a point about it the week before. He said that he forgot but also said that he did it to get a reaction out of me?


Last night we were watching a film and he said 'that woman looks like a dog!'. I thought that was a shitty thing to say, and I asked why he said that. He told me he did it just to get a rise out of me... When I am pmsing I get really irritated and sensitive, and I always mention it to him and ask that he doesn't do things to explicitly bother me. Every. single. time. it's like he can't help himself and he just starts bugging me. I am emotionally exhausted. I feel like I don't have a voice. I know that I can be difficult, but I genuinely believe that I am a good person. I am starting to feel like I am a bad person, and that I am to blame for everything. I feel so small. This is especially difficult as I grew up in a toxic household (my mom has bpd, my dad has severe ptsd), and I was emotionally abused and neglected my whole life. I have an eating disorder and a whole host of shit that I won't get in to, but I never feel like my partner actually tries to empathize with me on any of this, or understands how it effects my perspective on life. During an argument once told me that only children and animals deserve our empathy because they are 'pure' and don't do negative things? He now denies ever saying that.


I am not working right now. I was awarded a large scholarship for the duration of my masters which means I don't have to. This makes me feel like I don't work as hard as my partner?  Recently, I have been repainting our apartment. Admittedly I already painted our kitchen and I hated the colour so wanted to paint it again, which is probably annoying but I am obsessed with colour. He had promised to help with painting because he never had before. It was the weekend, so I asked him to help and he said 'he didn't feel like it'. I asked him why and he said he just didn't want to. He slept for several hours while I painted. We were talking about him being depressed (I thought this might be the cause of everything because he has been sleeping more, seeming more bitter, etc.) and he said that the two main reasons he's unhappy are because 'he can't do whatever he wants all the time' and because I redecorate too much. Okay.


Since RDR2 has been released all he has been doing is gaming. I'm not supposed to interrupt him while he's playing because the storyline is so intense, and he has stopped paying attention to our cat who loves him more than anyone :( This makes me really sad because one of the things I love most about him is how loving he is with our cat.


He has been physically aggressive with me two or three times, like grabbing my wrist really hard or pushing me out of the way into a door. I was being annoying on all of these occasions, but I was upset when he grabbed or pushed me. He didn't understand why.


I don't feel like he is interested in any of the things I love. He says that he doesn't actually believe I love to cook, or like design, or like to make things. That I just pretend because I feel like I'm supposed to. I do push myself really hard, but I am constantly learning new things (like how to code!) and how to do leatherworking etc. I was gone for two months this summer on international internships, and I was very stressed doing all the prep work and grants etc. I believe that he thinks that the stress means it's not worth it. I agree it was stressful, but they were two of the best experiences of my life. Maybe he resents me for leaving.



All of this is to say, is there any reason to stay? He owes me around $3500 but we have a contract. I wouldn't be able to move until July as there are no apartments in my city for rent and would need an extra $500 a month I don't have (but would maybe be able to pick up a part time job. I really, really, love our apartment don't want to leave it. I built custom shelving etc. and have plants that are overwintering...) I have $8000 debt. I am starting an online shop to sell some of my crafts, which will maybe help pay some bills. He started therapy again and says he really wants to fix things, but I am not sure I believe him. I feel stupid. Please help.



Tl;DR I think my boyfriend might be making me feel like crap"

* Are you passionate about Astronomy and Physics? 
* Are you ready for the challenge of working on a complex project at a elite research university? 
* Are you ready to see what you can do when you push yourself and the Universe is the limit? 
* Are you excited to make friends that will last a lifetime? 
* If so… read on!

The Yale Summer Program in Astrophysics (YSPA) is a research and enrichment program hosted at the Yale [Leitner](http://leitnerobservatory.org/)[ Family Observatory and Planetarium](http://leitnerobservatory.org/) (LFOP) at Yale for 32 rising high school seniors **(high school students who are juniors when they apply)** who have shown an aptitude for science and math, an interest in astrophysics, and who are considering going into careers in scientific research. The program consists of a two-week online, directed self-study program followed by a four-week residential program. Students at YSPA live together on campus in one of the residential colleges, take classes at the Leitner Planetarium, learn to program and analyze data in the computer lab at the Leitner Observatory, and use the telescopes at the Leitner Observatory (as well as remote observatories) to collect data for their research project. At the end of the program, students write up their results in the form of a scientific paper and then present those results at our YSPA mini-conference.  

It’s difficult to describe what to expect from YSPA compared to the other ways a ""sciency"" high school student might choose to spend her or his summer. If you do a research internship in a scientist’s lab, you might learn some advanced research techniques, but you might not learn any of the fundamental concepts behind the research, and you might not make friends with anyone your age with your interests. At a college summer course, you might learn some interesting science and math and experience a college campus but not get any hands-on experience or learn research methods. At a summer camp, you might have a lot of fun and make a lot of new friends, but you probably would not get to learn new and interesting science (depending on the camp). 

YSPA is not a camp, it’s not a summer course, and it’s not a research internship, but it has elements that are like all of those things. You can expect to be challenged academically and personally and to be pushed to explore the boundaries of your comfort zone. You can expect to feel satisfaction and a boost in self-confidence after completing a complex research project. You can expect to meet peers who are fun, super-smart, and as passionate about science as you are. You may ﬁnd that completing the program is one of the hardest and most rewarding things you’ve ever done.  

The main goal of YSPA is to provide our students with the opportunity to be academically and personally challenged in a professional scientific research environment. With the experience of meeting these challenges, they can go to college with the confidence that scientific research is something that they are ready to pursue. YSPA has the secondary goal of accelerating the personal growth of our students by giving them the opportunity to live and work in a university environment with their true peers– other high school seniors from around the world who have similar interests in math and science. Finally, YSPA also has a goal of teaching our students practical skills in computer programming, data analysis, statistics, writing, and other research methods— skills which are essential in all science, engineering, and tech fields.

a415xx,12,2018-12-07,27 and Unemployed..,27Jobless,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/a415xx/27_and_unemployed/,"Hi, this is going to be a long post so be ready...

I am 27 years old and unemployed. Actually let me be clear, I have never had a permanent official job, just temporary jobs: internships and assistant - kind. That said, I've been living with my family all my life. except when I boarded in high school and university but that doesn't count... at the end of the day i am yet to have put a roof over my head in my life.

This year, my parents threatened to throw me out  and said they didn't want to see me eating their food anymore. They then changed their minds and let me stay on but I'm afraid this wont last for long. I was diagnosed with depression in the middle of my uni years, so i was hospitalized and advised not to go to school by my doctor for a while. Thus I had to defer from school. After 2 years out of school, when I went back, my classes were rusty that I had to redo some classes. Thus it took me 8 years to finish my undergraduate degree. I finally graduated this month, this year.

Although my parents paid for my hospital bills and my medicine, they don't believe in empathizing with people struggling with depression. They see such people as 'too soft for the world and spoiled' so living at home isn't easy. They create fights all the time and pick on me. At the moment, my parents act fine with me living with them but it's because they are happy that I am finally graduating. Within the next 6 months however, i am sure that if i am still unemployed, they will actually go ahead and kick me to the street. However, in reality not all graduates get employed within the first few months after graduation, and I might just not be so lucky. My parents don't seem to care about this though considering they have put up with a 'depressed' child.

My problem is compounded by the fact that my grades from my degree were average. Most people who get well paying jobs from my course performed exceptionally and also pursued additional papers to supplement their degree. So aside from my degree result being average,I also have not done any of these professional papers because I do not have the funds to do them. My parents also are not willing to contribute to paying for these papers after paying my health bills and having me live with them for so many years. They also paid for my undergraduate degree. For me, I don't feel like a new graduate... I feel like someone who has been unemployed for 4 years. My parents' main interest right now is in me finally getting a job now that I have a degree, although getting a degree doesn't mean that i will automatically get a job.

Recently, a boss from an assistant job I did before my last year of uni is offering me a job. But when I worked with the company she is at, it was horrible. Not only did I work from Monday to Sunday, I was given a backlog of work they had piled up in years and had no help. I also had an uncomfortable 4 hr commute every day which cost a lot of money daily. The worst part of it was that my boss would pay me late, or some months not at all and the pay was peanuts. The one time I was promised a pay increase it never materialized.It was the kind of company that makes you work for them and then plays games with your salary, sometimes they pay sometimes they don't. My boss would say she was happy with my work but would still treat me this way with no explanation when I would ask. Even the job she is offering as of now is for such little pay that I will very barely pay my bills, but even then the company sometimes skips months of pay and never refunds.

Considering that my results and qualifications are average however, I wonder whether I should get back to this job now that it's the only one available? The previous time I worked for them the experience was so frustrating that I quit. I know that I have better chances of a job right now than when I worked with them before because then I had not completed my degree.  At the end of the day I just want to sustain myself and put food on the table like anyone else, so working a job where I spend a ton of money on the commute and other costs only to be paid 'when my boss feels like' feels silly. However, I am aware that I have a timeline at home so I wonder whether i should take this shitty job in desperation for now or just look for another way to make money?

I also wonder what to do with my life, it's become one tiring experience after another!

Sidebar: Reddit parents, how does it feel to live with a child who is 25+ at home? My parents act like its hell daily  so I wonder how it feels on the parent's side? Please leave your comments for me.

Anyone with advice is free to comment, please help . Thanks

a41jj8,1,2018-12-07,My ex girlfriend broke up with me,toughtittywampas,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a41jj8/my_ex_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me/,"So here it goes. Three years ago at university I met my girlfriend - she was smart, stunning, funny, kind and everything I had ever hoped for but never thought I would ever find. We spent 2/3 months together after which she had to go back to France as she was just spending a year abroad and had to go back to her university. I was absolutely devastated but we decided we would try a long distance relationship. 

Every other week one of us would fly to the other and it was tough but we made it work. In fact it was almost fun because we both got to have these small little escapes, although it was heart wrenching to leave each other at the end it was worth it because we knew we would see each other again soon. 

At the end of that year she moved back to England to live with me during my final year of University and she did another year abroad. It was absolute bliss and was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. About 4 months in I got an opportunity to do an internship out in the US for a year, I really didn't want to leave but I felt that if I didn't take the opportunity I would regret it and I know how hard finding work as a graduate is. From that point there was an issue with our relationship. I knew that I couldn't support both of us on my stipend and even if I could I couldn't have asked her to drop everything and move with me. 

Now she was incredibly supportive and loving and everything that made me love her so much in the first place but from that point we both had this feeling that we were going nowhere and it started to have a detrimental effect on our relationship, we stopped being as affectionate to each other because we were scared of how we would feel when we had to part. 

We kept in this was until it came close to the end of the year still loving each other but definitely having this cloud hanging over us. Unfortunately a few weeks before we had to move out she had an accident and was in hospital for 2 weeks. I spent as much time as I could to be there and support her and after she got out tried my best to care for her as she couldn't walk. It really strained what was left of our relationship as this was supposed to be our last bit of time together. When our lease ended on our flat she flew out to her mum's and I packed up and left. Before I went to the US I went to see her at her mum's and it was horrible and heartbreaking and we agreed that even though we couldn't be together we would remain friends because we loved each other and we wanted the other person to be happy. 

Fast forward to now, she came out to see me and needless to say as soon as I saw her all of my feelings came rushing back. The other night I tried to kiss her and she pulled back and made it known that she didn't want to. I felt embarrassed and ashamed and she felt quite anxious. Last night we decided to talk about it after I got back from work. She told me that she doesn't feel that way about me and that things were really bad over the last month's of us living together. Now I totally respect that and I don't want to ruin our relationship because any relationship with her is better than nothing at all. Although I knew this I always felt that it was the distance between us that was the deciding factor on us being together, that at some time in the future we might be together again. Although I understand and respect what she feels and deep down I know she is right but I am completely devastated and heart broken.

The problem is she is staying with me - and I know that when she leaves I won't see her again for at least 8 months. Usually in this position I would want to spend some time alone and overcome my emotions. But I don't want to be alone and I don't have any friends or family out here. I also really want to be friends with her because she knows me better than anyone and vice versa. How do I deal with the emotions I am feeling without making her uncomfortable and cause her to leave? She is the best person in my life and having her in it, in any way, makes my life better. 

I'm sorry for the mammoth post I just need some advice. "
a41s90,1,2018-12-07,Will I stifle my career with a small firm offer?,LevelAud,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/a41s90/will_i_stifle_my_career_with_a_small_firm_offer/,"Hi all: I'm looking for concrete advice and experiences. Any help you might be able to provide is greatly appreciated. I'm the first person in my immediate family to go to college, let alone have a CPA, so I can't really ask them for advice. This is a long post but i wanted to give sufficient background since I'm asking for advice in my specific situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I'm a 5th year MBA student and will be taking the first part of the CPA exam at the beginning of February. I'm trying to have all 4 parts passed by August (though I understand failing at least one part is common).  I had an internship with a top 15 firm in the summer, but wasn't extended an offer. Since then I have found an internship with a small firm (about 70 people) that mostly focuses on government work- school districts, townships, fire departments, etc. I decided to accept because I figure that more internship experience couldn't hurt. The internship starts in January, but I am trying to figure out what I should do if I am extended a full time offer.

&amp;#x200B;

Career goals: my main motivation in my career is that I want a wife and family in the future.  I have no desire to work for the Big 4, or to become the CFO of a fortune 500 company. I would like to make an an upper-middle class income by my 40s, which I consider to be $200k+, ideally making 150k or so by late 30s. These are ballpark numbers. I think this can be achieved by becoming a controller/CFO/some executive position of a smallish/medium sized private company, or partner in a smaller public accounting firm (please tell me if I'm wrong about any of that).

My concern is that starting with this small, government-based firm will prevent me from having decent exit opportunities in either another public firm or private company. And I'm not sure the relevance of training I will receive, since it is mostly government audits. However, it would be riskier to look for a job after graduating, since I don't know if I'll be able to get a better one. On the other hand, it could be riskier \*long term\* to start with the small firm.

The firm I'm interning at would likely start me 10-15k less than a top 15 firm, but has good benefits. I don't mind making a bit less starting out, as long as it won't interfere with my long term goals.  I've heard that starting salary after college can greatly affect long term career progression, which is my issue.

&amp;#x200B;

My question: is accepting a full time offer with the small firm going to greatly hinder me from finding private or other public jobs in the future? I am not sure if I should accept this job and then look for public/private exit opportunities later OR search for another full time offer after I graduate. I have decent credentials- 3.7 undergrad GPA, I was the president of my university's accounting club, I'll have 2 audit internships, 150 credits, an MBA (not that that counts for much), and I hope to have passed at least a few part of the CPA exam by the time I graduate in May. I had some interviews but I guess that's a skill I need to work on since I wasn't extended an offer by any of those firms (mid sized).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be studying for the CPA exam, working 2 days a week, and taking night classes 3 days a week come January-May, so I want to have a plan now. I am grateful for any guidance from someone older and wiser, so thank you in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR should I accept a small, government-based accounting firm offer, or hope to find another job after graduating?

My name is Jon. I just turned 30, I’m a PhD student studying Counselor Education, six figures in student debt, and I’m a Licensed Professional Counselor Intern in the state of Texas. The reason I’m writing this article is because I’ve had spiritual experiences for the past decade that have helped guide me, which may also help provide insight to some things. I’ve been seeing strange lights and crafts in the sky for the past decade, with and without people and substances, and I finally learned what it all means. I’ve experienced more than I could mention in this article, and have learned and been shown more than many are comfortable with. My purpose for writing this article is to bring awareness into what I’ve been experiencing, and it is real regardless of the beliefs of those that will view this. I would also like to encourage other experiencers to come forward and create a conversation so that none of us feel alone.

I was raised Jewish and also have some American Indian ancestry, and I used to not think that these facts played a role in all of this. I’m a very spiritual person, and I’ve had to become one to survive what I’ve been through. I found solace in researching what I had seen and had an unquenchable desire to discover the truth. I had no idea at the time that truth was trying to show itself to me. In March of 2008 when this started, Ancient Aliens had just started on the History Channel (probably not so coincidentally). The ancient astronaut theory appealed to me and I began to wonder whether or not the light that guided Moses through the desert or the chariots of fire in the sky referenced in multiple cultures could be what I was seeing.

There’s a full write-up of my encounters on Reddit, but it wasn’t until this year that I had an encounter that gave confidence to the ancient astronaut theory. I met a girl near the beginning of 2018 that I instantly fell in love with, and we were almost inseparable. Since what I’ve seen is a part of my life, when it comes to romantic relationships it’s something I have to bring up at some point. She said that she wanted to see what I had been talking about and I informed her of the possibility that what I’ve seen could be responsible for us being here. At about 11:45 P.M. on the eve of Mother’s Day, we went east of Lubbock near McAdoo, TX where the windmills are. We pulled off into a field and leaned against the car facing south, and it was a beautiful night.

There was one light in the sky that didn’t look like the rest of the stars, and we were both fixated on it. It suddenly increased luminosity and started growing until it had this beautiful giant powder baby blue aura around it. Imagine holding a basketball out in front of your face. It looked like how the star over the manger had been depicted, and I also learned it bore an identical resemblance to the Blue Kachina of Hopi prophecy. The light started dimming down, and then I noticed a few large, fluffy looking lights southeast of us. They looked like big out-of-focus illuminated marshmallows, and it appeared as though there were three smaller lights breaking off, or “blossoming” from each large one.

Very slowly, the large lights hid within clouds and encircled us, and the large lights were equally spaced in front of the clouds, which were overcast outside the circle and the sky above us was completely clear. It appeared the smaller lights had arranged themselves into a grid, or dome-like pattern above us. It was like a cathedral of stars and remains the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. There was a bright light at the top center, maybe 1000 feet up, and when I nudged her to look up, it was like a wave started from the top center of the dome. The wave flowed like a burning leaf, and as the light passed each light in the grid, it refracted a fluorescent purple, almost like a peacock feather. The wave reached the clouds and the large lights hidden within them faded, and the smaller lights drifted outward like jellyfish and disappeared.

I look around and notice a light in the field we were standing a few hundred yards to the east of us. It was glowing LED white, looked to be 10-12 feet tall, and was in the shape of a pinecone that was skinny side up. To be honest, someone in Biblical times might’ve described it as a burning bush. We asked each other if it had been there before, and agreed it hadn’t. After 30 or so seconds looking at it, it began to rise slowly and then at about 20-30 feet off the ground, it came straight for us, fast. She couldn’t handle it and had her face in her hands crying, saying she wanted to go home but doesn’t remember any of it. I felt the need to make her feel safe so we got in the car and headed for the main road. There was more that happened that night but it isn’t incredibly prudent to include.

The morning of Mother’s Day after the encounter, I couldn’t sleep and she had to. I had recently learned that the crafts from my first two encounters flew towards the Moundville Mounds in Moundville, AL after they flew over me in 2008 and the connection was fresh in my mind. I was gifted a couple hundred books by a regular at the restaurant where I waited tables before I moved to Lubbock, and I never read one. I had been at the same house for five years and just so happened to stock a particular book on the shelf where I would see it. It’s called “Black Elk Speaks”, and it’s a dictation of Black Elk’s (an Oglala Sioux/Lakota) story. He was a medicine man that claimed he had an important message for the world. It was about 6:45 A.M., the golden hour, and I decided to tuck it under my arm while I walked my roommate’s boxer to clear my head.

I liked to walk Tyson without the leash because he listened at crosswalks, and we saw some strange things happen with nature. There was a coffee shop five blocks from the house that opened at eight, and I decided we’d go to the park a couple of blocks away to wait. We get a block from the coffee shop and there were two trees in front of this house full of dove. Right as we were about to cross, the doves start crying, shrieking. We look over and out from behind that house slinks a grey fox with a dead black kitten in its mouth. We watched as this fox made its way to our side of the street trotting with pride, got within 20 feet of us with Tyson off the least, and acted like we weren’t even there. The whole reason I went to college was so I could create positive systemic change, particularly in the prison industry, and I saw parallels of predation in that metaphor. I ponder the whole way to the park and sit down to open Black Elk Speaks, and to my amazement I find everything I had seen for the past 10 years contained within it.

Black Elk knew that if he had been honest in 1930 about the connection that all tribes have, the connection that I have, it would’ve been rejected. He had to play to how he knew the public needed to perceive him, so he disguised his experience in metaphor and spiritual language. I immediately knew that Black Elk’s description of the horses in the sky taking their stables was what I had seen. I was shook, and I felt I had to talk about it. I made many calls and emails to a few Cherokee people in Oklahoma because that’s the tribe I’ve been told my ancestry stems from. My girlfriend and I go to Tahlequah a couple of days after Mother’s Day and had a meeting with a few people. I won’t discuss what was said, but it is true that almost every American Indian tribe believes their creators came from the stars. What I now know is that Black Elk Speaks is a spiritual breadcrumb trail that’s been left for all of us.

I’ve sought closure about what I’ve seen since it started, and my mother has shared encounters but my father was under the impression this has all been something mental. A couple of hours after our meeting, two crafts flew by during the daytime in Tahlequah. They looked like hard-boiled eggs cut in half and smoothed on the bottom, and after they left I got excited and called my father. I thought I had illustrated the connection since they showed up in front of the whole town. My father showed up to Lubbock a couple of days later, but before he did some strange things happened. My girlfriend at the time didn’t remember crying the morning of Mother’s Day, and she doesn’t remember this. We were sitting on my couch and I was pretty spiritually elevated. Her tone changed to a really soft and engaging one, and she leaned in and told me that she was Mother Nature, and that I was the king of Israel. I was a little shocked and didn’t say anything, and then she asked me to come outside with her. It was nighttime and we sat on my front porch, and she told me she could make lightning bugs dance while she hummed a song, and she showed me. If what she told me was true, it would make sense why my life has been such a series of close calls and coincidences.

The next morning, my father showed up and I agreed to go into a psych ward at Covenant Hospital (go figure) for him. I knew what I had seen was true, but that didn’t make it any less difficult to deal with. I openly shared about what I had seen and my father was insistent I go to another facility in Houston for six weeks, supposedly one of the best. I’m named after a book called “Jonathan Livingston Seagull”, and there was a copy on the bookshelf, an old one. The only other time I had seen this same print was at my grandparent’s house, and it was my father’s copy. I open it and find an excerpt written inside that reads “Jonathan Seagull was born to be an instructor, and his way of demonstrating love was to show something of the truth to a gull who only asked to see something of the truth for himself…thank you for that, Merry Christmas”.

My name is Jonathan William Buchalter. Jonathan means, “Name given by God”, William in German means “fierce protector”, and Buchalter in German means “bookkeeper” or “accountant”. The fact that I’m named after a book that deals with spiritual ascension and teaching others and have found multiple books that have led me to this really doesn’t seem like a mistake. I feel that it’s possible that the collective creative will of humanity potentially puts some of us here to help us understand how things work. That may sound like a broad claim, but there’s plenty that I haven’t shared that backs it up.

I went with the motions trying to rebuild my foundation and eventually ended up back in Dallas, where I was born. On November 5th, I met a guy that I became quick friends with that told me I should come to Sedona, Arizona because there’s people like me there. We stayed with his father and my buddy took off after a couple of days but his father let me stay for two weeks. I met two healers in Sedona, one of whom has the same connection I do, just a couple decades further along. I also learned that the Hopi have a prophecy called the True White Brother who is accompanied by two knowledgeable aides, which I found interesting. I was supposed to start a new job November 26th that got pushed back to December 10th, so I chose to investigate what I should use that time for. I decided that I should go visit South Dakota, per the advice of a Lakota elder I received a while back.

I made an account on couchsurfing.com and only reached out to stay with one person, and they accepted. They just so happened to be the great-grandchild of Old Hollow Horn who rescued Black Elk when he was injured during the Wounded Knee Massacre, which still blows my mind. I sought and found spiritual guidance that led me to many realizations, and so much of how this has all come together illustrates how creative intelligence can work. It’s pretty amazing how alike the Lakota and Buddhists are in their belief systems, and I’ve done a lot of research that indicates “star people” are considered spiritual guides in many cultures around the world. So why are so many people afraid of these beings?

Fear has always been an effective strategy for excluding what’s new, but I hate to break it to you, this isn’t new. If we’d each do our own research we’d find instances of visitation throughout history. Since the 1970s, there’s been a warming up to the idea of disclosure, and many creative minds have exhausted themselves producing the best representations of a universal spiritual connection to this force, but why did they do it? Is it possible Spielberg is a contactee like me and has been channeling? Was “Arrival” by Denis Villeneuve a subconscious precursor to disclosure? This certainly seems to have been a gradual process, and the public has gravitated to the idea of it. When we collect spiritual belief systems from different cultures, they all start to paint a picture that suggests I may be right.

The Lakota have a phrase “Mikatuye Oyasin”, which basically means, “We are all relatives”. Their philosophy talks about how everything is one, and everything tries to be whole and find balance. In nature, round is everywhere, which provides interesting insight into how everything we build is square and rigid. It’s as if the society we’ve created has become unnatural and is working against us. I’d encourage people to research what percentage of the population were farmers or producers before the industrial revolution. I don’t think we were meant to spend most of the daylight hours of every week doing work that advances our material agendas and ruins our bodies from sitting. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that it is very difficult to find spiritual people in high places of business, and I have met more happy homeless people than happy millionaires. I have a lot of theories and other knowledge about what I’ve seen that I won’t get into because there’s something more important I need to say.

Of all of the research I’ve done, perhaps one excerpt from the Bible can help you understand what I’ve learned. In John 10:34, Jesus said “Is it not written in your law? I said, ye are Gods”. I learned that what I’ve been seeing are the thunder beings of American Indian lore, and they’re likely what put us here. They can act as spiritual guides and assist medicine men in acting as conduits of the creative energy that comprises all things to heal. There are people today around the world capable of doing what Jesus did. I would encourage everyone to do his or her own research before dismissing what I’m saying. What I now know is that if we are all fragments of that same creational intelligence, then we are basically it, and so is everything. That would also mean that it’s us in the driver’s seat and not some all-knowing man in the clouds, but we can still seek and be guided by that creative intelligence itself. Once we understand our own divinity and develop ourselves spiritually, the external fixes we medicate with to make ourselves feel better are no longer needed. We become empowered, conscious, and realize we are masters of our own destiny.

After traveling the country seeking guidance and meeting many amazing people, I took a step back and looked at society. So much of what we do is aimed at achieving security while not pursuing freedom, and we don’t understand how much that contributes to our mental state. I see people burdened by life’s problems without the means or willingness to speak up and change it. A lot of people almost have this resigned, powerless demeanor with how they view the world, but most of us want to improve it. I also understand that everything that I’m saying can come with societal consequences, but I’ve put up with worse than y’all can throw at me for the past decade, and this is too important to stay silent. People are afraid to use their voice because they don’t want to threaten their livelihood, and that shouldn’t have to be a choice. I know, as do many of you, that what is going on in the world today is not right, and we are encountering difficulty preparing for the consequences that are coming while still contributing to what’s going to cause it.

Words can’t express the love I have for everyone and how much I want to see us flourish and prosper, and that love becomes heavy once we realize what’s coming. Though my experience is different than yours, it has taught me what’s important…us. The things that we have prioritized over each other have only hurt us. When was the last time someone asked you how your day was? When was the last time you called your family to say you love them? When was the last time you really felt comfortable and at peace? I’m here to tell you from personal experience that the solution isn’t external. Our spirit, which is a collective one, can only be fed with itself. We are all in this together regardless of what we choose to divide ourselves with, and everyone will feel the consequences that are going to compound unless more drastic action is taken. We can’t let the science that proves we need to take action fall to the wayside. If we don’t bring accountability to this world, no one will, and that is the truth. I love you all and hope my words have helped improve your day in someway, and I’m willing to share about my spiritual experiences, stories, thoughts, or just listen to anybody that wants. We need connection, and I offer myself to everyone as a start."

My name is Jon. I just turned 30, I’m a PhD student studying Counselor Education, six figures in student debt, and I’m a Licensed Professional Counselor Intern in the state of Texas. The reason I’m writing this article is because I’ve had spiritual experiences for the past decade that have helped guide me, which may also help provide insight to some things. I’ve been seeing strange lights and crafts in the sky for the past decade, with and without people and substances, and I finally learned what it all means. I’ve experienced more than I could mention in this article, and have learned and been shown more than many are comfortable with. My purpose for writing this article is to bring awareness into what I’ve been experiencing, and it is real regardless of the beliefs of those that will view this. I would also like to encourage other experiencers to come forward and create a conversation so that none of us feel alone.

I was raised Jewish and also have some American Indian ancestry, and I used to not think that these facts played a role in all of this. I’m a very spiritual person, and I’ve had to become one to survive what I’ve been through. I found solace in researching what I had seen and had an unquenchable desire to discover the truth. I had no idea at the time that truth was trying to show itself to me. In March of 2008 when this started, Ancient Aliens had just started on the History Channel (probably not so coincidentally). The ancient astronaut theory appealed to me and I began to wonder whether or not the light that guided Moses through the desert or the chariots of fire in the sky referenced in multiple cultures could be what I was seeing.

There’s a full write-up of my encounters on Reddit, but it wasn’t until this year that I had an encounter that gave confidence to the ancient astronaut theory. I met a girl near the beginning of 2018 that I instantly fell in love with, and we were almost inseparable. Since what I’ve seen is a part of my life, when it comes to romantic relationships it’s something I have to bring up at some point. She said that she wanted to see what I had been talking about and I informed her of the possibility that what I’ve seen could be responsible for us being here. At about 11:45 P.M. on the eve of Mother’s Day, we went east of Lubbock near McAdoo, TX where the windmills are. We pulled off into a field and leaned against the car facing south, and it was a beautiful night.

There was one light in the sky that didn’t look like the rest of the stars, and we were both fixated on it. It suddenly increased luminosity and started growing until it had this beautiful giant powder baby blue aura around it. Imagine holding a basketball out in front of your face. It looked like how the star over the manger had been depicted, and I also learned it bore an identical resemblance to the Blue Kachina of Hopi prophecy. The light started dimming down, and then I noticed a few large, fluffy looking lights southeast of us. They looked like big out-of-focus illuminated marshmallows, and it appeared as though there were three smaller lights breaking off, or “blossoming” from each large one.

Very slowly, the large lights hid within clouds and encircled us, and the large lights were equally spaced in front of the clouds, which were overcast outside the circle and the sky above us was completely clear. It appeared the smaller lights had arranged themselves into a grid, or dome-like pattern above us. It was like a cathedral of stars and remains the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. There was a bright light at the top center, maybe 1000 feet up, and when I nudged her to look up, it was like a wave started from the top center of the dome. The wave flowed like a burning leaf, and as the light passed each light in the grid, it refracted a fluorescent purple, almost like a peacock feather. The wave reached the clouds and the large lights hidden within them faded, and the smaller lights drifted outward like jellyfish and disappeared.

I look around and notice a light in the field we were standing a few hundred yards to the east of us. It was glowing LED white, looked to be 10-12 feet tall, and was in the shape of a pinecone that was skinny side up. To be honest, someone in Biblical times might’ve described it as a burning bush. We asked each other if it had been there before, and agreed it hadn’t. After 30 or so seconds looking at it, it began to rise slowly and then at about 20-30 feet off the ground, it came straight for us, fast. She couldn’t handle it and had her face in her hands crying, saying she wanted to go home but doesn’t remember any of it. I felt the need to make her feel safe so we got in the car and headed for the main road. There was more that happened that night but it isn’t incredibly prudent to include.

The morning of Mother’s Day after the encounter, I couldn’t sleep and she had to. I had recently learned that the crafts from my first two encounters flew towards the Moundville Mounds in Moundville, AL after they flew over me in 2008 and the connection was fresh in my mind. I was gifted a couple hundred books by a regular at the restaurant where I waited tables before I moved to Lubbock, and I never read one. I had been at the same house for five years and just so happened to stock a particular book on the shelf where I would see it. It’s called “Black Elk Speaks”, and it’s a dictation of Black Elk’s (an Oglala Sioux/Lakota) story. He was a medicine man that claimed he had an important message for the world.

a42k1d,3,2018-12-07,I am attracted to abusive and predator men,journey1992,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/a42k1d/i_am_attracted_to_abusive_and_predator_men/,"

I am attracted to abusive and predator/creepy men. The ones who are assholes, angry, unavailable, aggressive, controlling, dominant, have poor boundaries and are turned on by making women powerless and fearful.


Through intensive therapy, I’ve learned why I am attracted to negative qualities like this... Due to traumatic bonding because of my abusive caregivers, i was taught this was how love was expressed. They are familiar behaviors and my body craves it like an addiction. Men like this make me feel emotionally dysregulated which can also feel like excitement and passion. I feel intense fear around them but also physically excited (if you know what i mean). Even as a child, I liked watching scenes where women were taken advantage of and were overpowered by men in the bedroom even when they did not want it.


I was sexually harassed at my last internship. The man got jealous and angry with me and other men when I talked to other men. He seemed to like it and get turned on when i said ditzy/stupid things and when I acted scared of him. He followed me around the building. He loved it when I was helpless because it fed his self esteem but also he wanted me dependent on him. He wouldn’t take no for an answer when I avoided him. He was also quick to anger. He tried to get me alone in his office and touched my leg and waist a couple of times. When I started acting confident and assertive because I had enough of his behavior, he did not like that and got angry and sad (I think he has severe rejection and abandonment issues). He made me do work I wasn’t supposed to do. He tried to stop me from doing the work I wanted to do. He scared the crap out of me. But I also was attracted to him and even felt like I had fallen in love at one point. Very confusing. I think his obsessiveness and controlling behavior made me feel loved and desired. Also I felt feminine and like a damsel in distress that he rescued. I was always used to being the one who protected others and it was so attractive to be around such a masculine and dominant presence who could protect me if I needed it. I felt overpowered around him and submitted to him easily. Anyways I never went back after that internship was over, he was no good for me plus he was married (when he was trying to get with me, he would take off his ring. I guess he thought I was too dumb to know).

What happened at that internship with him was traumatic and I felt hypervigilant around him. I have to do EMDR to work through what happened.


At another internship, another married man sexually Harassed me. When I walked in the room, he said,”Hi.... hiiii, I should call you smiley.” The way he said it was like he was turned on and it made others uncomfortable in the room. Another time, he told my demeanor reminded him of his wife and that he always tells his coworker that if he had another son, he would have me marry him. He got Angry when I rejected him, too. I spent that internship avoiding him.


Anyways, a big reason I am not dating now is because I want to work on myself and break these

Patterns of being attracted to and attracting these toxic dynamics in a relationship. Ugh, it sucks im attracted to these types of men. I have borderline personality disorder traits and I bet I attract men who also have personality disorders.


Anyone else relate?"

I had no idea at the time that truth was trying to show itself to me. In March of 2008 when this started, Ancient Aliens had just started on the History Channel (probably not so coincidentally). The ancient astronaut theory appealed to me and I began to wonder whether or not the light that guided Moses through the desert or the chariots of fire in the sky referenced in multiple cultures could be what I was seeing.

There’s a full write-up of my encounters on Reddit, but it wasn’t until this year that I had an encounter that gave confidence to the ancient astronaut theory. I met a girl near the beginning of 2018 that I instantly fell in love with, and we were almost inseparable. Since what I’ve seen is a part of my life, when it comes to romantic relationships it’s something I have to bring up at some point. She said that she wanted to see what I had been talking about and I informed her of the possibility that what I’ve seen could be responsible for us being here. At about 11:45 P.M. on the eve of Mother’s Day, we went east of Lubbock near McAdoo, TX where the windmills are. We pulled off into a field and leaned against the car facing south, and it was a beautiful night.

There was one light in the sky that didn’t look like the rest of the stars, and we were both fixated on it. It suddenly increased luminosity and started growing until it had this beautiful giant powder baby blue aura around it. Imagine holding a basketball out in front of your face. It looked like how the star over the manger had been depicted, and I also learned it bore an identical resemblance to the Blue Kachina of Hopi prophecy. The light started dimming down, and then I noticed a few large, fluffy looking lights southeast of us. They looked like big out-of-focus illuminated marshmallows, and it appeared as though there were three smaller lights breaking off, or “blossoming” from each large one.

Very slowly, the large lights hid within clouds and encircled us, and the large lights were equally spaced in front of the clouds, which were overcast outside the circle and the sky above us was completely clear. It appeared the smaller lights had arranged themselves into a grid, or dome-like pattern above us. It was like a cathedral of stars and remains the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. There was a bright light at the top center, maybe 1000 feet up, and when I nudged her to look up, it was like a wave started from the top center of the dome. The wave flowed like a burning leaf, and as the light passed each light in the grid, it refracted a fluorescent purple, almost like a peacock feather. The wave reached the clouds and the large lights hidden within them faded, and the smaller lights drifted outward like jellyfish and disappeared.

I look around and notice a light in the field we were standing a few hundred yards to the east of us. It was glowing LED white, looked to be 10-12 feet tall, and was in the shape of a pinecone that was skinny side up. To be honest, someone in Biblical times might’ve described it as a burning bush. We asked each other if it had been there before, and agreed it hadn’t. After 30 or so seconds looking at it, it began to rise slowly and then at about 20-30 feet off the ground, it came straight for us, fast. She couldn’t handle it and had her face in her hands crying, saying she wanted to go home but doesn’t remember any of it. I felt the need to make her feel safe so we got in the car and headed for the main road. There was more that happened that night but it isn’t incredibly prudent to include.

The morning of Mother’s Day after the encounter, I couldn’t sleep and she had to. I had recently learned that the crafts from my first two encounters flew towards the Moundville Mounds in Moundville, AL after they flew over me in 2008 and the connection was fresh in my mind. I was gifted a couple hundred books by a regular at the restaurant where I waited tables before I moved to Lubbock, and I never read one. I had been at the same house for five years and just so happened to stock a particular book on the shelf where I would see it. It’s called “Black Elk Speaks”, and it’s a dictation of Black Elk’s (an Oglala Sioux/Lakota) story. He was a medicine man that claimed he had an important message for the world. It was about 6:45 A.M., the golden hour, and I decided to tuck it under my arm while I walked my roommate’s boxer to clear my head.

I liked to walk Tyson without the leash because he listened at crosswalks, and we saw some strange things happen with nature. There was a coffee shop five blocks from the house that opened at eight, and I decided we’d go to the park a couple of blocks away to wait. We get a block from the coffee shop and there were two trees in front of this house full of dove. Right as we were about to cross, the doves start crying, shrieking. We look over and out from behind that house slinks a grey fox with a dead black kitten in its mouth. We watched as this fox made its way to our side of the street trotting with pride, got within 20 feet of us with Tyson off the least, and acted like we weren’t even there. The whole reason I went to college was so I could create positive systemic change, particularly in the prison industry, and I saw parallels of predation in that metaphor. I ponder the whole way to the park and sit down to open Black Elk Speaks, and to my amazement I find everything I had seen for the past 10 years contained within it.

Black Elk knew that if he had been honest in 1930 about the connection that all tribes have, the connection that I have, it would’ve been rejected. He had to play to how he knew the public needed to perceive him, so he disguised his experience in metaphor and spiritual language. I immediately knew that Black Elk’s description of the horses in the sky taking their stables was what I had seen. I was shook, and I felt I had to talk about it. I made many calls and emails to a few Cherokee people in Oklahoma because that’s the tribe I’ve been told my ancestry stems from. My girlfriend and I go to Tahlequah a couple of days after Mother’s Day and had a meeting with a few people. I won’t discuss what was said, but it is true that almost every American Indian tribe believes their creators came from the stars. What I now know is that Black Elk Speaks is a spiritual breadcrumb trail that’s been left for all of us.

I’ve sought closure about what I’ve seen since it started, and my mother has shared encounters but my father was under the impression this has all been something mental. A couple of hours after our meeting, two crafts flew by during the daytime in Tahlequah. They looked like hard-boiled eggs cut in half and smoothed on the bottom, and after they left I got excited and called my father. I thought I had illustrated the connection since they showed up in front of the whole town. My father showed up to Lubbock a couple of days later, but before he did some strange things happened. My girlfriend at the time didn’t remember crying the morning of Mother’s Day, and she doesn’t remember this. We were sitting on my couch and I was pretty spiritually elevated. Her tone changed to a really soft and engaging one, and she leaned in and told me that she was Mother Nature, and that I was the king of Israel. I was a little shocked and didn’t say anything, and then she asked me to come outside with her. It was nighttime and we sat on my front porch, and she told me she could make lightning bugs dance while she hummed a song, and she showed me. If what she told me was true, it would make sense why my life has been such a series of close calls and coincidences.

The next morning, my father showed up and I agreed to go into a psych ward at Covenant Hospital (go figure) for him. I knew what I had seen was true, but that didn’t make it any less difficult to deal with. I openly shared about what I had seen and my father was insistent I go to another facility in Houston for six weeks, supposedly one of the best. I’m named after a book called “Jonathan Livingston Seagull”, and there was a copy on the bookshelf, an old one. The only other time I had seen this same print was at my grandparent’s house, and it was my father’s copy. I open it and find an excerpt written inside that reads “Jonathan Seagull was born to be an instructor, and his way of demonstrating love was to show something of the truth to a gull who only asked to see something of the truth for himself…thank you for that, Merry Christmas”.

My name is Jonathan William Buchalter. Jonathan means, “Name given by God”, William in German means “fierce protector”, and Buchalter in German means “bookkeeper” or “accountant”. The fact that I’m named after a book that deals with spiritual ascension and teaching others and have found multiple books that have led me to this really doesn’t seem like a mistake. I feel that it’s possible that the collective creative will of humanity potentially puts some of us here to help us understand how things work. That may sound like a broad claim, but there’s plenty that I haven’t shared that backs it up.

I went with the motions trying to rebuild my foundation and eventually ended up back in Dallas, where I was born. On November 5th, I met a guy that I became quick friends with that told me I should come to Sedona, Arizona because there’s people like me there. We stayed with his father and my buddy took off after a couple of days but his father let me stay for two weeks. I met two healers in Sedona, one of whom has the same connection I do, just a couple decades further along. I also learned that the Hopi have a prophecy called the True White Brother who is accompanied by two knowledgeable aides, which I found interesting. I was supposed to start a new job November 26th that got pushed back to December 10th, so I chose to investigate what I should use that time for. I decided that I should go visit South Dakota, per the advice of a Lakota elder I received a while back.

I made an account on couchsurfing.com and only reached out to stay with one person, and they accepted. They just so happened to be the great-grandchild of Old Hollow Horn who rescued Black Elk when he was injured during the Wounded Knee Massacre, which still blows my mind. I sought and found spiritual guidance that led me to many realizations, and so much of how this has all come together illustrates how creative intelligence can work. It’s pretty amazing how alike the Lakota and Buddhists are in their belief systems, and I’ve done a lot of research that indicates “star people” are considered spiritual guides in many cultures around the world. So why are so many people afraid of these beings?

Fear has always been an effective strategy for excluding what’s new, but I hate to break it to you, this isn’t new. If we’d each do our own research we’d find instances of visitation throughout history. Since the 1970s, there’s been a warming up to the idea of disclosure, and many creative minds have exhausted themselves producing the best representations of a universal spiritual connection to this force, but why did they do it? Is it possible Spielberg is a contactee like me and has been channeling? Was “Arrival” by Denis Villeneuve a subconscious precursor to disclosure? This certainly seems to have been a gradual process, and the public has gravitated to the idea of it. When we collect spiritual belief systems from different cultures, they all start to paint a picture that suggests I may be right.

The Lakota have a phrase “Mikatuye Oyasin”, which basically means, “We are all relatives”. Their philosophy talks about how everything is one, and everything tries to be whole and find balance. In nature, round is everywhere, which provides interesting insight into how everything we build is square and rigid. It’s as if the society we’ve created has become unnatural and is working against us. I’d encourage people to research what percentage of the population were farmers or producers before the industrial revolution. I don’t think we were meant to spend most of the daylight hours of every week doing work that advances our material agendas and ruins our bodies from sitting. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that it is very difficult to find spiritual people in high places of business, and I have met more happy homeless people than happy millionaires. I have a lot of theories and other knowledge about what I’ve seen that I won’t get into because there’s something more important I need to say.

Of all of the research I’ve done, perhaps one excerpt from the Bible can help you understand what I’ve learned. In John 10:34, Jesus said “Is it not written in your law? I said, ye are Gods”. I learned that what I’ve been seeing are the thunder beings of American Indian lore, and they’re likely what put us here. They can act as spiritual guides and assist medicine men in acting as conduits of the creative energy that comprises all things to heal. There are people today around the world capable of doing what Jesus did. I would encourage everyone to do his or her own research before dismissing what I’m saying. What I now know is that if we are all fragments of that same creational intelligence, then we are basically it, and so is everything. That would also mean that it’s us in the driver’s seat and not some all-knowing man in the clouds, but we can still seek and be guided by that creative intelligence itself. Once we understand our own divinity and develop ourselves spiritually, the external fixes we medicate with to make ourselves feel better are no longer needed. We become empowered, conscious, and realize we are masters of our own destiny.

After traveling the country seeking guidance and meeting many amazing people, I took a step back and looked at society. So much of what we do is aimed at achieving security while not pursuing freedom, and we don’t understand how much that contributes to our mental state. I see people burdened by life’s problems without the means or willingness to speak up and change it. A lot of people almost have this resigned, powerless demeanor with how they view the world, but most of us want to improve it. I also understand that everything that I’m saying can come with societal consequences, but I’ve put up with worse than y’all can throw at me for the past decade, and this is too important to stay silent. People are afraid to use their voice because they don’t want to threaten their livelihood, and that shouldn’t have to be a choice. I know, as do many of you, that what is going on in the world today is not right, and we are encountering difficulty preparing for the consequences that are coming while still contributing to what’s going to cause it.

Words can’t express the love I have for everyone and how much I want to see us flourish and prosper, and that love becomes heavy once we realize what’s coming. Though my experience is different than yours, it has taught me what’s important…us. The things that we have prioritized over each other have only hurt us. When was the last time someone asked you how your day was? When was the last time you called your family to say you love them? When was the last time you really felt comfortable and at peace? I’m here to tell you from personal experience that the solution isn’t external. Our spirit, which is a collective one, can only be fed with itself. We are all in this together regardless of what we choose to divide ourselves with, and everyone will feel the consequences that are going to compound unless more drastic action is taken. We can’t let the science that proves we need to take action fall to the wayside. If we don’t bring accountability to this world, no one will, and that is the truth. I love you all and hope my words have helped improve your day in someway, and I’m willing to share about my spiritual experiences, stories, thoughts, or just listen to anybody that wants. We need connection, and I offer myself to everyone as a start."
a42oo3,25,2018-12-07,I’m attracted to abusive and predator men,journey1992,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/a42oo3/im_attracted_to_abusive_and_predator_men/,"
I am attracted to abusive and predator/creepy men. The ones who are assholes, angry, unavailable, aggressive, controlling, dominant, have poor boundaries and are turned on by making women powerless and fearful.


Through intensive therapy, I’ve learned why I am attracted to negative qualities like this... Due to traumatic bonding because of my abusive caregivers, i was taught this was how love was expressed. They are familiar behaviors and my body craves it like an addiction. Men like this make me feel emotionally dysregulated which can also feel like excitement and passion. I feel intense fear around them but also physically excited (if you know what i mean). Even as a child, I liked watching scenes where women were taken advantage of and were overpowered by men in the bedroom even when they did not want it.


I was sexually harassed at my last internship. The man got jealous and angry with me and other men when I talked to other men. He seemed to like it and get turned on when i said ditzy/stupid things and when I acted scared of him. He followed me around the building. He loved it when I was helpless because it fed his self esteem but also he wanted me dependent on him. He wouldn’t take no for an answer when I avoided him. He was also quick to anger. He tried to get me alone in his office and touched my leg and waist a couple of times. When I started acting confident and assertive because I had enough of his behavior, he did not like that and got angry and sad (I think he has severe rejection and abandonment issues). He made me do work I wasn’t supposed to do. He tried to stop me from doing the work I wanted to do. He scared the crap out of me. But I also was attracted to him and even felt like I had fallen in love at one point. Very confusing. I think his obsessiveness and controlling behavior made me feel loved and desired. Also I felt feminine and like a damsel in distress that he rescued. I was always used to being the one who protected others and it was so attractive to be around such a masculine and dominant presence who could protect me if I needed it. I felt overpowered around him and submitted to him easily. Anyways I never went back after that internship was over, he was no good for me plus he was married (when he was trying to get with me, he would take off his ring. I guess he thought I was too dumb to know).

What happened at that internship with him was traumatic and I felt hypervigilant around him. I have to do EMDR to work through what happened.


At another internship, another married man sexually Harassed me. When I walked in the room, he said,”Hi.... hiiii, I should call you smiley.” The way he said it was like he was turned on and it made others uncomfortable in the room. Another time, he told my demeanor reminded him of his wife and that he always tells his coworker that if he had another son, he would have me marry him. He got Angry when I rejected him, too. I spent that internship avoiding him.


Anyways, a big reason I am not dating now is because I want to work on myself and break these

Patterns of being attracted to and attracting these toxic dynamics in a relationship. Ugh, it sucks im attracted to these types of men. I have borderline personality disorder traits and I bet I attract men who also have personality disorders.


Anyone else relate?"

My name is Jon. I just turned 30, I’m a PhD student studying Counselor Education, six figures in student debt, and I’m a Licensed Professional Counselor Intern in the state of Texas. The reason I’m writing this article is because I’ve had spiritual experiences for the past decade that have helped guide me, which may also help provide insight to some things. I’ve been seeing strange lights and crafts in the sky for the past decade, with and without people and substances, and I finally learned what it all means. I’ve experienced more than I could mention in this article, and have learned and been shown more than many are comfortable with. My purpose for writing this article is to bring awareness into what I’ve been experiencing, and it is real regardless of the beliefs of those that will view this. I would also like to encourage other experiencers to come forward and create a conversation so that none of us feel alone.

That would also mean that it’s us in the driver’s seat and not some all-knowing man in the clouds, but we can still seek and be guided by that creative intelligence itself. Once we understand our own divinity and develop ourselves spiritually, the external fixes we medicate with to make ourselves feel better are no longer needed. We become empowered, conscious, and realize we are masters of our own destiny.

After traveling the country seeking guidance and meeting many amazing people, I took a step back and looked at society. So much of what we do is aimed at achieving security while not pursuing freedom, and we don’t understand how much that contributes to our mental state. I see people burdened by life’s problems without the means or willingness to speak up and change it. A lot of people almost have this resigned, powerless demeanor with how they view the world, but most of us want to improve it. I also understand that everything that I’m saying can come with societal consequences, but I’ve put up with worse than y’all can throw at me for the past decade, and this is too important to stay silent. People are afraid to use their voice because they don’t want to threaten their livelihood, and that shouldn’t have to be a choice. I know, as do many of you, that what is going on in the world today is not right, and we are encountering difficulty preparing for the consequences that are coming while still contributing to what’s going to cause it.

Words can’t express the love I have for everyone and how much I want to see us flourish and prosper, and that love becomes heavy once we realize what’s coming. Though my experience is different than yours, it has taught me what’s important…us. The things that we have prioritized over each other have only hurt us. When was the last time someone asked you how your day was? When was the last time you called your family to say you love them? When was the last time you really felt comfortable and at peace? I’m here to tell you from personal experience that the solution isn’t external. Our spirit, which is a collective one, can only be fed with itself. We are all in this together regardless of what we choose to divide ourselves with, and everyone will feel the consequences that are going to compound unless more drastic action is taken. We can’t let the science that proves we need to take action fall to the wayside. If we don’t bring accountability to this world, no one will, and that is the truth. I love you all and hope my words have helped improve your day in someway, and I’m willing to share about my spiritual experiences, stories, thoughts, or just listen to anybody that wants. We need connection, and I offer myself to everyone as a start."

My name is Jon. I just turned 30, I’m a PhD student studying Counselor Education, six figures in student debt, and I’m a Licensed Professional Counselor Intern in the state of Texas. The reason I’m writing this article is because I’ve had spiritual experiences for the past decade that have helped guide me, which may also help provide insight to some things. I’ve been seeing strange lights and crafts in the sky for the past decade, with and without people and substances, and I finally learned what it all means. I’ve experienced more than I could mention in this article, and have learned and been shown more than many are comfortable with. My purpose for writing this article is to bring awareness into what I’ve been experiencing, and it is real regardless of the beliefs of those that will view this. I would also like to encourage other experiencers to come forward and create a conversation so that none of us feel alone.

I was raised Jewish and also have some American Indian ancestry, and I used to not think that these facts played a role in all of this. I’m a very spiritual person, and I’ve had to become one to survive what I’ve been through. I found solace in researching what I had seen and had an unquenchable desire to discover the truth. I had no idea at the time that truth was trying to show itself to me. In March of 2008 when this started, Ancient Aliens had just started on the History Channel (probably not so coincidentally). The ancient astronaut theory appealed to me and I began to wonder whether or not the light that guided Moses through the desert or the chariots of fire in the sky referenced in multiple cultures could be what I was seeing.

There’s a full write-up of my encounters on Reddit, but it wasn’t until this year that I had an encounter that gave confidence to the ancient astronaut theory. I met a girl near the beginning of 2018 that I instantly fell in love with, and we were almost inseparable. Since what I’ve seen is a part of my life, when it comes to romantic relationships it’s something I have to bring up at some point. She said that she wanted to see what I had been talking about and I informed her of the possibility that what I’ve seen could be responsible for us being here. At about 11:45 P.M. on the eve of Mother’s Day, we went east of Lubbock near McAdoo, TX where the windmills are. We pulled off into a field and leaned against the car facing south, and it was a beautiful night.

There was one light in the sky that didn’t look like the rest of the stars, and we were both fixated on it. It suddenly increased luminosity and started growing until it had this beautiful giant powder baby blue aura around it. Imagine holding a basketball out in front of your face. It looked like how the star over the manger had been depicted, and I also learned it bore an identical resemblance to the Blue Kachina of Hopi prophecy. The light started dimming down, and then I noticed a few large, fluffy looking lights southeast of us. They looked like big out-of-focus illuminated marshmallows, and it appeared as though there were three smaller lights breaking off, or “blossoming” from each large one.

Very slowly, the large lights hid within clouds and encircled us, and the large lights were equally spaced in front of the clouds, which were overcast outside the circle and the sky above us was completely clear. It appeared the smaller lights had arranged themselves into a grid, or dome-like pattern above us. It was like a cathedral of stars and remains the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. There was a bright light at the top center, maybe 1000 feet up, and when I nudged her to look up, it was like a wave started from the top center of the dome. The wave flowed like a burning leaf, and as the light passed each light in the grid, it refracted a fluorescent purple, almost like a peacock feather. The wave reached the clouds and the large lights hidden within them faded, and the smaller lights drifted outward like jellyfish and disappeared.

I look around and notice a light in the field we were standing a few hundred yards to the east of us. It was glowing LED white, looked to be 10-12 feet tall, and was in the shape of a pinecone that was skinny side up. To be honest, someone in Biblical times might’ve described it as a burning bush. We asked each other if it had been there before, and agreed it hadn’t. After 30 or so seconds looking at it, it began to rise slowly and then at about 20-30 feet off the ground, it came straight for us, fast. She couldn’t handle it and had her face in her hands crying, saying she wanted to go home but doesn’t remember any of it. I felt the need to make her feel safe so we got in the car and headed for the main road. There was more that happened that night but it isn’t incredibly prudent to include.

The morning of Mother’s Day after the encounter, I couldn’t sleep and she had to. I had recently learned that the crafts from my first two encounters flew towards the Moundville Mounds in Moundville, AL after they flew over me in 2008 and the connection was fresh in my mind. I was gifted a couple hundred books by a regular at the restaurant where I waited tables before I moved to Lubbock, and I never read one. I had been at the same house for five years and just so happened to stock a particular book on the shelf where I would see it. It’s called “Black Elk Speaks”, and it’s a dictation of Black Elk’s (an Oglala Sioux/Lakota) story. He was a medicine man that claimed he had an important message for the world. It was about 6:45 A.M., the golden hour, and I decided to tuck it under my arm while I walked my roommate’s boxer to clear my head.

I liked to walk Tyson without the leash because he listened at crosswalks, and we saw some strange things happen with nature. There was a coffee shop five blocks from the house that opened at eight, and I decided we’d go to the park a couple of blocks away to wait. We get a block from the coffee shop and there were two trees in front of this house full of dove. Right as we were about to cross, the doves start crying, shrieking. We look over and out from behind that house slinks a grey fox with a dead black kitten in its mouth. We watched as this fox made its way to our side of the street trotting with pride, got within 20 feet of us with Tyson off the least, and acted like we weren’t even there. The whole reason I went to college was so I could create positive systemic change, particularly in the prison industry, and I saw parallels of predation in that metaphor. I ponder the whole way to the park and sit down to open Black Elk Speaks, and to my amazement I find everything I had seen for the past 10 years contained within it.

Black Elk knew that if he had been honest in 1930 about the connection that all tribes have, the connection that I have, it would’ve been rejected. He had to play to how he knew the public needed to perceive him, so he disguised his experience in metaphor and spiritual language. I immediately knew that Black Elk’s description of the horses in the sky taking their stables was what I had seen. I was shook, and I felt I had to talk about it. I made many calls and emails to a few Cherokee people in Oklahoma because that’s the tribe I’ve been told my ancestry stems from. My girlfriend and I go to Tahlequah a couple of days after Mother’s Day and had a meeting with a few people. I won’t discuss what was said, but it is true that almost every American Indian tribe believes their creators came from the stars. What I now know is that Black Elk Speaks is a spiritual breadcrumb trail that’s been left for all of us.

I’ve sought closure about what I’ve seen since it started, and my mother has shared encounters but my father was under the impression this has all been something mental. A couple of hours after our meeting, two crafts flew by during the daytime in Tahlequah. They looked like hard-boiled eggs cut in half and smoothed on the bottom, and after they left I got excited and called my father. I thought I had illustrated the connection since they showed up in front of the whole town. My father showed up to Lubbock a couple of days later, but before he did some strange things happened. My girlfriend at the time didn’t remember crying the morning of Mother’s Day, and she doesn’t remember this. We were sitting on my couch and I was pretty spiritually elevated. Her tone changed to a really soft and engaging one, and she leaned in and told me that she was Mother Nature, and that I was the king of Israel. I was a little shocked and didn’t say anything, and then she asked me to come outside with her. It was nighttime and we sat on my front porch, and she told me she could make lightning bugs dance while she hummed a song, and she showed me. If what she told me was true, it would make sense why my life has been such a series of close calls and coincidences.

The next morning, my father showed up and I agreed to go into a psych ward at Covenant Hospital (go figure) for him. I knew what I had seen was true, but that didn’t make it any less difficult to deal with. I openly shared about what I had seen and my father was insistent I go to another facility in Houston for six weeks, supposedly one of the best. I’m named after a book called “Jonathan Livingston Seagull”, and there was a copy on the bookshelf, an old one. The only other time I had seen this same print was at my grandparent’s house, and it was my father’s copy. I open it and find an excerpt written inside that reads “Jonathan Seagull was born to be an instructor, and his way of demonstrating love was to show something of the truth to a gull who only asked to see something of the truth for himself…thank you for that, Merry Christmas”.

My name is Jonathan William Buchalter. Jonathan means, “Name given by God”, William in German means “fierce protector”, and Buchalter in German means “bookkeeper” or “accountant”. The fact that I’m named after a book that deals with spiritual ascension and teaching others and have found multiple books that have led me to this really doesn’t seem like a mistake. I feel that it’s possible that the collective creative will of humanity potentially puts some of us here to help us understand how things work. That may sound like a broad claim, but there’s plenty that I haven’t shared that backs it up.

I went with the motions trying to rebuild my foundation and eventually ended up back in Dallas, where I was born. On November 5th, I met a guy that I became quick friends with that told me I should come to Sedona, Arizona because there’s people like me there. We stayed with his father and my buddy took off after a couple of days but his father let me stay for two weeks. I met two healers in Sedona, one of whom has the same connection I do, just a couple decades further along. I also learned that the Hopi have a prophecy called the True White Brother who is accompanied by two knowledgeable aides, which I found interesting. I was supposed to start a new job November 26th that got pushed back to December 10th, so I chose to investigate what I should use that time for. I decided that I should go visit South Dakota, per the advice of a Lakota elder I received a while back.

I made an account on couchsurfing.com and only reached out to stay with one person, and they accepted. They just so happened to be the great-grandchild of Old Hollow Horn who rescued Black Elk when he was injured during the Wounded Knee Massacre, which still blows my mind. I sought and found spiritual guidance that led me to many realizations, and so much of how this has all come together illustrates how creative intelligence can work. It’s pretty amazing how alike the Lakota and Buddhists are in their belief systems, and I’ve done a lot of research that indicates “star people” are considered spiritual guides in many cultures around the world. So why are so many people afraid of these beings?

Fear has always been an effective strategy for excluding what’s new, but I hate to break it to you, this isn’t new. If we’d each do our own research we’d find instances of visitation throughout history. Since the 1970s, there’s been a warming up to the idea of disclosure, and many creative minds have exhausted themselves producing the best representations of a universal spiritual connection to this force, but why did they do it? Is it possible Spielberg is a contactee like me and has been channeling? Was “Arrival” by Denis Villeneuve a subconscious precursor to disclosure? This certainly seems to have been a gradual process, and the public has gravitated to the idea of it. When we collect spiritual belief systems from different cultures, they all start to paint a picture that suggests I may be right.

The Lakota have a phrase “Mikatuye Oyasin”, which basically means, “We are all relatives”. Their philosophy talks about how everything is one, and everything tries to be whole and find balance. In nature, round is everywhere, which provides interesting insight into how everything we build is square and rigid. It’s as if the society we’ve created has become unnatural and is working against us. I’d encourage people to research what percentage of the population were farmers or producers before the industrial revolution. I don’t think we were meant to spend most of the daylight hours of every week doing work that advances our material agendas and ruins our bodies from sitting. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that it is very difficult to find spiritual people in high places of business, and I have met more happy homeless people than happy millionaires. I have a lot of theories and other knowledge about what I’ve seen that I won’t get into because there’s something more important I need to say.

Of all of the research I’ve done, perhaps one excerpt from the Bible can help you understand what I’ve learned. In John 10:34, Jesus said “Is it not written in your law? I said, ye are Gods”. I learned that what I’ve been seeing are the thunder beings of American Indian lore, and they’re likely what put us here. They can act as spiritual guides and assist medicine men in acting as conduits of the creative energy that comprises all things to heal. There are people today around the world capable of doing what Jesus did. I would encourage everyone to do his or her own research before dismissing what I’m saying. What I now know is that if we are all fragments of that same creational intelligence, then we are basically it, and so is everything. That would also mean that it’s us in the driver’s seat and not some all-knowing man in the clouds, but we can still seek and be guided by that creative intelligence itself.

Of all of the research I’ve done, perhaps one excerpt from the Bible can help you understand what I’ve learned. In John 10:34, Jesus said “Is it not written in your law? I said, ye are Gods”. I learned that what I’ve been seeing are the thunder beings of American Indian lore, and they’re likely what put us here. They can act as spiritual guides and assist medicine men in acting as conduits of the creative energy that comprises all things to heal. There are people today around the world capable of doing what Jesus did. I would encourage everyone to do his or her own research before dismissing what I’m saying. What I now know is that if we are all fragments of that same creational intelligence, then we are basically it, and so is everything. That would also mean that it’s us in the driver’s seat and not some all-knowing man in the clouds, but we can still seek and be guided by that creative intelligence itself. Once we understand our own divinity and develop ourselves spiritually, the external fixes we medicate with to make ourselves feel better are no longer needed. We become empowered, conscious, and realize we are masters of our own destiny.

After traveling the country seeking guidance and meeting many amazing people, I took a step back and looked at society. So much of what we do is aimed at achieving security while not pursuing freedom, and we don’t understand how much that contributes to our mental state. I see people burdened by life’s problems without the means or willingness to speak up and change it. A lot of people almost have this resigned, powerless demeanor with how they view the world, but most of us want to improve it. I also understand that everything that I’m saying can come with societal consequences, but I’ve put up with worse than y’all can throw at me for the past decade, and this is too important to stay silent. People are afraid to use their voice because they don’t want to threaten their livelihood, and that shouldn’t have to be a choice. I know, as do many of you, that what is going on in the world today is not right, and we are encountering difficulty preparing for the consequences that are coming while still contributing to what’s going to cause it.

Words can’t express the love I have for everyone and how much I want to see us flourish and prosper, and that love becomes heavy once we realize what’s coming. Though my experience is different than yours, it has taught me what’s important…us. The things that we have prioritized over each other have only hurt us. When was the last time someone asked you how your day was? When was the last time you called your family to say you love them? When was the last time you really felt comfortable and at peace? I’m here to tell you from personal experience that the solution isn’t external. Our spirit, which is a collective one, can only be fed with itself. We are all in this together regardless of what we choose to divide ourselves with, and everyone will feel the consequences that are going to compound unless more drastic action is taken. We can’t let the science that proves we need to take action fall to the wayside. If we don’t bring accountability to this world, no one will, and that is the truth. I love you all and hope my words have helped improve your day in someway, and I’m willing to share about my spiritual experiences, stories, thoughts, or just listen to anybody that wants. We need connection, and I offer myself to everyone as a start."

1. What is the best way to apply?  In person?  Online?  Referral?
2. How much about the technical aspect of Apple products are you expected to know beforehand?
3. Will my background in computer engineering and a few software-related internships help?
4. I saw in other posts that it is extremely rare that people are hired straight into the Genius position, most Geniuses are promoted from other internal positions.  To what extent is this true?
5. What does the hiring process look like?  What should I do to maximize my chances?

I kept myself busy. With three more quarters left to go and my preceptors at my internship telling me to work for them as a paralegal after college, my professional/academic life was going good.

My plans were to work for two years, study for the LSAT and get into a really good law school.

Things with Mama Xochi and Santa Muerte were slowly being patched up.

Mama Xochi had took my distance the hardest. She was a little meaner than usual but she still cooked me my favorite foods whenever I would go visit her.

La Santa Muerte, although terrifying and seemingly the one who would take the longest to forgive me, actually was the one who pushed me to talk to Mama Xochi. She welcomed me back with open arms.

Life was normal. I was hanging with my sorority sisters again. Mama Xochi and I were began opening up to each other. *La Santa Muerte* made sure my powers as a *bruja* came through. In fact, I was becoming pretty strong. Almost as strong as Mama Xochi.

Per usual, shit hit the fan.

You ever heard of Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of war?

He’s a tricky ass motherfucker.

There was a legend where he led the Aztec people to Culhuacan, a city. Huitzilopochtl proposed to the king, Achitometl, that he would marry his daughter so she could be become a goddess.

That shit didn’t happen. Instead, Huitzilopochtl brutally murdered her, and had his priest rock her skin. Achitometl came over, hoping to see his beautiful daughter in the traditional wedding wear.

Instead, he saw his daughter’s skin literally chilling on Huitzilopochtl’s priest. In a rage, he ordered his troops to attack the Aztec people and Huitzilopochtl.

They got away.

Huitzilopochtli did a lot of other bullshit too.

This dude loved war so much, he got Malinche, an enslaved indigenous woman, to lead the Spanish against the Aztecs. He was hoping the Aztecs would get into a war and win.

Well…

Tencochitlan was no more. It became Mexico.

\~

I came across him one night, as I finished up my intern shift at the law center in downtown LA.

I felt the energy in the air become an uncomfortable hot.

A heavy hand clapped my shoulder.

“Esperanza.” whispered a deep, husky voice.

I slowly turned around, trying to calm the rising anxiety in my heart.

A man with wild curly hair and blazing violet eyes stared back at me. His beard was also wild and nearly grazed the ground. Oddly, he was dressed in a neat pinstripe suit.

“Who are you?” I hissed, rising to my feet. My eyes turned black as I glared at him. “You had no fucking right to touch me either.”

He stepped back, chuckling a bit.

“*Mija*, *tu eres muy poderosa.*” He commented, grinning at me. “I am an old friend of your Mama Xochi and La Santa Muerte.”

“They never talked about you.” I shot back.

“*Pues*, we had a history. *Pero*, that’s in the past. *Mija,* I wanted to talk to you because you are powerful. I look at you and see great potential. I know you have been hurt in the past. You have already been through so much and I can’t imagine your pain.”

He reached for my hand but I slapped it away. “I told you to not fucking touch me.”

The man laughed, causing my skin to crawl. “Trust me *mija.* Meet with me later. I can help you uncover your history and who you truly are.”

He disappeared, his energy leaving with him.

I sat back down on my desk, wondering what he meant.

*Esperanza, mi querida.*

Looking up, I saw *La Santa Muerte.* Her tone seemed worried. It was very off putting.

Grabbing her hand, I looked at her. “*Que tienes mi Santisma Muerte?”*

She shook her head. *He has found us. I can’t believe it.*

""Who was he?”

Sighing audibly, her expression hardened. *Mi hermano, Huitzilopochtli.*

""Why does he want me?” I asked, sitting back down.

*Mama Xochi was his priestess.*

My jaw dropped.

*She was one of the most powerful venerators to the old gods. But Huitzilopochtli LOVED her. She helped him bring destruction to Mexico, under the premises that doing so, it would get rid of the violence and poverty that ravaged it. She believed in a better Mexico.* 

*Yet she finally saw through Huitzilopochtli's plans and began helping the women and children that were living in the violence that she helped bring.*

*Huitzilopochtli professed his love to her. But she rejected him.* 

*Her heart belonged to your Papa Jose. He was a good man. A curandero with an open heart.*

*After the 10th failed attempt to win over your Mama Xochi, Huitzilopochtli killed your Papa Jose.*

*She turned to me, begging me to hide her from him. I also had to hide myself because he could trace me.*

*And that’s how she got here. En Los Angeles.*

*Your father was also meant to be a curandero. A powerful one too. But the death of his father left him angry and bitter. Also, you know life is hard here when you come from nothing.*

*Mama Xochi hoped to never have a female in the family again.*

*But then you came again. And you were a special one.*

*You see.. You died when you were born.*

I gasped. “What the fuck… So am I some sort of zombie o *que?”*

*No mija. Tu mama did not have eccamplsia. That’s what the doctors told your mama’s family.*

*In fact, tu mama gave up her life to have you. When the doctors were trying to resuscitate you, she prayed to me. She told me what was the point of being alive, if you weren’t here.*

*Again, I gave her a choice. To live and be without you. Or to die and have you live.*

*Tu mama loved you so much already, that she gave her life up.*

*In doing so, you became powerful. All of the old gods, excluding Huitzilopochtli and* T*ezcatlipoca, gave a part of themselves to you.*

*You are still human, yes. But you have the ability to do things that no other human can do. Including your Mama Xochi.*

*I have no idea how Huitzilopochtli found you. Perhaps it was* *Tezcatlipoca, as I stupidly confided in him.*

I looked at her.

“I think I’m gonna need some time to myself.” I said.

Immediately, my phone rang.

*La Santa Muerte* nodded at me.

“Hello?” I answered, not sure who would be calling me.

“Hi Esperanza?” asked a voice.

“Yes…?”

“This is \_\_\_\_\_ from White Memorial Hospital. Your grandmother, Xochiltl is here with us. Please come to the hospital as quickly as you can.”"

First off Id just like to give you a break down of what I would like to talk about

1. Light background on myself
2. Some of the things my father does
3. Is there a chance he is bipolar/why I think he may be
4. What to do about it

So lets jump right into it:

1. I think Im a pretty decent individual, good person, clean record, Im decently intelligent, went to a good university for engineering, went to a decent medical school (after 2 years I decided it wasnt for me), and now Im back in engineering for my masters degree. Ive had a mildly hard life, and in that I mean in the best occasions Ive had the carpet pulled under my feet. Examples would be like my mother passing away the week of my crucial finals the days I had to apply to medical school or literally the final day of a job interview round #7 (computer science) I get massively sick from something and lose the offer.
2. Ever since Ive grown as a child Ive found my father to be a really angry individual. I come from an intelligent family of engineers and doctors (hes an engineer). He would beat me ages 3-15 for the littlest things such as getting an answer wrong on a homework assignment in math.

He was pretty terrible to my biological mother as well, hes always been a mess in the house, papers literally scattered everywhere, dirty laundry everywhere, lazy as hell. My mom would ask him to do light things like clean up the papers or not throw his dirty socks on the floor and he would go on a rant and just cuss out every detail about a person. **KEY ISSUE #1, when hes angry at anyone or anything he will just go out of his way to insult every aspect of someone.** If someone is arguing about a random political topic, say taxes, he will start calling the person ugly, mother fucker, bring up random failures in their life such as a board exam (GRE/MCAT ) they failed years ago, or one job offer they lost a decade ago, bring up their parents if their parents are slightly slow in the brain, etc

So now fast forward to this year 2018 when things have been getting really bad. I came home from medical school started my degree in comp sci, staying at home, im actively applying to jobs, and getting quite a bit of interviews, but these things take time.

My dad will come home from work at flip out at the randomest things. (My girlfriend moved in this summer, she works 60 hours a week as a nursing assistant and goes to school). A few days ago he flipped out about her throwing a plastic cupcake box in the garbage can, said she shouldve thrown it in the recycle. I told him its not meant to be recycled, and it fits in the can perfectly, and he went on a rant (Key Issue #1), how I failed an exam 5 years ago , about how am I a loser sitting at home cant get a job (I already have offers starting in summer), about how my girlfriend is stupid.

Another day he comes home and starts screaming and yelling about our home temple's closet doors being open (we are a hindu family), and why I havent closed them. Im not religious and for the past 23 years of my life they have always been open. I told him thats how its always been and he can close them after praying if it bothers him. Again he goes on rant issue again

An external example was for a company I applied to Stryker. Basically I applied to two roles, one I got rejected from immediately, and I mentioned it and he started talking about how its a terrible company filled with losers etc etc and I wouldnt want to work there anyway. the second role, I went through 5 rounds of interviews and lost to someone with 3 years of experience for an internship (lol). Today he comes home during lunch and starts flipping out about the dryer being done and why the clothes havent been removed yet. The dryer LITERALLY just stopped SECONDS ago.

I had a shirt I interviewed with hanging on our clothes rack in the laundry room for 2 days. He starts yelling in the middle of the weekend morning when Im doing chores that its been hanging there for a month. I said thats not possible because I just had my interview the day before yesterday.

He got remarried in July, to a woman (who unfortunately suffered abuse in her previous marriage which ended 30 years ago). And he will flip out at her for no reason also. Example being when she moved in to our house, we had a trolly (think of the one ups guys use to move boxes), and she started moving it, and one box fell which had our takeout lunch in it, because my dad didnt strap it down. He started cursing her out for everything, saying shes stupid, has too many shoes in her closet, just the randomest shit ever.

My dad is really lazy when it comes to walking our dog. When he takes her out its pretty common for her to consume something she shouldnt, get a tummy ache and suffer for a day or two. When I walk her, I have a firm grip so she doesnt have a chance. One day, I take her for a walk, NOTHING bad happens, she comes home has a tummy ache. He is cursing me out for everything for days as usual, and I find out he was the one who fed her bread with garlic in it in the afternoon before the walk... (dogs should not eat garlic )

**Key Issue # 2** Now heres the caveat, within the matter of HOURS, sometimes minutes, his attitude flips like nothing happened. He starts acting super friendly, and some how he has managed to work himself into a well paying job, and he will splurge money on us. He will tell me not to be silly when I ask permission to buy something expensive(300 dollar vaccum etc) - Which goes to my last point.

When I left medical school this year I had a 7.99 charge on my credit card from United. He filed a fraud charge on my behalf, let me know about it, I Said dad dont do that, that was my food bill on the airplane. (He is mad because hes in the wrong here). He starts bitching about how I shouldve ate food at the airport . I calmly explained food is more expensive there, a sandwich can and does cost 13-15 dollars in some airports, and water is insanely expensive. Then he starts accusing me on using it for entertainment (tv) for a 6 hour flight.

3. My analysis is that his mood flips. He gets mad over nothing. When he finds out hes wrong he starts attacking anything he can grab at, even if it makes no sense. Then his attitude flips and becomes the ""nicest person on earth""

4. Im not sure what to do, hes pretty unwilling to even accept he has anger issues. He blames me for my mom's cancer (and death) saying that I was such a stressful child to look after. ( I wasnt, I was a pretty regular, healthy, happy 4.0 student throughout highschool, didnt have any demands, my mom just had a habit of quizzing me on on my classes to make sure I was actually learning), and says that caused the cancer.

Im a pretty resilient person but seeing hes unwilling to get medical treatment, my only option is out. And im doing the best I can there, literally the best I can, applying to everything and everywhere I can."

a45fdj,7,2018-12-07,Some Thoughts on BYU's Counseling Center,Grief_Rage,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/a45fdj/some_thoughts_on_byus_counseling_center/,"First off, this post is lengthy, north of 1,400 words.  Secondly, this is a throwaway account for purposes of anonymity, but I will respond to questions if anyone were to pose any. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am struck with a mixture of grief and rage:  grief in the preventable loss of a human life, rage in that authorities at BYU may bear some responsibility in it.  I have been up close at three different Colleges/Universities where the Counseling Services on campus have been completely overwhelmed by incoming cases, in both outright need and in the severity of individual cases.  To anyone who may read this, I want to provide some background into how a Counseling Center might work. 

&amp;#x200B;

IACS, the International Association of Counseling Services, accredits College/University Counseling Centers.  This accreditation is not absolutely necessary, but if a particular center is not accredited, it is:  very new, at a very small college, or something is seriously wrong.  Their guidelines call for one full-time Counselor for every 1,000 to 1,500 students.  This Counselor is to be licensed to practice in their State, or in the final stages of attaining licensure.  Looking up BYU's Wikipedia page, I rounded up the student count to 34,000.  That means there should be between 22 and 34 full-time Counselors.  The letter that Dr. Steve Smith posted on the front page of the center's website says that there are 29 full-time staff, meaning that there is a Counselor for roughly 1,172 students – well within the guidelines.  This is actually far better than other, equally sized Universities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not every student that walks into a Counseling Center will become a client.  After an initial triage session or some other assessment procedure, the student may be referred off-campus for therapy.  This is usually done if the student is presenting concerns that do not fit the particular experiences or qualifications of the staff, is presenting with a complex set of problems that will require long-term therapy, or if the triage staff believe that more than X number of sessions will be necessary to accomplish what the student needs.  If the student is not going to be referred off-campus, they will probably be put on a wait-list, where their position on the list will be based on type and severity of presenting concerns.  Once the student is actually called and scheduled for sessions, they will generally be given a maximum number of sessions – the aforementioned X.  There is a broad range for X.  I know that some schools in the University of California system have it set at 3, other schools I know of have it set at 12.  From what I have read of what happens at other schools, the number of sessions tends to decrease with student population size.

 

A full-time staff member at a counseling center is running at full-tilt if they engage in 5-6 hours of direct contact hours in a given day.  This can be individual therapy, couples counseling, group therapy sessions, or engagement with an outreach activity.  The rest of the time is taken up with meetings, paperwork completion time, and supervision of unlicensed Counselors (these can be anything from Post-Doctoral Fellows all the way down to second or third year practicum students).  Meetings are meetings, of varying amounts of organizational importance.  Supervision is a crucial activity, both for the person being supervised, and for that person's clients.  Paperwork time is also crucial, the current legal and ethical environment makes it so – detailed notes tend to be required if a person is admitted to a hospital.  In some instances, failure to keep accurate and detailed notes have resulted in a loss of liability insurance coverage for some therapists.   
  

I tend to think in terms of numbers and scenarios, so I ran some numbers on what may be happening at BYU.  Given what is happening at other Colleges and Universities across the United States, regardless of size and whether private or state-supported, 12-15% of the student body will go in for counseling services in a given semester.  I came up with two scenarios, Best Case (Least Overwhelmed) and Worst Case (Most Overwhelmed):   
  

Best Case:  12% of the student body goes in for therapy in a given semester (4,080 students), and none are referred out.  They are each allotted 3 sessions (the X from before), there are a total of 95 session days possible in a given semester, there are 29 full-time staff.  That results in 12,240 sessions for the semester, roughly 129 sessions per day, which makes for roughly 4.4 sessions per day per staff member.   This number is less than the 5-6 hours of direct contact time that I suggested before, so I would say that this is not even remotely overwhelming.   
  

Worst Case:  15% of the student body goes in for therapy (5,100 students), and none are referred out.  Their session allotment is 12, and the same 95 days and 29 full-time staff are available.  This results in 61,200 sessions for the semester, roughly 645 sessions per day, which makes for roughly 22.21 sessions per staff member per day.  Considering there are only 24 hours in a day, this situation is impossible – but the center has non-licensed Counselors (the aforementioned Post-Doctoral Fellows all the way down to second or third year practicum students).  To get that astronomical 22.21 sessions/staff/day down to 8 (the number of hours in a normal working day), it would require 81 full-time equivalent staff (highly unlikely for BYU to have that many).  To get it down to less than 5 sessions/staff/day, the center would need 129 full-time equivalent staff (utter impossibility).  Odds are, this worst case scenario is not happening.   
  

What is most likely is that somewhere around 15% of the student body will seek therapy in a given semester.  If they are being seen once a month, they will probably be given between 4 and 6 individual sessions – it is possible, though unlikely, that a student could be in individual, couples, and group therapy all at the same time.  I do not know this number, but I imagine there could be as many as 58 Counselors at the BYU Counseling Center.  I arrive at this because BYU has PhD programs in both Clinical and Counseling Psychology, is an accredited internship site, and Universities of this size and type tend to have a number of trainees on staff equal to 50-100% of the number of full-time, licensed (or nearly licensed) staff.  Not all of these trainees will be full-time (Post-Doctoral Fellows and Interns are, but graduate assistants and practicum students may only work 10-20 hours a week).  58 is probably then the upper number of total therapists, but a range of 43-50 is likely. 

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me to think that something truly awful is happening at BYU, something morally worse than the Worst Case Scenario.  One of these things, or some combination thereof, is happening:   


An absolutely gargantuan number of students are seeking therapy, somewhere north of a third of the student body in a given semester. 

The center is giving students a fairly large number of total individual sessions, somewhere in the neighborhood of 8-10. 

The Counselors (especially the full-time ones), are using a distinct minority of their time towards direct contact hours 	(please, please tell me that this isn't happening).    
    


Given my experience, #2 is likely (though still improbable), #1 is unlikely (though I wouldn't be completely shocked if 20% of the student body sought therapy in a given semester), but #3 is most likely.  Unless a student's presenting concerns are truly low-tier (which should qualify them for weekly group therapy), being seen only once a month in an individual session is a travesty and you are practically begging for situations such as this.   
  

Also, in my experience, I have had a number of friends outside the field of mental health and education say that these students are all just a bunch of snowflakes, need to grow up, etc.  Maybe, but then I would point the finger at them for putting today's young adults in such a state.  But then again, if someone has reached the point that they think that the only way through the pain is to end it all, then something needs to be done for them, even if you think they're a snowflake.  If human life is precious, and has any meaning to it at all, then we have an individual duty to help alleviate, or at least not add to, another person's suffering.  This is the grief and rage that I feel. "

It was a great opportunity and I had a good relationship with the youth pastor.

Eventually, the youth pastor left, and I was getting married at the same time. I thought that this was a great time to bow out, since I would have more responsibilities at home and at work.

All of a sudden, people began congratulating me, since they had heard ""through the grapevine"" that I was being named the new youth pastor.  This was quite a shock to me, since I had never even discussed it with the senior pastor at all.  

With even more heartbreak, I discovered that many members of the youth had heard this and they were looking forward to it.  I had to tell them that nothing had been decided yet and that I hadn't discussed it with anyone, so it was just a rumor going around.

Then, to top it all off, the pastor announced from the pulpit that I would be taking over as youth pastor to much applause.  The few parents and youth I had already talked to looked very confused.

I finally met with the senior pastor.  I told him that I had decided this was a good time for new leadership and that I was going to be busy with my new life and I wanted to take a year off from ministry to ensure I had enough time for my wife.

He then said something I'll never forget.  In the most manipulative way possible, he said, ""Well, you'll really be disappointing those parents and kids.""  In a moment I knew exactly where all the rumors had come from.  It was his way of manipulating me into taking the job!  Otherwise, I would be letting everyone down by breaking his promises.

I have to admit, for a moment I considered breaking all my plans in order not to cause anyone heartbreak.  I knew I could do the job, but if God hadn't called me to it, would he be with me in it?

At that point, I decided that I couldn't take a position I didn't feel called to it, and if God was in me not taking it, he would provide very well in my absence.

Fortunately for me, there was an all-church function that next Sunday evening, so I made my way around to everyone and explained that I had never ""accepted"" the position and that I had only just had a meeting with the pastor for the first time a couple days ago.  Yeah, he might have been exposed as a liar at that point, which wasn't my intention (because even David didn't attack Saul as he was the ""Lord's anointed""), but oh well, I have to tell the truth.

God did provide very well.  The new youth pastor was one from a sister church that the group had done a lot with.  I respected the guy very much, and he brought along a few of his former youth members (now young adults) as assistants.

The new youth pastor did ask me to come and speak once as a special guest, which was nice and it looked like everything worked out in the end.

I went on to do 5 more years of youth ministry after this, but ultimately went into software engineering while still doing quite a bit of ministry on the side.

I know this is a minor one, but it really shocked young me as to how callously manipulative a pastor could be."

I started smoking every day at 16 and continued this until sophomore year of university. I defined myself with weed, loved getting high and listening to music, and couldn’t imagine a life without Mary Jane. December of last year I realized weed was clouding my brain, fucking up my reward system, shutting me off socially from non-stoners, souring relations with my parents, enabling a non-growth and comfort oriented mindset, and adversely affecting my health. I was still a bright student but I knew I wasn’t  fulfilling my total potential and this made me sad. With a tough semester in the spring, I decided that my last smoke session would be during winter break and I would not smoke the whole next semester. For me, this was a huge ambitious and terrifying goal, but I knew I could and should do it. 

First month sucked and rocked. It was hard to fall asleep but once I started taking .4 mg melatonin (still do this btw, helps a lot) ever night, the dreams were incredible vivid and a great reward (albeit scary at times). Sleep was suddenly something that rejuvenated me and I woke up feeling energized not drained. Immediately felt much more clear headed, confident, and empowered. However, I lost many of my friends from my former life which was difficult. Also I had no idea how to reward myself without weed which I still struggle with. 

Second month-end of semester was a grind. I gave 100% effort for all my classes, resulting in friendships with my professors and a 4.0 GPA in hard classes...very very proud. I started meditating 20 mins every day which was a great replacement for the sublime feelings weed gave me. I also started using my newfound clearheadedness and motivation to fill my brain with information by watching about two hours of documentaries a day (s/o to Vice documentaries on Netflix). I had a medium dosage of magic mushrooms at the end of the semester which gave me perspective on everything and made me realize I wanted to continue the progress...I committed to two more semesters of no weed. 

Summer: interned for 3 months in China where weed is illegal as fuck so didn’t have much temptation, although I could have bought some at one instance, I decided not to because I didn’t want to break my streak. Was very bad about alcohol though and drank heavily many dad of the week. Decided to give up alcohol too upon return to the USA. 

Return to USA: changed my major from finance to international business and committed to myself that I am moving abroad after graduation. Took more ownership over my education and continued with good academic habits such as befriending professors, doing all reading, treating every assignment and test with respect, etc. I took 2 tabs of LSD at the beginning of the semester when I started craving weed and this made me realize the good thing I had going and killed my desire to smoke. Finished the semester yesterday and I got another 4.0. Haven’t drank a sip of alcohol since the summer (~4 months). 

Now/struggles: I am done with the semester and have been killing it. I have a month break with nothing to do (except find a summer internship) and no supervision. The urge to smoke weed is overpowering, but I will not give in. I will reach one year and I will not stop there. 

Thoughts:
Melatonin helps for sleep but only take half a 1 mg tablet every night (any more is too much)

Dreams are a big motivator for me to stay sober because they are so interesting and realistic

Get rid of your paraphernalia if you’re serious about quitting

Browse r/leaves often, it helps a TON

A psychedelic trip after a few months of sobriety can enable you to find motivation to stay sober if you are careful and go in it with the right intentions (but be careful, these are extremely powerful substances)

Meditation, ecstatic dance, spiritual books have helped me a lot

I still listen to “stoner” music like the Grateful Dead every day and I appreciate it more now that I’m sober 

Former stoners have immense potential and make up some of the most successful entrepreneurs and thinkers 

If you can’t see your life without weed, maybe you should think about quitting 

Feel free to PM me if you think your situation sounds like mine and need someone to talk to :P"

a48unu,3,2018-12-08,Ponytail Problems,onepokadot,Workplaceconfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workplaceconfessions/comments/a48unu/ponytail_problems/,"Hello! I am a HR intern at a small facility. My Boss hired me with no experience managing a direct report. She hired me because I have a BA in HR (She was not trained in hr formally). She previously asked me to not wear my hair up in a ponytail saying that it made me look young and unkempt. She told me that no one would want to come to me for anything because I looked young. While I was a little upset, because I hate wearing my hair down, I complied, no biggy. 

Now, a few months later today she stopped to tell me that my hair was oily the day before. She asked me if I had a medical condition. Then she said that I sometimes had an odor (which I don't. I wash regularly and in addition I have NEVER been told that I have an odor.) Really it seemed like she was trying to justify complaining about my hair again. Mind you I do not work with any customers and I  barely end up interacting with anyone other than her. 

To say the least she really hurt my feelings and now, a job I had previously enjoyed, I am dreading. 

Just to add in a little bit more info, my internship has been extended indefinitely because she needs the help and I have been very helpful. I am not eligible for benefits and I have been extremely accommodating with my schedule. I've been trying really hard to do an amazing job. I'm getting real tired of her micromanaging. She twists people's word around too and has a very negative outlook, constantly reminding me that whatever I do I have to be willing to prove I did xyz in front of a judge. 

I'm struggling though because I want to quit. I can't. I'm trying to make tuition payments for MBA classes I'm taking on the side. I'm applying for other places but the town I live in has slim pickings. 

Thanks for letting me vent. 

Any suggestions? "

I was a second year intern at the hospital you worked in, or basically ruled. You were one of the top surgeons in the world, you specialized in plastics and could make any scar disappear, not to mention you worked on a lot of very attractive women wanting breast or ass implants. You were quite attractive too, very tall and well cut, you had a square jaw and killer blue eyes. Your hair is a salt and pepper black, with a bit of stubble on your chin and upper lip. Girls went crazy for you, patients, nurses, doctors, and yes, even interns like me and my fellow interns. Your name was Mark, or Dr. Sloan, and as my second year of my internship began, you claimed me as yours, which most doctors did with their favourites, but I was nothing special, I just passed my first year. 

“Hello, Pet.” You smirked at me as we walked down the hall, and I held my clipboard against my chest, covered in my light blue scrubs. You had assigned me the nickname ‘Pet’ halloween of last year, when I showed up in a cat costume, with a collar and all. All of the interns dressed up, but the doctors found it hysterical and nicknamed all of us after our costumes, most called me ‘Kitty’, but you stuck to something more humiliating. We walked into your office and I stood at your desk. “To be honest, Pet, your stats last year where shit. I’m surprised you made it this far, and boy am I glad you did. You see, I’m going to teach you everything I know. Every cut, every stitch, every surgery, you’re going to be perfect, a ‘Mini-Sloan’ even, but you’re going to do something for me, in return.” I looked at you and nodded slowly.   
“Anything, Sir.” I begged, absolutely needing your offer, I would surely flunk the program without a good surgeons help, and you were better than good. 

My name is Lennon, but I usually go by Lennie. I am 20 year old, with long blonde hair and a nose piercing. I have a tattoo of a triangle on my left wrist, and below my belly button I had a tattoo that says‘SLUT’ in a pink fancy font. My breasts are 36C and I have a decent sized ass- not too big but not too small. I have bright blue eyes, thick eyelashes and a cocky smirk/smile. 

You will be playing Mark Sloan, a plastics surgeon who is rich and completely gorgeous. If you want a photo reference, please ask me and I’ll provide a link of the actor I’m thinking of, asides from that, play him however you want!   
Please start with what you expect of me to do for you, yes be as dirty as you want. 

I will NOT reply to anything but a response to my plot, and then I’ll create an OOC chat for us, if you’d like to get to know me more. If you need help coming up with a starter, just start telling me all of the rules you expect me to follow, how I should be behaving, what you have planned, whatever you want! x

Ironically it didn’t happen during any of the jumps, it happened a few strides later, she kind of popped up and I was caught off guard and was just launched.  It happened so fast I barely knew what was happening until I hit the ground.  Landed right on my hip on the left side.

So now I’m stuck in bed for a while then will be on crutches for about 3 months.  Probably can’t ride for a while after that then too, which honestly just sucks.  It was really my fault, it wasn’t a great ride to start and I wasn’t focussed, otherwise I probably would have sat through it if I was paying more attention.

I miss riding and being with the horses already.  I plan on watching other people’s lessons to keep learning as soon as I’m mobile enough.

I know it’s not the worst that could have happened, and I’m very thankful for no head injury (yay for my helmet),  but I just needed to rant because I’m feeling pretty crappy about it and the fractures are pretty painful.  Plus on top of all that I have to defer my final exams that were supposed to happen in the next two weeks for at least a month, and I’ll probably run into problems with the internship I am supposed to start in January.  Hopefully all turns out well though!

I have a few personal side projects (iOS and web apps) and regularly participate in hackathons.

I pretty much have the credits required to graduate with a CS degree as I have been taking mostly CS courses anyways. Only missing 313 at this point.

I tried to contact CS advising and Science advising but keep getting rerouted to different people. Obviously my grades aren't good enough to be admitted through the regular application. Am I just stuck in my current major? Is the CS department flexible at all in terms of admitting students with a lower GPA if they demonstrate ability outside the classroom?"

**How old are you?**

21

**Where are you from?**

Ireland

**What do you do IRL?**

I'm studying Game Development in University, but as soon as I'm finished I've got a job lined up as a software engineer for Amazon =D

**How much experience in gaming?**

I started gaming when I was around 11 after a friend introduced me to this magical device called an Xbox and we played Halo at his place for ages. I ended up getting my own and was hooked. I got the 360 when it came out and did pretty well online in Halo 3 and Reach. Fast forward a couple of years and another friend introduced me to Minecraft. I bought a middle end-ish PC to play that and eventually branched out into other games such as Left4Dead, Skyrim, Dark Souls, Fallout, and obviously, Planetside 2. Nowadays, I'm rocking a beast of a PC and play anything that catches my fancy really, but Planetside 2 remains as that one game that I just can't quit.

**Which outfit(s) did you join before?**

I joined BHO initially and learned a bit about team play, then realized that they were actually quite bad at it. After a while I left and joined MTCo (Great bunch of people!) and had some fun there for a few months, but eventually I had to leave because I was inactive for a while due to an internship. 

**Why do you want to join NCIv?**

Man, do I have fun in the few public squads you guys have open some days. It's so much fun being in a squad that actually knows what they're doing for a change and gets into epic fights. One of my favorite memories in PS2 was when I was in an NCIv squad and we were defending on a rooftop against a massive VS overpop with just our small squad. We lost the base but those last few minutes were just epic chaos! It was during that fight that I finally unlocked my GODSAW too! =D Also I feel like there's a certain prestige to NCIv members. I often see them at the top of the leaderboards and such in-game. I actually wanted to apply ages back, but I felt like I wasn't good enough so I said I'd come back and apply when I'm better. Nowadays I feel like I do pretty well, so I thought I'd give it a go!"

**Gender:** Female

**Age:** 26

**Birthday:** December 1

**Occupation:** Professional Hero, Head of Investigations at the Misty Mountains Hero Agency, Japanese History teacher and Occult Investigations Club Supervisor at Southern Osaka Academy

**Height:** 157cm (5'2'')

**Weight:** 45kg (101 lbs)

**Hair Color:** Light Blue

**Hair type/Haircut:** Shoulder length and wavy

**Facial Hair/Facial Hair Type:** N/A

**Facial Hair Color:** N/A

**Eye Color:** Violet

**Skin Color:** Slightly pale

**Blood type:** AB

**Hero Agency/Villain Team:** Misty Mountains (霧の山脈 - Kiri no sanmyaku) Hero Agency

**Attitude:** Mizuki is a peppy, optimistic, and bubbly individual. However, these characteristics cover a keen eye and incredibly intelligent mind. While she may seem air-headed on the surface, it's just due to her focus only being on more important tasks or her attention being focused elsewhere. She is very easy to get along with and provides a source of levity and cheer to most interactions. 

Mizuki is a skilled detective, having been a sidekick to the Pro Hero “Private Eye”. She prefers the investigative side of hero work and usually leaves the more action-centric side of hero-ing to the other associates of the Misty Mountains Hero Agency, when she can. While she doesn't enjoy combat, she is willing to fight when need be and will often try to end combat quickly through subduing techniques. 

While peppy and popular with people, she is a bit of a conspiracy theorist. She enjoys the idea of aliens, monsters, and ghosts, which can seem a bit odd to people when she gets fired up over the subject matter.

She is also skilled in many household tasks due to being raised in a single parent household with many siblings.

**School:** Graduate of the Southern Osaka Academy Hero Course 

**Year:** N/A

**Department:** N/A

**Class:** N/A

**Distinguishing Physical Features:** Blue hair, lighter skin, thin but athletic, average height. Somewhat baby-faced. Seen as a “ideal Japanese beauty” or Yamato nadeshiko (やまとなでしこ or 大和撫子)

**Hero or Villain:** Hero

**Hero/Villain Name:** The Glistening Detective Hero: Neptunia (ネプチューン探偵)

**Costume:** She wears an ornately designed, blue and white one-piece bathing suit made from a light, Kevlar material. Around her waist is a multi-compartment utility belt, which contains water bottles and her detective’s tools. Normally she wears a long, dark blue coat to cover herself, but during combat, it is quick discarded. Around her wrists are two golden bands, which match the golden necklace she wears. She does not wear shoes, allowing her additional surface area from which to sweat. 

**Gadgets/Tech/Weapons:** Around her belt, she carries several bottles of water, which she utilizes to re-hydrate quickly when need be. The bottles act as a small de-humidifier, which pulls moisture from the air, filters it, and stores it in the bottles. She carries several tools for investigating crime scenes with her detective skills. Finally, she carries a bottle of perfume.

**Name of their quirk:** Dancing Sweat (舞汗 Mai Ase)

**Quirk Type:** Emitter

**Quirk Range:** Mid-range

**Quirk Description:** Mizuki’s quirk allows her body to absorb water, which she can pull from the air or other water-based sources, and willfully extrude it as sweat, which she can then control for a variety of purposes.

**Miscellaneous Quirk Info:** Her Quirk is a fusion of her parent's quirks; Sweat Manipulation and Water Absorb. 

**Quirk Strengths:**

Mizuki is capable of absorbing water from nearly any source which contains it, though drinking it directly is the most efficient. Her skin is capable of both absorbing it and expelling it, allowing her to absorb or expel it from nearly any point on her body. Though, her hands and feet are the easiest for her to control.

She can finely control the water pressure of the sweat she generates, giving her the capability to creating high-powered, destructive blasts of water or trickling, light streams. Blades of water, high-powered cutting streams, or waterspouts used for fast movement are not outside of her capabilities. Even once her sweat is outside of her body, she can control it in a matter similar to telekinesis. She can even control it's state of matter, enabling her to change the sweat she extrudes from liquid (water), to gas (steam), to solid (ice).

**Quirk Weaknesses:**

Because her Quirk utilizes both an outside source of water and her own sweat, she needs to carefully regulate how much water she retains within her body, or she risks dehydrating herself. She is also incapable of controlling any other form of water, aside from her own sweat.

Dry conditions can hinder her ability to pull moisture from the air, which hinders her abilities. Conversely, humid conditions make it easier.

As a side affect, the more rigorous the exercise, the worse her extruded sweat can smell, which can be off-putting and embarrassing. 

**Special Moves:**

*Steam Escape:* Extruding sweat from piece of open skin on her body, she quickly changes the sweat from liquid to gas, creating a smokescreen-like cloud of steam.

*Sweat Spout:* sprays sweat from the bottom of her feet, and then manipulates it into a tornado-like spout of water. This can be used for quick movement or launching herself into the air.

*Icicle Armor:* Mizuki freezes her sweat in order to create an armor of ice on key points of her body. A trade-off, unfortunately, is the areas covered in ice cannot produce sweat, so she needs to be careful. 

*Icicle Blade:* Mizuki creates a weapon of ice, usually a sword or dagger.

*Ice Prison:* Utilizing a large swath of controlled sweat, she covers a target with water and then quickly freezes them in place.

a4byvi,533,2018-12-08,My [23F] boyfriend [23FTM] dropped me off at a mall after a fight he had with his family,ghujh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a4byvi/my_23f_boyfriend_23ftm_dropped_me_off_at_a_mall/,"I apologize in advance for any formatting issues, I'm typing this on my phone because I don't have access to my laptop right now. 

A little background, we can call my boyfriend June. June and I have been dating for 2.5 years. He is FTM transgender and we dated prior to his physical transition. He has been on testosterone for over 2 years and is cis-passing. We were best friends for about a year before we started dating. We are both currently living together and in grad school, he is also graduating with his Master's tonight. 

So all of this started about 2 months ago. I bought us tickets for a flight and needed to put a gender on his ticket. I asked him what he thought I should put because his gender marker on his license still says ""F"". He said to put M. I asked if he was sure and he said he would get it taken care of at the DMV before we left. It sounded like he meant business so I left it at that and put M on his ticket. 

Throughout these 2 months I've kept reminding him to go to the DMV but he's always been so busy with schoolwork and work and his internship. Our flight is scheduled for next Thursday so I've definitely been getting antsy. This past week his mom has been in town helping us out while we studied for finals (this will be pertinent later). 

On Wednesday, June decided last minute that we were all going to the DMV to change his gender marker. I didn't necessarily want to go because I had a final on Thursday I desperately needed to study for and I know how long the DMV takes. I told him I didn't think I had time and that wasn't originally part of my plan for today. He says to me ""Are you gaslighting me? We've talked about this and it's been in my calendar for months."" But I have absolutely no recollection of having a conversation about this specific day for changing his gender marker? He goes on to say ""None of this would be a problem if you didn't put M on my ticket"". At this point I lose my cool and start yelling about how it wasn't my idea to put M. We kinda resolve this and he goes with his mom to the DMV while I head out to study at a coffee shop. I'm definitely still feeling weird but glad he's getting this done.

Unfortunately the DMV didn't accept his paperwork. He was devastated but I told him we just have to try again another day. 

So on Friday (yesterday), June and I had plans to go with his mom and brother to the mall for some Christmas shopping. His mom was really excited. About 20 minutes before we leave, June says ""hey why don't we go to the DMV before the mall?"" His mom says no, she just wants to shop today. June is visibly upset when we get into the car, and he and his mom bicker back and forth the entire 30 minute drive to the mall. I was extremely uncomfortable.  

Everything came to a head when we parked at the mall and were walking through the parking lot. June's brother made a joke about his parking job and June lost it. A lot of what was said I couldn't understand because June's family all speaks Spanish, but I caught the drift. June was going off about how no one supports him or cares about him, he was saying how he's going to kill himself and no one would have to worry about his graduation or gender marker or anything because he'd be dead. His mom and brother were essentially telling him to stop being a baby. They walked inside and June plopped down on a bench outside. I sat next to him but didn't know what to say. He said he was going to the DMV no matter what, and I told him I would come with him. 

We get back in the car, but June is so in his head he almost immediately blows right through a stop sign. I say ""babe that was a stop sign"" and he SLAMMED on his brakes. I was terrified so I covered my eyes and yelled ""Jesus Christ!"" He looked at me, turned the car around, didn't say a word, and pulled up to the mall entrance. All he said was ""I'll see you later."" So I got out of the car and he drove off. 

He called me right after he left apologizing for dropping me off. I told him that he procrastinated too long for this and made it an emergency on everyone else's behalf. He started crying about how no one cares and that I always procrastinate and he never makes me feel bad about it. I placated him then hung up.

After that, I called my sister and she drove 40 minutes to come pick me up. She was heated and told me I don't deserve to be treated like that or for him to talk to me the way he's been talking to me. She's saying that he's emotionally manipulative. All of this is very scary and overwhelming to hear. I'm worried I took it too far and should have just waited at the mall for June to finish up because he obviously needed space. I didn't even tell him I was leaving. I texted his brother what happened and told him my sister was picking me up. 

I haven't really spoken to him since. All I told him was ""I'm safe, I need space"". I didn't come back home last night, I stayed at my sister's house. She doesn't want me to even go to his graduation tonight. I'm worried and embarrassed because at this point his whole family is in town and I'm not there. June, his mom, and his brother have all tried to call me but I didn't pick up. June's brother texted me not to ruin his night tonight. 

I'm completely at a loss. I want to go to his graduation, but I'm so absolutely wrecked over everything that has happened. Is there any way to fix this relationship? Am I overreacting? He's been calling me and texting me like crazy, apologizing and worrying and the works.

Edit: I should definitely clarify, this is not the first time he has threatened to kill himself. It's been about 6ish times since we started dating. I'm not phased as much by it anymore to be honest. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend got into a heated argument with his mom and brother. Took it out on me by dropping me off at a mall. His graduation is tonight and I still haven't spoken to him. How should I proceed? "
a4c4hw,6,2018-12-08,"Theory about time travel, the wormhole, and the significance of the term “End Game”",carpleror,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/a4c4hw/theory_about_time_travel_the_wormhole_and_the/,"OK so I want to start by saying this is totally an out there theory, but read through because it’s a fun ride. Even if this theory doesn’t turn out to be true, it’s incredible to see how much they had planned out for the future of the MCU. 

This would require A LOT of foresight by Marvel (which the more I think about prior films, the more I see how much thought they put into setting up A3 and A4), or perhaps quite a bit of dumb luck, but what if the time travel aspect that’s been rumored is actually directly through the wormhole. If you remember back to Age of Ultron, there’s a scene in the beginning, right after Ultron first attacks and Tony is trying to justify why they need a system like Ultron to defend the earth. Tony starts by reminding them about the Battle of New York when he took the nuke through the wormhole and saved the earth from the aliens. He then points up and says “We’re the Avengers. We can busy arms dealers all the livelong day, but that up there, that’s the End Game. How were you guys planning on beating that?” Cap responds with “together”, Tony says “we’ll lose” and Cap delivers his famous “then we’ll do that together than too” line. This scene just exudes foreshadowing to A3. 

But here’s the theory. What if (and again, warning for a super tin foil hat theory) Tony goes through the wormhole in A1, goes up space and blacks out, and at some point comes into contact with himself floating through Space, the Tony we see in the A4 trailer (time does weird things in Space). Or while up there he is somehow implanted with the knowledge that post-Infinity War Tony has about Thanos and the Snap. Or for whatever reason, becomes aware of Thanos’ plot and how that battle ends with half of life being turned to dust. Hence him referring to Space as the ”End Game” because Dr. Strange has already used that term on Tony, and intern Tony reuses the line on himself. What if he’s so traumatized by Space because he had some sort of out of body experience, or has seen the future, or even worse has seen his own death of himself just floating in Space. 

Now let’s take it a step further. What if it was too traumatizing for him to truly remember and he’s pushed it to the back of his mind. And it’s only when Wanda uses her powers on him in the beginning of Age of Ultron, that things really start to come back (he’s traumatized in Iron Man 3, but I don’t think he actually has memories or anything, it’s more just PTSD at this point). More evidence to this is midway through Age of Ultron, when Tony meets with Fury in a barn to discuss what’s happened. Tony says to Fury “I’m the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn’t tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world too. Because of me. I wasn’t ready. I didn’t do all I could.” Fury says it’s just Wanda playing tricks on his mind and Tony says “It wasn’t a trick, I was shown. It wasn’t a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.” If that’s not foreshadowing to Infinity War, I don’t know what is! But it begs the question, has Tony actually seen what happens in A3 already. Does he truly know the whole world is going to perish at the hand of Thanos, and he powerless to stop it? If he actually saw what happens in A3 and has pushed it to the back of his mind, or is just hiding it from the team, it would explain all his paranoia. It’s not PTSD, he actually knows what’s going to happen and is trying to do everything he can to stop it. 

I know it’s out there, and I know my theory needs a bit more thought to be fully developed, but this would be incredible if true.

He is my best friend and a very kind lovable person. He treats me very well. Our relationship is currently great despite our opposite personalities. I am a very driven student who just got my master's degree and will be starting my career. He is still struggling to graduate from undergrad. He only has one class left to graduate but has failed it twice. He has always been unambitious and didn't do well with his gen ed classes, but has really stepped it up with his upper level classes; however, it hasn't been enough. He is still struggling and can't pass this class. He says he wants to get his master's degree, but he hasn't even received his bachelor's yet, and is struggling at the bachelor level. I can tell that he is starting to get upset about his failures as well, so it's not like he isn't bothered by them. I don't want to break up with him, because he is my best friend in the whole world, but I am worried that I should find someone who will be able to support a family down the line. I always planned on being a working mother, but my career choice is not lucrative enough to support a family on my own. I always imagined my life with him, but his career outlook seems bleak. He also hasn't done anything for his resume, so even if he eventually gets a degree, he has no skills or internships to help him get a job. How long do I wait for him to get his career/life together? I will not think about getting engaged until his career path is in order, but do not want to wait forever. I have always wanted to get married by the time I am 28. If I spend too much time waiting for him, I may miss my opportunity to meet someone else and start a family before I am 30 like I always planned, but breaking up with him would break my heart too.

She's one of the few persons who finds me extremely funny and hilarious and has said so. She can't stop laughing when I'm humorous.
There are also other indicators of interest like **frequently touching my arm or hands while talking**, finding frequent excuses to get a handshake from me,  frequent glances towards me, holding strong eye contact, initiating conversations with me. 

She has also gone deep into conversation and shared a lot about her, to the point where it feels like we've known each other for almost 6 months and not 1 month! She also asked me (within the first week of meeting each other) to add her on my Instagram and she likes anything I share, we also share frequent messages on Instagram. I feel we have also been flirtatious in our exchanges, indulge in banter and tease each other, she finds excuses to hold hands or get me to examine her hand/finger nails etc., a lot of light touching and she has never flinched from it.

However she also talks about which other guys she finds good looking in front of me. Her type of guy does not look like me at all ! Is that a sign she's not attracted to me ? 

Initially I was not a attracted to her (she's not exactly my physical type either), but given that I'm looking to date and kinda craving a relationship, and she seems to atleast like me as a person, so should I ask her if she would like to go on a date with me ? She'll be leaving the Company next week and be moving to another city a 2 hour drive away, so I must make my move fast !

Also I feel that if she's really into me she would be more explicit and ask me to hang out casually atleast if not a date ! Or is it normal for women who really like a guy to still wait for the guy to ask her out formally ?"

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years. We love each other and talk about our future often, how we want to get married and start a family together.

There is one problem to that though and it is a big one. We are currently both in college studying something we love and plan to get a job with. I study game developement. She goes to law school. 

Here is the problem: How my education and industry works, I have to do an internship abroad, and most likely find a job there because there are little to no job opportunities in the industry in my country.

She goes to law school and thus is studying specifically to stay and work in the country. Her degree means little to nothing in foreign countries.
We are both ambitious people and value our (future) career highly. We would both sacrifice anything for our career, but sacrificing our relationship for this is something that would make us miserable. We love each other and both would not want to destroy each others dreams and ambitions. We have argued in the past about this and and have never come to a solid middle ground or agreement.

She wants/needs to stay in the country to be happy. I want/need to move abroad to have a job and follow my dreams. I know it might be hard to give any advice on this but we are desperate for sollutions. We do not under any circumstances want to break up. Any advice would be highly appreciated.

I want to try to get into the Google Brain Residency or FAIR residency. Does anyone know if I can get into this residency as an undergrad? I don't have any research experience but I worked on an applied ML team at G or FB and as I said above I will be working at FAIR or Google Brain as an intern soon.

My idea right now is since I will be internal to Brain or FAIR soon I can talk to manager/team members/respective individuals and instead of getting evaluated for a SWE offer, ask to get evaluated for FAIR (obviously not a traditional thing to do) so I am trying to get more ideas.

Anybody have any ideas on this?

a4ela8,3,2018-12-08,Pain of choosing my second major,legion7878,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/a4ela8/pain_of_choosing_my_second_major/,"As a highschool student i always wanted to pickup CS as my major in university.But since i grew up in a not very educated family and mine always looked for others advice to help me in these matter i(in a such lengthy and twisted way) ended up in EE.At first i put my priority to self study CS courses since my university didnt offer double majors.Besides i still put good effort in EE.I am second year of EE now and my university is now offering double majors.But the thing is i grew attached to Mathematics i picked up during my EE courses and i found out that i actually more enjoyed the ""tool"" side of CS(like more learning to script,programming or setting up a network.) 

I  can see that i have the potential to double major. And as an advice one of my professors in university asked me to go to mathematics because all the analytic skill will come to use(personally i think he wants a research assistant because,he is fed up with ee phd students who dont even know the difference between gradient and derivative,before you ask where the hell is my uni , ill come to that later.)

As background of this situation:I live in Iran.Research sucks here.Professors pay for their own research and academia is full of rich blockheads who think getting a phd is ""Prestigious"".The high salary jobs are mostly for jacks of all trades who can (for example IT) set up a network(using microsoft gui),secure it(mainly by banning all foreign connections) and...you know the rest,or for business owners with ""connections"".
My family put up a lot of effort for me to reach here.(Their ideal utopia is a place in which i am a ""god"" in both academic level(which i believe means an accomplished researcher and professor) and business level(which means making having a six figure salary))

I ,if every thing was ideal, now would have chosen Math as my second major(I dont know what exact part of this combination im intrested in but the thing im sure is that i hate office workb and business.Basically everything that is concerned with money.)But right now(considering situation described above and considering that if i want to get a good salary the right thing would be to drop out and look for an internship) my family wants me to either study CS or Business.
Now a relative of ours whose son getting law phd in italy called us recently and told us i should pick up cs as my second major because his sons friend get 5000 euros as network engineers(im pretty sure he doesnt know the difference between CS research and IT)

What im asking you(which is a lot considering you read everything above.You did,didnt you?) what would you do if you were me?
Choosing math which probably means losing higher salary chance,maybe even getting ridiculed by friends and relatives because the only acceptable outcome for them is higher salary,and more than that maybe even dissapointing your family.
Or i choose CS or Economics and maybe lessening my chance to reach what i consider accomplishment?"
a4ezvo,0,2018-12-08,"Girlfriend breaks up with me, most of my friends chose her side",DeepLeopard,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a4ezvo/girlfriend_breaks_up_with_me_most_of_my_friends/,"I am a college student going to school in Tennessee. At my college, there are many options for student housing, one of them living in a house that has 10 singles. In order to be eligible for one, you need to apply a year before hand. So last year in fall me and group of friends all wanted to live in one of these houses, and were going to apply. However, I chickened out at the last minute. In the house live pretty much all of my 9 best friends, and one girl. However, the people in the house gave two people honorary memberships, one to me and one to a guy named Noah. Me and Noah go to the house all the time. Whenever I'm there, I usually help clean or set up chairs and tables for parties, I vacuum the house sometimes, I set the clocks, and I take out the trash. Noah sometimes helps to, but mainly he just brings alcohol. This girl, who I will call Jessica, is really really cool. I had a crush on her ever since I met her.

So fast forward to last summer, where I was going to be living on campus to take summer classes. Jessica was living in a house in town doing an internship. We start hanging out and start dating. Every thing is great, Im super happy and totally in love. We spend every day together. What blows my mind is that she actually is the one initiating a lot of things. She kissed me first, she said she loved me first, she wanted to get physical first. We have any amazing time together. So now in fall, we are still hanging out a lot and still dating. However, she has a talk with me about how she is concerned with our relationship. She says that if she were to date me, she would really want to be serious, but she's not sure if she's ready yet. I tell her that I want to be a team and we can help each other. We decide to wait for a few days and think about it and see how we feel. We decide to keep dating, she says she loves me. Then, about two weeks after that, I have an anxiety attack which she sees. She is beginning to get the impression that she is a bad influence on me, or that she is causing my anxiety. She eventually breaks up with me. She does it in a really harsh way. She tells me that she doesn't miss me when I'm away, that she doesn't love me anymore, at basically kinda rips into me a lot. I was devastated for a really long time, and obviously am still not over it. She tells me that she can't see any long term between us.

So, now in December, I hear that she is dating the other honorary member of that house, Noah. Not only do I hear this, I also hear that she started dating Noah IMMEDIATELY after she broke up with me. We were together for about 5 or 6 months, and now I'm hearing that she either cheated on me or simply moved on instantly. Later still, I find out some more information. The people who live in the house, including Jessica and Noah, all have a meeting about making sure that I don't find out about their relationship. The literally all conspired to make sure that I wouldn't find out. I am devastated because not only did I lose my girlfriend, who I adored, but she either moved on super quickly or was cheating on me, and all my friends are conspiring against me. I have no idea how to proceed. I think that the best thing for me to do is to not go over to their house for a long time. I don't want to be around people who treat me this way. I wanted to be a member of their house and not their enemy. It is such a fucked up situation.

I don't know what I should do. I think the worst part about everything is that I still have feelings for her, and I actually really like Noah. He actually seems like a really nice guy. But I know that he was flirting with her while we were dating. And she obviously doesn't care about me enough to keep me around. Or maybe she was going behind my back and seeing him. I just can't believe that this would happen, and that everyone else in the house would kind of turn a blind eye and start hiding things from me. From what I understand, one of the members of the house told me that pretty much everyone who lives their think that what Jessica and Noah did was really shitty, but because Noah is such a nice dude who likes do by people alcohol and push people's internship applications forward, no one really cares. When one of the members in the house eventually told me that Noah and Jessica started dating the day after she broke up with me, the other members in the house got really angry at him. It feels like I'm dealing with a mob mentality here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose my question is this: should I continue to be friends with the people in that house? I miss my ex so much, and I still love her, but I don't think I could ever date her again after she did this to me. And I don't think there is any way that she would even want to date me again, either. Should I tell them that I know they were hiding information from me? Or should I just stop talking to those people?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

Dating a girl, she breaks up with me and immediately starts dating someone else. All of our mutual friends conspire to make sure I don't find out about their relationship"

No matter what I do nothing seems to work. I can study for hours, go to class, do all the homework and abuse office hours and still not do well. I’m starting to think that maybe college isn’t for me. I have ADD and Dyslexia so studying effectively is hard. 

I know that internships will require at least a 3.0 GPA but I’m currently below that and will probably drop even further after his semester. What can I do?!"
a4gegq,1,2018-12-08,Do I need substance abuse counseling or treatment?,YungGazzy,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/a4gegq/do_i_need_substance_abuse_counseling_or_treatment/,"I’ve been a habitual drug user for the last 4 years or so, starting in high school. Like almost everyone, it started with drinking and weed, at first a couple times of week but now almost daily (only weed though, I’ve had a few awful blackout experiences on alcohol so I tend to stay away from that). I’ve also picked up nicotine, stims, psychs, benzos, and opiates in the last year and a half although I do them sparingly to avoid an inescapable addiction. 

The thing is, I don’t seem like a drug addict to most people. I’ve got a scholarship, straight A grades, and a pretty great internship with career potential, but at heart I know that I’m addicted. Not to any one drug in particular but to the escapist sensation of not being sober. I can’t stand going through a week, most of the time just a day, without ending a night at least kind of fucked up on something, and when I try to get off of one substance, I’ll inevitably take up another drug to replace what I’ve foregone. This complete loss of control over my desires worries me, and I don’t know if I want my foreseeable future to be defined by the constant craving for drugs that’s always in the back of my mind. Not to mention that I’ve been close to being arrested at least a couple times for possession and distribution and that my use has caused me to hurt myself and others, physically and emotionally, on more than one occasion. Especially the stress that I cause my family, that’s what makes me feel the most shitty about this. 

I’ve never had anyone I felt that could relate to me on this issue, so I wanted to ask this subreddit’s opinion on if I should back out and end my relationship with drugs before I fuck up again and do something else  that I’ll regret for the rest of life. I know I can’t go sober by myself, my plugs and drugs are just too accessible for me to go cold turkey, but would counseling or therapy help? I’ve had good friends try to talk me into quitting my use, but no matter how convincing their arguments are and no matter how much I agree with them, I can never bear to tear myself away from my drugs at the end of the day. In fact, they seem like they improve my quality of life substantially by allowing me to avoid the stress, loneliness, and existential dread that follow me around when I’m sober, but at the same time, the harm I’ve caused myself and my potential to fuck up my future because of drugs says otherwise. If anyone has any opinions on this or similar experiences comments would be greatly appreciated. Peace and stay safe guys 👌"

I needed to make the most of it, at least that's what all of my family and friends would tell me. Some might consider joining a club, going to more events, getting internship. I had more exciting things in mind. With my sights set on a female friend of mine, I was ready to create my new slave. She had a bright future ahead of her, always studying and ensuring she would have the best opportunities when she graduated. 

So how would I change this dedicated college girl into a slave for my use? Needless to say, you can find almost anything on the internet. Without complete confidence in its ability, I get my hands on a drug that fosters an addiction to cum. Such an unhealthy and constant addiction is going to ruin my friend's future, but also ensure I have a loving slave who will do anything for a single drop of my seed...

I'd love to play this out with someone! You'd be playing as a female character that I have references for, and we can discuss more details when you reach out. I love the slow burn of someone changing and becoming a cum addicted slave. If you're interested, send me a message and we can move to kik if you have it!"

a4ijzi,0,2018-12-09,On the verge of becoming an adult and I feel completely unprepared by my parents in regards to financial education.,DaBacon_404,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a4ijzi/on_the_verge_of_becoming_an_adult_and_i_feel/,"I'm 17 living in Ohio. I turn 18 the first week of Feb.

As I am about to turn 18 I feel I am completely unprepared to be an adult. My parents have given me very little in way of financial education. Citing the age old reason in my household that its none of my business and I would just go out and tell people critical information they don't need to know. (Never done that in the past nor will I in the future.) They have taught me nothing in taxes or investing or saving money. Neither have been to college. I'm beginning to suspect that they have nothing to teach me. I'm also feeling like I'm not managing my money very well.

Background info:

Income: I work at local grocery store as a carry out making $9/hr and I only normally get 10 hours a week. -20% in taxes. Mother won't let me quit to find a better job because the manager that approached me for the job is a client of hers (Hairstylist). Been working there since late june 2017.

Wealth: I have a savings account and checking account opened at a local community bank. Division of Park National Bank. I have \~$700 to my name. Savings got wiped out by buying the car completely on my own with my grandfather pitching in a decent chunk of cash. The car was bought in an effort to save money in gas. (2010 Honda Accord V6 with sunroof. Very well taken care of and has not seen salt on the roads before coming to Ohio.)

Vices: Books, Video games, food, gas new computer stuff.

Education: I'm mostly self-taught, I've exceeded every standard set to me in school and I'm usually always ahead when it comes to knowledge on topics such as math or history. I have about 34 credit hours in college credit at my local university of which I've been accepted to start my freshman year at. I plan to get a bachelors in Computer Science with a minor in Web Security.

I've spent all of my high school career around computers and know a good bit of how they work and hardware etc. Learning how to program and build network infrastructure on my own. (Current project: SSH server.) I'm hoping to maybe get an internship at a regional company sometime this upcoming summer or the following one.  


Edit: It's rather late, I will post my replies in the morning while I work on some of my finals before going to work."
a4izjt,4,2018-12-09,Whats the fuss about having Apple on your resume as an engineer?,LibertyState,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/a4izjt/whats_the_fuss_about_having_apple_on_your_resume/,"I'm (almost) a recent grad with big semiconductor company internship experience. Potentially getting an offer from Apple in physical design verification in Cupertino. No complaints.


I've been doing some research, and a lot of people say Apple salary is less than other surrounding big companies because of the prestige and the fact that people want to work there regardless for the name. Why is that? I thought that was the case for Google, Microsoft, Amazon as well. But it seems like those companies do pay more, but Apple doesn't because there's a high demand to work there due to prestige regardless of salary.  But doesn't google have equal prestige? Microsoft? Just curious. 


Also bonus question, what's the base salary for a recent grad with 1.25 year relevant experience at a known company?"
a4k5zy,8,2018-12-09,Why does the missing get worse?,mcBumbleFuzz,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/a4k5zy/why_does_the_missing_get_worse/,"I've been on this sub since July of this year, I would like to say thank you to each and every one of you who has helped me or just simply read my posts. Up to this point I've shared snippets of my life since the breakup, but now I would like to share my full story and ask the question of: Why do I miss her more as time goes on?

&amp;#x200B;

My story starts at university. I was in my second year, in a shared house with a few people who were crazy (One got evicted, it's a long story). I messed up my A levels and went to a university that wasn't my first choice and where I knew no one. My parents were getting divorced throughout this and my girlfriend at the time was unfaithful, I ended that relationship at the end of my first year as she was always messaging other guys inappropriately, wouldn't want to meet up with me much, sex barely happened etc. It was both of our first relationship so no one really wanted it to end.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to second year of university. I met this girl a few times on nights out or at socials, we spoke for a little bit but not much, I just thought there was something about her. She was always cheerful, had a great smile, we got on really well. A few weeks before the end of my second year, she asked me if I wanted to go on a night out with her and some of her friends, I agreed, so we went there together. That night we slept together. University ended for that year and I went back home, as did she. Turns out that we lived 5 minutes from each other back home (What are the chances!). We continued to message and started seeing eachother, it was great. We clicked really well, always had a great time together and the sex was amazing. I treated her right, as I was raised to do and how I think all women deserve to be treated.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my internship year at a prestigious company which I couldn't believe I had achieved (I was 20 year old), she went back to her third year of university. We stayed together and again, things were really great, we would visit each other every weekend. A few months in and she randomly messaged me saying she was off to a guys house who she met at the club for a pancake night (just them). I asked her what would be happening after the pancakes had been finished as she said she would be getting home late. I'm not a controlling person and not sure what the opinions are on here, but exchanging details with a guy on a night out and then going to his house for a 'late night' doesn't seem acceptable to me in a relationship. I told her this, she didn't seem happy about it but didn't go. A few weeks later (This is around 9 months into the relationship) she called me mid week and said that we were over, that she didn't feel that she had had enough time to herself after her previous relationship and that she needed time to herself. (Her previous relationships had all been abusive with either, manipulation, cheating, controlling etc. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, things were going so well yet she had just ended them out of the blue.

&amp;#x200B;

That weekend she returned from university and we spoke in person, she said that she couldn't have a controlling ex again and what I had said to her reminded her of that. I told her that I have 0 issue with her friends and her own life, but that form of behaviour is not acceptable in a relationship. Just as if I had gone on a night out, exchanged numbers with a  girl and then aimed to spend an evening at their house, just us, how would she like that (I would never do that I was just making a point of comparison to show her how it upset me). I didn't get much of a response. I told her that I respected her decision but just wanted some form of closure, as in, why end something that's the best either of us have had all because of a disagreement. We decided to try again.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until the 15/16 month mark all went great again for a while, we went on holidays together, became big parts of each others families, things were better than ever before. We had a valentines day while I visited her at university, she came back the following weekend, and, mid sex, she started crying. I asked her what was wrong (I thought I'd hurt her) and I stopped, again, asking her if she was ok and what was up. She just said that we needed to end and that she loved me but wasn't in love with me. I was quite angry at this point, as there had been no communication, no talking about how she felt, no discussion, like mature adults would do. I asked her to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

The following week I was so upset and angry, I had given everything to this girl and she just randomly ended things without reason, for the second time and without any discussion or closure. Through both of this breakups I was still on my internship (It was 15 months) and I was really trying my best to get an offer and make something of myself. It was really hard work, such a challenge and I needed her support, that's what really upset me as well, how rather than communicating and working on us, supporting me through my work and what I wanted to achieve, she almost broke me at such a founding point of my career. Here's the thing about the job, at this point it was hard work, but I really enjoyed it. My team were great, we had great banter and a nice culture, things in my life were going well, I was so happy. I didn't bring stress or work home with me. This following week she kept messaging me (I never initiated as I said that she had made her choice and whilst I didn't agree with it and really upset me, I would respect it as I couldn't continue to play games with my heart), I responded here and there but was quite dismissive and not really interested (as I'm sure everyone on here can relate, you still love them but they've hurt you and you're guarded). Near the end of that week, after work, she asked to meet at a park near me. I agreed as I thought I would get some form of closure. She gave me a card where she had written how she sometimes feels suddenly down and overwhelmed, then makes decisions hurting the closest to her, how I was the best thing in her life and how she wanted a future together. She would seek therapy and wanted to work through things with me, if I could forgive her.

&amp;#x200B;

I said that I would try again, on two conditions. 1) She would take the therapy sessions as she had said. 2) She would communicate with me when she felt this way, no more surprises like she had done before. I said that ending things and not wanting to be in a relationship is fine, but it's not fair to just turn around and do that to someone. I really loved this girl and against the logical answer of 'no', I decided to give things another go.

&amp;#x200B;

Things continued for a good 15 months, we experienced new things together, became even closer and for the first 6-9 months of this stretch she communicated, she called me her soulmate, we started saving for a house together (I sold the car I had bought on the internship that I really loved to save for the deposit, I'm a car person but a car meant nothing to me compared to a future with her), we spoke about marriage and she would always say she hoped we got married and had kids, all the time. I agreed, as this was the future I wanted as well, I wanted to marry this girl, but I just needed to know that she had sorted her head out from the previous breakups. She was looking for a job after university and after finding one, some people she worked with weren't nice to her. She came home most nights crying and I would do whatever I could to cheer her up, disregarding her snapping etc as I knew it wasn't at me, it was because I was the closest thing to her and she had stress at work which overspilled at home. This went on for a good few months, eventually she found another job and all was great again.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point we were basically living together, either at her parents house or at my parents house (we would alternate). I went onto the graduate scheme at the same company I had interned in, and things were different this time. The role and team I went into were much higher pressure, longer hours, the stress was immense. I became quite depressed for a few months, I wanted to do my best to earn as much money as possible for our future so I stuck at it, but I became quite irritable, quite aggressive and a bit toxic if I'm honest, like a cloud was over my head constantly. I wouldn't want to go out, I would just want to come home and spend time with her because she made me so happy. I needed her to have my back and support me when I was sacrificing myself for her, for us, there was no other reason. Messages between us at work became a bit slower and I could tell something was up, she would read a message and reply an hour later (not a big deal but I could see the difference), she became a bit snappier with me but I just thought it was because we were adjusting to a working life together.

&amp;#x200B;

We always made time for our friends, went out with them together, separately etc, there was never an issue there or with us wanting to do our own things.

&amp;#x200B;

We went on a two week holiday in June, I was unwell for a few days because the stress of work had finally gotten to me and was coming out. I thought we had a great holiday but what I had realised was that things were a bit strange, I think we had sex 3 times in 14 days, which for us, was not the norm. Generally now that I think about it the sex life had lowered a bit, but the quality was still great when it happened. I just thought, it's what happens now that we both have a lot on our plates, the love is still there but it's a different kind now, it's a companionship, a deep bond, not like the honeymoon stage (which seemed to reoccur after every time she ended things). It's the natural progression of the relationship. I remember one instance where she was walking around the hotel room in a thong and I slapped her bum in a playful way, she asked me not to touch her all the time, at which point, I knew something was seriously wrong as normally we were very affectionate and physical with each other.

We returned home, sex really trailed off, I would initiate and she would just say she wasn't in the mood or was too tired, I felt rejected and cold. One weekend shortly after, she came out the shower, hugged me and burst into tears. Told me that she just wanted everything to be perfect. I got the same line as before, that she loved and cared about me but wasn't in love. I suddenly saw that the way I had been from work had caused some damage, and I explained all of this to her. No job was worth losing us over, our future, I was doing it all for our future but I could suddenly see what it was doing to me. I can't say I'm completely to blame here as she had ended things twice before in a similar fashion, but maybe this had sped up the inevitable? She didn't end things this time, we agreed to work on things over the next few weeks, to give eachother space and time but still see eachother a few days a week. We saw eachother on a few of those days and I could see in her eyes when I kissed her goodbye she still loved me and felt the same way.

I went away with my friends for a week (all guys, to a marina, relaxed bars and restaurants type thing) and it was at this point the messaging became quite poor, responding to me like I was a random off the street. Our three year anniversary was mid week while I was away, so I ordered a big bouquet of flowers to her workplace telling her happy three years and that I loved her. The response I got was along the lines of, ""Thanks for the flowers they're really nice, three years is a long time!"" and I just started crying. Maybe deep down I knew at this point what the decision was. But why? We hadn't discussed and worked on us like we had agreed, things were getting a bit better then suddenly she just shut me down like that. I felt awful. I returned home at the weekend and on the Sunday we met at a park near her. She said that we needed to end and that she wasn't in love with me anymore, that it wasn't my job that had caused this she just didn't want to continue and it had been on her mind for a while, we weren't right for eachother. She was very adamant and this was very out of character, it's like a switch was pressed (Just like the other times she ended it). We drove back to hers, I collected the rest of my stuff and went on my way. I was in denial, I couldn't believe this had happened, the girl who I wanted to marry, the girl who called me her soulmate, was saving for a house with, was my world, had betrayed me at one of my darkest moments.

She has since blocked me from Instagram, we've had 0 contact since. Turns out that two months after she ended things, she slept with a guy on the edge of our friends group on that same night they had met in a while, then a month after that, she's now made it official with him on Facebook, what's worse is that this guy is a total loser. I was expecting a handsome, smart, athletic, successful person then I would feel shit but in a way could see the shallowness and logic of it all. It feels like I've been hit with a train, how can you give up everything we had and our future, for what's essentially (and it hurts to say this) being an easy girl who's chasing limerence and the honeymoon period. I thought she was different, I really didn't see this one coming.

It's now 5 months since the breakup of this 3 year relationship. This is my story. Since it ended I've purchased Invisalign (my teeth aren't bad but I got hit in the face a few years ago and it's just small stuff that bothers me), I've been hitting the gym hard, started training Krav Maga again as I'm so angry. I punched a bag until the metal chains holding it sheared off and broke when I found out she had a one night stand with that guy. I know it can be said that it's her life now etc and I agree, I just miss her more every day and feel that her behaviour is disgraceful, tainting our memories and what we had even thought I know they're separate things.

I'm still in the same job, trying to get out but the hours and stress are the same, I manage it a bit better now.

I've been on one Tinder date since, felt horrible afterwards.

If anyone has comments, questions, or general advice it would be really appreciated, I know it's a long post but it's finally time for me to tell the whole story on here."

One I would definitely choose over the other because I think I can see myself working there full-time. The other is a food company that I thought would be interesting to explore, but I am afraid of getting a boring project. 

I could choose one for the summer, or I could choose to do one in the summer and the other in the fall. If I do one in the fall, I would miss my fall semester of senior year, but I would still graduate on time. I don't know how this would impact finding a full-time job. 

Pros of doing both:

* I get to know what two different industries are like
* I get to learn how food products a lot of people enjoy are made
* This is my last chance to explore the food &amp; beverage industry in a 3-month, low-stakes program

Cons of doing both:

* I'd miss the senior design class that's taught in the fall (I can potentially still study this on my own?)
* I'd miss the fall career fair
* I'd meet less people who are also interning

Any option stand out to you as the clear choice? Any advice?

I can be on my phone ignoring her and she will keep on chatting about whatever she made up (she also tends to exaggerate her stories btw). Everything gets worse, because she loves to invade my personal space. She stands very close to me, I couldn't stretch my arm in front of me if I wanted to and I can feel her breath. Lately I've been giving hints like I stand with spread legs, so when she comes too close she will hit my feet. The other day I stepped her foot 4 times because of this and she didn't react! She stood there like it's normal for people to have their feet on top of yours.
Now I've been tuning out and answer her questions aggressively, because I feel almost violated. The idea of confronting her makes me nervous and I don't know what to do. "

a4lm8j,261,2018-12-09,"I (18F) rent a room in someone else's house, and $200 cash is missing from my desk",thirsty_houseplant,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a4lm8j/i_18f_rent_a_room_in_someone_elses_house_and_200/,"I'm an intern and student this semester, and I rent a fairly secluded room (but without locks) from a very well-to-do family consisting of 50sF, her two kids 13F and 8M, and their nanny 32M. Renting another room in another part of the house is 50M, but he wasn't in town while this happened and is very trustworthy (i.e. he like, audits government spending/corruption for a living).

My room is right next to 32M's room, and we're the only people on the floor. He's a very outwardly nice and friendly guy, but he tells outrageous lies about himself constantly (and has gotten called out on them multiple times by his employer the 50sF mom, who is a high-ranking government attorney). He's one of those people who constantly lies to make himself look good (like, saying ""i made this marble cake from scratch"" when there were two Betty Crocker boxes in the recycling bin). 

He is very nice to me, but he seems too eager to please, and I have been avoiding interaction with him because he's a liar and gives off a sketchy vibe. In addition, 50sF and I think he might be lying about running a charity-- he gets a lot of stuff (signed guitars, etc.) in the mail for a ""charity auction"" he's putting on, but we can't find anything on his charity, and the URL he gave us doesn't work. I don't trust him, so I avoid him whenever possible, which is easy because I'm gone from 9am to 8pm almost everyday. 

Anyway, I've been here since September, and I keep some cash hidden in a book on my desk. Not original, I know. I'm regretting it now. It's around $200, and it's mostly money my mom gave me to do some christmas shopping for our family. I haven't touched it since Wednesday, and when I went to get it this morning, it was gone. I did not move it, and I've checked everywhere else it could be.

It wouldn't be the end of the world if I never got it back, but it's $200. I don't know if I should call my mom and ask her what to do. I've never lived with people I don't know before, so I have a lot of learning to do, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Also I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I've had a few weird things happen. Once when I woke up, a few things in my room weren't where I left them when I went to bed. Like, a heater I had going was unplugged, when I went to bed with it on, and the outlet is in a fairly inaccessible place I couldn't have gotten to while asleep. I am a very heavy sleeper. Not sure if this is relevant, but it creeped me out.

Also, I don't know if 32M did it, but it worries me a lot because he works with the kids. I've avoided any confrontation because that's not my business, but I've considered telling 50sF about his compulsive lying, because she's a smart woman who catches all the lies he tells her. I think 32M thinks I'm a dumb 18 year old girl who won't question what he says, because whenever he says stuff like ""oh, your dad's from France? I was just in Provence collecting my grandmother's noble title"" I'm just like ""nice"" and keep focusing on my own shit. But if he's really this untrustworthy, I feel like it's my responsibility to tell the mom because he works with her kids, and they are vulnerable.

I'm just not sure how to proceed, or who to tell.

Tl;dr $200 cash is missing from my room in a larger household. Most likely suspect is compulsive liar nanny (a 32 year old guy). How do I proceed, and do I tell his boss, the mom I rent a room from?

Note: I'll be moving out on friday, regardless. Everyone involved is aware of this"

545am started out like any other day. Hubby got up first to have a shower since he is starts work before me. I lay in bed a little longer to cuddle with the dog and check my social media. Once hubby was done, uniform on, and out the door, I got up to have my shower.

As the hot water cascaded over my body I suddenly realized that I had an early morning client meeting and showing. I still needed to get to the office and grab my paper work. So, I shaved my pussy really quick and finished my shower.

I put on my black skirt, two inch black heels shoes, purple dress skirt and a purple thong. Quickly fed the dog, patted him on the head and raced out the door.

The usual 40 minute drive to work only took 25 minutes because I raced through a rather quiet morning traffic commute. As I pulled into the parking lot I noticed Brian's white suburban parked in his spot. Weird because he doesn't usually arrive at work until 10am. Not 6:30 am.

I went to go inside and the main door was locked so I had to fumble to get my keys out. Once I did, I unlocked the door, went inside and locked the door behind me.

I walked down the hall towards the my office and noticed Brian's door was closed, again weird, since his truck was outside. Maybe he had a business trip and left it here. Who knows.

As I walked past his office I herd what sounded like a female moan. I stopped suddenly in my tracks for another listen. Sure enough I heard a female yip from his office. So I stood there to listen longer.

His office chair squeaked and the wheels moved and suddenly I heard, 'omg, omg, omg' followed by another few yipping cries. 'so good, my bf needs to do that better.' the female voice in the other room spoke with a young high pitched voice.

It sounded like Victoria, the new intern Brian brought on for the summer. 20 year old brunet with shoulder length black hair and a killer tight young body.

' Fuck fuck fuck, I'm going to Cum you dirty old bastard!' she cried out from behind the door. My guess is that Brian is eating her pussy.

Suddenly she was moaning and squealing and it sounded like she was cumming.

'omg my fucking God!, she cried out as I heard Brian moan. He was definitely enjoying tasting her.

It went sent after I heard his chair move. Wasn't sure if they were finished or not so I was getting ready to high tail down to my office.

' holy fuck, it's huge!' Victoria obviously just say Brian's 10 inch cock. I found myself standing there nodding to myself knowing that she is correct.

Brian moaned out loud as I heard sucking sounds coming from the other side of the room. She was definitely enjoying that big cock.

At this point my panties were soaked. I reached under my shirt and fingered myself as I listened to them on the other side of the door.

'Mmmm God girl, that mouth is fantastic.'

'God, my bf is tiny compared to this'

'keep sucking you litte slut'

God my pussy was dripping listening to them. I placed one hand on the wall to brace myself as I fingered my wetness.

'I always old guys dicks shriveled up and didn't work.'

OK, that one almost made me laugh out loud.

'I'm glad I can prove that doesn't happen.' Brian said back as he grunted. Then I heard loud sucking sounds and some gurgling sounds. I could tell he was fucking her young mouth.

She exhumed hair and cried 'omg'

It sounded like she was gasping for air after getting throat fucked by his big cock. Then I heard loud sucking and gurgling sounds again as Brian continued to face fuck her.

She gasped for air again.

I came at this point holding my hand over my mouth. My juices running down my leg.

'How's that wet pussy slut? Ready to get fucked'

Omg, I almost came again hearing that.

'I don't think it's going to fit.' she almost sounded scared

""turn around and bend over the desk. '

God, my favourite way to get fucked. Victoria was in for a good fucking. I came again.

' omg it's too big! '

' fuck this puss is tight '

Then I heard slapping sounds as he began fucking her. She was squealing like crazy as his cock stretched her pussy.

Slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap

Omg my pussy was throbbing listening to them.

Slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap 'omg omg omg' slap slap slap slap slap slap slap 'I'm going to cum' slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap 'Jesus christ! Slap slap slap slap slap slap slap slap' AAARGH yeah fuck cumming!'

I came with her.

' here it comes you little slut ' then Brian was grunting those familiar sounds he makes when he comes.

I then went into my office and waited for her to leave his office. It was another 15 minutes then I heard his office door open.

I send him a message saying.. ""really, you dirty old bastard, she's old enough to be your granddaughter.""

He responded with ""you need to get in here.""

I left my office and saw Victoria fixing her makeup at her cubicle.

""morning Victoria."" I said with a smile.

""Morning Mrs D.""

I handed her my car keys and sent her out to get some coffee and donuts down at Tim Hortons. Once I saw my car leave the parking lot, I went in to see Brian and closed the door.

He was sitting in his chair and as I got closer to him, he pulled his chair back, naked from the waist down and his big cock still sticking straight up.

""You need to taste that young pussy, it was amazing."" he said with a devious smerk.

I knelt down between his legs and licked his thick shaft.

""See what I mean"" he said as I licked my lips. She did taste amazing. ""now suck it clean you married bitch.""

I took his shaft and my mouth swallowed as much as it could. Sucking and licking the Cum off him. He held my head as it bobbed up and down. He was moaning and watching me.

""God that mouth is fantastic."" he grunted as his hips started thrusting in his chair. My mouth was making loud sucking sounds as I sucked him.

""she old enough to be your daughter, how does that young pussy taste you little slut.?

I moaned my approval as I cupped his balls and fingered his scrotum.

""Jesus christ you naughty slut."" he moaned as I teased him. ""that's it, I can't take anymore."" he said standing up in front of me.

I looked up and he cocked slapped me a couple times with his wet shaft.

""open your mouth slut""

I did as he commanded and he shoved his cock all the way in my mouth and held it there for a moment. Then he put both hands on my head and started fucking my face.

""take it slut. Taste that 20 year old pussy."" he grunted looking down at me. His old man balls slapping in my chin as he force fucked my mouth.

Gurgle gurgle gurgle slap slap slap slap slap slap slap gurgle gurgle gurgle slap slap slap slap

""God damn little married slut taking my old cock""

His hips were slapping into my face so hard I thought I'd get a nose bleed. I was so hot. I was fucking my pussy with my fingers.

""Here it comes slut.""

I came on my fingers knowing I was about to swallow a huge load. And then it hit the back of my throat as he grunted. I swallowed his load that felt like it was never going to end. Finally he collapsed spent in his office chair.

""God that was amazing ' he breathed deeply.

I got up off the floor and fixed my skirt and hair."" your a dirty old bastard. I said to him fixing my thong.

""That's why you work for me."" he said with laugh as he put his dress pants on.

""You know it."" I replied. ""I have to go, I have that showing this morning and I'm almost going to be late.""

As I left his office he wished me good luck. Victoria was sitting back at her cubicle and smiled as I walked over to get my coffee.

""We should talk"" I said to her as I walked out the door.

And that is a story for another time.

I know these kind of things can go hand in hand with this job with all the heavy lifting and awkward positions you end up getting into restraining large dogs and no matter how much I practice “lifting with your legs and not back” I still feel like there’s more I can do to keep everything working smoothly. 

I’m thinking of joining a yoga class or gym once my internship is complete and I’m not at work 70 hours a week but I thought I’d ask what works for everyone else before committing to something. 

Are there any special things you do to not feel like youre 100 year old after a shift??"

I am a junior at uni right now, majoring in stats w/ a minor in computer science. I am really interested in biostatistics and it's applications in health care/public health, as well as the big data/""data science"" field.

Basically I am trying to figure out how to get some exposure to this area as an undergrad. There are few options to consider:

- *Trying* to take some Biostat/Epi graduate courses as a senior (not sure how plausible that is). Along with taking upper division computer science courses in the DS/ML area.
- A summer institute of biostatistics, though I am trying to get an internship this summer and do not know if I'd able to do both. Worth it?
- A public health minor. Idk if this would be worth it, though I do have some space for a second minor and am intrigued by the field (just less upper-division computer science classes).

I am aware biostats is a MS/MPH program, which is why I want to try to get exposure to it before committing to it (which I probably wouldn't right after undergrad anyways). Any suggestions?

I have zero information on if any of these are worth it, but I think I want to do something. Any input would be very appreciated! Please also let me know if posting to /r/publichealth or elsewhere would be a better choice.

Cheers!

I'm a 26 y.o. , 152cm (average from where I live but a midget among the world) guy. I'm considered obese but so is my country that it's top 3 in Asia. Now that I mentioned it. I'm Asian. Yellow but darker colored skin. Been staring at the sun for too long. But physically active despite my weight and size. 

Not really attractive so don't expect anything. But attractive aside, I usually colored/dyed my hair often. It's black now but after 6 months from now, I would like to dye it to faded gray. My best was purple. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I'm still a student in a university taking a media degree. I have a half a year left to graduate.

I'm a very serious person but I can take jokes easily. But sometimes, I'm pretty oblivious to them that I took them seriously. So in short, naive.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for hobbies, I have plenty such as watching anime/shows (though not pretty often) , games and blah blah blah. I always try something new that leads to me not commit to every single one of them. As for now, I'm more into:

1) Music - As I was 18, I wanted to be a musician. But that's on hold now. I'm more into rock or hardcore. 

2) Photography - This one is fairly recent. I just bought myself a mirrorless camera because I have interest in videography / filmaking when I was an intern at a company. Now it lead me to do more photography and astrophotography (pictures of stars and deep space). 

3) Technician / Tech Geek - I have an interest in fixing stuff since I didn't have money to buy new stuff. So I usually buy / find old parts and fix them. I'm frugal that way. Also, I build PC for people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really think much of what I wanted to say but that's a good gist of me.   


Probably, I looking for someone who has the same taste as me. Even better, if she is a model so I can take pictures. Hahaha.

They all agreed that if they're beaten in equal machinery they'd have to give up their championships.

a4nukv,3,2018-12-09,6 months later,lowkeyvanessa,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a4nukv/6_months_later/,"i was with my ex for 3 years. long story short, he took an internship that was several states away this past summer. our relationship had a lot of ups and downs, but i was so convinced he was the one for me. anyway, i bought a plane ticket so i could go see him when his internship ended so i could drive back with him. he broke up with me, completely out of the blue. he said he didn’t feel anything with me for months. he said he knew he was gonna breakup with me when i bought the plane ticket (rip that $300!!) before the breakup, i could feel him pulling away but i thought we would get through it like we had multiple times before. i asked if he had met someone else. he said no. several days later, a mutual friend sent me a screenshot of another girl sitting on his lap. turned out he had lied to me about a trip he had taken to nyc. he said the trip was only him + some guys from the internship, but she was all over him in the pictures. i never went through his tagged pics on insta. 

it’s been 6 months...i don’t miss him or that relationship as looking back, i see that it was toxic and me and him were both settling in different ways. 

however, i am still hurting. i’ve moved on and have found happiness, but when our anniversary passed the other day, i had a really long crying session. 

my heart still kinda aches. i thought my whole life was planned out and i really wanted that plan. i’ve accepted life will be different than planned, but it still kinda sucks. "
a4ohh2,1,2018-12-09,Questions about paying off parents' Parent PLUS loan,throwaway389js8920,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a4ohh2/questions_about_paying_off_parents_parent_plus/,"I went to a private university for 1 year and my parents signed a Parent PLUS loan to help pay for the tuition. At the time, I didn't care about finances and didn't even think about how expensive it was, and how I was going to pay it off. A year later, I realized how much it was going to cost me in the future, and I transferred to my state's flagship university. From that point forward, I managed to land a bunch of internships, and eventually land a job that paid 75K out of university.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated a little under 2 years ago, and this is my financial situation:

&amp;#x200B;

\- 90K salary + solid benefits / insurance. At risk of losing job (company going through messy merger), but I could easily get another similar job

\- 10K Emergency savings

\- 20K Roth IRA

\-35K Vanguard portfolio

\- Around 20K in student loans (ranging from 4% to 6% interest)

\- No other loans, don't own a car, monthly expenditure totals to around $1600

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think my parents are doing well financially, and I just learned that this Parent PLUS loan they took out has an interest rate of 7.5%! I think they still have between 10K and 12K to pay off on this loan, but I'd like to pay it off (or at least help.) My parents never made me agree to paying them back. At the time their financial health was very strong, but there were a series of events that really messed that up. I don't know how to go about this, because I'm not sure that my dad will accept the money. He is quite stubborn, and I think he looks at this as a case where he agreed to pay for it, as an investment in me, and therefore he will pay it off. Still, I'd like to do it, and I think if I did it the right way he'd at least let me help them. I am looking for advice on how to do this. Also, how does this work tax wise? Is there a way to do this that would be tax beneficial for either myself or my parents? Is it possible to pay the loan company directly even if I am not legally responsible for the loan? Is my best option for paying them back to sell off some of my Vanguard funds and write my parents a check?"
a4oinn,0,2018-12-09,The Problems of the Brawl Stars Dev Team,MortisRockabilly,Brawlstars,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/a4oinn/the_problems_of_the_brawl_stars_dev_team/,"So Yesterday I posted a Article that I titled 'I'm gonna get Crucified for saying this' 

**Link Here :** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/a4gfm2/im\_probably\_gonna\_get\_crucified\_for\_saying\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/a4gfm2/im_probably_gonna_get_crucified_for_saying_this/) 

I find it very important that you read that Article I made **BEFORE** you read this one since I bring up some points there that will end up having context in here. 

The Big Problems I see are the following 

\- Making Excuses to cover up their own horrid work. 

\- Community Consensus &lt; Youtuber Consensus 

\- Over Estimation for Balancing Brawlers. 

***1.) Excuses*** 

So lets start with the biggest pressing issue of the Brawl Stars Dev Team : Their version of Damage Controlling. A easy example is when the Brawl Talk for Landscape Mode first dropped on Reddit, YouTube, Twitter and other Media Platforms. The Subreddit was basically in a Riot against Landscape Mode's impending Meta Shift for Brawl Stars (which I greatly explain in Yesterday's Post.) You can't argue that the Dev Team **wasn't well aware** of the firestorm in the Subreddit of people trying to stop Landscape from happening, hence they went into **Damage Control** and made a excuse about this supposed ultimatum of **'Landscape or Kill'**. Afterwards the community just gave up the fight for Portrait Mode just allowing it to happen as it goes along. The Big Problem of this is that people thought it was justified enough and that it's just the way it had to be. But if you take a step back, it just seems a little too justified for it's own good. Think about the main reasoning of the Landscape or Kill was that Portrait was supposedly 'not bringing in enough players.' However if the Dev Team had actually released the video **BEFORE** the Update happened and the backlash came (like maybe in the **Brawl Talk itself** to explain themselves properly.) then maybe it'd be more justified.

What the Dev Team did instead was explain themselves after the firestorm broke out at a time that was way too late and maybe just a bit fake. Seeing as at that point they would've already gone into Damage Control and made that video to try to cover themselves from getting more and more ire from the community, and **it's not debatable that they weren't aware of the community's uproar over Landscape** seeing as if that was the case t**hey wouldn't have released the video at all.** 

***2.) The Community's Consensus means less than a Youtubers Consensus.*** 

This part may be a bit touchy to certain people. I want to make the point that **this part specifically isn't designed to be targeted to any specific Youtubers who cover Brawl Stars related content,** this is more directed at how the **Dev Team treats Youtubers compared to the Community in General.** I have reasoning to believe that **the BSDT (Brawl Stars Dev Team.) treats Youtubers with more respect compared to the community in General,** the reasoning behind this is that these Youtuber's have tons of Subscribers. 

**Examples Include (just naming some channel examples.)** 

**- Coach Cory : 27.5K Subscribers**

**- KairosTime : 52.4K Subscribers**

**- Lex : 37.6K Subscribers**

**- Doing Life Gaming : 3.7K Subscribers.** 

All these channels **have decent amount of Subscribers** and when the game goes global, has the risk of **attracting bigger Youtubers with higher Subscriber counts**. Which intern can cause the Dev Team to **think that it's acceptable to continue favouring them instead of the community consensus**, however if Youtubers were to start saying bad things about the Dev Team (not saying that they need to have this happen to them.)  they'd have their communities start to reignite the firestorm again. For example, the community had to get **into a big fuss over the Movement Joystick being grounded** and the Dev team **for about a solid 3 or so months ignored them**, it took the Youtubers **saying something to get the Dev Team to have the Movement stick grounded**. Another example is that I for the longest time (and still semi-believe today.) is that Dynamike is stupidly broken on most Game modes excluding maybe Brawl Ball and I expressed that over multiple accounts (I was banned 2 times before this account, once for supposed 'Low Effort Posts' and a 'Low Karma Score'.) Everybody for the longest time thought that **I was just bad at dealing with Dynamike or was just bad at the game in general**, 5 months later of this and Coach Cory finally says that Dynamike is Broken and everyone agreed with him, so the Dev Team inadvertently influenced the Community to have a **Double Standard** of the **Players opinion means less than the Youtubers Opinion**. This also ended up influencing.... 

***3.) Future Brawler Balancing***

This part is gonna be a bit more complicated to explain seeing as I gave a basic ideal in the previous post : A **infinite loop** of Brawlers **that don't need Buffs or need Nerfs getting Buffs**, and Brawlers **that need Buffs but get Nerfs instead** which **promotes those more broken or easy to use Brawlers instead of Brawlers that require more tactical know-how** which then gives the Dev Team the mentality of '**If people like it then when want them to play with them more.'** It's also arguable that the **Rarity of a Brawler** can also have a effect on this. The most recent example of this being Leon. Leon is a **Legendary Brawler** (one of three) that is mainly about flanking the enemy and taking out brawlers that prove to powerful to fight in a full out offensive. However people are saying that he is broken however if the previous point has shown anything it's that the **main consensus means less than a Youtuber's opinion** and youtubers don't exactly have a opinion on Leon as of yet. I attribute the Balance Changes down to the amount of people that actually HAVE Leon all over this reddit there is a ton of people that have posted their **Legendary Chances**. Meaning that **they don't have Leon yet**, The Dev team clearly bases their Balancing **on Popularity**, so with such a small amount of players actually owning Leon. The Dev Team took to task and **Nerfed Leon's main quirk making him a shell (or in this case hoodie) of his former self**, compare him to Darryl, **he's super Broken and popular,** hence the Rework which promoted Darryl's to play a bit more defensive but with **no nerf to his Damage Output** people still play him **similar to before (especially in Showdown, Smash and Grab and Heist.)** On top of this Leon was clearly **supposed to be designed around stopping this**, but because of his **Rarity and Overall opinion of him causing his Nerf there's still very few Brawlers that can counter Darryl.**

&amp;#x200B;

***The Conclusion?*** 

So the conclusion is simple, the Dev Team **rarely cares about the opinion of the Community** but treat the Youtubers like they mean everything (which they do.) and bases their Balancing on **what's popular at the time**. On top of that they will only make excuses when it **risks the game (their version of Damage Control.)**  It's time we start **demanding quality control and for everyone's opinion to matter when it comes to the Quality of Life for Brawl Stars.** An Easy way we can start this is by making Landscape Optional and allow those who wish to play with Brawl Stars in the original way. ***It's time to start a new age for the Dev Team that WE want.***

I’m currently earning a master’s degree in public history, and after some time doing various kinds of fieldwork, I’ve started to gain an interest in curation. I’m wondering where to go from here, with little time left until I graduate. 

For one of my internships, I worked a little bit with a curator, did some objects research, and proposed an objects list for an exhibition. However, this was only a small part of the internship. Ideally, I would like to do an internship that focuses solely on curation, but it’s competitive in my city and I can’t afford to put a ton of time into an unpaid gig. If I can’t get a formal internship, I’d at least like to volunteer somewhere. I wish I’d realized I wanted to do this sooner, so I could’ve planned my fieldwork out better!

I’m wondering if anybody has pointers or personal stories about breaking into the field of curation. I’d also welcome advice about approaching an organization about volunteering, when it isn’t advertising any open positions. "

[One](https://i.imgur.com/QV67fop.mp4)
“Oh the same old boring thing, flowers” Your wife complained after you asked her if her class had bought her anything fun as they graduated and she wouldn’t teach them for two months over summer break.

In reality however the boys in her class had chipped in and bought her the most *pathetically whorish* lingerie set she owned, way more slutty and sexy than that pair of thongs you once bought her. She took her time and sent out a thank you snap to each and every boy while she wore it.

[Two](https://i.imgur.com/LM8UpuZ.jpg)

When you stepped into the bedroom with the fresh bouquet of flowers in your hand, your heart shattered. You were greeted by your wife literally gagging on a thick, meaty boycock atleast thrice the size of your own. And you could tell beyond any doubt that your wife was in LOVE with the thick meatpole she was making love too. What hurt even more was that she didn’t stop, not even for a second, even after seeing you. “Ms..” the boy panicked.

Your wife hushed him with a finger to his lips and just continued to gag on his fat cock, her ass in the air and her married pussy dripping on your bed.

[Three](https://i.imgur.com/MDvKyZF.jpg)

After that time you caught your wife fucking one of the intern boys at your job and you were to pathetic to stop her, even getting hard. She knew she had you around her finger. She invited him over to your house and you all sat down. 
“So, this is Kyle, and Kyle is moving in with us and he will sleep with me in our bed, you can take the couch or the floor...doesn’t make a difference to me.” She said, when you asked why with a tear in your eye she simply pulled up her phone and showed you the humongous cock on her phone and smiled “that’s why”

[Four](https://i.imgur.com/ADHgwuV.jpg)

Your wife found out that the boy she was babysitter for had gotten broken up with by his girlfriend and she saw it as the perfect opportunity. After the parents had left she told him to go shower. As he got clean she put on the lingerie you bought her and sat herself down on the couch with a balloon, it was valentines day after all. (It did hurt you a lot that she didn’t want to spend it with you, huh?) 

When he came out in nothing but a towel she called for him. “Timmy, I heard your girlfriend broke up with you, and that sucks. But to be fair that’s just how girls your age are, unpredictable. What you should go for instead are older girls, like me!”

a4ppfs,195,2018-12-09,"After the program was suspended from its conference for an entire year over the illegal tackle incident (that caused the fall of the head coach), Nihon University plays a game against a team of semi-pros and demolishes them",Honestly_,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/a4ppfs/after_the_program_was_suspended_from_its/,"Okay, for those of you not around in the offseason, let's go through what happened:

* Japan has a spring league of exhibition games to let younger players get some reps. During a cross-conference game between two major powers (Kwansei Gakuin and reigning national champion Nihon University), a Nihon LB committed an extremely flagrant late hit on the first play from scrimmage. [You can see the incident here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKbLWcyQ_wo)

* **Thus began one of the craziest sagas in college football history**, so big it dominated the news cycle in Japan (it hit a perfect slow news cycle despite being a tertiary sport) and even got reported by major outlets in the United States. 

* End result: head coach and assistant resign, police investigations, the conference suspends the program, a respected semi-retired coach from the other conference is hired, BUT the conf the school is in _rejects_ the submission for reinstatement as not being sincere so the reigning national champs couldn't play this Fall (the ""real"" season). They have relegation in Japan so they will now drop to Division 2. 

* Incidentally, the respected, replacement coach they hired is Isao Hashizume spent a year in a coaching internship program at Oklahoma before returning to successfully coach Ritsumeikan University (Bruce Feldman wrote about it a while back). A few FBS schools have had such programs (OU, USC, Boise, etc)

**Here's an analogy using comparisons in the USA:**

* Alabama getting in trouble for a dirty tackle during a spring exhibition game

* The coaches try to throw the player under the bus, but everyone basically points to a college equivalent of the NFL BountyGate.

* The defensive player gives a news conference tearfully apologizing and saying he is quitting football. 

* The QB he hit on the other team gives a statement that he shouldn't quit football, but the family asks for a criminal inquiry into the actions of Alabama's coaching staff

* Independent, 3rd-party panel holds Alabama attempted to silence players from blaming coaches for dirty tackle incident

* Nick Saban and his DC both resign in a spectacular press conference televised nationally.

* The SEC bans them both from competition _for life_. 

* The SEC tells Alabama they have to have a 3rd-party report explaining what they will do to fix the systematic issues that led to it or they will not compete in the 2018 season.

* Alabama meanwhile hires a famous old coach who was semi-retired. 

* Alabama releases a report, the SEC says it shows insufficient commitment to reform and keeps the season ban in place. 

* Alabama will now be relegated to the SoCon after the season. 

That is everything that's happened up to July in what's otherwise a minor sport in Japan. 

Since then:

* The player who set it all in motion returned to the game with the blessing of even the opposing team in that fateful game. 

* [Police do not plan to charge the coaches](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/11/b3fedfa79b94-american-football-ex-nihon-univ-coaches-unlikely-to-be-charged.html)

* The ex-head coach has filed a lawsuit against Nihon University, asking his firing to be invalidated

* [The team played a game in mid-November](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/11/17/more-sports/football/phoenix-triumph-return-field/), against a team made up of players from several X-League (Japan's pro-league) teams whose regular seasons had ended. Nihon won handily, 51-6.

My uncle is over and he's typically the nicest one, but for some reason he's being an ass this visit. My little cousin had a black boyfriend, he asks if she still has the nigglet boyfriend. Like WTF! is wrong with you! Why is it so hard for some people to be a nice person. She was going off to a drag show, she's in another state right now. She's dressed in drag and he's says ""oh some of that homo shit"" like not necessarily. You can dress in drag and not be trans/lgbt. 

My mom goes ""to each his own"" and he's like ""ya I guess"". Which my mom is NEVER like that. She tries to play to middle man when someone else is making fun or being an asshole, but if it was just us and my uncle wasn't here, she'd been the same way. 

I can't stand it. Like OMG we are in fucking 2018 Grow The Fuck Up People! Times have changed, change along with them.

Someone told me that test engineers don't write a bunch of logic code and what not but don't test engineers develop test cases for instance which do include logic and maybe some algorithms (though I haven't used any in a span of about 2 months)?

I have always wanted to do development, but got offered a software test validation position. This was the only offer I got since I graduated and I didn't have enough luxury to rescind the offer. It's not that I didn't want to do testing, it's just I would have preferred a dev job instead but having graduated with no internship experience, I guess I wasn't left with any other option.

This being my first full-time engineering job, I have learned a lot in the past couple of months, in terms of the software development cycle and how to work in a team. So far I haven't quite written anything from scratch - it's been mainly maintaining the already existing tests and making some modifications based on the new requirements.

It's just sometimes I think how will this job change my career prospects in the future; not having any significant background in testing, what's the scope of it? Do a lot of test engineers end up switching to development eventually? Would I be able to switch to development in near future? How hard would be the switch?"

Flairbot should have processed all the flair requests from the past two weeks or so. Flair requests before then have been lost. 

You should be able to go to [the flair site](http://flair.would.win) and send a new flair request to Flairbot. Flairbot runs every 5 minutes to process all requests.

If things are good, you should be able to update your flair to your hearts content.

I'm a Junior from the University of Waterloo looking for summer 2019 internships in the Portland area due to family reasons. Just wondering if you all know of any large employers of summer interns either in Portland, Beaverton, or Hillsboro, and where folks from PSU typically intern. I'd mainly be looking for PM, data science, or tech/management consulting jobs. Intel would've been ideal if they did visa sponsorship for Canadian undergrads - not sure if Nike is the same. 
Looking forward to hearing some thoughts and suggestions.
Best Regards, from Waterloo."
a4sd6n,4,2018-12-09,[22F4M] Quiet Jewish Girls Always Have The Best Tits,Loungette,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a4sd6n/22f4m_quiet_jewish_girls_always_have_the_best_tits/,"Now some of you may be wondering: just where the hell did that stereotype come from? Isn't that sorta weird and out of left field? Since when were Jewish girls stereotyped for anything other than big noses and obsessive grandmothers?

Well when you have a sample size of precisely one subject, outcomes are much easier to reach.

For this particular hypothesis, the subject in question was Kate Kleinberg, the nose of whom was actually quite diminutive and wonderfully complicated the remainder of her adorably girlish, mousy face that ensured she'd get carded for alcohol until she was at least forty. Her hair set a similar tone, falling across her shoulders and forehead in bouncy brown strands that would tickle at the tips of her eyelashes just above that set of bright blue eyes whenever she tilted her head down.

She did that a lot, by the way - tipping her head down. If there was one thing Kate had become intimately familiar with over the years then it would certainly be the view of her shoes. More famed for their loud and boisterous New Yorkian relatives on the 'State side of things, Kate herself was more of the silent sort - oh, sure, she was friendly enough once you got to know her, but that in itself was the hardest part. Coincidentally, considering the adjective used to describe her face shape, she was well-known amongst her peers back in high school for squeaking whenever she got embarrassed, which was pretty often. Less often now, in her early 20's, but it was still easy enough to spook her if you tried.

Adorable.

Yes, ""cute"" would probably be the first adjective that would enter the brains of most people she met with the shuffling and the squeaking and the overall aesthetic of such a meek young girl, but it would be lying to say that a number of other choice descriptors hadn't been tossed her way following her post-pubescent years.

For all her shyness, Kate was the farthest thing from an idiot one might imagine - naive and hilariously impressionable, sure, but not an idiot. Aside from the whole ""squeaking"" thing, her most famed moment in high school might've been her uncharacteristically emphatic reaction to receiving a B+ on her Chemistry midterm and, for as much difficulty as she had with looking other people in the face, strangely she seemed to infect many she spoke to with that exact same problem. Every shirt has cleavage when you've got a chest her size, and all those tight-fitting turtlenecks ever did was just showcase it even better! She distinctly remembered going red in the face for the better portion of an hour upon hearing one of her classmates use the phrase ""painted on"" in reference to such a sweater hugging at her bosoms, and had taken to only visiting the gym later at night after realizing just how much attention she was drawing whenever she used the treadmill.

---

So, what plans do I have tonight for the Jewish girl with the big ol' tiddies and atrocious social skills? Well, I'm sure you can at least get a *close* guess, considering the subreddit, but this prompt is ultimately pretty open-ended!

Obviously I'm looking for something factoring in her shy nature, but past that I'm fully open to ideas! I'll list out a couple of possible scenarios below, but keep in mind that they're hardly restrictive!

- Kate's been dragged along for some sort of road trip for either a class, work, or some other reason we come up with and ends up bonding with her trip-mate. Road-head is the ultimate form of bonding.
- Kate ends up getting dragged to her worst nightmare - a party - by one of her more extroverted friends. Since she's not much of a party animal she ends up awake after it starts puttering out and is surprised to have unintentionally drawn some attention. Maybe she gets pushed into joining a couple others in the hot tub, maybe she gets pulled into a game that turns out to have stripping involved, maybe she just gets chatted up by a cute guy that's hanging around.
- Kate's older co-workers at her internship takes an interest in her.
- Being shy and geeky, Kate is inevitably drawn to gaming groups, whether computer-based or classical pen and paper. Of course, a bunch of similarly introverted nerdy guys might not know how to behave themselves around such a good-looking girl.
-Kate is brought to an amateur photoshoot where she is continually talked out of more and more clothes.
- The classic study buddies sort of setup.

And so on! You get the idea, I hope. A lot of the above scenarios are written to be very purposefully flexible on how many male characters are involved and I would *love* if any of my potential partners would be willing to play multiple male characters, but that's completely an optional thing! I'll similarly offer to add in another girl just to slightly even things out, but no more than that and only if there are at least two guys! What can I say? I'm picky and a shy girl getting spitroasted is, like, *super* hot.

Some other kinks and general stuff that I'd like included:

 - Cumplay, the only thing that's pretty much a requirement. Spunk on me. Cum quick, cum a lot, cum on my clothes, cum in my food, just get a lot of splooge in a lot of places, y'know?
- Semi-public, which is basically just as close to public as you can get without getting arrested. Sure, she's shy, but I also mentioned she's *super* impressionable, right?
- Casual stuff. Grabbing her butt or stuffing your dick in her face un-announced, having her blow you while she studies for an upcoming exam, that sort of thing. Could happen before or after the proverbial ice is broken depending on how ""coercive"" you want these scenes to be.
- Casual group, which is basically just, you know, casual stuff but in a group setting! This can apply to people playing multiple characters or only one. For multiple characters obviously double+ teaming, blowbangs, and stuff like that would be loved along with Kate getting passed around a small group of friends or coworkers. In a scenario where you're only playing one, though, they can look but they don't have to touch. Maybe you like showing off to your buddies by having your new girlfriend blow you on the couch while you're all hanging out and chatting.
- Chubby guys! I love chubby guys. And any other sort of generally conventionally unattractive sort of dudes - something about the contrast makes me go crazy.

Again, none of those are required, just some stuff I like including! I don't do impreg, hard gore, bathroom stuff, or bestiality, but *most* other things are on the table, so be sure to ask if you want a kink included! Want to cum on the shy Jewish girl's feet? Then gosh golly, cum all over 'em!

Send me a message if you're interested! I only write in third person, but if you're only playing a single character and want to write in first person, we can work something out."
a4t0xi,12,2018-12-10,(M22) Currently laying next to my naked girlfriend (23F).... unsatisfied with my sex life..,Silver_Hawk_007,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a4t0xi/m22_currently_laying_next_to_my_naked_girlfriend/,"I have known this amazing girl for 4 years and have been dating her for almost a year now. She is in college, I am working.

She has to do internships every other semester for school. This make it kinda hard to be in a relationship and this is what stopped us from dating for so long before. We decided to take the plunge. About a year ago after speaking to each other everyday on and off for about 4 years. About a year ago right before we started officially dating we were having sex pretty often. Basically every time we would see each other. Multiple times a week and many nights multiple times a night (between 3-6 times per night) this eventually died off which I am fine with. 6 times in a night is kinda a lot. But right after this she moved away for 3 months. I went to visit her after about 2 months of her being gone and it was amazing. We had tons of fun spending time with each other during the day, and we would have sex in the night and the morning. 

She came back to where I live for school in August. Right before she came back she started a new birth control (nexplanon) we had sex 1 time before it had really kicked in but once it did it basically made her sex drive nonexistent. This was really hard we talked about it and figured out it was the birth control and she decided she wanted to have it removed so we could have a more healthy sexual relationship. Once she got started on the new pills as they kicked in we had sex 1 time it was pretty terrible because it had been so long I guess. But anyway.... 

We recently decided to move in together. And she will live with me when she is in town. We have been living together for 3 weeks now and she seems less and less interested in me. I feel like trapped now. I don’t want to have a sexless relationship like this. But I love her. I don’t know if it will get better. she goes away for her next internship in a few weeks and I’m hoping it will be better when she gets back?

I try to initiate but when I do sometimes she says I’m being to pushy etc. Tonight we kinda started getting intimate but when I started to make some advances she told me to “be good” and that’s all she ever tells me anymore. She says that we will get back into the grove and stuff but I don’t know. Tonight we decide to massage each other naked with oil and stuff I massaged her first and once I was done she just wanted to sleep without massaging me... Now she is currently laying next to me naked and has left me wondering how I got in this position and what I can do about it.

She doesn’t seem against having sex. She bought paint and a big canvas that she wanted to have sex on covered in paint to hang up in the apartment. But she never wants to any other time it seems and always pushes me away when I imitate. I’m overall just really confused... 

Does anyone have any advice or experience with this? I don’t know what to do but I don’t want this to continue."

a4uuom,24,2018-12-10,"I'm sure this sounds really entitled, but I don't want or need a power wheelchair...but that's all I'm being offered",dashestodashes,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/a4uuom/im_sure_this_sounds_really_entitled_but_i_dont/,"My local vocational rehabilitation office is helping me get a new wheelchair, because mine is too heavy and ill-fitting to really help me in the workplace. My insurance doesn't touch durable medical equipment unless you literally need it 100% of the time at home, and I really only need my wheelchair when I'm out of the house for work or to run errands. I try to stay as active as possible, so I even avoid using it when I think I can manage with just my walker or cane. 

I was hoping to get a power-assist device with the new chair, so I can keep going for longer and have less risk of injury. I also have pain in my shoulders, upper back, and arms/hands already, so I'm trying to minimize that as much as possible. Like I said, I still want to be as active as I can. I'm already overweight and struggle to exercise at all, and I really can't gain any more. 

The rehab tech guy and I have been communicating back and forth for the past few months trying to get this worked out. His higher-ups are insisting I use a power chair instead, which is cheaper for them than a power-assist device. I totally get that, and I know they have to choose the best option af the lowest price so they can serve as many people as they do. 

But I don't need a power chair! I don't need (or want) a scooter! I can't lift those out of the car with anywhere near the ease of the lighter wheelchair I'm asking for. The lightest parts of the models they've suggested are between 30-40lbs! I've had to lift my mother's mobility scooter into her car for years, I know how heavy these can be.  For me, trying to be independent and not rely on my husband to help me do literally everything, heavy pieces I have to put together/take apart in the parking lot whenever I need to go somewhere just isn't feasible (and my car is too small for a lift). 

I'm frustrated that I don't really have many options to work with. I'm hesitant to look into the cheaper power-assist stuff that ends up looking a bit more like a scooter (like the electric bike attachment things) because I can't deal with even more nasty glares, and again it may not be doable based on the weight. Right now, I told him to just focus on the wheelchair itself and I'll figure out about power assist or something. Some of the medical equipment websites have financing, and maybe I can find somewhere to try them out before I buy them. 

Just a little bit of a rant I had to get out. I hope I don't seem to entitled, because I am incredibly grateful for voc rehab and all they've done for me. I'm even impressed and grateful that, if I had truly needed a power chair, that would have evidently been a piece of cake for them to get. It's just that it doesn't fit my needs at all and I'm kind of frustrated. Even my doctor's documentation wasn't enough to prove that power-assist is the better option for me (though it's entirely possible there was some confusion and miscommunication there because this whole process has been a mess). 

I'm just hoping I can get the new wheelchair itself relatively soon. I start an internship in January, and I'll really need it to do my best work rather than being distracted by my pain and fatigue. "
a4vtqp,11,2018-12-10,My nmom kicked my sister out. I need to vent.,theantisocialburrito,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a4vtqp/my_nmom_kicked_my_sister_out_i_need_to_vent/,"A little background: I am the oldest of my family, and I have a 17 year old sister who I adore. Growing up, she was usually spared of my nmom’s wrath as I was primarily the target. I was verbally, emotionally and at the last straw of it, physically abused by my nmom, who is basically 41 years old and delusional. She will never take fault in her failures or her downfalls and always plays the “oh you’re the ungrateful one,” or “I put a roof over your head, I was pregnant at 17 and life was hard for me! Your life isn’t hard so shut up.” I left home at 19, guilty for leaving my sister and brother behind in a clearly unstable house. 

Anyway. A few years ago, my family moved across the country (U.S.) and I have maintained a good relationship with my sister regardless. Ever since I left, sadly my mom’s sights have shifted to my sister. 

Last night, my sister calls me hysterically crying. It broke my heart. She’s not very open with her emotions, so I’ve never heard her cry like this. She said she wanted to do something nice for my nmom, so she started cleaning the house, only to be confronted by a drunken nmom, who had apparently driven drunk earlier. The argument escalated, my mom went on her usual ranting to try to bring my sister down, saying she was worthless, ungrateful, selfish and horrible. She berated her for hours and my sister kept trying to stand up for herself, telling my mom she’s never been there for us and that my sister has depression but my mom would never care and tell her to suck it up, so she feels like she can’t talk to my mom. Of course, my mom started saying my sister doesn’t have a right to be depressed and she has a good life, that she (my mom) was pregnant at 17 so my sister’s problems don’t matter. She basically one upped her problems the whole time instead of considering her feelings. “I’m the adult, and you’re the kid so you have to deal with it. I have so much power over you, I’m your mom.” Fuck her.

Eventually, my sister screamed that she’s going to get emancipated. My mother took her phone and keys and made her scrub the bathroom. My sister stood up for herself again, and then my mom told her to get the fuck out. My sister had five minutes to pack, all the while flinging my hysterical, violent mother off of her. My mom then threw her out and texted my dad (whom she’s divorced from and belittles constantly), saying “hope you have my back with (my sister).” Laughable. As if my father would take her side over his own daughter. He knows of the problems there and feels like it’s his fault too for not intervening sooner. 

She left to my dad’s and said she’s never going back. Today she’s going to go get the remainder of her stuff with family, and she’s terrified. She feels extremely guilty, and she keeps saying it was her fault the fight escalated and that she said she’d never leave my little brother. I told her she’s got a right to be happy and selfish at this point, as she needs to get her life in order, and cutting ties is the only way. She continues to stand by her guilt, apologizing for everything and beating herself up. 

At this point, I’m here for her as much as I can be. I knew this day would come. I’m feeling a little guilty too, because I keep thinking, if I never left, I would’ve been able to be near my siblings. I would’ve been able to keep the abuse from targeting them. I wish I could do more for my sister, but in my heart I know she’ll be okay. She’s starting an internship at a zoo next year and she’s got my dad to stay with. I told her I made something of myself and carried on after all the madness, and she can, too. I feel like all my words are just cliches and don’t really help. My husband and I have been sending her money every once and a while to help with gas. But now that she’s out of the house, she can get a job and she has the opportunity to live with a cousin rent-free.

I just wanted somewhere to vent. I’m very sad, trying to hold it together. Angry at my mother and resisting the urge to text her and tell her what a piece of garbage she is. I hope my sister gets a hold of her guilt and throws it away, because that’s my mom getting to her. If anyone has any kind words or tips, please let me know. Thank you for reading. "
a4w1xo,1,2018-12-10,(M21) Caught between a rock (F20) and a hard place (F21),ConfusedStressed129,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a4w1xo/m21_caught_between_a_rock_f20_and_a_hard_place_f21/,"I (M21) recently went abroad for the second semester of my junior year of college. While I was abroad I met an amazing girl (F20) whom I dated for the five months that I was there.

We decided to make the most out of the time I was there and filled it with as much activities and couple related events that one can think of in a five-month span. Jointly, we decided that breaking up would probably be the best bet once I leave because of the huge distance between where her and I live.

Once I came back to my home country, the break-up wasn't smooth and twice-a-day video calling etc. continued. The 'L' word was exchanged and things were in a weird limbo place. Due to the fact that it would still be a full year until I graduated, no long term plans or goals were set. I learned after being home for a month that she had made out with a guy at a club ten days after I left as an attempt to see how it felt -- and she hated it. This broke me, and I decided to take a month break from her, I needed this to get my bearings and attempt to try my best to get over her. She hated the break, I hated the break, and with many relapses, the month passed and we were not better.

I couldn't get her out of my head as my girlfriend, and she was the same with me as her boyfriend. Her cold demeanor was something that I had grown accustomed to due to her thick skin serving as protection from emotions as a whole. Thus, I was emotional, she was emotional in a different way, and it didn't mesh well leading to a second break initiated by her. These breaks seemed to be necessary, they were leading us to get over one another for, at minimum, the year that it would take before I graduated and got my life sorted.

In this time, I rekindled a friendship with a girl (F21) from my university. I needed to get over the international girlfriend, so I decided to go on a few dates with the local. The natural progression occurred and she became my girlfriend. I immediately got cold feet and talked to her about it on our one week anniversary.

Things were too different from the amazing relationship I had while abroad. I decided to give it a chance, stick it out, and see if things change and sparks fly. Fast forward to now, two months in. The sparks aren't there, and to me, I'm at a loss as to what I should do. The local girl is very nice, but the sparks aren't there for me. I wish that they were, but I think about the international girl every day.

I've made the decision to do everything in my power to go back abroad to start my career and so I don't have the what if scenario playing in my head with her for the rest of my life. All of this being said, I still have not talked to the international girl since September out of respect for my current girlfriend and my own feelings. Also, my current girlfriend is left in the middle of something she is totally unaware of.

I understand answers will say, ""Break up with her"", or call me a bad guy, but with career thoughts, classes, internships, finals, love life, family, etc. it's easy to be caught in the middle of it all and take no action at all. Any help would be amazing from this wonderful community, and I look forward to the replies. Thanks.

TL;DR I've gotten myself into a confusing situation involving two girls and a lot of stress with thousands of miles/kilometers between it all."
a4wrsl,28,2018-12-10,Should I tell Ex-SO's new gf that he sexually assaulted me?,RobotFalafel,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/a4wrsl/should_i_tell_exsos_new_gf_that_he_sexually/,"This is something I need to get off my chest, but I'm also really looking for advice in this situation because the guilt has been eating me up.

When we were dating, ex-SOs plans at the time were to get a return offer at his internship (out of the country) and work there full-time, so he would be far far away about a year after we broke up.

Well apparently he didn't get that return offer and decided to do a Master's instead...at the same university. Which means two more years of bumping into him on campus. Greaaaaat. But I could deal with that, and if that was the worst art I would never be writing this post.

However, about a month ago my best friend lets me know that Ex-SO is dating an acquaintance of hers. I have tried my very hardest to just avoid him and not get into any drama involving him, however I kind of snapped at that point. I BEGGED her to tell him that he had sexually assaulted someone in the past and was abusive. She claimed she didn't know the girl well enough and didn't want to get involved.

I found the girl on Facebook (I know, I know) and thought about messaging her myself but I don't want to be a part of a narrative where I'm 'a clingy, bitter, crazy ex-girlfriend trying to ruin all of his relationships'. Not letting him justify his shitty behavior by calling me 'crazy' is something very, very important to me. Especially because we run in the same circles.

This was over a month ago. The guilt of letting someone be abused and possibly sexually assaulted and having to go through what I went through is burning me up inside. I feel so guilty doing nothing when its possible I have the power to prevent this from happening to someone else. I really could not care less that he's dating someone else, this isn't about that. I just feel like a bystander to a sex crime basically.

TL;DR: My best friend told me that my abusive, sexual assaulter ex is dating an acquaintance of hers. I feel like I can't stand by and watch what happened to me happen to someone else."

I also kept thinking about the things I was enjoying since I wasn’t smoking things like spending time w family, eating out w friends, playing video games, reading, I felt as if I started to smoke again I really wouldn’t be attentive to those things anymore.

a4xlpk,3,2018-12-10,"Going back to school full time, will be running at deficit for 2019, any tips?",theaccountant91,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a4xlpk/going_back_to_school_full_time_will_be_running_at/,"**Background**: 27 M laid off from sales job mid May, was planning on going back to school for second B.S. in accounting in August 2018 anyways. Just completed first semester as full time student - secured part time internships for spring/fall in 2019 paying $20-22/ hour. 

Will be netting roughly $1600 per month from internship - 24 hours/week  at $20/hour.

Before my monthly expenses - wanted to post some personal debt/equity info:

* Checking account: $21,000
* 401k - $21,500 
* Student Loans: $13,000
   * Deferred payments of 200/month because I'm in school - average 3.4% interest rate. 
* Owed on car: $5,500
   * 2015 BMW 328i - very small dent in bumper. bought for $21,500 last year with 34,000 miles. Prob worth $18k now.

Right now living at home, my parents are moving out of state, but are allowing me to take over their rental property 2 bed/1bath house for $800/month starting April 1st, 2019. So I should be able to save ($1600\*3) - (800\*3) = $2,400 before moving out.

Now for Monthly Expenses - starting April 1st, 2019. 

* Rent (starting April 1st) - $800
* Car Payment - $300
* Car Insurance - $175
* Internet - $100 - est
* Electric/water - $100 - est
* Health Insurance - $60
* Food/Entertainment - $400 - est
* Gas - $60 

Total - $1,995 

My take home from work will be $1600, so I will be running a deficit of (395) for roughly 9 months. (3,995) for year. I will also have to pay tuition for Spring, Summer, and Fall of 19. Roughly (5,750 total)

This is barring any emergency expenses, car repair, furnishing apartment, etc. So my checking which I consider my emergency fund will be depleted as follows. 

21,000 + 2,400 - 3,995 - 5,750 = $13,655. 

This was a huge decision to not find another sales job and go back to school, I know it will pay in long run, but just feeling the stress of depleting my savings I worked so hard for the last 3 years, and also not contributing to 401k at all. Will graduate December 2019 hopefully with full time employment as staff accountant (50-60k) and pursue my CPA. Is there anything I can do to lessen the blow to my savings? I realize it might look more like 10k because of unexpected expenses through the year. 

Thanks for reading. "

My interests reside mainly in technical theater. This past summer, I had an awesome internship working in the running crew of a fairly well-known theater, and I'm back in school now for my senior year.

 I'm feeling pretty down because my school doesn't have a good theater program, and no one in the program shares the interest of technical theater with me. I only need 20 more credits to graduate, so I'm really close to being done. 

I was telling my dad this morning how I'm sick of being at this school that doesn't have optimal programs for my desired career. He immediately became irate - he worries because I'm not having fun with my senior year, and that I have no friends (this in particular hurt me pretty bad - I feel I have few friends because there aren't many people here that share my interests). I really badly want to get my senior year over with and go to college, but he wants me to have the ""normal senior year experience.""

So now, as well as feeling like I'm being held back from my passions, I've learned my father thinks I'm not normal because of this. 

I feel really, really shitty today.

I graduate in May, but I am a graphic design major. Though my degree isn't in computer science, this kind of work goes hand in hand with designing web pages and coding. It would be a great stepping stone for me, and it pays fairly well for my area. It is a small school and I don't believe I'll have much competition as it is only a community college, and it is only being advertised to students, but I want to give the best impression possible. 

I have an extensive background in computer science. Mainly hardware and software, and although I'm no expert, I'm no stranger to networking and diagnostics either. I'm driven, eager to learn, and goal oriented. Most of what I know is self taught, which I personally find more impressive than learning in a classroom as it takes discipline. I am also currently teaching myself HTML and CSS, and soon I'll move to JavaScript, as well as trying to save money in order to take the tests for CompTIA A+ and CCNA. They're just insanely expensive. 

I have included my skills, knowledge, goals, motivation, and everything relevant I can think of in my resume, but I SUCK at writing a convincing cover letter that sets me apart. Also, unfortunately even though it is an internship that has the potential to turn into a full time position, the head of the IT department doesn't do the hiring. Because it is still a work study position, there is one single woman in the financial aid department that places the students for work studies. 

Can someone please, please help me write a unique cover letter than just screams, ""IM BETTER THAN THESE OTHER PEOPLE. PICK ME!""

Also, I'm a nontraditional student. Well, sort of. I'm married and almost 27 so I'm about 7-8 years older than most of the other students. 

I need to have this finished within 20 minutes or so so that I can submit it before other students are able to. I'd like mine to be the first application, resume, and cover letter seen. 

I know I'm asking a lot of complete strangers, but please. If you're skilled at these things and you're feeling generous, I could sincerely use the help. My family could really use this job. Not only for the money and experience, but for my own mental health. "

I don’t want to accidentally make a mistake and have a problem with the IRS if Turbotax wouldn’t be able to handle it accurately. 

I tried to keep it brief and concise, these are the relevant factors:


* recently married this year, filing jointly, parents may try to claim us as dependents


* both of us have had legal name changes this year (updated already with SSA)


* I work 3 W2 jobs and have been withholding at the higher single rate. My spouse will not have income to report


* I also earned income out of state for an internship and paid taxes to that state (MO), no tax agreement between Missouri and my resident state Ohio


* both college students needing to file 1098Ts and document for student loan interest paid 


* earned just over $600 as an independent contractor that I understand I need to report, will not be given a 1099 for this


Again I’m just wondering if all of this is enough to warrant paying a professional to handle our taxes to make sure everything is done correctly and to have help in case the IRS asks for anything else. Usually I’d use the free Turbotax service. Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated, and I can elaborate on any of these circumstances if needed! Thank you. "

I brought it up years before and he mentioned how maybe in the future he sees himself with a family. I recently asked him again about marriage and I was not giving him an ultimatum at all, just wondering when (what age) he sees himself committing to me ( I told him I'd like to before I turned 35). He was clearly hesitant about the question and he told me that he was not sure he is ready to commit, if ever. It is not even necessarily a financial thing (he just landed a high paying engineer position). He says that he is not ready because he is not the ""man"" he wants to be yet (idk what he meant by that)...After a minutes of trying to understand what he means (like is he just with me as an option?), my conclusion is that he does not want to ever get married.

Our love story is honestly not one that I enjoy telling people. We started as friends, then sex buddies, then finally after I asked him if he wanted to commit to me, he asked me to be his gf. Comparing to the past, I think he has issues with commitment. Now, the reason I am having trouble with this is due to a few reasons, 1. I am getting older 2. I am currently in school and financially dependent on him (I worked while he was in school to help him out and I have only been jobless for the last year of my school term because he said he wanted to return the favor). anyway breaking it off would mean I may throw myself into the streets. 3. I am getting this huge guilt in my stomach that I have not respected myself for years, just throwing my self to him when I know there are men out there that would not treat me like an option.

I am honestly feeling beat down because I spent 8 years with a man and he couldn't see me in his future as a wife...I am trying to stay emotionally strong while also trying to plan my future not relying on him. I have started to look for internships and plan to apply to jobs once I graduate in Spring 2019. I just don't know what to do right now as we are still texting...Oh by the way we are in an long distance relationship. I caught him talking to a girl on Facebook before but nothing ever got physical. He of course apologized, but trust never fully returned. Someone please just tell me what to do...I'm suppose to see him in 2 weeks for Christmas but I don't know if I should"
a4zee8,44,2018-12-10,"My origin story (M, early 30s)",iWatchFuckedUpPorn,Rapekink,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/a4zee8/my_origin_story_m_early_30s/,"True story, not fantasy.  


I grew up in a small town, and bisexual men were simply not a thing at all there and were definitely not socially accepted. I never felt emotionally attracted or ever felt the desire to date a man, and I LOVE being with women, but I occasionally want to fool around with a guy. Everyone knew everyone in my small town, so it wasn't really an option to experiment until I went to college.

During college, I got an internship at a corporation in a nearby major city, and decided that was the perfect time to experiment! I met up with a couple of guys and a tranny or two, and played oral only for me, but I fucked them.

I ended up meeting another guy off the internet, who was physically my type. 6'2'', fit and muscular, and good looking. We'll call him E. We met up, went out on the town for a few drinks, and came back to my apartment to get busy. I was a little drunk at this point, but not hammered. I should mention, I'm not a small guy by any means. I'm an avid lifter, and I'm pretty muscular and strong. I would never have guessed I could ever be overpowered or made to do anything I didnt want to do.

Once we got back to my place, we each had another drink and started fooling around. I pulled out his cock and it was pretty fucking respectable, not as big as mine but still larger than average and pretty thick. I sucked his cock for awhile, and he switched off and sucked mine and deepthroated me like a fucking professional, and then he asked if he could fuck me. 

Mind you, I had never had anal, not even a dildo or anything. I was a little worried it was going to hurt, so I told him yea I wanted to try it but only with lots of lube, patience, and he had to use a condom, which he agreed to. He got us both another shot, then got a condom and the lube out. He put a finger inside my ass, which was a little uncomfortable but not too bad. Then he told me the easiest way for me to take it was bent over the bed, with my ass pushed out. I didn't know any different, and figured he was the experienced one here, so I did as he told me.

He put the condom on, then got behind me and put some lube on my asshole, and started rubbing his cock on my asshole. He stopped for a second, and I looked behind me to see what he was doing, and I realized he had just pulled the condom off and was starting to try to put it in my ass. I immediately tensed up and said ""No stop wait, You have to wear a condom!"" and tried to push him back, but he grabbed my arm and pushed it behind my back.   


At this point, I realized he was WAY FUCKING STRONGER than me, and I was in a bad position to fight back (which was obviously his plan all along). He grunted something about needing my tight virgin ass, then leaned forward onto me shoved his cock to the hilt all the way up my ass in one very quick thrust. I felt like my asshole was being torn in half and struggled to get away, but he held me down and fucked me fast and hard with no mercy and no breaks.  It was the worst pain I've ever felt, I couldn't relax and I was so clenched up that every thrust I thought I was going to pass out. I kept telling him to please stop it was hurting so bad and I struggled for a minute or two but realized I wasn't strong enough to stop him, and he wasn't going to stop until he came.

He fucked me faster and faster, and then pulled out of my ass and shoved it back in, over and over. I could tell he was getting close because he started thrusting deeper and harder, and I told him please dont cum in my ass. He told me to take it like a good boy, and came deep inside me. I could feel his cum squirting deep into me, apparently he was very excited by his rape of me. (Hell, maybe hes a member of this sub. Who knows.)

Afterwards, he pulled out of me and took me to the shower to wash us off. He told me how great it was and he loved fucking me, and asked if I liked it. I was in shock a bit and my ass was bleeding, but I just told him yea it hurt but it was good. He laughed and said its supposed to hurt the first few times, and reached behind me and shoved 3 fingers back up my ass, then said ""See, you're more relaxed already""

We washed up, and then he said he had to go and left. He texted me a few times after that, but I didnt respond. I didnt really know how to deal with it and didnt want to talk to him or see him again.

Flash forward a year or so, and I realized I was thinking about getting raped and it was making me horny... except this time I was imagining I was the one doing the raping. As time went on, I got more and more excited by rough sex, CNC, and painal... now I really NEED it, but I don't really know how to make it happen in a safe/not real rape way. My wife is definitely NOT into it, as we have experimented a few times with it and she was not a fan.  


I dont know how to make her understand that this is something that I need to feel. I need the dominance and the roughness. I want someone who can be my submissive little whore in the bedroom and I can do whatever I want to them. My wife and I are swingers, but we don't really know where to find someone thats into this sort of thing and its driving me wild with need.  


Well, thats my origin story. Super fucked up, and now it made me fucked up too. Its a vicious cycle. Hopefully someone enjoyed this!"

I don't think that to be the case. A lot people have trace evidence of where everyone was at the beginning of Infinity War, and the Avengers are definite smart enough to put those pieces together.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest player in this is Banner. Banner knows Strange exists, and more importantly that he was attacked by Ebony Maw because he held the Time Stone. After the attack, Strange and Stark go missing and the space ship begins to leave earth, so I'm sure it's not a far stretch for Banner to assume they were on the ship. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Tony call Pepper and let her know he's going onto the ship?

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, Thanos shows up to earth with the Time Stone, so again the Avengers can assume that Strange and Stark were defeated somewhere in space. The only problem with that assumption is they might also assume they are dead. But any smart individual with some resemblance of a military background (i.e. Captain America) would know not to assume that until death has been confirmed with a body. So with that information, they should be looking for both Stark and Strange in space.

&amp;#x200B;

Going further, they can even link Peter to the space ship through Miles and FRIDAY. Although they really don't know who Miles is, Miles knows who they are, and could theoretically reach out to them to let them know Peter saw the space ship and went to help. Also, as Peter and Tony are heading up to space, Tony has FRIDAY send Peter the Iron Spider suit. If the remaining Avengers back at Avengers HQ in upstate NY look through FRIDAY's records of that day to try and piece together Tony's involvement (which I can't imagine why they wouldn't think to do this, especially Banner), they would be able to see that the Iron Spider suit was released and headed straight to the ship, so they could assume that Peter was with Tony.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now for how Tony is rescued - Many people have been talking about Rocket finding Tony floating in space, and I think that's exactly what's going to happen. Rocket is undoubtedly faithful to his friends, and will do whatever it takes to find them. Who just happens to be floating through space on the Guardians' ship? Mr. Tony Stark! And more so, Rocket and Thor know the Guardians were headed in search of Thanos, and that Titan might be one of the places they looked. With that information, I'm not saying that the Avengers would assume that Tony, Peter, and Strange were able to cross paths with the Guardians, but I think at the very least they would be looking for the Guardians' ship. Finding the Guardians may be of interest to the remaining Avengers, who are trying to build a team for their second fight with Thanos. They could put together a search and rescue for the Guardians ship, or begin sending signals into space in the direction of Titan looking for the ship, and intern end up finding Tony.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of this theory relies on assumptions, but that's basically how you do detective work...

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: So admittedly, it's been a while since I've seen the movie and this seems to be common knowledge. I think I've been conflating the fact that the Avengers don't know Tony fought Thanos with them not knowing him and the others went to space. My b..."

My college roommate used to pull this kind of thing pretty often, and it really just amazed me. Let me start off by saying, this roommate was and is a good person.  I wasn’t a perfect roommate either, so I’m not trying to paint a picture of perfection for myself. BUT, some of the things that happened had me livid. So here goes: 

There were 4 of us living in our apartment total. 3 of us had cars: myself, roomie X, and roomie Y. The fourth (we’ll call her roomie Z) did not have a car, so we very fairly split the parking rent in only 3 parts. We lived in a very urban area, so we had plenty of buses, Uber’s, Lyfts, cabs, and you could even walk safely around locally. Despite this, roomie Z decided pretty early on that the car-lessness wasn’t going to be an issue, because why not just repeatedly ask to borrow ours.

Two majors instances come up that I think are relevant to this sub.

Story 1: Roomie Z got an internship somewhere two days a week and asked if anyone would loan their car. Roomie X said absolutely not, no one would be driving X’s car but X. I had a job that required my car daily, so I said not possible. However, I did occasionally let Z take it out weekends or evenings to run errands or go grocery shopping. Roomie Y decided to be the nice person and lend the car for the internship for a while. FOR FREE. Didn’t even have to pay for gas and still didn’t have to pay for apartment parking. After a stretch of weeks, there came a point where Z was out with the car and the car was low on gas. Roomie Z asked Y if Y wanted it filled up. Y said yes of course and thanks. TWO HOURS LATER, Y RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FROM VENMO REQUESTING PAYMENT FOR THE GAS THAT Z HAD USED. Smh. Y came up with an excuse to stop loaning the car pretty quick after that. 

Story 2: As I said before, I did allow roomie Z to borrow my car on occasion and assuming it was for a short period. I never charged for gas or maintenance, and i was fairly lenient on where it went and who rode in it. Well, one evening, Z had an event to go to the next day and wondered if I would lend my car. I said that 1) I had to babysit the next day, and I could uber but would prefer to have my car and 2) my tire pressure light was on currently, and i hadn’t yet checked if something was wrong with the tire or if it just needed air. Z was understanding, and we moved on. 20 minutes later, I received a text message that said verbatim, “since I can’t use your car, can I borrow (my boyfriend’s name) car?” MY boyfriend!!! Who was in town visiting me, who didn’t live with us, who was not direct friends with Z, and who didn’t owe Z anything. I was floored. I simply said, “no way, you’re not insured or directly related to (boyfriend), so his dad would have a cow. Good luck.”  ... I later found out the event was located about 35 miles away in another town, and Z had already offered to drive friends to it. None of that was communicated on the request to borrow in the first place. I was left amazed for the entire weekend at the audacity. 


TLDR: roommate wanted to borrow our cars for free repeatedly, on a whim, without car insurance, without paying for gas or parking, and without scruples.. "

I've had the worst luck the last few weeks. I do not have health insurance as I'm just a lowly intern, and don't qualify for state insurance. I've been out of work for 2 weeks on bedrest with sinusitis and bronchitis, causing me to be late on a few bills/groceries. Of course, my manager is wonderful and is scheduling me for a few hours of overtime this week, but that won't show up until the end of December.  It's my first day back since being sick and I tripped over a tablecloth, popping my wrist backwards. It hurts a lot but I can't take any more time off without going under. 

I can't afford to go to the doctor for xrays and am just trying to buy a wrist brace at Walmart to tide me over so I can keep working. If I hadn't missed 2 weeks pay and it wasnt the holidays, I'd have enough to buy one myself, and I hate even asking for help. 

I'm willing to show the receipt to prove it's for a wrist brace as well as a pic of the brace if it helps. I will also be paying this forward once I'm back on my feet in a couple of weeks. Thanks in advance.

a50nok,2,2018-12-10,Back and Forth: Sharing my story,understood5,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/a50nok/back_and_forth_sharing_my_story/,"Here's a bit of my situation, wondering if any others have dealt with this or have an impression on what I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

I started smoking at 22, I am 27 now. I have had two or three major times (about 4 months) where I have stopped for various reasons (anxiety, preparing for drug tests that never came, enjoying the momentum and ""how long can I go?"" feeling). I have smoked weed and oil pens pretty much all day for most of this timeframe, but never more than a  gram a day. My GF continues to use vape pens out of my site. I feel that I self-medicated for anxiety and depression. The smoking both helps, and exacerbates the situation. Since I have stopped smoking, I have found myself drinking beer and whiskey much more often. On most evenings, I will have a glass of whiskey and 3 beers or so.  This is more expensive and makes me feel bloated and disgusting. 

I stopped smoking about 3 months ago in preparation for finding internship where the might have been the possibility of testing. I have been extremely anxious and cranky finding the site and interviewing, but it has worked out. I have landed my internship, was not tested, and am coming up on my winter break as a Master's student. Part of me wants to start smoking again so badly. And part of me REALLY just can't bring myself to do it again. I go back and forth so much.  

I feel like I need something to take the edge off of my stressful life. Smoking used to be something i never thought about. Now, I think about it constantly and miss doing it, but think I would feel terrified and guilty  that my Master's and internship and everything will somehow come crashing down if I start again, even though  have no evidence of this.

Is it ok to be getting high? Am I bad person for getting high? Why is drinking acceptable and smoking all of the sudden isn't for me? When will I feel like it's ""safe"" to go back to smoking?

&amp;#x200B;

Would love some thoughts, thank you."

So here's the update, I went in, he told me the internship offers $15-$18 an hour, I make $16/ h now, so I would try to get at least that. He assured me during the first half of the year I would get at least 30-40 hours a week, and he could keep me on during the off season as office staff and administration help if I work out, at atleast 25 hours then. He says he treats these internships as long-term interviews. They in past have mainly done auditing for all the local non-profits, but they are getting bigger into tax returns, and I would be the intern for the tax manager, which he said would be a good opportunity because they plan to grow that side over the new few years to get even with their auditing side. 

What I would be giving up:

-Health insurance, dental, etc (could get on my moms)

-$16/h at full time (34k a year)

-Tuition reimbursement (4 semesters left, $4k a semester).

Parents divorced when i was in middle school, and I have been living with my father and my sister. My sister has always received special treatment from my father and his family. I have always been regarded as the ""stuck up"" child, partly because I was a very tense and anxious kid, and also because I try very hard in school and work to this day, and some may regard my life as being ""boring"" (even though it is not, i just dont like bragging about my life like they do). I always knew something was weird, even as a little kid. My dad's family was not typical, they never took the time to truly get to know me, they never contact me first, and they always ""brag"" about how they would be able to cut me off so easily even though I am family. They would always hide stuff from me, for example after my blood-related uncle died, his wife suddenly disappear from the picture, and I still don't know why. They are very cold people, and they brag about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my sister kisses my dads a\*\*, and I have always been the one to question his parenting philosophies. When I say something behind my dads back, my sister is the one to go running and telling him. My sister also is not as ""stuck up"" as me, meaning she does not try hard in school, has no hobbies, and she does a lot of drugs/smokes a lot of weed. Two years ago on vacation while I was trying to meditate on the beach, my aunt came up to me and said I was ruining the vacation because I bring a negative ""vibe"" everywhere I go, and I need to be more like my sister who is ""free-spirited"" (aka doesnt care about anything). After a lot of thinking, I realized that they like people such as my sister because they are the ones who will be dependent on them forever. For example, they took her prom photos, helped her write a resume, and they buy her lots of gifts and clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am 20 and a senior in college. My dad has a long track record of doing things that include installing security cameras inside of our home, setting strict curfews, taking away my car for small little things and threatening to stop paying for my education, snooping through my room, and special treatment of my sister. Things got really tense when I called him a narcissist, and he chased me down the porch and harassed me for my keys. I eventually moved out after being yelled at for snooping through his room in retaliation to him snooping through mine (yes, immature. i know) I went to go live with my Borderline mother (who is an addict). She was very annoying and eventually ended up going to rehab in October, so I needed to get out again. I moved back in with my Dad.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving back in has reminded me of the special treatment that my sister gets. When I was 18 (my sisters age), I was not allowed to hang out with boys, sleep over anybodys house, drive. I got caught with weed and a bottle of beer and it was a HUGE deal. My sister has MULTIPLE bottles of vodka and wine just sitting in her room, she drinks glasses on wine in her room, she has weed/dabs literally just sitting On her dresser for everybody to see. Nobody cares. She has guys over all the time, my dad sees them walk in on the cameras, he doesnt care. Everything is paid for with her, she has zero debt, and he will probably help her get a job. Me, I am 40k in debt, have zero connections, and have to work for everything I have. I got a really good internship in NYC and when I saw him after calling him with the news he said ""you over it yet?"". He is always the type to not let me be happy, he always tells me im getting over my head etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I have felt quite worthless as of lately, as I have realized that I have never truly been wanted/ been able to help people. Growing up, my father never let me do anything on  my own. He was always hovering over my shoulder and constantly criticizing me. Gods sake, I couldn't even make my bed right... he would always unmake it and make me redo it and it was NEVER RIGHT. Beyond that, he would never teach me anything useful. He's in finance and never taught me what a credit score was, that credit cards are good, etc. And when I called him out for this his excuse was ""well you shouldve asked"" HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING I DONT KNOW EXISTS! I haven't been given what everybody else has been giving, I will always be a ""kid"" in their eyes. My cousin gets a BMW, and then I consider buying one and they yell at me saying ""I don't need it."" My cousin and sister can go out until the crack of dawn and have drugs in their room, and when I do i am told that I need to ""chill"". I feel like I am good for nothing, I have nobody in this world that I can help/provide for. As a woman, this makes things even tougher.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Kyle. I am a 17 year old (18 days from 18 years old, lol) who has been programming since 2012. About a year ago I started doing freelance WordPress work on Upwork. In that same amount of time, I was able to land an internship that I will be working at full-time out of high school. However, until that happens, I need to make a little extra cash. The past year has shown me that freelancing is just not for me. I simply cannot deal with the crappy clients that Upwork tends to bring. On top of that, I find it **very** hard to motivate myself to do work for someone else (oddly, I didn't have that problem while working full-time at the internship).

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I am thinking of creating a WordPress theme. I just don't know if it is the right call though. There are **SO** many WordPress theme already available, and I feel breaking into that market would be extremely hard. On top of that, I think my time would be better focused on learning a new technology like React.js or Vue.js, where jobs seem to pay 2x more than WordPress jobs do. However, I do really enjoy creating WordPress themes and I think it could be a possible way to generate some residual income.

&amp;#x200B;

So, how would I go about creating a WordPress theme? Should I plan out every single feature ahead of time, or should I just jump right in? Should I take a look at other successful themes and try to copy them or should I come up with something completely unique? I just read another Reddit post where a guy said he tried to come up with something unique and it completely failed. He only found success when he made his theme appeal to the masses. I am thinking I should do the same, but what exactly would that be?

&amp;#x200B;

I probably seem like I don't know much of anything right now, but all I am trying to do is to get some solid advice. That seems to come in the form of asking some dumb questions lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR;** Should I even attempt to create a WordPress theme since there are already so many, or should I just bite the bullet and chase my dream of having a little residual income from WordPress? Or, should I scrap WordPress entirely and focus on something like React.js or Vue.js?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks guys. I really hope someone responds. I am in need of some advice right now :)

Please help,330thoughts,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a525gu/depression_and_deathhealth_anxiety_please_help/,"Hello, stranger. I am writing this because I am desperate and I am hoping that writing this will somehow calm me down. It's also very late and I don't dare call or wake anyone up, so this will do for now.

I don't know anymore if this is anxiety or depression or everything combined, but it's getting really scary and I don't know how to cope with it anymore. Lately, almost every night I think about death, about getting sick, about dying young, about losing everyone that I love. It's heartbreaking.

A little background story about all this: I've been shy/anxious all my life. My parents thought I was shy when I was little because I've always started crying whenever a stranger (to me) would start talking to me or when my parents introduced me to someone. They categorized it as shyness, I think it was more, considering my situation now. I've always been the quiet kid, even though in middle school I was getting along just fine with other kids. Fast forward to high-school, I started being depressed. First year of university, had to go to another city to study, first time living alone, that's when my depression got really bad. I literally thought I was going insane. I couldn't go to uni for a while either because I hated having to small talk to my classmates or trying to make friends. I have severe anxiety. 
I considered jumping out the window (6th floor) a few times while I was at uni because I couldn't take it anymore so I eventually went to a shrink. Only a few sessions, couldn't afford more. It worked for a while. Last year of uni I got really depressed again because of all the pressure and simply because depression decided to come back.

I've met my lovely boyfriend, who has been so supportive and really been trying to understand what I'm going through, in a CS match. Yeah, I know, what are the odds. I didn't think of it more than an internet thing, we've met 4 times now. (he's from another country.) for a while he helped me ignore my depression but it came back.

My anxiety didn't allow me to get a job. I feel useless and I feel like a burden. I think about it constantly. I went to a few interviews but I broke down in tears the mornings I had to go and had panic attacks so I gave up. The closest to a ""real job"" was my internship in university, lots of panic and anxiety attacks happened.
Recently I've developed a pretty severe health anxiety. Every single thing that's wrong with my body has to be cancer. Every little numbness, anything out of place. I thought I had throat cancer, had to go to the Dr to check it out. I thought I was having heart attacks, had to go to the Dr to check it.
Every single night I keep googling symptoms and causes and all that hoping that they will tell me that I'm wrong. Once I start crying I cannot stop until late in the morning and it keeps snowballing.

My boyfriend offered to pay for going to the shrink but I refused. We're planning to move in together in a year or so, and he's not doing great with money either, and I don't want to be a leech, I already feel guilty.
I wish I could have a job and work and have my own money, move in with him and help with the bills and all that but I feel hopeless and now this health anxiety and the depression I feel like they're literally killing me slowly. But I know I need help. I don't know where to start. I feel so lost and it hurts so much having these thoughts every single day. I feel like I'm wing sucked into a black hole. I don't know how to get out of this.
I want to hear some advice on how to cope with this. Or some stories on how you got through. I'm lost. Please. "

Georgia Tech - The thread curriculum where you get to choose a specific focus within CS (security, human interaction, systems, etc.) seems really valuable.  Haven't visited but heard it is a good location as well.

It usually meant my fwb and I would fuck like rabbits. Or rather he would fuck me. It was the spring semester of my first year of college. Mark was my fwb and we had great time during the fall semester break for the first time. Ever since we kept in touch.

I landed in the afternoon and hit a bar in the evening catching up with old friends. They picked me up and we had a couple of rounds of drinks when I get a text from Mark. He had night shift and he was so eager to taste me. I tell him, may be we have to meet the next day.

It usually meant Mark would text me and we would meet at an always empty parking lot in a corner. He'd leave his truck and jump into the backseat of my car. 

He'd start kissing me hard. I'd undo his pants and play with him; he was always already hard. I'd kiss my way down his stomach to his thick cock and lick him slowly. Then I would envelop his hardness in my mouth. 

Sometimes, I was impatient and just wanted him inside of me. He would make me wait and slide a finger deep inside of me, making sure I was hot and wet and begging for it. Or he would make me suck his dick pushing me holding my hair right in his fist.

I'd lay down in the back seat of my car for him to climb on top of me. He would then rub his big cock against my opening and bury himself slowly, completely into me.

We'd fuck like this, he'd come after 15 minutes, and he'd stay hard inside of me. Then we'd fuck again.

My friends explain their night plans and it quickly became obvious that they went home or to their boyfriends. I text Mark asking for a ride home and tell him he might get a quickie if he can rush and drop me home. At least I could fuck him for offering a ride.

I get a text back telling he will pick me up in 10 minutes but I might have to fuck his friend. I don't understand what he exactly meant but wait for him. When he picked me up it was his friend Bill driving a car and Mark grins and opens the back seat door still seated. He moves farther as I get in.

After some introductions, we start moving. I tell Bill where to drop me. Mark talked to Bill about how he first spotted me as an intern. We hardly crossed the parking lot when I saw his arm go around me and pull me closer. I leaned against him with his left arm drapped over my shoulder. 
Immediately, his hand slipped into my dress. From the connor of his eye Bill could see Mark's arm around my shoulder as he began fondling my tit with his left hand, my tit was almost out of my dress.

I turned slightly and leaned further back against him putting my feet in the empty seat beside me. He could now reach both of my tits easily with his left hand. Bill saw all of this from the corner of his eye and the mirror. He adjusted the mirror twice already. I whispered to Mark asking him what he was doing. He simply asked me to relax and enjoy our time together after a long time.


Mark spoke to Bill throughout this action. It was as if he was tending to both of us. Suddenly, he asked him if he liked what he saw in the mirror. The car came to a stop at a red sign. When Bill turned sideways in his seat to answer, Mark didn't move his hand from my tits but continued to fondle me openly, his hand massaging one of my tits then the other. Bill watched Mark's hand inside of my dress, both tits were partitally out of the dress as he moved his hand from one to the other. He was mesmerized, he looked at me as our eyes met, a faint smile was on his face as Mark rolled my nipple between his fingers. The neck of my dress had been pulled down and both of my tits were exposed.

Bill said he thought I was beautiful and he hoped I didn't mind him admiring me. He though my tits were perfect. I didn't know, or couldn't think of what to say. When Bill resumed driving, Mark lowered the top of my dress below my tits leaving me naked to the waist. He continued to massage both of my tits and abdomen reaching as far as he could with his left hand. I arched my back and pressed closer to him, he pushed my dress down further well below my belly button.

Mark fumbled with his belt with one hand and after a minute or so had his pants un-zipped and loosened. The head of his cock was peeking out of the top of his shorts.

I leaned further back into his arms, his right arm cradled my body as I scooted back and laid my body acoss his lap, my head was cradled in his right arm resting on his chest, his left hand free to explore my now totally exposed body. I raised my legs and Mark pushed my dress down up to my waist. It has become a habit for me to not wear panties when meeting Mark. I now lay totally naked across his lap, his hard cock poking out of his shorts was pressed against the side of my body only inches from my face.

My naked body begin to stir and move with the rhythm of his touch, his hand was cupped over my pussy and his finger was inserted inside my cunt. Suddenly I clamped my legs closed as I was nearing an orgasm. My eyes met Bill's when I opened them. I partially sat up and saw Bill peering over the seat watching as Mark brought me to orgasm with his fingers. Bill parked the car at a corner of a parking lot. I sat all the way up and leaned my head toward Bill. As I swung my body in Bill's direction i sat my naked ass on Mark's lap. Mark reached around and fondled my tits with both hands as Bill watched. Bill whispered to me and asked if I was having a good time, I just shook my head yes, I was bent over in his direction toward the seat headrest. He whispered that so was he.

Mark continued to fondle my tits with both hands while I was sitting on his lap, as Bill watched my face. I sucked in a soft breath and let it out slowly then squirmed my naked ass on Mark's lap. It took a second for Bill to realize that Mark had slipped his cock into me from behind. My body begin to move in a slow rhythm to his strokes. This slow fucking motion lasted for several minutes as I rode his cock, lifting herself high then sliding down the length of his hard dick. I opened and closed my eyes several times, looking at Bill. The rhythm began to increase as Mark begin fucking me harder, my head moved backward as I sat up on his lap. He was fucking me faster and harder his hands now on my hips raising my ass to take his cock to the hilt. I braced my arms on the front seat as I bounced on his lap, my tits jiggled as he fucked me faster. I tensed and drew in another breath, he was apparently about to cum, I leaned back on his chest, his hand reached around for my clit once more and I again tensed and let out a soft moan.

Bill was watching intently, his gaze did not move from our bodies. Mark touched my clit as I arched backward against him, my body grew rigid for several moments as I shuddered with mild spasms then my body totally relaxed.

I remained sitting on his lap leaning back against his chest my eyes closed, his hands were still resting on my hips. I remained still, leaning back with his cock still inside me, when suddenly his dick slipped out of my cunt and hung free between her spread legs. I was still straddling his legs as I reached down and took his wet cock in my hand and began to stroke him slowly. His cock was semi hard and slippery, still covered with my wetness. Bill was focused on my pussy that was parted and still open from the rather large cock that had just slipped out. I continued to stroke his cock as it hung between my spread legs. He became harder as I rubbed it against my open cunt. Bill looked at me again and had a glazed looking smile. This was almost too much for me to stand, my body was about to explode, if you would have touched me with a feather I would have cum, my mind was having a hard time taking this all in.

I would have fucked Mark again once his cock was hard if we would have had more time. We all became aware that we were getting near the time, both Mark and I started pulling ouselves together. I tidied up my dress as he pulled up his pants. The car pulled up to my home enterance and brighter lights hit us, we all stumbled to get out. We said our goodbyes. Mark and I hugged and exchanged a brief kiss. He whispered and asked me to kiss Bill for his service. I was shocked for a second but Bill has seen it all. I kissed Bill and he turned that into a lizard kiss and didn't leave me for a minute. I entered my house and slept wondering what was in store for me for the next four days of my stay."

My NDad came inside from the backyard shortly after. I said, “oh I didn’t know you were home” and he said back, “where else would I be?” with a pissed off tone. I said, “I thought you might have been out with your friends like you were the other night.” He said, “last night?” Matter of factly. I responded, “oh I guess it was last night.” Then my sister came downstairs and he started screaming at me that once school finishes this semester I better, “pull my fucking weight around this house and that it isn’t a fucking hotel.” 

To preface, this is the first semester I’ve lived at home since starting college and I’m a senior studying electrical engineering. My internship that I got is close to my house so I decided to live here this semester after my NDad offered it so “graciously”. (Ever since I’ve moved back in he’s been trying to control every aspect of my life). I work 25 hours a week at my engineering internship and am taking 18 credit hours. I’ve tried my best to keep up with his expectations of me, but I didn’t even do a great job of taking care of myself while I was living alone given my course and workload, let alone cleaning up after him too.

He said, “you are either going to have to pick up your slack or move out of my fucking house.” I simply said okay and went upstairs. Now I hear him slammed doors and pounding things. Every time I hear it my heart races so fast. I don’t care how much it costs, I’m going to move out next semester. This is not manageable."
a52qbs,13,2018-12-10,I am at the lowest point in my life and I can't find a way out.,throwawaylifething,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/a52qbs/i_am_at_the_lowest_point_in_my_life_and_i_cant/,"Just gonna type this out in one go.

I started college in Fall of 2014, fell in love too soon and pushed that love to 3 years where we broke up beginning of 2018 at the turn of the new year. Within that time, I have not taken care of myself financially, educationally, and emotionally.

I have been flunking classes to where I am now academically dismissed this Fall semester with only 72 credit hours earned after attempting 124, and it wasn't until this summer I found what I wanted to do with my life. Unfortunately, I am now 100k in debt with the payments starting in March 2019 and I highly doubt the school will accept my readmission. 

I have failed my parents and my family who gave everything for me to succeed. They are wondering if I got back in to school for the Spring, but the school hasn't contacted me back yet after sending a few emails.

I have always been late on rent for the past few months, and I'm sinking in $2000 in credit. My current internship says they take employees and pay for their school. I have applied to many positions after being there for a couple of years now and they never contacted me about it for the past half year, and I have tried contacting HR about my applications which ended up all being denied. It's a job I don't want in the long run but it would be very helpful as of now, but my internship expires on the 28th of this month. After that, I have no idea what I'm going to do.

This year has to be the most depressed I have ever been going on a 6 year depression stretch now. After being told about my academic dismissal I knew my life was over. I haven't been looking forward to the Spring semester because I have a strong feeling I won't make it. Not counting down the days to the new year but more like counting down of me not making it to the new year.

And I promised myself I would never take my life because it is a selfish thing to do. I don't want to hurt and betray my friends and family. But most importantly I don't want them to have the $100k student debt burden.

I've been told I look a lot happier this year. But honestly I've been awake every night until 4am because my thoughts won't slow down about how much I have failed everyone in my life. It is torture and I can't take it anymore. I am trying to find something positive about this but I can't see a gleem of hope.

Whenever I visit home, I feel like a failure and they don't know how much deep shit I am in.

TL;DR: I fucked up my life financially, mentally, educationally, and emotionally. I don't know how to keep on going."

a541dj,51,2018-12-11,I let him [F]uck me how he wants.,bonjour_chat,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/a541dj/i_let_him_fuck_me_how_he_wants/,"It’s been a while! Do you guys still remember me? I missed you.

Over the summer, I saw an older man. He was in his early 40’s. I liked the idea of fucking an established career man, and he liked fucking a 21 year-old university student. It was a win-win for both of us. Warren was handsome — his hair was starting to grey, but he wasn’t losing it. He had a nice stubble and wore nice clothes. I liked how he always had a classic timepiece.

We met at a bar, in a very innocent way. I got lost on my way to the bathroom and he showed me how to get there. I complimented him on his tie and we struck up a conversation. Two hours later, he was fucking me against his closet door. I guess not so innocent anymore.

He liked hearing about my sex life, I told him all about the times I fucked my roommate. But he doesn’t know about this account... so shhh! He quickly figured out that I like being told what to do, spanked and choked, thrown about the bed. Once, we were making out on his couch and he ran his hand gently throw my hair, and then grabbed it forcefully. “I want to throw you on my bed, and fuck you,” he said. I nodded and he did.

One day, this past summer, I was just getting home from my internship when he asked if I wanted to have dinner with him. I promised my parents I would hang out with them for a bit, so he invited me over after. I don’t live far away so I said sure.

I was on the bus heading over to his house (I don’t drive because I suck at it and I support public transit!) when Warren texted me again. “Can I be mean when you walk in the door?”

“Yes, daddy.”

Oh also, I call him daddy sometimes. He doesn’t like it so much - but I do. Is it a bit concerning? Maybe. But I’ll figure that out in therapy.

I walked through the lobby of his fancy condo and said hi to his front desk man. I got in the elevator, heart beating. Walked to his door. Knocked.

Nothing.

So I knocked again.

Nothing.

I twisted the doorknob and it opened, I tiptoed in. He was standing at his kitchen island, cutting a lemon and putting it in his water pitcher.

“It’s rude to just walk into someone’s apartment,” Warren said, not looking up from his cutting board.

“I’m sorry. It was unlocked...” I slipped my jacket off and hung it on the rack. “I didn’t mean to.”

Silence. Just cutting lemons.

Warren finally looked up. He looked at me for a second, then said, “Okay. That’s fine. Take off your shirt.”

I hesitated. We’ve done this kind of thing before but never immediately. I wasn’t sure what to do.

Warren walked over to me after washing his hands. “You’re taking too long,” he said. He flicked the strap of my shirt. I quickly slipped it off, revealing my lace black bra.

“You know I like the red one. I’m disappointed.”

“I’m sorry, daddy. I fucked up twice now. I didn’t mean to,” I said. I looked up into his eyes, begging for mercy.

Warren smirked. He knew I was going to make it up to him. He suddenly spun me around so his body was pressed against my back. I could feel his erect cock against my ass. I wanted it so badly. He put his hand against my throat, choking me a little. “I’ve been waiting for this all day. I was sitting in my office thinking about fucking your little tight pussy all day,” he whispered in my ear. I almost moaned out loud. My pussy, officially soaked.

Warren undid the belt of my skirt, and quickly slipped it off. His left hand remained on my throat, while the right one rubbed my clit through my panties.

“Wet already? You want to be my little slut today?” Warren asked.

“Yes daddy,” I replied.

“Yes, what?”

“Yes, daddy. I want to be your little slut.”

“Good girl.”

He marched me over to his hallway, and took off his t shirt. “Get on your knees,” he ordered.

I complied, kneeling against his hallway wall. He stood in front of me in only his trousers. I looked up at him.

Warren ran his hand through my hair, and stroking my cheek gently, “Do you know what to do?”

I nodded. I unbuckled his belt, undid his pants, and pulled them down. I slowly took off his briefs, revealing his cock. I took it with my hand, licking it to get it wet. I know Warren loves how I suck cock. When we’re not roleplaying like today, he compliments me all the time.

I licked it all over, paying attention to the tip and balls. Then, I begun sucking. I try really hard to deepthroat him and gag a bit. He has one hand on the back of my head, making sure it doesn’t hit the wall.

“Oh baby, you’re a natural.”

He begins thrusting. I keep my mouth open, trying to take as much of his cock as I can. He fucks my mouth, treating me like a doll. I could feel my saliva dripping out of my mouth, falling onto my body and my bra. Normally, I tap out but I wanted to see how far I could go. I wanted to please him. 

Finally, he stops. He asks me if I’m okay, and I nod. He smiles, pulling me up in a deep kiss. He undos my bra and slips it off at the same time. I feel his hands on my chest, squeezing my nipples. He takes handfuls of my boobs as we kiss. Then I feel his hands on my waist, and he walks me to his bedroom, still kissing me.

He turns me around forcefully, and pushes me on the side of his bed. I’m bent over, feet still on the ground. I turn around to see his face.

“No!” he barks.

I quickly turn back around. I feel his hands along my body, and touching my lace panties that are still on. I feel his hand pull them to the side, and feel him push against my pussy.

“You like that?”

“Mmhm,” I replied, unable to muster a word.

“You like it when I fuck your little cunt?”

“Yes daddy.”

“Tell daddy you like it.”

“I like it when you fuck my little cunt, daddy.” I spit out. It’s hard to concentrate on repeating words when his fucking cock is pushing into you. I am really sensitive so it takes at least a dozen strokes to get a cock fully in me.

Finally, he’s able to fuck me completely. He starts off slow, but begins to slam into me while my face is buried in his mattress.

He pulls out, slipping my panties off.

“Get on the bed,” he said. I complied.

I’m lying on my back as he kneels over me. He spreads my legs out and puts a finger into my cunt while looking into my eyes. He starts to play with my clit while I quiver underneath him. Then, he gets on top of me and fucks me. I start to moan and he presses his hand on my mouth, trying to shut me up. I liked this. It was dirty. There was no need to shut me up, we were in his large condo alone. My legs are wrapped around him as he fucked me into an orgasm.

He got up and went to his drawer, pulling out a vibrator. Warren had me climb on top of him, and I slipped onto his cock. It was so easy now that I was possibly the most wet I’ve ever been in my life. As I grinded into him, close go another orgasm, he turned on his little vibrator and held it against my clit. It was heaven. He had one hand on my tit, squeezing. One hand using the vibrator.

He stopped and flipped me over so that he was standing behind me, doggy style. His cock never left my pussy so this was very hot. He began fucking me hard, one hand on my back and another holding a vibrator to my clit again. I think I almost passed out when I came again.

“Lie down,” he said. I did as I was told. He knelt over me as he came onto my tits and body. I gave his cock one last slurp.

“That was fun,” I said. His cum still all over me.

“Yes it was,” he replied, giving me a kiss. He helped wipe me clean. We continued kissing, passionately. I could feel his cock growing again as we made out against his window. The blinds may have been open.

“Why don’t you join me in the shower?” I asked.

Ookay I will continue this as my fingers are cramping. Thanks for indulging my procrastination :) Let me know if you like it! "

“Oh the same old boring thing, flowers” Your wife complained after you asked her if her class had bought her anything fun as they graduated and she wouldn’t teach them for two months over summer break.

In reality however the boys in her class had chipped in and bought her the most *pathetically whorish* lingerie set she owned, way more slutty and sexy than that pair of thongs you once bought her. She took her time and sent out a thank you snap to each and every boy while she wore it.

[Two](https://i.imgur.com/LM8UpuZ.jpg)

When you stepped into the bedroom with the fresh bouquet of flowers in your hand, your heart shattered. You were greeted by your wife literally gagging on a thick, meaty boycock atleast thrice the size of your own. And you could tell beyond any doubt that your wife was in LOVE with the thick meatpole she was making love too. What hurt even more was that she didn’t stop, not even for a second, even after seeing you. “Ms..” the boy panicked.

Your wife hushed him with a finger to his lips and just continued to gag on his fat cock, her ass in the air and her married pussy dripping on your bed.

[Three](https://i.imgur.com/MDvKyZF.jpg)

After that time you caught your wife fucking one of the intern boys at your job and you were to pathetic to stop her, even getting hard. She knew she had you around her finger. She invited him over to your house and you all sat down. 
“So, this is Kyle, and Kyle is moving in with us and he will sleep with me in our bed, you can take the couch or the floor...doesn’t make a difference to me.” She said, when you asked why with a tear in your eye she simply pulled up her phone and showed you the humongous cock on her phone and smiled “that’s why”

[Four](https://i.imgur.com/ADHgwuV.jpg)

Your wife found out that the boy she was babysitter for had gotten broken up with by his girlfriend and she saw it as the perfect opportunity. After the parents had left she told him to go shower. As he got clean she put on the lingerie you bought her and sat herself down on the couch with a balloon, it was valentines day after all. (It did hurt you a lot that she didn’t want to spend it with you, huh?) 

When he came out in nothing but a towel she called for him. “Timmy, I heard your girlfriend broke up with you, and that sucks. But to be fair that’s just how girls your age are, unpredictable. What you should go for instead are older girls, like me!”

it can happen in a few hours or many hours, but eventually i have to uninstall, reboot, reinstall again.

bitdefender free is a good antivirus, but i literally end up loading up a page, reload it and its broken. this is the seventeenth time.

If any of you work for the company, I understand you dont want to put more effort into the damn thing. But what if people install new browsers? what if the certificate keeps getting f\*\*\*ed?

can someone just add in a button to reset the damn root cert in all browsers, or add a new browser, or just export a new root certificate from the settings? if I could i'd invite myself to be an intern and add the feature for just a resume booster. its not hard. you literally just copypasta the same function it uses during install, add it to a button click event, and boom.

no new features added, no extra benefits for freeloaders, application that works with a simple update.

I guarantee you from programming experience, it would take less than 15-20 minutes to write that in.  


  
is there anything I can do? because If I cant debug this myself im fucking done already. ive wasted hours of my time uninstalling this over and over agian.  


the certificate is still held by firefox, the application just rejects it suddenly.

Though I wasn't working out through most of my weight loss, I was active daily as I live in the NL and bike or walk everywhere.  Fitness is the next step! I joined a bouldering gym before I left the NL and had taken the first steps into getting back into a workout routine... I am not trying to lose any more weight, but would like to tone up and build some muscle.  While I'm here on a tropical island, swimming and scuba diving will have to suffice (it's too hot for anything else!)  


So that's my story!  I just want you all to know that you can do it!  It won't always be easy, there will be setbacks... sometimes the scale is going to go in the wrong direction.  But it's ok.  Just keep at it.  You'll get there :-)  


As promised...

The common room wasn’t busy, but there were still about a dozen other girls lounging on couches and chairs, all first years based on their pajamas and piping.  None of them seemed shy that their nipples were visible, and in a few cases, their pussies, since some of them were sitting with a leg draped over a chair or couch.

“Is it always this...um…”  Regina paused.  “Informal?”

“You're free to be naked down here if you want, though you’d probably get cold.  I mean, we keep the temperature a bit warmer here on our side of the dorm, but seriously, my nips have been stiff for two days now.”  Regina glanced at her roommate, seeing she wasn’t exaggerating, then, when she saw what was on the TV and went white.

“What the hell?”  She hissed.  “You’re watching porn?”

“Watch the archaic the swearing, dummy.”  Kiera said, leaning in to whisper.  “And no, that’s Grey’s Anatomy.  Dr. McSomething-or-other...I don't really follow the show...is just fucking one of the new interns.  She’s got some nice tits, though.”  Kiera offered.

“But they’re, like, actually fucking.  Like, that guy’s a famous actor, and that’s his penis...actually penetrating that woman.”

“To be fair, that is how sex works...but it’s probably a stunt cock or something.  Half these actors have a ‘no fucking’ clause in their contracts these days.  The people who are really good at fucking on camera usually don’t stay on TV...they move on to movies.  It was bad enough when a few of the actors decided they didn’t want to be naked anymore...Shonda Whatsername killed off a third of the cast.”

“We don’t actually show this on TV where...um...where I’m from.”  Regina said.

“Those must be some boring shows.”

“Well, I mean, on network TV they simulate it, but there’s no nudity, definitely not fucking.  Only on premium cable will you see some nudity, more obvious simulated sex…but when you see that.”  She pointed to the couple still engaging in actual sex.  “That’s what we call pornography.”

“We have pornography.  It’s just all, like, fetish stuff.  I mean, they won’t show her doing him with a strapon, or him sucking her toes while he jerks off in her shoes or something...but crackers, they’re just boarding...in a *bed*.  That’s about as tame as it gets after 8pm.”  Once Regina got past the sex, the show was pretty much the same as she remembered it.  The cast was slightly different, but the stories were all the same, long-winded repetitive speeches included.  As much as she hated to admit it, she didn’t actually mind seeing some of the actors naked, and seeing a doctor walking around with an erection in his scrubs was funny.  After that was over, they watched a cop show, which didn’t have nearly as much nudity or sex, but still had a fair share.  Regina found herself giggling every time the gruff detective snarled ‘crackers’ instead of saying goddammit or whatever other religion-derived curse would otherwise be there.
After ten, they went back to their room, and Regina was actually feeling generally comfortable, for the first time in several hours.  She went to the bathroom to use the facilities and brush her teeth, a few other girls doing the same, one of which was completely naked other than slippers, and shortly thereafter she went to bed.

----

She woke up with a jolt, feeling her school bracelet vibrating on her wrist.  She looked at the clock.  It was six forty-five in the morning.

“I am not ready to get up this early.”  Kiera said.  She got out of bed, took off her babydoll, stretched, showing offer her compact body and small breasts.  She scratched at the edge of her bush, making Regina turn away.  “Out of bed, Reg.  We have ten minutes from when the alarm goes off to get to the bathroom.  Get your slippers and your robe,” she said, pulling on her own robe and stepping into her slipper flats, “and let’s get going.”  Regina stared back, confused.  Kiera didn’t even bother to tie up her robe.  “Oh, that’s right, you showed up late.  Don’t worry, it’s new to me too, sort of.  We report to the bathroom for inspection by the Dorm Mistress, and any lessons she might have.”

“Lessons?”

“What do think dorm masters and mistresses do, stand around all day and be bitchy?  I mean, they do that, *too*, but how are you supposed to learn the college rules and the fun stuff, if someone doesn’t teach you?”

“Naked, though.”  Regina said.

“What else are you going to be wearing before eight in the morning?”  Regina didn’t have an argument for that.  She got out of bed, shyly undressed, then pulled on her robe.  She felt slightly more naked than she had in the pajamas, even with her tied at the waist, but Kiera said nothing.

“So, we all just go to the bathroom together?”

“Well, it’s not synchronized or anything…”  Kiera raised an eyebrow.  “Look, just, you know, keep your mouth shut...listen, learn, try not to overreact.  I can’t teach you everything about living in this world, and mostly because I’ll never really know where the gaps are in your knowledge.  I mean, what if you call a sandwich a *muzzletup* or something, how would I know that?”

“I know what a sandwich is.”  Regina said.

“So, that’s one of about a trillion things I can be sure of.”  She took Regina’s hand and started leading her down to the bathrooms.  “Let’s get down there before Dominique gives us laundry hours for being late.”

----

“Okay ladies.”  Dominique the dorm mistress said when Regina and Kiera entered with a pair of other girls.  “We’re all here, and on time, which is a credit to you all for the first full day, at least.”  The dorm mistress was wearing a light blue robe of similar material to their own, sheer, but with some satin stripes to hide a bit of her nudity.  “Now, if you’d all remove your robes, hang them up and let me do my inspection, we can get you closer to a shower and whatever else you’re looking forward to this morning.”  Regina glanced left and right, taking a breath as the other girls all started taking off their robes.  She was nearly the last one naked, though Kiera seemed to be moving a little more slowly to help Regina not stand out so much.  They all hung up their robes on the hooks lining the nearby wall, and Regina realized she’d probably have to label some of her stuff in order to avoid someone walking off with it accidentally or otherwise, since everything was alike.  “Girls,” Regina gasped at the word, though she wasn’t the only one, “stand with your legs two feet apart, and put your arms above your head.”

“Yes, Dorm Mistress,” they all said together, doing as she asked.  The dorm mistress walked down the line of them, peering at their underarms, looking between their legs.  Most of the girls were styled similar to Regina, a little bit of hair, and waxed between the legs.  She saw a tall blonde next to her had a nearly full bush, though it was trimmed short.  The dorm mistress stopped at the blonde, slipped a hand between the girl’s legs, and ran her fingers through her pubic hair.

“You need a bit of a trim, Miss Culver.  I told you to consider waxing.  Take care of it after the lesson, please.”

“Yes, dorm mistress,” she replied.  Then the dorm mistress stepped in front of Regina.  She bent over, her larger breasts hanging free in her robe, and studied the hair at Regina’s crotch.  She reached out a finger and traced the line of her hair, then ran the finger along her newly waxed labia.

“I’m glad to see you made your salon appointment.”  She said, standing up.

“Yes, dorm mistress.”  Regina said softly.  The dorm mistress moved back down the line, caressing legs, telling some of the girls to focus their shaving in certain areas, knees, et cetera, and then she had them stand normally.  The dorm mistress checked her watch and went to the door of the bathroom, and held it open as two guys walked in wearing robes.  They looked the naked girls up and down, one of them smiling a bit, the other looking more nervous.  They were first years by their robes, and Regina instinctively moved to cover herself, though Kiera stopped her by lightly slapping her hand down and subtly shaking her head no.

“Well, I was hoping for more volunteers, but here we are.”  The dorm mistress said.  “You first years are always so shy, and any second years currently here are dorm masters or mistresses like myself...meaning we’re too busy to help in other lessons.  So…” she undid her robe and removed it, hanging it up with the rest of the girls, “it’s just us today.”  The dorm mistress was maybe five and a half feet tall, with large breasts, pale skin, and a full dark bush, trimmed, but completely covering her sex.  Her pink nipples hardened quickly in the cool air of the bathroom, and she paced over to the two guys, her round ass swaying gracefully.  She was pretty, full-bodied, but not overweight by any stretch.  Regina glanced around at the other girls and realized all of them were at least pretty, if not beautiful, not one particularly overweight, underweight, gawky, ridden with acne, or any other thing that people in her age group often suffered from.  She knew she fit in that group as well, though there were a few girls she’d definitely consider hotter than herself.  “Gentlemen, if you’d remove your robes, please?”  The guys were slightly hesitant, but they took off their robes, revealing their nakedness.  One of the guys was hard—and completely hairless, Regina noted—the smiling one.  The nervous one was neither hard nor hairless, trimmed down brown hair trailed from his navel to his sex.  “I figured we’d start out easy with this week’s lesson.  Shower sex.”  She moved to the nervous guy and took his cock in her hard, stroking him and teasing at his balls with her fingertips, he quickly got hard, and let go, smiling.  “Now you’re ready for the lesson.”

“Makes me wish I wasn’t hard.”  The other guy said.

“Oh, you’ll get your turn, smiley…”  The dorm mistress laughed.  “So, can anyone tell me what the three most important things are about shower sex...and by sex I mean anything that leads to coming, not just straight up coitus, okay?”

“Temperature?”  The blonde girl with the bush said.

“Yes...sort of.  It’s not just finding a comfortable temperature, but one that is conducive to the actual activity.”  Dominique went to one of the showers and turned it on, then another.  “Cold or scalding, neither works, the low end of warm is okay, but one of you is going to be unhappy, and seeing a lot of steam is sexy in the movies, but it leads to stickiness in real life.  Then there’s the issue of when boy A or boy B,” she pointed to each, “blows his load.”  There was some nervous laughter.  “If the water’s too hot, the come is very difficult to wash off.  That’s maybe not a big deal to you two,” she said to the guys, “but having to take another full shower after banging one out is tedious...and wastes water.  So, find a comfortable temperature for both of you, the cooler the better, and when the guy pops, when it comes times to wash it away, the colder the better.  Now what are the other two things?”

“Balance?”  A brunette said at the end of the line.

“Correct.”  The dorm mistress said.  “If he’s lifting you up to go inside, you need to brace yourself and so does he.  All our showers have grab bars, though technically you’re not supposed to be having sex in these,” she pointed, “except in rare cases like now.  If he’s taking you from behind, as long as you latch onto something, you’ll be okay, and if you're on your knees, just remember not to accidentally drown yourself under the shower spray.”  She laughed and the others followed.  “Remember, most people are fine during the actual sex, but when they start to come, balance tends to slip, no pun intended.  And the last item?”  The room was silent.  Regina glanced around, waiting another moment before speaking.

“Um, lubrication.”

“Yes, Miss Regina, and I’ll give you further credit for not saying it as a question.”  She walked back to her robe and removed a plastic bottle from pocket.  “This is your basic water-soluble lube, available at the bookstore in case anyone is wondering.”  More laughter.  “You,” she pointed to a short blonde with perky breasts midway down the line, “get in the shower with smiling boy.”  The dorm mistress walked over to the guy with the grin and took him by the cock.  “See,” she said, leading him to the shower where the girl was already wet under the spray, “I told you, you’d get your turn.”  He got in the shower with the girl and took a moment to run his hands over her boobs, tweaking her nipples.  She laughed a little but seemed nervous with the audience.  “Okay, Miss Ilyana, take his member in your hand and start working whatever magic you have.”  The blonde looked down at the guy’s erection.  The other students and the dorm mistress had naturally formed a half circle around the shower stall.  The blonde trailed her fingers up his scrotum and it tightened against his body.  Regina noted he was probably only about six inches in length, but without any pubic hair, he looked slightly larger.  The girl started jerking him off, pulling out toward her belly as she held onto his hip with her other hand.  “Not bad technique, Miss Ilyana, you’re both stable, at least.  How does it feel, smiling boy?”

“Um, I am definitely enjoying it, but I could technically do this myself.”

“Oh,” the dorm mistress turned to the class, “the smiling boy wants more.  Well, let’s try this first.”  She took Ilyana’s hand from the guy and squirted a glob of lube in it.  “Get back to it.”  Ilyana started again, and the guy visibly gasped, and her movements were much more fluid.  “I bet that feels way better?”  The guy nodded.  “It won’t last forever directly under the spray, but if she leaned over him or angled him out of the water, that small amount would probably be good until completion.  Now, there are oil-based lubes, but they’re apparently bad on the drains of these old buildings, so we don’t sell them at the school.  Oil-based lasts longer in the water, but it’s more difficult to clean up.”  The guy started coming, hitting the young woman right at the navel.  “Oh, well, that’s the end of *that* lesson, I guess.  This is why,” she turned to the class, “it’s important to have more than one volunteer.  I hope volunteers will pick up later in the semester, particularly as the third and fourth years return—it’s really better to have a half dozen guys at hand—but you can’t predict the interest in fucking the first years...I mean, in my first year, we had a line out the door, almost from day one, second semester, never more than three guys...it limits your learning potential.  Ilyana, rinse off, and wrap a towel around yourself, so you can see the rest of the lesson without getting everything wet.  Smiley, you can go.”  He leaned down and nibbled at one of Ilyana’s nipples before letting her go. He stepped out of the stall and took the offered towel and started drying off as Ilyana rinsed off and quickly did the same.

“She deserves an A,” the smiling guy said.

“We don’t give letter grades...get going.”  The dorm mistress slapped his bare ass.  “You’re a distraction.”  He gave a mock salute and slipped on his robe and slippers, then left the bathroom.  She turned to the class.  “Girls.”

“Yes, dorm mistress.”

“Present your wrists, please.”  They all held out their announcement bracelets, and the dorm mistress looked at each one.  “Ugh...such a first-year array...fairly boring.  I guess I’ll demonstrate this next bit.  Get in the shower, shy guy.”  The nervous guy, still slightly hard, but not as erect as he was a few minutes prior, went in the shower, and quickly adjusted the spray.

“It was a little hot.”  He said.

“I appreciate your consideration.”  Dominique said, moving into the stall with him.  She pressed her bare wet body against his, letting him a get a good feel of her, rubbing against him, though he kept his hands at his sides. She licked at one of his nipples, making him shiver, and carefully got down on her knees.  “Oral sex in the shower is a pain, literally and figuratively.  The tiles are terrible on your knees, ladies.”  She pushed her hair out of her face.  “And I already feel like I'm’ drowning.  So, what do we do?  Well, step one would be to *not* do it, I mean, within limits of denying what the guy wants, of course, but step two would be—could you lean over me a bit grab onto the shower bar behind me?”  His cock was right in her face, and when he leaned over, he slipped a little, her face mashing into his crotch, but he got a grip on the pipes, and she pulled back a bit.  “See, ladies, dangerous...I could have lost an eye!”  They laughed.  “But now he’s taking the brunt of the shower, and I can do this.”  She took his shaft in one hand and leaned in, putting his tip in her mouth, working him with tongue for a few moments as he made very happy noises.  Regina couldn’t believe that she was standing there watching what was effectively a sex show, *and* she was naked herself.  Quick looks let her see that some of the girls were enjoying it, smiling even, but she felt more embarrassed than aroused.  Dominique got the guy nice and hard before pulling back.  “No problem there, though it still feels like there’s water running up your nose.  Obviously, height difference will play a part in this, but that’s always the case with a good on-the-knees blowjob.”  She stood back up and rubbed her knees for a moment.  “Are we feeling good, champ?”  She asked the guy.  He nodded.  “You haven’t even touched my tits...they’re awesome.”  She took his hands and placed them on her breasts.  “Feel those, my nips hard under your touch.  I’m wet for you...right now...not just because of the shower...feel down there, go ahead.  Run you hand through my bush, slip a finger inside me, grab my ass…”  He did everything she asked, and Regina watched both mesmerized and disturbed.  The dorm mistress was enjoying herself, the guy clearly aroused, but she had no idea if she was just enjoying the teaching, getting off on running the show, or something more.  “Now, back to our friend the lube.”  She grabbed the bottle from the soap dish behind her.

“Oh...fuck…”  The guy hissed as she squirted some in her hand and started massaging his cock.
“Nice and warm now from the shower, right?”  She squirted some more in her hand and rubbed it between her legs.  She rinsed off her hand and grabbed the bar in the shower, bending over and presenting herself to the guy.  “Get in there, before the lube rinses...come on!”  She demanded.  He glanced at the girls watching him, but then took the dorm mistress by the hips, and eased forward, with one hand he pushed inside her and she moaned.  “Oh, yes, keep it going, you first year stud...come on…”  He started pounding away.  “I saved you for last because your dick was bigger than other guy’s.”  Regina thought they were both about equal, but she assumed the dorm mistress was playing up the guy’s ego to keep him hard, though he didn’t seem to be having any issues in the moment.  “Don’t forget ladies, when you’re in this position, you can have fun with yourself, too.”  She assumed a slightly wider stance and started teasing at her clit, or at least that’s what it looked like from Regina’s angle.  “Mmm...now, I know what you’re all thinking…’Dorm mistress, beautiful and wonderful as you are, with those amazing tits and that ass to die for, any of us could have offered ourselves to this hot-cocked first year, and crackers, that’s true, but not the next part.  The final part of the lesson.”  She looked over at the class as the guy continued to pump away.  “Any guesses?”  She took the lube and squirted some more down her asscrack.  “Now any guesses?”

“Anal?”  A taller girl of Indian descent asked.

“Fuck...fuck…”  Dominique closed her eyes, clearly, truly, enjoying herself, “sorry…again with saying it like question?  Correct...but be *sure* of your response.”  The dorm mistress moved her hand from the front of herself to the back slipping a couple fingers in her ass.  “I bet he didn’t expect to finish like this.”  A few of the girls laughed.  “Okay, cowboy...I’m ready for you to ease it in, come on…”

“Really?”  He asked.  “I’ve, um, never done this?”

“After all the stories I heard about what goes on in the guys’ dorm after hours. I find that hard to believe.”  She said.  “I’m just kidding—I know you guys just blow each other.”  She laughed.  “Just give it a go...you might like it, or you might not.  You’ll probably come either way.”  He was hesitant, but he did pull out from her pussy, letting her guide him into her ass.  “Steady, relax, just keep easing forward.  Mmm...there we go...there we go...that’s tight, right?”

“Uh, yeah…”  He said.

“Then start fucking me like you mean it, cowboy,” she slapped her own ass.  He started out slowly, but there was so much lube, he had an easy go of it.  Regina felt the dorm mistress was really enjoying it, and she must have liked it, to some extent, if she had the bead for anal on her wrist.  Regina had set up her announcement bracelet very conservatively...not ridiculously so, but enough that she wouldn’t be participating in anything like what she was watching, but then, none of the other girls apparently had the bead either.  A moment later, the guy started grunting then letting out some longer deeper groans.  “Oh, fuck me, stud, fuck me…”  The dorm mistress said, playing it up.  He pulled out and quickly rinsed off his cock, taking a little body wash mounted on the wall and cleaning more thoroughly.  The dorm mistress stood up and looked to the guy.  “Let’s give him a polite round of applause, ladies.”  She started speaking after the clapping ended.  “Anal is one of the few things that generally works well in the shower—with the right preparation, of course.  You get yourself nice and clean to start, and there’s the fact that it’s easy to clean up afterward.  Now, as soon as he leaves, the rest of you may start your morning.  Don’t forget my notes on shaving, trimming, et cetera,” the guy took the hint, quickly toweled off, and left, “and pay attention during your final few days of orientation.  I don’t want to have to ding any of you for silly infractions.”  Regina watched as the dorm mistress went over to her robe and pulled a small vibe out of the pocket.

“Oh, she has a Guinevere SM.”  Kiera whispered to her, “nice little travel vibrator.  Not bad for a shower.  I was thinking of getting one of those, too.”  Regina was still having a bit of a hard time dealing with her roommate’s frankness about masturbation.   She shook her head.  Dominique got into her already running shower and closed the curtain.  “I mean, I’d just use my Cleo after something quick like that, but she’s probably just looking to get off fast.”

“She’s just going to…”

“Do you even need to ask, Reg?”  Kiera said.  “It’s one of the better places.  At least you can pretend it’s private.”

“Whatever…” she muttered.  “So, can we go back to our room now and get our shampoo and stuff?”

“You are so lucky you have me as a roommate, lady.”  Kiera smirked.  “Look, in the shower stalls?”  Regina followed where she was pointing.  “Bodywash, conditioner, shampoo, shaving gel.  Everyone uses the same, everyone smells the same, everyone held to the same standard.”

“You’ve only been here, like, twelve extra hours more than me, how do *you* know all of this?”

“I read the First Year’s FAQ in the student handbook, plus I read the notices posted around the dorm.”  Regina frowned.  She hadn’t even bothered to look at her school materials since she’d arrived.  She’d been so overwhelmed, and not that studious to begin with, that she never got around to it.  “Towels are over there.  Use as many as you want.  Put them in the laundry chute or in the bins at the end of the hall when you’re done.  You can put your hair up in a towel to go back to your room, but you still wear your robe in the halls, got it?”  Regina nodded, still feeling overwhelmed by all the random intricacies.  “I * really* want to brush my teeth,” she pulled her toothbrush from her pocket, “and take a shower.”

“I should have realized that about the shampoo and stuff when we had to use the toothpaste dispensers last night.”  Regina said.

“Yeah, they let a few things slip for the first couple of days, and your late arrival didn’t help you at all—I’m assuming you got ready that morning in a private bathroom, used your own toiletries, that sort of thing.”  Regina muttered yes.  “You can be sure that pretty much everyone on campus has the same clothes, more or less, smells the same, has the same haircuts, all of that...the great equalizer among all us rich and privileged assholes.”  She grinned as she heard the dorm mistress start to come in the shower.  “Are you okay to wash on your own, or do you need my help for that, too?”  Kiera reached out and ran hand over Regina’s chest.  “Happy to help…”  She winked.  Regina blushed, but laughed.

“No, thank you…I think I can manage not to screw that up.”  She muttered.  “But really, thank you for the help.  I mean it.”  Kiera nodded and went into a shower stall, a moment later, the water came on, and it prompted Regina to follow her lead.

----

It didn’t take long to find a rhythm and routine in her new life.  Yes, the uniforms were odd, but Miss Stevens was completely correct that *not* having to think about what to wear made life easier.  Orientation continued for the rest of the week.  She didn’t have any classes, technically, though she did have to meet with her classmates and professors just to learn where the rooms were, go over the syllabuses, know what was expected academically, which turned out to be not too bad, even by Regina’s low standards.  Her second day offered a few surprises, especially when she saw students actively engaging in public sex, or sexual activities, at least, in the quad, in the student union, the cafeteria, some of the classroom hallways.  It was never outright exhibitionism, but it was clear someone was getting a hand job or a girl was blowing a guy, more so if girl’s panties were around her ankles a guy had his head or hand up her skirt.
The whole student body wasn’t on campus yet, the remaining sophomores, juniors, and seniors weren’t required to arrive until the weekend—though few were trickling in—so it wasn’t *that* much sex.  Most of the students were still just trying to get their bearings.  After lunch, the fourth day, a guy did approach her, obviously wanting something, but Kiera stepped between them, protecting her, and went down on the guy just outside of the cafeteria.  The guy had no problem with the alternative, and Regina stepped away a bit and watched as her roommate took the guy and worked his cock, kneeling on her notebook to not mess up her stockings.  He came and she swallowed, making sure nothing dripped on her or him when she was done.  He helped her up and whispered something in her ear.  She laughed.

“Maybe next week, okay?”  She said over her shoulder, walking back over to Regina.  “I hope you don’t mind I did that?”

“Uh, no, thank you, I guess.”  Regina said, not quite looking her in the eye.

“Oh, don’t give me that.  I *know* you’ve given blowjobs before.”

“Not in public, not as dozens of people walked by going to and from the cafeteria.”  Regina shook her head.  “I’m sorry.  I don’t mean to act so shocked...but really...I’ve been seeing this all week, but it’s still something I need to get used to.  And I *know* you.  Um…”  She looked at her roommate.  “What did he whisper to you?”

“Oh, well, he is into something *I* may be into, and, well, I said *maybe*...but not now...not this week, and no, I’m *not* going to tell you.”  She grinned.  “Come on, we have to get to library orientation.”

----

Library orientation turned out to be interesting and confusing in equal measures.  The library was huge, one of the largest buildings on campus, an old building with a modern interior.  It housed a few computer labs, books or course, study rooms, even a cafe, though you couldn’t take drinks or snacks into the library stacks.  The librarian, Mr. Stockly, a tall middle-aged man who seemed built for the part, with combed-back brown hair, white at the temples, glasses, and a three-piece suit, showed her orientation group the facilities, went over the rules, and went through the process of how to find and check out books.

“Of course, you can always seek out library staff if you have any questions,” he added, “but no, we cannot give you credit if you forget to visit the library for your required daily hour.  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, once every weekday, no exceptions beyond holidays.  I have been assured, extra time in the laundry is no fun for students.  The idea is to instill study habits, but should you wish to meet the requirement on the computers or sipping coffee—in the *allowed* areas,” he cautioned, “no one cares, which is one more reason *not* to miss your daily requirement, right?”  They were back in the lobby.  The library was mostly empty except for staff and another orientation group making the rounds.  “Before I end out session, are there any questions?”  No one said anything.  “Well then, with that, *boys*...”

“Yes, Mr. Stockly,” they all said in unison.

“Please line up shoulder to shoulder and take out your penises.”  They all answered yes and did as her asked.  Regina watched the whole procession with a confused look on her face.  “*Girls*,” they all responded as well, “if you would be so kind as to form a line, at the start of the row.  All of the girls did as he asked, Regina stepping behind her roommate near the middle.  “You may be wondering, what’s this about?  Well, I’ve found, over the years, that the allure of the library is too much for some students.  The very idea of engaging in sexual activity, particularly among the books is *terribly* appealing for some reason.  So, let me be clear.  If you do so, you *will* be caught and punished.  If you damage any books...with any fluid...coffee, semen, or otherwise, you will be caught and punished.  Now, to remove some of that allure, I’d like you all to proceed down the line, get a good feel of all these strapping young men’s manhood, touch them, stroke them, get them hard,” he looked at the girls, “well, go on…”  Regina had never seen a dozen exposed men all at once, and while some of them were hard, or partly hard, most were not.  The girl at the front of the line stepped forward and took the guy in her hand, giving him a quick caress.  He got stiff, and she moved on to the next, then the next.  The second girl followed her lead, and the line Regina was in started moving forward.  “It seems an obvious lesson, but there is no *magic* involved, all men *react* the same.  The library is no *love* potion…”  He droned on.  Regina found herself at the front of the line, looking down a line of erect penises.  Her roommate, three guys down, glanced back at her.  “You get no reward for having sex here…”  Regina stepped forward and took the first guy in her hand, his cock hot to her touch, hard in her grip.  She lightly stroked the length of him, not looking him the eye, and moved down to the next, longer, another with more girth, one who was surprisingly big, and she kept going until she reached the end.  “Just sex...just flesh…”  Mr. Stockly said.

“Oh…!  Oh no!”  The last girl in line stepped back as a guy started to come on her uniform.

“It almost always happens.”  Mr. Stockly said with a sigh, stepping forward.  Nothing to be ashamed about, gentlemen.  I’m sure some of these ladies are *quite* proficient with their hands.  Now, Miss…”  He waved his phone in the girl’s direction, “*Jennifer*...well, since you’ve already taken the brunt of it, would you mind finishing off the rest, that way they can all share the cleaning bill?”  Regina watched the girl’s face twitch, but she nodded, and moved back to the front of the line, taking the first guy’s cock in hand and jerking him off in earnest.  “Now, all of you can say you’ve had sex in the library, yes?  So, I expect to hear no more it for the next four years.”  They stood there and watched as the girl made each guy come in turn, her uniform getting progressively streaked with come until, by the end, it was dripping off her.  Almost twenty minutes had passed, and the girl’s arm had to have been burning with exhaustion, Regina thought to herself.  The librarian finally dismissed them all, and Regina followed her roommate out of the building with the others.  A minute later, the come-covered girl walked out of the double-doors, frowning and shaking her head as she looked down at herself.

“Hey, Jennifer, was it?”  Kiera called out.  The girl walked over to them, and Regina got a good look at what a mess she was, semen on her blazer, blouse, skirt, stockings, even her shoes.

“What do you want?”

“I was just wondering if you need a wipe?”

“Oh, fuck you!”  The girl said.

“I was being serious.  For your hands, at least?”  Kiera said, holding one out.

“No…”  The girl sighed.  “It wouldn’t do any good.  I have half a mind to go to the rest of orientation like this,” she plucked at the hem of her skirt, “but I don’t need someone taking it as an invitation to add more to the mix.  Ugh, my sister told me Mr. Stockly was an asshole...he does this...makes this happen in each and every orientation class.”

“You sister is an alum?”  Regina asked.

“Twin sister, she’s around her somewhere,” she waved an arm to the campus, “probably *not* covered in spunk, but her best friend from high school was the target last year.  Rumor has it Stockly likes watching the show, likes seeing the surprise when one of the guys finally blows his load, and really likes it when one of us—me, in this case—becomes the spark bitch.  Honestly, why can’t these weird fuckers just try to have sex with us like a *normal* person…?”  She started walking away but looked back.  “Thanks for the offer...”  She said and continued down the sidewalk.

“Speaking of random encounters,” Kiera said, “aren’t you supposed to go track down some dorm mistress after your meeting with Even Stevens?”

“Ugh…”  Regina groaned.  “I forgot.  All of this is so distracting.”

“I tell you what distracted me, that guy with the big cock near the end of the line.  He was as big as my vibrator”

“Kiera, is that all you ever think about?”  Regina sighed.  “No, forget I said that...we just gave a dozen guys half a handjob...what the hell are we supposed to think of?”

“Fix.”

“What?”  Regina asked, confused.

“Say ‘what the fix’, not ‘what the hell’.  No one says that except nutjobs and Covenant Amish...and they’re not too different, in my opinion.”

“Wait, there are Amish?”  Regina asked.

“*Covenant* Amish...you’re from Pennsylvania, aren’t you?  I asked you this the other day.  They live like it’s the years of pre-technology or close enough...shitty clothes, no machines...they, um, what’s the thing where they put their hands together and kneel?”

“Praying.”

“Uh, yeah, they pray a lot.”  Kiera said.  “They say god, hell, that sort of thing...I saw an old movie with Harrison Ford...so, you know—crackers—you sound like you’re Covenant Amish.”

“Well, I'm not…”

“Yeah, no shit, Reg.  I mean, I have no idea *what* the fuck you are, but no shit...”

She leaned back in the chair wearing one of my button ups, she always said she felt sexy in my shirts. She unbuttoned it all the way spread her legs and put one on the table. The soft purple panties she was wearing were already wet. She ran her hand down her chest exposing her beautiful breast and then into her panties, she moaned softly and told me to start.

I was at work dreading the day because we had our small department meeting which are so dull. I sat at my normal spot at the table right in the middle. Then she came in. Our new intern beautiful skin, amazing eyes small perky breast and a petite frame. She was wearing a blue and yellow short sundress that plunged deep down her chest. She had a tattoo going down her left arm a bunch of beautifully colored flowers. She clearly was not wearing a bra as the dress was very form fitting and you could see her nipples poking through the dress. She sat down across from me and winked. See she has been flirting with me since she started. She used to wear more modest clothing but it's been getting more and more revealing. We were the only ones in there so far. After she sat down she started sucking on a pen running it across her lips staring at me not saying a word. She dropped her pen under the table and asked me if I could get it for her in a cute little voice. I went down under the table grabbed the pen and looked up. She had spread her legs open and wasnt wearing any panties. She reached down and touched herself a little, when she moved I saw the pink heart shaped plug she had in. I quickly came back up and handed her the pen. She ran her fingers that she just used to touch herself over my hand. She said thank you and winked at me again. The meeting started I couldn't focus she kept staring at me biting on her fingers. I know everyone could see. All I could think about was the glimpse of her pussy and that plug. I knew why she was wriggling in her seat, to feel the plug move around, to be honest it turned me on more. After the meeting was over I went to my desk still horny and semi hard. She walked past my desk touched my shoulder and kept walking by as she lifted her dress up so I could get a peek of her perfectly round ass. I was so turned on I couldn't think straight. She came over and sat on my desk legs slightly apart giving me a peek told me to come to the bathroom on the 3rd floor. That floor is empty so nobody would be there. I was reluctant but so horny I made up my mind I was going to have her. As soon as I exited the elevator there she was leaning against the wall legs crossed with a disappointed look. She said you kept me waiting, I don't like to wait. I walked over to her grabbed her short hair and kissed her while I pulled her to me.

At this time my wife was moaning pulling her panties aside and rubbing her wet pussy telling me to go on while running her foot up and down my dick through my shorts.

Back in the dream the intern pulled me in the bathroom got on her knees and pulled my dick out of my slacks. She wrapped her hand around the base of my cock and licked the head, wrapping her tongue around it. Licked my balls all the way up my shaft then taking my whole cock in her mouth. She looked up at me and told me to fuck her. I pulled her up turned her around lifted up her dress grabbed her hair and slid my hard dick inside of her. She gasped with pleasure as I moved in and out of her. I slapped her ass thrusting harder and harder against the sink. I could see her face in the mirror as she yelled that she was cumming. I turned her around pulled the dress off, sat her ass on the sink, put my hand around her neck and slid my dick up and down her soaking wet pussy she begged me to put it in. I slid my cock deep inside of her choking her and rubbing her clit with my thumb. It was so tight I could feel her contracting her pussy on my cock. She grabbed my shoulder leaned back and came. I was on the verge of cumming when she got on her knees took my dick in her mouth. She was good at it, she knew what she was doing, like she loved it, worshipped it. Pulled my dick out of her mouth looked at me and continued to jerk me off until I came she opened her mouth for me to shoot my load into. Some of it made it into her mouth but mostly on her chin and tits. She got up wiped her mouth off and kissed me. She got dressed, said thanks and walked away.

By the time I finished telling the story my wife had gotten herself off. She was soaking she brought her fingers up put them in her mouth, seductively looking at me. She stood up bent over the table and told me to fuck her like I fucked the intern in the dream only this time fill her up."

&amp;#x200B;

i want to use a raspberry-Pi as a Selfhosted server, which i can access from the internet and wanted your opinions about security and ideas what i could and should do. The really long text after this is just what i thought up until now, please feel free to give ANY advice even outside what i wrote (what i wanted). Even buzzwords like ""you should look into xyz"" will help because sometimes its hard to google a thing you cant really describe or think off

&amp;#x200B;

Prestory:

So after an internship in a bigger company where i learned a whole bunch of stuff about servers and working with linux machines i got a raspberry-pi as a present. This was all very new to me because my background is not that of a full computer-scienctist/engineer/IT-dude so my knowledge is very limited right now,  but i figured that with  a raspberry-pi you could do many things i didnt considered before. 

My Plans are:  
Hosting my own website with wordpress  
Using the Pi as an Insider to WOL my PCs, also possibly shutdown the PCs through Pi ssh to w10 Powershell(?)  
Using the Pi as a NAS  
Using the Pi as a Firewall?

How i want to do it:

Docker:

I learned about containerization and i want to try it by myself as well. They used Kubernetes (because they were working with google cloud), but i realize i dont need such heavy weight container management system but can just use docker compose to handle my containers for wordpress, NAS, Insider. I will probably also pack the WOL function into a custom container image, depending on its complexity. Furthermore i will use gitlab to version my wordpress content and store my docker-compose config.

Network security:  
I want to access my Pi from the Internet, but it should be secure. So there are services i want to use which should not expose to the internet (NAS, WOL function) and services i want to expose to the Internet (Websit) and i think those two 'spaces' should intersect. I heard about VPNing to a Pi on port A without exposing the whole Home Network to the Internet for the private part and expose port B to the Internet which only speaks to the wordpress container (?). 

What i already did:

Well i installed my Pi gave it a local static IP address and could manage to ssh to it. I also installed fail2ban and configured my sshd\_config file so that only one non root user can access it. After accessing the Pi i could then su to a root user

Please feel free to drop any advice. Like the fail2ban thing i just accidentally read about it and didnt think about it. Or tips about Docker (never used it before, will be a hell of a journey). Im glad for every comment!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance =)

The first is a short term summer busy season tax position at a big 4, and i guess it’s an internship but I could’ve sworn i applied as seasonal associate, whatever i guess it doesn’t matter

The other is a full time audit associate for a NYC regional firm. Im not sure if it’s considered small or midsize but it’s around the “top” 200th mark. Before you comment on that, i get that sounds dumb to call it top 200, but i’m just trying to give a rough idea regarding the size

My gut feeling is to take the full time audit position bc it’s a full time job, whereas the internship doesn’t guarantee anything once the summers over. Also, the regional supposedly has decent busy season hours which means it’ll be easier to study for the CPA there.

In terms of pay it’s pretty much exactly the same, and both are going to require an 1:00-1:30 commute

What do you guys think?

I am also from a very conservative country that shuns any sexual relations outside of marriage.
Through out my internship year I rotate between medical specialties, from surgery to family medicine. 

In my rotation in the Urology and men's health department, I came across a very curious case.

A 27 year old male *newly wed*, who walked into my clinic complaining that he has a very small penis and it's causing him to have erectile dysfunction and inability to have sex with his wife at all for the past six months. He wanted to explore his options for his size. 

So I take his medical and surgical history and other important details. 
And move on to the physical exam. 
And to my surprise, he wasn't at all small. In fact he was within the national average. 
So I explain that to him, and he still pushes for a treatment. 

I insist that whatever treatment I can provide will either be a temporary 2cm-3cm, or will completely diminish his erection's angulation - Causing him to have an erection that doesn't face forward and upwards- and would still only add a couple of cm. 

He refuses to take my advice, so I contact the consultant who I was shadowing at the time. 
I explain what's going on and he tells me he'll take it from here. 

He goes in and talks to the guy for about 20 minutes. Turns out he had all of his sex education from porn and ""guy talk"" from his friends. And that he couldn't help but compare himself and his sex life to porn because he thought it was the norm. 

Forward a couple months he comes back to the clinic angry and wants a surgery, and says it's destroying his marriage. We decide to do liposuction to his pubic area so he can get a few cms. He comes back a couple of weeks later saying that it didn't work and he needs the surgery. 


All I can say is porn is such a bad habit, avoid it at all costs.

Som background about me, I am 21(m)  Dutch native with dyslexia and autism. I've always struggled with ""off time"" so I would always get very restless and anxious in my free time be it weekends or in the evenings when I wasn't at school or work. due to this I was never able to get rest and was mentally tired and on the verge of collapsing due to stress almost non stop. I always wanted to read but could never do this due to my dyslexia (it's quite mild), so I had a very hard time reading books written in my native language (Dutch). however last year for christmas I decided i'd try my hand at reading a 40K novel and bought myself for christmas Dark Imperium, and boy that was a mistake ;P.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I have amassed and ever increasing collection of 40K novels (see picture below). And reading brought me a lot of very personal benfits. 

I Finally had a place to relax and put my mind to in my off time where I had nothing else to do, my mental tiredness went down, i had almost no stress anymore and when I had I could forget about it all. Since then I graduated school (Computer science) and got a job out of my internship there straight away. got my drivers license, didnt have to go to therapy anymore. and all in all got happier by a significant margin. 

&amp;#x200B;

So thanks to all you lot, GW and books/writers in general.

&amp;#x200B;

My little 40K book collection I managed to buy up this year.

a595z3,70,2018-12-11,I'm taking care of myself medically after being too depressed to care for months. Also I got a really good job I didn't think I could get. And I'm taming a wild horse.,CastielGalafran,CongratsLikeImFive,https://www.reddit.com/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/a595z3/im_taking_care_of_myself_medically_after_being/,"My living situation has been shit lately. My parents are crazy and I've been living with them while working on my master's. The stress of their insanity plus the stress of school has torn me up mentally. I've gotten really depressed. 

I haven't seen the point in taking care of myself medically. I know I have cavities but I haven't made a dentist appointment. I had a bad UTI for a month or two that I did absolutely nothing about. It started hurting bad enough I finally got some cranberry pills and luckily that knocked it out. I did end up going to the doctor and getting an inhaler for my asthma after my boyfriend begged me to go. I've been wearing the same old contacts for 4-5 months now. 

A week and a half ago I tripped while running and got two deep gouges in my right ankle. I knew I had to clean it. But I didn't. My parents had gotten so crazy I started praying every night to just die, and I guess I just didn't care anymore if my wound got infected. Well, it did. I knew it was infected. And I hid it so that no one would know. My boyfriend and his cousin's wife saw it though. They freaked out. My boyfriend took me to his house and he and his grandma spent an hour helping me clean the wound and treat it. The inflammation is finally going down. He keeps checking in on me so I keep treating it.

Also, I tore some ligaments in my wrist a month ago. It hasn't really healed yet. 

So yeah, I've been really depressed. But I finally went to the eye doctor today and got new lenses. I'm ordering glasses when I get home too. I have a doctor appointment on Thursday. I'm going to ask them to let me take an MRI or something so I can actually know what's wrong with my wrist. I've been treating my infected wound 2-3 times a day since Sunday and it's a lot less gross now. I still need to schedule a dentist appointment. I hate the dentist even on my best days, so that's going to be a big hurdle. 

Also, I somehow got this job at a really fancy law firm. I didn't even know it was fancy at all until after my interview. I didn't even apply to them. I had interviewed for an internship and didn't get it, but the people really liked me and wanted to help me get a job. They had friends at the fancy law firm and gave them my resume. The fancy law firm people hit me up, interviewed me, and I somehow got the job. They're letting me start part time next semester and I'll go to full time when I graduate. I have no idea why they gave me the job, but I won't look a gift horse in the mouth. 

And also, my boyfriend's grandpa got this wild mustang. He's been trying to tame the horse for the last month or so. On Sunday I got in the corral with it and spent hours working with it. I'm the only person it lets get that close to him, so now I'm going to be taming and training the horse. This has been a lifelong dream of mine. 

So yeah, I've been really depressed but I'm finally getting some medical shit done and also I've accomplished a couple cool things. "

I just got my first job in a city that has a pretty standard cost of living, with housing being the most expensive part. I'll be making around $50k/year plus per diem for the traveling that I have to do with my job, which I am guessing will add around another $10k/year.

I wanted to try to ballpark how much I would have to budget for my monthly expenses after taxes and savings, as well as where would be the best place for my money to go. I currently have a healthy emergency fund of around $20k from summer internships and work, so I don't really feel like I need to add to that immediately.

A little more info to know is that my job has a health insurance policy that is great, I have a fully paid-off car, and I have to ability to live somewhere near work.

**Here is where I need help:**

I was under the impression that per diem does NOT get included as income and is therefore not taxed, but after a little more research it seems that if your per diem is higher than the federal limit (I don't really understand what the limit is) than it is taxed as income?

I don't currently know how much my company contributes to my 401k, but I do know that they have a plan, so I'll find out more about that soon. That being said, I know I can, but should I fully max out my 401k first? Also I learned today that there are two types of 401k's (Roth and Traditional), so would it make sense to put it all into a Roth 401k for now since I'm not making much?

I understand that the max contributions to both Roth and Traditional IRAs is $5500, but as a young person with a pretty low income currently, should I put all of it into a Roth?

Lastly, am I even approaching this correctly? I wanted to try to max out both my 401k and an IRA, determine a ball-park estimate of the taxes I would be paying, and then figure out how much money I would have left over to budget for my living expenses (mainly being able to determine how much I would have to spend on an apartment). I don't know if this is even the right way to approach a real income for the first time."

I wasn't going to let my senior year in college rush by me. I needed to make the most of it, at least that's what all of my family and friends would tell me. Some might consider joining a club, going to more events, getting internship. I had more exciting things in mind. With my sights set on a female friend of mine, I was ready to create my new slave. She had a bright future ahead of her, always studying and ensuring she would have the best opportunities when she graduated. 

So how would I change this dedicated college girl into a slave for my use? Needless to say, you can find almost anything on the internet. Without complete confidence in its ability, I get my hands on a drug that fosters an addiction to cum. Such an unhealthy and constant addiction is going to ruin my friend's future, but also ensure I have a loving slave who will do anything for a single drop of my seed...

I'd love to play this out with someone! You'd be playing as a female character that I have references for, and we can discuss more details when you reach out. I love the slow burn of someone changing and becoming a cum addicted slave. If you're interested, kik me at HelloMySlave

Looking forward to hearing from you!"

Your boss asks you ""Where do you want to be in 5 years?""  If I were to answer this question honestly, I'd be called lazy, unambitious, and possibly get fired.

When I went to college, I had the American Dream.  I wanted the big house. I loved Chevy Camaros. I wanted the huge job with the huge paycheck.  I wanted all the game systems and the best phone and the best PC.  So  I majored in computer science, got an internship at the company my cousin worked at, and worked at the help desk at school.  I'm 25 now and have had 2 different IT jobs.  I make about $70k/year and life is pretty good.  I'm comfortable.  I have an amazing fiancee, a great dog, a nice apartment, a Nissan Rogue, and I can pay the bills and still save plenty for the future.  My fiancee is getting her PhD and makes a stipend of about $27k, so I support us for the most part.

But something awakened in me a couple years ago which has flipped my mind completely.  I don't want any of the American Dream.  I don't want to be part of the rat race to climb the corporate ladder.  I don't want the huge house, the fancy car, the important-sounding job title, the 6-figure salary, or all the newest gadgets and gizmos.  All I want is a modest home (1200-1300 sqft), a simple car, the things I need for my hobbies (which I already have and really isn't much), live with my wife, dog, and a future kid or two, and work a small, part-time job.  The only reason I haven't quit the full-time corporate work force is because my fiancee has a medical condition that will need my benefits once we're married.  I'm desperately hoping that she lands tenured researcher job she wants so that the tables can turn and I can semi-retire and work at a pet shop until we fully retire (she's aware of this and is fine with it).

[Season!](http://brantsteele.net/bigbrother/06/r.php?c=da637jCr)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!This season was great, if a little confusing at times. Jared was clearly an epic winner. He made a shocking return, which I totally expected to go to Jon Prose. Jon was a great early game villain, and was a beast. I feel really bad for what happened to Serena, just because her friend was evil, she got targeted by the rest of the house. Jon was a little too flashy in the first week, when he used the Veto on Angie for no apparent reason. I was surprised Jeff went home over Serena, but I was happy, because I loved Serena. Angie was an extremely fun character, being the pawn bunch of times, until she sadly went home, but that made way for a great moment when my personal favorite from the season, Diane, won the double eviction HOH! I wish Mace had gone home, because that would have been better for Diane, but Mace turned out to be a fun character and Stacy didn't do much. Once again, she was held back because of her partner. I don't know why Emma used the veto on Mace, just for Diane to go home over Jared. Mace was quick to turn on her the next week. Mace was a great villian, but I'm happy he didn't win. One of my favorite parts of this season was the awesome Abasto's just having fun in a house doing nothing while everyone around them played the game hard. And then... THE WORST MOVE IN BIG BIG HOUSE HISTORY! Why did Mace vote out Maria Jose over Jared? If he was going after a pair... JARED'S IN A PAIR TOO! Mace probably would have won if he had got out Jared, but no. He's a dumbo, but I still want him to come back. I think it's just a testament to how good Jared was. I was hoping Angel would somehow pull out the win on the roommates, but it wasn't meant to be. So the roommates made the final two so they both get a million dollars! Jared definetly deserved the win over How Rad, but it doesn't matter. They both get half a mil. Great winner, great season.!&lt;

My startup is looking for a CTO or Technical Co-Founder to accelerate the development of our web app.

\*\***The Product:**

Our app automatically generates a realtime record of your life. This record is then searchable and easily navigable, allowing users to get insights from their own data and drive behavior change to improve their lives.

We validated our idea at QS18, a conference for our target market in September, and we started beta testing this week. I have been able to get us to this point with a combination of contract work, interns, and good old stack overflow, but now that we are getting users onboard, it's time to start building a real team who can respond quickly and effectively to user feedback.

\*\***The Team:**

I am a design student at UCLA, but I'm graduating in the Spring. I have some frontend experience and have a decent understanding of our app's architecture. I have a steady stream of interns who work with me on a quarterly basis, which is fine for getting work done, but not fine for having a larger-picture technical vision. We have 2 technical advisors. One is the CTO of a large media company in LA (1,000+ employees) and the other is a software engineering intern at Roku. 

Our team is missing someone in the trenches who really knows the technical details of our product and can effectively build teams around projects and features. I have been doing this so far, but I am unable to asses work speed or quality, so I know that we are sacrificing both time and quality. Both of which need to be improved in order to move the product forward. Ideally you would be comfortable writing code but also delegating tasks to interns.

\*\***The Tech:**

We're built on node.js, postgres, docker, digital ocean, 0Auth, firebase, and (migrating over to vue.js from plain HTML/CSS/JS/Jquery). In the near future, we'll have to implement some NLP and NLU as well as get some basic computer vision implemented for image tagging. We may also have to implement apps for digital assistants like an alexa skill that users can use to interact with their data. Our app also interfaces with many 3rd party APIs, so being comfortable with combing through 3rd party documentation is helpful.

  
**\*\*Location:** Prefer LA or Bay Area; part-time remote is okay  
**\*\*Salary:** Equitable Founder Equity  
**\*\*Basic Requirements:**

1. Experience with at least one server side language (eg. python, node.js, java,..)
2. Understanding of cloud computing and web applications
3. Interest in engineering and big data
4. Strong knowledge web performance and optimization

**\*\*Good to have:**

1. MS or BS in Computer science
2. Machine Learning experience with NLP/NLU specialization 
3. A fan of test driven development
4. An interest in self-tracking or collecting personal data

Later on, he continued doing part time (20 hours) Internship at the same company during this fall. He received an offer for internship for next semester and a verbal offer for employment after he graduates. Now we were told that if he continues to do that, this will be considered as an employment bridging and he may have issues for his STEM OPT application or H1B.
We were not aware of this until now. Currently he has done 3 month full time CPT and 4 month part time CPT.
What are his options right now. How serious is this issue. Can he continue his CPT. Can he apply for internship at a different company. Even if he chooses not to do internship now, can he accept the job offer made by the company where he interned. Will this affect the regular OPT application.

Should I work to get a degree?,GJ4E0,analytics,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/a5ddsv/i_am_22_years_old_and_make_37hr_in_the_silicon/,"Hi everyone - I am a contracted Data Analyst at an extremely well known social media company. I just started my career last year through a non-profit organization and now have 1.5 years of Analyst experience so far (6 months as an intern then another year as a contract worker). My highest level of education is a high school degree (and from a continuation school -at that) with a couple years from a community college (with really shitty grades to be honest).

&amp;#x200B;

My question is should I go for a degree if my overall goal is to rack up enough experience to become a Data Scientist / Research Scientist? I love what I do and I have a passion for both data and psychology. I can either go two paths: A) Work my way to get a masters degree in Analytics to fulfill my dream or B) Rely on networking and studying relevant skills on the side to fulfill my dream.

&amp;#x200B;

Route A:

Get a masters degree in Analytics. I was looking at options like Golden Gate University for a masters in Analytics. Either a masters in Analytics or Psychology. I want to still be able to work a full time job as an Analyst however I that a full-time job involves overtime (especially in the Silicon Valley). I am doing pretty good for myself but would like to be more technical with what I do. Is a degree necessary?

&amp;#x200B;

Route B:

Plan B is to heavily rely on networking and studying relevant skills from websites like Lynda etc to be successful in become a Data Scientist / Research Scientist.  I am against the atrocious amounts of money charged for a for a college education. I also believe not everything i'm going to learn in college is relevant, so this route would be the most optimized way to success however it's not guaranteed that I'll be hired as a Data Scientist / Research Scientist.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

Is a degree necessary to become successful in the world of analytics?

\- If so, then what college path should I take?

If a degree is not necessary to become successful in the world of analytics, do you have any advice for me to boost my career in becoming a Data Scientist?

My \[24F\] boyfriend \[24M\] of over 3 years broke up with me about three months ago and now is showing interest in getting back together.

Some back story: My relationship with him was great, of course there were a few things that I was unhappy with, but it was easy to look past because I loved him deeply. At the beginning of summer our relationship was better than it had ever been, we were discussing moving in together and our futures, and we were both really excited about all of it. I also found out from his dad after we broke up that he had even expressed to him that he saw a ring in the near future. I thought he was the man I was going to spend my life with. Then I left for a 3 month internship this summer half way across the country.

During this time I visited an old high school friend \[24M\] who I hadn't seen in 2 years and was only 3 hours from where I was staying. After that weekended he ended up professing his love for me and it stirred up some old feelings (I had a baby crush on him in hs). These feelings made me insanely confused because I never thought about anyone that way besides my bf. So when I went back home to visit and celebrate our 3 year anniversary I discussed these feelings with my him. He was immensely hurt, but was glad I was honest. I made the choice to cut contact with my friend afterwards. Then about a month later my bf came up to see me for 5 days and we had an awesome little vacation on the beach.

When I came back after the summer was over I could sense something was up with him, he was off and it prevented us from getting back into the groove of things with our relationship. I also found out he had a new ""platonic"" friend \[23F\] that he had met over the summer by seeing a text pop up on his phone. He told me it was nothing deep and she was just an acquaintance but he was excited about it because he had never had a true platonic friend before. Then i found out that they had been hanging out one-on-one, and she would text him all the time and call him for emotional support. Also when I was at a party that she was also at, he made no effort to introduce us. In fact it seemed like she was actively avoiding me. All awhile our relationship is struggling, I could feel him pulling away, this caused me to become extremely insecure and suspicious. About a month after I got back he broke up with me because he felt he could no longer give me 100% and he felt extremely guilty about it because he knew i deserved 100%. He also said that he got a taste of freedom and not having to be tied down by a relationship over the summer, which he liked (even though I am an extremely low maintenance gf, seriously). This left me in pieces, I was completely heartbroken and could barely get out of bed for weeks. There were times while I was at school I had to rush to the bathroom because I couldn't hold back the tears. Now, 3 months later, I'm finally able to at least function without constantly being beaten down by my sadness.

Last week he asked me if he could come see me and read a letter that he wrote, the jist of which was essentially ""i fucked up and I feel empty now"". I asked him if anything had happened with his friend, and he told me that he kissed her while we were broken up.

So now I'm just extremely confused and conflicted about what to do. Almost all of my family and friends all think I need to shut the door on him completely. But even after being hurt so badly, I'm still in love with him. I should also add that he is the only person I've ever slept with and I'm extremely curious about exploring sex with other people. I just feel stuck, and I'm worried that whatever choice I make I'll end up with regrets. 

If you have any advice on this I would appreciate it, thanks for reading!

tldr; My boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me after I was away all summer and is now showing interest in getting back together. All of my friends and family think I should close the door. He's the only one Ive ever slept with and I am curious about exploring sex with other people. Ultimately Im still very much in love with him even though he hurt me badly, and I know when our relationship is doing well it's the best part of my life.

Just to give a quick summary of my situation I am now entering my third season of public accounting. 

Flash back to my first year / internship which was straight out of college. My first season was a complete joke and i don’t know how I even lasted as long as I did (oh I know why, cuz I had massive debts and wanted a decent paying job out of college!) I received very little training and was basically pinned to a senior and supervisor who I communicated extremely poor with. The most explanations I would receive would be to “look at what was done in the prior year”, and god forbid I’d have additional questions (like any normal first year staff) they would just insist on completing tasks themselves, while also gossiping constantly about how terrible I was (while never correcting me on what I did wrong). As a result I never grew and as time went on I was expected to magically learn accounting concepts and auditing standards from these same individuals and others in my department. Eventually I became blacklisted and no one wanted to work with me, and I sat idle for days on end. Then I got my review which basically told me I had 90 days to shape up or I was going to be canned. Upon which I was assigned with new mentors and projects that actually were hands on with me, and go figure, I actually learned ! 

My second season I was on to a great start and back in the grind of working on new areas. However, I had unforeseen events due to my health that forced me to take a break in the peak of what was supposed to be my development &amp; foundation. I eventually came back after a few weeks and felt like I was starting all over again, which was fine. I worked on smaller projects and more compliance based work. 

I am now entering my third season and feel like I still haven’t gotten a grip on most fundamental accounting concepts, not to mention I’m scared to be looked at as incompetent and blacklisted as the staff no one wants to work with. I have now also grown to hate a lot of what I am doing and also most of my colleagues. The only thing holding me back from leaving is the timing and also because I have a few individuals who have helped me get where I am today, who will also be pretty much screwed over on this decision. 

How do I suck this up and just get through it ? Most clients are messy and complex, and the reality is most of my colleagues aren’t good at mentoring me. I feel like I lack some basic knowledge and most of all I lack confidence in myself. Sometimes I just think it’s not for me, and other times I feel fine. I also need advice on how to let go of my strong disliking to colleagues of mine.

a5hutp,2,2018-12-12,Help me make these heroes ! (kind of a long post),Tryskhell,ChampionsRPG,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsRPG/comments/a5hutp/help_me_make_these_heroes_kind_of_a_long_post/," Hey guys !

I'm an amateur writer (I really only write as a hobby and I never intend on getting published) and I'm writing some kind of comic-like super-hero episodic novel, in a very WORM-like world (for those who know the web-novel, from Wildbow).

I generally like to keep intern logic a lot, so I tend to use TRPG mechanics to manage character strength, magic systems etc.

That's why I'm interested in the Hero System. I got a hand on the two core books of the 6th ed, as well as the champion powers. I'd like to -more or less loosely- use that system to create and manage most of the cast (which is still in the making, btw). 

I'd also like to say that, while it's set in 2037 and technology is almost cyberpunk-level developed, it's quite a dark-fantasy setting. Heroes often use military-like equipment (body armor and weapons), and can end up in firefights, taking bullets AND shooting people with real, deadly weapons.

So, to start with the main characters :

**""Gauss""**, also known as ""Induction"", ""Neodyme"" or Sky Silverline. She is the protagonist of the story. A Caucasian 20-years old girl, with blonde artificially wavy hair, blue eyes, a bad attitude and an Electromagnetism themed power. She spent 4 years homeless, and she is a survivor. One day, after taking a drug a shady guy sold to her, and after days of intense pain, she gained super-powers. Even tho her first tried were catastrophic (she badly burnt her whole right arm when she first tried to heat a hunk of metal through induction), she still has the most powerful power of the group. She doesn't know how to properly use it, however, and it still depends widly on her mood.

Her main attack method is to fling iron beads at her enemies, often just under the speed of sound (so, still hella deadly). She also rarely use a steel chain to bind foes, sometimes goes for an aluminium bat, and when she is angry, she can even shoot lighting. She is armed with a compact SMG (think a P-90).

She defends herself by producing a magnetic field that can stop bullets, but she wears body armor too.

She can also sense electromagnetic fields. Fields too strong to tend to make her nauseous, or can even be painful. She also feels anxious in EM-free environments (like if you lost a sense)

However, like a real magnet, her active field doesn't extend very far : 25 cm away from her skin. She is also totally the least powerful of the bunch, rated around 3/10 (even tho her power could get her to a 10/10, that's like Superman !)

Her build is heavily power-oriented. She isn't really skilled in a lot of things...For her, magnetic-related powers (from the champions power book) do most of the work. I still need help to manage her heat induction? steel chain, SMG and armor. For her EM-sense, the vanilla one fits well, but I'm not really dure how to implement the limitations. 

Personality-wise, she is a bit harsh and...just a hard teen, she never really grew up from her 16s. In fact, for now, she is helping the heroes because of she behaves, she has a roof, but learning to make friends will be her first character arc.

Next up is **""Carnot""**, also known as Esteban Alvarez. He is kind of a father fingure to Sky, and he is the one who offers her a roof for as long as she behaves. He is a big 54 years old Hispanic man, with short (military-cut) black hair and a beard. He also has the power to redirect the energy through him and objects he touches. While this power can be in fact quite limited, Esteban is very skilled with this power, and is a very good fighter -he is a veteran elite soldier.

His main attack method is...shooting people with various weapons. He has a shotgun, an assault rifle, a pistol and a taser. He also has a sort of kite shield. But he can also expel the heat in objects he touches in spheres or cones, or absorb the hits he takes to redirect the kinetic energy in enemies he touches.

His defense is both his body armor, shield, and kinetic absorption. As long as he is on a surface (the floor, a wall, a bus), he can redirect the kinetic energy of bullets through his shield, through his body, and into the floor (after taking heavy fire, the asphalt is completely broken where he stood).

He doesn't have any special senses.

This one would certainly be very skill-oriented, but his intensive equipment would still drain a lot of Character Points...His ranking is around 6/10 but his power is more like a meh 4/10, so he is VERY skilled.

I need help for a lot of things for him. His body armor, his shield, his kinetic redirection thing, his heat expelling thing and his weapons. Really, the hardest part is that he can't create energy, only redirect it, and he can't store it either. When he takes a bullet, he must immediately either crack the floor or punch a guy, else he would take the damage and I have no idea how to do that.

Personality-wise, he is a old guy, a big papa bear. He seems rough but he really cares a lot for Sky, Max and Jonas.

**""Compton""**, also known as ""Dazzle"", ""Flashbang"" or Maximilienne Moore is a 21 years old, short-haired Afro-American super with the ability to generate light through her skin. She his Sky's first real friend, and also her role-model and sometimes rival. She has good powers and knows how to use them.

Her main offensive move is to stun her enemies by shooting wavelengths of light into their eyes, provoking nausea, temporary blindness, and even short loss of consciousness. She also has a weak ability to generate laser beams and is armed with a SMG (the same one Gauss uses).

Because she needs to have her skin visible to use her powers, she isn't as well protected as the other members of the cast, her forearms still showing. She can, however, blind her foes like crazy, and can make (temporary) burnt images of herself on their retinas.

She can see in X-ray and infrared.

She is a well-rounded character, with both skills and powers. She is also more of a support (heavily debuffing the enemy) than an offensive hero. Her ranking is 5/10, as is her power.

She would be quite easy to do...I'm fact I just need advice about skills and her nauseating blast...

Her personality is upbeat, dynamic and smiling. She likes life and she likes helping other people.

And the last one for today is **""Parnell""**, AKA ""Glassflow"" or Jonas Reed. He is an Afro-American, short-haired 22 years old dood. His power is viscosity manipulations. He can liquefy or vitrify simple matter (non-living objects such as metal, concrete or glass, but not wood, for instance) and also himself, but also control liquids.

His main attack is to form sharp pieces of glass, rock or metal and fling them at his enemies, or shoot at them with his SMG (again, the main weapon of the kids).

In order to defend himself, he often shapes the environment to create walls and barriers, or he liquefies himself to avoid hits. He also wears body armor, like anyone who would go on the streets to beat up thugs, dammit !

He has some kind of tremorsense, feeling vibrations through non-living materials he is touching.

He is more an utility superhero, able to go pretty much anywhere he needs to go, and no non-organic wall can resist him. I don't even know if he is more characteristic, power or skill oriented...but he is ranked 4/10, and his power is between 4/6

I really don't know how to do him, however...I guess some kind of environment modifications and maybe barriers, could use shrinking to simulate being liquid...but I'm not too sure...

He is a nerdy guy, he likes books and computers. He is kinda naive, however, and lacks a bit of emotional intelligence.

So that's it, the main cast for now.

I hope you'll have ideas to help me create those characters, I'm open to criticism and multiple solutions !

One last thing, tho...

u/chris-goodwin , would you mind if I post my novel here, in an episodic fashion (maybe a thread or post every week or month (or whatever time it takes me to write an episode) ? Really, if you don't want me to do it, no big deal. I was just thinking...t'would be cool for a Hero System novel to get feedbacks and ideas from a Hero System community !"

During my internship, I was told to never forget about the physical stuff.  Try to imagine what it is going to look like and how things are going to connect/mount/etc.  In my haste, I utterly forgot that advice.


I changed my terminal block angle from 90 to 45 degrees at the last second without consideration of the circuit board.  The FETs get in the way of the screwdriver.  Also, there should be an easy way to access the terminal blocks without having to open up the enclosure.  Holes need some sort of strain relief for wires.


I had several connections from the PCB to the front panel of the enclosure.  I put them in locations that made sense for what pin they were on for the MCU.  Instead, I should have routed them to one location and had a single connector going to the front panel.


I probably made more mistakes.  Feel free to point them out.  I learned a lot on this sub and making mistakes is a great way to learn.

I came here to share my story of growing up with Ns and the abuse I've been through for posterity and to ask for directions. This will probably be a lengthy one, which I hope will be OK.
It's not easy for me to write this post at all, as I often don't believe my life (and life story) matters at all. Then again, I somehow feel this must have been written at some point.

### Backstory

#### A story of people getting broken throughout the years

To make this story complete, I have to go to times when I haven't been born yet. It all started with a sole person - my Ngrandma, who is the key person in that story. She was raised in a small village in a previous political/economical system. From what I know, she was a subject of abuse herself - when speaking about her parents she always mentioned she hated her dad (who was an alcoholic), but loved her mother. What always came to me as odd was that all she ever said about her mother is that she restricted something and/or beat her. Maybe it was some Stockholm syndrome, or her mother was narcissistic herself - this I don't know, I can only assume so.

Anyway, that's my Ngrandma. She moved out to a slightly bigger city for the university, finished it and got married at a young age. Her marriage wasn't the best either - she was fairly demanding and my grandfather would have none of it, so whenever she did something to make him fed up, he went abroad for work for a year or so. Due to her brother's position in the military (which was strong and important in the previous political system) she got a job at some government place and moved to one of the biggest cities in my country. The only positive aspect of all that is that they, as a family, had lots of money and I figure they could be considered somewhat elite.

My Ngrandmother and grandfather had a child, which obviously was my mother. Ever since she was young, my Ngrandma told her she was the prettiest and the most important (in her words, ""when I had a child, I wanted the whole world to know I do, and that she exists""). Obviously, though, this didn't go well - from what I understand, my mother was a subject of the same abuse I went through. She was forced to be someone she wasn't (and didn't want to be); her hobbies, friends, love interests and career paths were probably chosen by Ngrandma. This didn't go well, as instead of giving in she went full contrarian. She would disappear from home sometimes, only to be found somewhere far in the mountains; lied about choosing the university and married my father (obviously not approved by my Ngrandma, as she believes he's ""defective"" due to bad eyesight and a couple other reasons, while she probably wanted my mother's partner to be ideal) in secret. When Ngrandma found out about the marriage, she sworn to ""break this relationship"" (and ultimately did, but that comes in later).

Finally, when I was still a baby, my mother moved out to live with my dad. They had more children, and my Ngrandma would often barge in their home and scream a lot; I vaguely remember all the drama that happened there when I was young, I think (my memories are somewhat hazy and the timeline gets distorted). Finally, at some point, there was a big discussion between my dad and her. My dad proposed to go to the village he came from and live in his family home, so that everyone would be safe from my grandmother. However, my mom didn't finally agree to that - she still clung to Ngrandma for some reason; she would be persuaded by her to make my dad the enemy and reject him. As a result, my dad, not being able to cope with the abuse from both the person he married and her mother (Ngrandma) decided to go to the village he came from and my mother remained in the big city with Ngrandma. They wouldn't contact each other much.
Of course, my mother had no idea how to raise children, so my Ngrandma did a lot of the work there and still feels entitled to ""own"" us because of that.

#### Primary school

I lived with my mother and went to a local primary school. I wouldn't have an easy life - my mother worked one of the lowest paid jobs (she still does) and most of the rent was paid from my grandfather's pension (it still is), didn't have proper hygiene and would often invoke arguments. One of my most vivid memories from living there is that she lost some key and for some reason blamed it on me, so she woke me up in the middle of the night, screaming something like ""WHERE ARE MY KEYS???????"" and I remember being choked then. She said I won't be going to sleep until the keys are found. If I tried, she would use physical force on me. She finally found her keys somewhere and after I told her something like ""I told you you had them"" she only told me to shut up, of course. She would also hide our (mine and/or my siblings') things so that if we asked for them she would invoke some other argument, which often resulted in two hours of her monologue.

I wouldn't have an easy life at school either - the classmates regarded me as ""weird""; most of the people here were your typical nutjobs, who were only interested in football. I didn't get beat (much), but most of the people made fun of me and, of course, my mother, as they knew she worked a crap job. The teachers didn't like me either, because sometimes my mother would come to the school and scream at them for some reason. Obviously, there were motions to have her parental rights revoked, but then my Ngrandma would come in and convince the teachers not to do that. I got really bad grades as well and my Ngrandma would be furious, since she wanted me to be ""perfect"" and have the highest GPA.

Adding to the mix, there were 2 teacher's children in my class. One of them was a football nutjob without a brain and one of the people who bullied me the most. I couldn't even retaliate, because he was a teacher's child. He ended up with a GPA of ""round and good-looking"" 5.00, where I struggled to have 4.75. (Of course, karma came back to him in the junior high, where he had a GPA of 2.20 and had to change schools fast, but that's another story.)

The turning point is the 3rd class of my primary school. My immunity wasn't really good back then and I'd often fall sick for around 3 weeks in winter. One time was so severe I'd get bronchitis and was admitted to the hospital. I spent a month there. Not many people from school would come to see me, but I suppose it was kind enough of them to at least send me a get-well card (they were probably forced to, anyway). However, I didn't really have to remain in the hospital for a full month (as I was cured in a week or something). What I learned after getting out is that the hospital didn't want to let me go, since they noticed something was odd about my mother and thought of calling the social services. Once again, my Ngrandma persuaded them not to do that and it took quite a lot time, but they agreed, on condition I would live with her and not my mother. **This is where the story about being raised by N actually begins.**

I finished the primary school. Of course, I had a problem with meeting my Ngrandma's expectation, as I had to be the brightest child in the class so that she would have someone to brag about, and of course grades were the reflection of my intellect. Whenever I got some bad ones, I'd have problems and it'd for most part be attributed to just being lazy and/or playing too much video games. The reality was as I said - the teachers didn't like me, so I was handicapped from the start. This is also where I started being signed up for after-school classes - I'd go to two dance schools, a 2D computer-aided artist club, drawing classes, philosophy classes and some English lessons back then. I didn't learn lot at the English classed, as I've already learnt lot a lot of English from doing computer stuff (computer programs, the BIOS, etc.), my friends and video games. (If I have to admit something good about myself, I'd say learning languages is really easy for me... and I'm wasting all that potential.)

#### Junior high

In junior high half of my class were really smart, intelligent, friendly and fun people and the second half were trash just these I met in my primary school. Of course that worse part was a lot stronger, because the good part was humble and couldn't stand up to them.
For some reason, I started being liked by people in general at that school, so the bullies couldn't get a hold of me that much. I had some fun back then.
Anyway, coming back to the narcissist parts... I was signed up for after-school classes again. I remember going to English, where I'd get bored, because I was ahead of the program they were going with. I told my Ngrandma that I was wasting my time for most part, but of course she wouldn't listen. I also took up karate (""you should take up some sport! look at your back, you're all slanted!"", but wasn't really good at it, so I quit.

I had to have the best grades again. My GPAs were usually better than what I had in the primary school and I worked my ass out to satisfy my Ngrandma, but of course it wasn't enough. Her idea of a perfect child was the one who took up 20 after-school classes, went to cultural events, had a GPA of 6.00, was the member of all school committees and so on. I wouldn't, of course, meet these unrealistic expectations, so I lost a lot of nerves and was often ridiculed at home.
My brother, who I lived with at that point, couldn't put with the pressure. He found some bad company, started drinking/doing weed, getting aggressive and ultimately moved out to live with our mother, hoping he would have some peace at last.
One of the situations I remember is that, for some reason, I had a ""correct"" behaviour score on my report. My Ngrandma would scream at me; she said something like ""a 'correct' score means you're some kind of a criminal!"". I wouldn't earn a higher score (it was the base one), because I think it was the second year of junior high, which was the uprising of the ""bad part"" of the class and they would disrupt most of the classes.

Oh, by the way - I hardly invited friends home. Even if I *had* friends, I wouldn't invite them much, because it always ended on ""Look at her ugly nose!"" or ""Wow, why is her hair dyed? Some troublemaker maybe?"" and so on; she was judging my friends, so it quickly became clear she wanted me to hang out with the ""best students"", not my real friends. (I wouldn't even drink back then - I was too much of a ""good child"" to do anything ""illegal"", and it still remains that way.) She would also sometimes talk with my friends with me present next to them, ask them about their education, grades and such, and then made fun of me and diminished me in their eyes. Inviting my girlfriend home (I didn't have one back then, but it doesn't matter) would also be hard. I did that two times in high school and it always ended in hearing a lot of bad things about whoever I dated back then, not to mention the notorious lack of privacy and my Ngrandma not giving us any time without her (so that we wouldn't do anything ""stupid"", I presume, because every time she said something about sex it sounded negative - she came from a background where it was regarded as something to procreate only, after all). 

Junior high was also the time when my comparison problems started. My Ngrandma would often compare me to peers, saying ""Look at him! He has good grades, a girlfriend and goes to sports classes as well!"" or something like that. If it was convenient to her, she compared me to someone seemingly ""better"", but while it wasn't convenient (the test was so hard everyone got low grades) she would say ""you're not 'everyone', I don't care"". As a matter of this, I started comparing myself to other people subconsiously. ""That person had a loving family"", I thought, ""that person could do whatever they wanted"", ""that person is so smart I won't ever be able to catch up to them"". It never stopped.

Oh, junior high ends with a test. I *knew* I had to write it well, or I wouldn't be getting to a *good* school anytime soon (which means one of the top ones). You can guess that this pressure didn't work well, and my score was below any expectations.

#### High school
I applied to some schools. The reality is that most of the schools teach you similar things with similar results, so it doesn't really matter where you go as long as it's in top 80 in the rankings. Only the top 5 schools stand out, and the brightest minds go there. 

I got to a regular school. It was fine for me, but my grandma, upon hearing the results, had a shock. She entered the bargaining mode, where she would force me to write letters to some schools that didn't take me in and try to be reconsidered, which I did. Of course, no school had free slots in the classes, so I finally didn't switch schools, much to the dismay of my Ngrandma.

High school was hard. My class wasn't good, I had like two friends in my class (more in other classes), most subjects were hard; add teen emotional drama to the mix and there you have a disaster. At least most of the teachers were good. I had about at least 20 hours of extra, after-school classes IIRC - the drama club, more English, photography, German, math tutoring, programming classes and so on. I would sometimes come late for some of these because I wouldn't make it on time - for example the drama club was supposed to be 2 hours long, but since we've been training a stage performance it often took longer, so I wouldn't make it to English or maths and then have problems (""What are you doing, you lazy shit?! I'm paying for these classes!"").
In reality, back then I wanted to go to Chinese classes, but I felt like she would laugh in my face if I said that, so I didn't. I was under heavy load, though. I also remember Ngrandma being mad at me for ""treating the home like a hotel"", because I had so many classes and everything I actually came late. On the other hand, if I didn't have these extra classes and such, she'd be mad that I'm lazy and I'm not doing anything useful.

My poor perfomance was often attributed to using the computer (Ngrandma believes everything she hears in mass media and of course computer addictions were a big thing back then). I was often barred from using it, even though I was in the sciencey class with extra IT lessons. ""I heard Bill Gates lets his son use the computer for half an hour daily! Not to mention your eyesight!"". Her problems with me using computers never stopped; she wanted me to be a ""model person"" and instead of, I don't know, learning programming or actually using the computer to study I should go to some random concert (""because they're playing close by, for free!"") or ""have the time of my life with a girl"", whatever.
At this point I should mention that I hardly played any computer games at home. Handheld video game consoles were a blessing; I would play games at school during the breaks, sometimes at night at home (it was harder in high school; I was constantly tired). The latter was somewhat harder, since she sometimes barged into my room at late hour to check if I'm really sleeping. If I weren't playing games, I'd be using an IM to talk with my friends or meet some new ones (you know, the AIM/MSN/whatever era).
MMOs were mostly a no-go for me, and that includes any voice chats - I wouldn't ever call my friends, because I knew I'd be heard by her.

Junior high also ends with a test, which I yet again wrote bad. I remember the months before the test being overlearning etc., which in turn exhausted me and I screwed up lots of things.

#### University
I tried to go to university twice.

Even with my bad finals scores I managed to go for IT to a sub-par university. My ride to the campus took 2 hours and we had lots of breaks between classes. There oddly wasn't lot of places where you could go and buy food there, so I was often starved. Sometimes we had classes at hours like 18:00, and it didn't pay off to return home between some classes at 10:00 and these at 18:00 (because of being stuck in traffic jams for 2 hours). 
At first I was somewhat fine with going to IT. Then my eyes opened - the technology taught there was hellishly outdated, and most of the people there were there only because their parents bought them laptops and sent them there. They would cheat on tests (BTW I never cheated, if there wasn't a silent consent for that at the very least) and had no passion (which I, at that time, did have). Three math classes at once were also too hard.
Of course, my subconsious comparison also kicked in back then. I saw some people cheating and/or playing video games through the whole night, but somehow passing the classes. I did so much, yet I couldn't pass. It was unthinkable for me.
Oh, remember, what I said about computers? How ironic to get screamed at for actually trying to learn programming and code for the classes at university.

At the time I started the university my brother's health got suddenly worse. He had a runny nose all the time, got even more aggressive and ultimately, one day, fainted during some lesson. Then our father contacted him (which he doesn't do 90% of the year), promised to get him out of this mess (for some reason my father and his family always liked my brother more) and in turn my brother moved out to the countryside to live with our father and put into therapy. (He's mostly fine for now, but doesn't know what do with his life.)
Then, my Ngrandma finally started crying at his loss (knowing he hates her and that he won't return, and that he's not living with her beloved daughter anymore), so I had problems at home.
My mother also started acting up for some reason, sending me and my Ngrandma texts that she would kill herself is she isn't given money (for some reason she started believing she is getting bald and wanted money for wigs and/or hair therapy). We put her into a psychiatric ward and she got prescripted antidepressants, but she didn't remain here for long - you can't force anyone under therapy if they don't give their consent.

I got thrown out the university, because my lab partner (the one who said he was playing games all night yet passed) forgot to turn some report in (I did turn mine in, of course) and I didn't pass the subject. They lated readmitted me, but I couldn't get up from the bed and wasted half a year.

I went to the university again; this time for something other than IT, but at the best university (it didn't matter though - ""it wasn't IT, and anything that isn't IT is worthless; that's what they said on the internet""), since my Ngrandma wouldn't have me at her home if I wasn't a student. She has hidden the fact I've dropped out from the university from her friends and often lied that I'm doing IT.
I've dropped out again on the final year, deciding it wasn't what I wanted to do (as I always wanted to do IT, of course) and failing one class from the first year that shouldn't even be a part of the curriculum (and starting from this year, in fact isn't).
The past year was me working part-time as a junior developer and studying at the same time. I often jumped from classes to work and the other way, without a lot of time to study, yet alone for myself. My grades got bad, professors noticed that and were giving me better grades because I used to have a good impression on them; relationships with friends and social skills plummeted. I was a ""junior developer"" on paper only, because in fact I did lots of programming and DevOps, even after hours, because if something broke (not my fault) people were angry at me; they wanted it fixed, because they couldn't be doing their job.
BTW, even getting this job wasn't easy, as most companies didn't want to hire someone for part-time. Getting an internship during the summer vacations wasn't easy as well, as the companies usually wanted last year students, who would start working for them after finishing the university (which meant soon). I didn't even have commercial experience (apart from what I learned at home myself). If someone tells you there's no loophole in getting a job, that may be bullshit, especially for students.

### Extras
Any vacations with my Ngrandma (and she liked to take me and my siblings for these) were hell. Going abroad? She used me to complain to the hotel staff about anything (AC leaked, there were insects, she wanted another room - the current one wasn't ""perfect"" for some reason etc.), because I knew English. I particularly remember arriving at a hotel after an exhausting journey, going to the room and the next thing that happened was that I was forced to convince the hotel staff to change our rooms because of something she didn't like. She would scream at any of us for ""not spending the time as she intended to"", which went to the extremes. One time I burned my back hard and the last thing I wanted was to go on the beach, but I would get screamed at for ""wasting the great time she paid for"". She stopped when some kind person at the beach noticed my back, talked to her (we wouldn't understand what language it was; all we got was ""yoghurt"", so that I would put it on my back) and then I could finally rest, but she still looked at me with disgust. Similar thing happened when I had food poisoning during some vacations, got hospitalized and wanted to rest in the bed.
Some other time, I couldn't swim in the sea, because it was too salty for me and my eyes burned. Of course, she was also angry about that, because I was supposed to swim ""like everyone does"" and enjoy the sea. Minor mistakes like me or my siblings leaving a towel somewhere almost always invoked an argument. Sometimes it ended in her leaving us somewhere far away from the hotel, on our own. We barely made it back (thanks Google Maps). We were constantly watched by the Ngrandma and she would criticize us for anything.

Holidays were also bad. Christmas's coming up, right? This year I won't have to suffer, I hope. Me and my siblings went to see dad and his side of the family for Christmas. As a consequence, at some point in December we would have to decide whether to ""betray"" Ngrandma and side with ""that bad uncaring father who doesn't contact you most of the year, yet you suddenly love him"", or spend Christmas with her, which often wasn't free from drama and awkwardness. At some time me and my siblings knew what the former option meant, because we've often been guilt-tripped and decided to stay even though they wanted to go see our dad. In my dad's family home you could always feel that good Christmas atmosphere and noone was screaming. Time went by slower.

I mentioned Ngrandma's world views are shaped by the mass media already. Whatever she will hear in TV or read on the internet, she will believe. She says that ""if *someone more knowledgeable* than me (think all these scientific revelations you hear about in the TV) says it's true, it probably is"", and if I try to deny anything it's because ""I have no authority and don't believe anyone"". In fact for every bullshit she tried to fed me I did some quick Googling to disprove whatever she's shown me, but she wouldn't accept that. Someone wrote a comment about an event I went to, saying that ""only lemmings go to this kind of events"". When I wanted to go to an event like that again, she would call it a ""lemming gathering"". She also tries to appear progressive and accepting the LGBTQ+ movements, but I can her see her cringing at the idea of homosexuality. Actually, at some point she asked me if I was gay, but I don't recall, why. Either had no girlfriend or kept hiding that fact, I don't remember.

Another thing is that my hair started falling out, probably due to high amounts of stress and genetics (my father had a similar issue). She would take me to *lots* of doctors, always asking them to do a ""thorough blood test"" and thinking of a new cause of that problem. In her eyes I was already diagnosed with: ""it has to be diabetes 'cause you drink too much cola"", ""maybe you have hypothyroidism, better check your indexes checked"".
During some blood checkup I was diagnosed with **minor** thrombocytopenia (a little under the limit), which she attributed to ""using too much computer, which ultimately destroys my life"" and ""not doing enough sport"".

One more thing my Ngrandma used to make my life a living hell was getting a scholarship for poor families, while it was impossible and I knew it from the sole start. No scholarship office would believe me if I showed them the documents which stated that no parent of mine had any income (both parents work, but in the ""grey zone""). Getting any documents from any parent was hard, since none of them wanted to cooperate (my mother told me to ""cut this crap"" and I had to go to government offices in her stead, and father used to promise me to sent me the required documents for months, then when he finally did they always turned out to be incomplete). I was somewhat close to getting a scholarship recently, but it required the parents to sign under an oath that they weren't working, and none of them wanted to risk that.
Of course whenever I failed to get a scholarship Ngrandma blamed it all on me, because ""I can't ever work anything out"".

I often heard that ""I have no hobbies"" while I was interested in graphic design, photography, architecture, music, video games - not only playing them, though; various programming languages and OSes, cooking, philosophy, whatever and was commonly regarded as a ""jack of all trades"" (which is both blessing and a curse, obviously). I also heard that ""I won't make it in the life alone"", because ""I'm not cut out to live"". Even my clothes weren't bought by me; she effectively chose what I wore. Anything I did wasn't enough; I didn't hear any praises for being successful, but I was ridiculed and screamed at for failing.

Sometimes, when the things got hard between me and my Ngrandma, she started being silent and only gave me food. I avoided her, feeling the bad atmosphere in the air. This could persist for a week or more. She often said me and my siblings have destroyed her life and that she regrets doing everything she's done for us, and that she haven't slept for nights because of our wrongdoings.

What about my dad and grandpa I mentioned? Well, my dad goes LC with all of us except my brother, who he lives with. He doesn't bother to contact us.
My grandpa, OTOH... I guess you *could* call him an enabler. He lived with me for quite a long time (kept squatting my room, actually) and whenever I told him I was sick and tired of what Ngrandma's doing, he told me things like ""she obviously doesn't mean it bad for you"".

### The current

My Ngrandma would often threaten me that she would force me out and that she can't look at me ""wasting my life on the computer"" (for the past year I've been coming home kinda late and the only thing that remained was to look up what my friends did). I looked miserable, overworked and longing for a break, to go somewhere, travel, to do something that isn't this hell. All I ever talked about with friends, if I managed to somehow, was either about my Ngrandma and me being abused, or some other venting. I would always have to explain why I don't speak on the phone, why I can't watch movies and can't do many things normal people were doing.
Moving out started being more plausible, since I was actually saving money, but was unthinkable in terms of execution; there were too many things I would have to move, I had no car and no potential place to move. (One of my friends recently said it might have been C-PTSD and the syndroms seem accurate).
Oh, I just remembered a story about cars... My Ngrandma actually ""offered me"" to pay for driving license courses, but did it in such a way it kind of went into the background and was forgotten, so I didn't take her offer up. Then, during some argument she used this ""offer"" as ammo against me. (""All your peers have these! I even offered to pay for the courses, but you weren't interested!!!"")

Anyway, I finally gathered some friends and they *did* help me move. We got my stuff in the car and went away. I escaped and went no contact. It wasn't easy. Half of my stuff still remains in another city, at a friend's place. This is a record of this all.
One of the final things my Ngrandma tried doing was to guilt-trip me into staying at home and accusing me of going through the "" teenage rebellious period"". I'm already past my ""teen"" years, so I laughed at the idea.

Was it easy to go NC? Oddly, yes. I've had so much problems I started thinking about my own survival. I used to be really altruistic; wouldn't go sleep despite being exhausted if anyone needed help. I'd still probably do that. That being said, I had to worry about myself. I knew I was slowly disintegrating, due to the stress from work, university AND home. It had to be the time and it had to be done.

I'm getting better, but there still are issues I can't sort out, and these are:

- I still compare myself to other people, especially the really intelligent one; I often get sick when I realize there are some concepts I just won't ever grasp; my ambitions sometimes start killing me.
- I had to live with being called a ""monster who can't function in society properly"" and other names for *years*, so I gained emotional numbness - I hardly ever cry and/or laugh; most of my emotions are faked to match what ""a normal human"" would show.
- Nothing feels really fulfilling; I may have lots of time that I could use on self-improvement, but somehow can't get to it, and the months pass by. The things I liked to do don't seem to be interesting anymore.
- I can't talk on the phone too well. I hardly join voice chats, even though I could.
- I often think I don't matter and don't want to burden other people, so I hardly ever ask for help, even though I should. This post? I feel bad about burdening *any of you* with my pointless existence. If I didn't have this problem, I'd have written something on RBN a long time ago.
- Chatting with friends online absolutely **exhausts** me. I never reply on time; sometimes I don't reply at all. It's not like I hate anyone, I just... can't. I often also avoid answering if I'm invited to anything.
- I don't consider anything I do to be good. I had to convince myself to set up a Patreon account for a whole month.
- Too much perfectionism. One typo in some minor prompt in my code and I have the urge to roll everything back and fix it to hide the fact I made a mistake. Everything has to be right.
- I can't become assertive; I can't say ""no"". This was a problem at my former job, where I could have just said ""no"" to lots of things, but since I was a ""fresh, unexperienced employee"" I felt like I couldn't. Even after working for quite some time and being recognized as a regular, I often accepted jobs that shouldn't have even been mine.
- I often give up on doing something if I'm not immediately (somewhat) good at it.
- For some reason I often believe that lewd things are shameful. I have sealed most of the thoughts of anything like that from the junior high era somewhere deep in myself.
- I show some signs of being a narcist myself. I'm usually good for other people; they seem to like the ""former me"", who was a cool person in general (or at least that's what I think). My narcissism shows when I try going to work - applying for anything short of an IT/programming job is hard to justify to me, so I haven't been employed for some time and live off savings. That's the only case, AFAIK.
- I get too stressed. I applied for a dream job recently, and didn't get in. Why? I did the hard parts in 5 minutes, then the stress kicked in. I made a silly mistake and while trying to find it I, for some reason, decided that my usual workflow in finding it was ""unprofessional"", so I stared at whatever I wrote and tried to find it with my head. I got too stressed, way too stressed, getting this job was really important for me etc. and, as a consequence, I failed.
People with less skill than me got in, because they weren't this worried.
Since I did well for the most part of the interview, I can apply again soon, but my savings will take a hit. What if I don't get in again, for some reason? That's my biggest worry right now.

What should I do to make myself complete again and fix my head? Is it even possible? I don't think I'll be able to sort things on my own this time. I should probably go to a doctor, but I don't really know if I currently have any healthcare (I should, though).
I'm writing all this, because I recently got motivated after reading a story that felt really relatable. I decided that ""if it's come to this, I'll claw my way out of bed with my last dying breath"". I guess it's part venting, part asking for advice.

That would be, uh, everything, even though I probably forgot half of it. I hope I didn't break any rules while writing. Thank you all."

For any of you that have artistic/creative passions, how do you integrate your creative or artistic work into your life? TL;DR at the bottom in bold but here is some context for my questions:

I studied creative writing in college but when I graduated I was too frantic to really think about how I could pursue a career that allowed me to write, so I ended up following a different, easier to break into career path. Also, I felt like most pathways into writing-centered careers involved unpaid internships and I wasn't in a position to do that. I'm passionate about the industry I work in but I've never had a job I liked--most jobs in the industry are people-facing and I'm an introvert. I feel like I can't just keep going on this path anymore. 

Right now I feel like I'm going through a second puberty with this urge to burn down my whole life and start over (I'm in my Saturn return for anyone that's interested in astrology). I'm trying to build a life for myself that is more aligned with my values and centers around my creative endeavors but I have no idea where to start. I feel like many black women don't necessarily have the same way into creative industries as white artists and we often have to blaze our own trails. 

I've recently started taking more writing classes, workshops, and labs which has been helpful in so many ways. I would like to start submitting some of my writing to different platforms but I feel like I don't know what I'm doing, like there is some essential industry knowledge that I'm missing. I also feel like I'm too old to be starting over (I just turned 28)  and I'm essentially a nobody, so maybe I shouldn't even try. To be clear, I'm not necessarily trying to make this into a full time job, just trying to get my stuff out there and maybe earn some money. Eventually I'd like to be able to partially support myself with writing gigs, but this seems wildly optimistic. I guess I'd just like to proudly identify as a writer and not feel like a fraud in doing so. 


**TL;DR:For any of you that pursue your creative passions either as a full time job, partial income generator, or even just as a serious hobby (i.e. Somehow bringing your work to the public) I would love to hear your story. How did you get to where you are today? How do you make it work financially? What are your goals for the future? What would you do differently looking back? Anything else you'd like to share**"

I want to have a career in accounting, but I don't have a job lined up yet. I have applied to a lot of firms in October, got interviews with several, got a second interview with a few, and nothing came from it. Meanwhile everyone in my classes are popping in with their job offers and where they are moving to during summer to start their careers. Same thing happened last year with internships, and I got into a slump this year and stopped applying. 

Now its December and I realize I need to stop being a sad sack and keep trying, but I keep getting worried it's too late to try and find a job at a firm, and then I won't get a job, and then I won't get a chance to study for a CPA, then I will get pigeon holed into a dead end job, and then never get my CPA, and I keep spiraling and just give up.

I was just wondering if anyone else here had a similar time before graduating college, and that there's hope for people like me who might be having the same worry.

Not likely we will last, but feelings might change",ginza95,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a5okii/should_we_break_up_now_or_later_not_likely_we/,"Hi, upfront I appreciate all advice and insights, I am here to rant essentially. It is about me 23/M and her 21/F

&amp;#x200B;

I met my current girlfriend in July, we have been together since. I am from the UK and I was travelling around when we met, I agreed to find a job and live here because I intended to try my hand at living abroad (through teaching English). I knew I would only plan to be here until the end of my contract (July) or until December 2019. Then I would plan to go home and start my career.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the first time I went home to the UK (after I had finished my backpacking), I have always thought about what the future of the relationship would hold, knowing that I would not stay forever as a teacher in her country. It has caused severe arguments each time it has been brought up, and now with Christmas coming, the wounds have been reopened.

&amp;#x200B;

I have dealt with Christmas planning awfully. When I flew out to start teaching in October, I deliberately bought a return ticket that would allow me to come home for Christmas. I didn't necessarily plan to use it, but I wanted the option in case I really wanted to come back to my family. Now, I have become homesick recently for Christmas and wish to go back for the holiday. She always says she thinks Christmas is for couples, for me it is family. Before I changed my mind to wanting to come home, I was very much open to the idea of us traveling to another country together for the holiday, I promised I would spend it with her (which was a stupid mistake, but also she made a point of saying if I went home without her she would break up with me). I obviously did not want to break up, hence the promise.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I wish to go home. The homesickness for Christmas peaked and I genuinely cried about it, repeatedly saying I just wanted to go home for the holiday (our last Christmas was not good as mum was ill, also there is only 4 of us, so I feel like if I'm away too I am letting them all down) and she initially refused because of late flight prices (although imo she is being picky, there are some reasonable deals available right now). Then after seeing how much it meant to me, she agreed to go, despite prices. Me, being an idiot, said how I wasn't sure it was right she come because we have only been together nearly 5 months and of course we might break up next year anyway if I decide to go home. She also just got accepted to a Disney internship in Florida in the Summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I want her to come again (I KNOW I AM INDECISIVE, I HATE IT). However, I have a feeling it is more because of loneliness. I have been bad at making friends here, partly because I am introverted and partly because I have her to hang out with, she is my best friend. Now, she refuses to come because of prices again, and the fact I constantly bring up my fear of further commitment given we will likely split next year. She says she is willing to sacrifice her life here to move to the UK, but I struggle with the burden that she might hate it and then resent me, especially if we did break up for any reason after that.

&amp;#x200B;

She is an amazing girlfriend, she always puts me before her and I know I can be selfish. Equally, I feel as though maybe we should split now rather than in say 6 months time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know... I need advice. Thank you r/relationships

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr:  Consistent arguments about our future. Uncertainty about what will happen when I want to go home. Should we stay together or break up now. Stay together means she comes home for Christmas but this feels very early in the relationship, only just under 5 months. Also she does not want to pay very high plane fees but I am homesick for a home Christmas. We will break up if she does not come, because she believes Christmas is for couples, and I believe it is for family.

[Operating together in search of German raiders](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/a4gxxb/today_in_naval_history_9th_december_an_intercept/), Exeter, Ajax and Achilles sight smoke on the horizon near Rio de la Plata at the border of Argentina and Uruguay, off South America at 0614 hrs and the Exeter is ordered to investigate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Writers Note:** *The Achilles is currently in service in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, a precursor to the modern Royal New Zealand Navy. This marks the first engagement fought by a ship flying the New Zealand Southern Cross.*

&amp;#x200B;

The Exeter pokes forward to take a look and at 0616 hrs, hoists Flag N to her Yard Arm, signalling that she has sighted a hostile and signals by lamp ""I think it is a pocket-battleship"". She has spotted the Admiral Graf Spee, though she incorrectly identified her during the engagement as the Admiral Scheer, second of the Deutschland sisters, also believed to be operating in the area. On board the Graf Spee, lookouts sight the Royal Navy warships but as faulty German intelligence had placed the cruisers elsewhere, Captain Hans Langsdorff  mistook the ships as a destroyer escort for the merchant convoy that he believed was in the area and set the Graf Spee on an interception course.

Realising his error, Langsdorff would nevertheless order his ship to charge the Royal Navy warships, trying to bring the his superior firepower of his Panzerschiff's 11-inch guns to bear before the faster cruisers could manoeuvre.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""As I was crossing the compass platform, the captain hailed me, not with the usual rigmarole of 'Enemy in sight, bearing, etc', but with 'There's the fucking Scheer! Open fire at her!'""  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Lieutenant-Commander Richard Jennings, Gunnery Officer, HMS Exeter

&amp;#x200B;

The Royal Navy cruiser group would separate, the Exeter taking a north-westerly heading while the Ajax and Achilles would head north-east in order to flank the Graf Spee's and split her fire. Graf Spee would open fire at 0618 hrs, lashing out at the Exeter first utilising the superior range of the Graf Spee's batteries over the 8-inch and 6-inch guns possessed by the Royal Navy warships.

Exeter would retaliate at 0620 hrs angling to bring her aft guns to bear at 0622 hrs. Of the Leanders, Achilles would come into range first at 0621 hrs and open fire while Ajax would open fire at 0623 hrs.

Exeter would come out the worse for the opening exchange, being straddled amidship by the Graf Spee at 0623 hrs. Shrapnel would kill her starboard torpedo crew, damage her communications and searchlights and damage her Walrus flying boat which was being prepped for spotting duties. The Walrus is dumped overboard.

At 0624 hrs, the German gunners would find range,[landing an 11-inch shell on Exeter's B-Turret, wrecking it and sweeping her bridge with shrapnel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Exeter%27sDamage1939.jpg), killing all but her Captain Frederick Secker Bell and two other crewmen and wrecking Exeter's internal communication system. Withdrawing to the aft conning position, Captain Bell would continue to command the Exeter via runners passing messages to steerage teams who were manually turning the rudder.

Despite the damage suffered, Exeter had latched onto the Graf Spee like a rabid dog and still firing with her 8-inch guns, she swung swing to bring her hastily re-crewed starboard tubes to bear (a runner having brought news to the auxiliary bridge). She fired a pair of torpedoes at the Graf Spee at 0630 hrs though both missed.

At about this time, Ajax and Achilles had closed to 13000 yards, drawing the ire of the Graf Spee's secondary 5.9-inch batteries as well as shifting fire from one of her 11-inch guns to target the Ajax.

Ajax would launch her own spotting aircraft at 0637 hrs. Around the same time, Graf Spee would turn away and make smoke. Royal Navy fire during this period ""had up to this point been most effective"", and it was believed that the Graf Spee had made a momentary retreat due to the threat posed by cruiser torpedoes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Writers Note:** *Given the location of the Ajax's* [Seafox's catapult](https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/wpimages/images/images1/360/1111/06/360_ba69fd0e8bb58772df1435276955b360.jpg) on her deck *and the fact that Ajax was both taking incoming fire from the Graf Spee and delivering fire from her aft turrets at the time, credit has to be given to the testicular fortitude of Lt. E.D.G. Lewin, the FAA pilot.*

&amp;#x200B;

At 0640 hrs, Graf Spee would also land a near miss on Achilles, spraying her bridge with shrapnel (wounding her Captain) and shredding her Director Control Tower, killing four ratings from her gunnery control teams and damaging her central fire control W/T set.

Not realising that the Achilles was operating her gunnery under individual control, Ajax's spotting aircraft radioed incorrect shot corrections to the Ajax that resulted in her subsequent fire overshooting the Graf Spee until proper corrections could be made.

Moving to pursue while turning to bring her port torpedo tubes to bear, Exeter would be struck again by the Graf Spee's big guns (approximately 0646 hrs), taking a pair of 11-inch hits which knocked out her A-turret and temporarily disabled her Y-turret due to damage to her electricals. Now listing 7 degrees and suffering internal flooding, the Exeter had taken a savage beating

Furious, Captain Bell declared ""I'm going to ram the bastards. It will be the end of us but it will sink him too.""

To the benefit of all involved, damage control teams would restore functionality to her Y-turret at 0650 hrs and Exeter would abort her planned suicidal charge and bring herself about to keep her Y-turret trained on the Graf Spee. Due to damage, Y-turret was being coordinated by instructions shouted by Lieutenant-Commander Jennings, the Exeter's Gunnery Officer, perched on the roof of the searchlight platform. Somewhere around this point in the exchange, despite damage to herself, Exeter's shooting successfully destroyed the Graf Spee's raw fuel processing system with an 8-inch shell.

&amp;#x200B;

**Writers Note:** *This was the decisive shot in the engagement. Destruction of the system would leave the Graf Spee with insufficient fuel to escape Royal Navy pursuit or flee for home.*

&amp;#x200B;

At 0710 hrs Achilles and Ajax would alter course to close the range. In response, Graf Spee would withdraw under smoke, then make drastic course alterations at 0716 hrs to end-run and finish the limping Exeter. A near miss would successfully flood Exeter's final operational turret which would fail at 0730 hrs before her attack would be driven off by concentrated fire from Achilles and Ajax.

Turning to engage the Leander-class cruisers, Graff Spee would trade fire with the Ajax and Achilles, sustaining a number more hits before being forced to evade a spread of torpedoes fired by the Ajax by turning to port at 0724 hrs. At 0725 hrs, an 11-inch shell from the Graf Spee shattered Ajax's X turret killing four of the turret crew outright and wounding six. Shrapnel from the hit would strike Ajax's Y-turret, jamming it and taking out both of her rear turrets simultaneously.

At 0732 hrs, the Graf Spee would turn west and drop more smoke to throw off the cruiser gunfire which was scoring hits and the scrum would close to a short-ranged brawl at 8000 yards at 0738 hrs before the Royal Navy cruisers withdrew at 0740 hrs due to ammunition shortages. Around this time, a near miss brought down Ajax's main top mast and destroyed her aerials though damage control teams were able to rapidly jury-rig a set of replacements.

At 0740 hrs, listing and taking on water, Exeter would drop out of the chase and limp southeast at minimal speed while her damage control teams worked feverishly to save her. With flooding up to Number 14 bulkhead, Exeter crawled for repair at the Falklands at 18 knots.

&amp;#x200B;

**Writers Note:** *The Graf Spee had taken a not insignificant battering at the point from the three British cruisers, with 36 of her crew killed and 60 injured including Captain Langsdorff who had been hit by splinters while commanding his ship from the bridge.*

&amp;#x200B;

A running chase would ensue as the Graf Spee seized upon the falling back of the Royal Navy ships to also make a break for it, steaming directly for the River Plate, with Ajax making a brief stop to recover her seaplane.

At 0946 hrs, Cumberland would depart the Falklands in pursuit, though she would not arrive in time.

At 1005 hrs, Graf Spee would take several pot shots at the pursuing Achilles which had closed to rapidly, narrowly missing her but causing the Achilles to turn away and temporarily widening the chase.

The Ajax would receive a message from the Graf Spee at 1104 hrs ""please pick up lifeboats of English steamer."" Ajax  would encounter the SS Shakespeare during the pursuit. Apparently, the Graf Spee had closed with the steamer and fired warning shots before ordering them to scuttle, intending to use her as a diversion. The Shakespeare had refused and made to flee and Captain Langsdorff, pressed for time as he had been but unwilling to sink an unarmed ship with her crew on board, decided not to make anything of it.

The shadowing would continue throughout the day with the Graf Spee opening fire with her big guns every time the pursuing warships got overly close, each time forcing the smaller Royal Navy cruisers to drop back.

At 2115 hrs, the Uruguayan gunboat Uruguay, then on patrol duty closed to intercept the approaching warships, but realising what was going on, wisely decided not to get involved in the pursuit and would be left astern.

&amp;#x200B;

The Graf Spee would slip into the neutral port city of Montevideo at and drop anchor 0050 hrs, while the Ajax and Achilles would cease pursuit and prowl the entrance to the River Plate at 2350 hrs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Writers Note:** *The saga of the Admiral Graf Spee isn't over and will continue for another week. CN and JP players please give your Graf Spees headpats. She might have been on the wrong side of the war but she was a good girl. Also, this engagement is why I have a Lvl 100 Ringed Exeter and am currently squatting on the blueprints for her eventual retrofit.*

**Today: 13th December 1941 (Saturday) - The Niihau Incident**

On December 7th, Airman First Class Shigenori Nishikaichi had crash landed his damaged A6M2 Zero on Niihau Island Hawaii after attacking Pearl Harbour and was detained by native Hawaiians who were at the time unaware of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. Nishikaichi is able to persuade a trio of confederates to help him recover his papers, which had been confiscated by the islanders following the crash.

Nishikaichi and a Yoshio Harada, a Hawaiian of Japanese ancestry overpower a guard outside Harada's residence where he had been staying under house arrest on December 12th, and arming themselves, set off to attempt to request a rescue using the radio from his downed aircraft, before torching the building in which the papers were supposedly being held to destroy the maps, radio codes and Pearl Harbour attack plans.

Though Nishikaichi later realised the papers had already been transported off-site, he is overwhelmed by a group of native Hawaiians and killed after a brief though violent stuggle. Yoshio Harada turns a shotgun on himself and commits suicide.

The incident is used as justification for the U.S. government's decision to intern Japanese Americans during the war, out of a belief that American citizens of Japanese ancestry might aid Japan.

**Today: 13th December 1941 (Saturday) - The Battle of Cape Bon**

With Italian and German forces in North Africa being pummeled by the British Eighth's Army's offensive Operation Crusader, the Supermarina would make the decision to shift emergency supplies using the light cruisers Alberico da Barbiano and Alberto di Giussano. Escorted by the torpedo boat Cigno, the cruisers would make the run to Tripoli to deliver supplies and sailed from Palermo on the 12th, unaware that C-38 signals had long since been intercepted and decoded at the Mediterranean Fleet HQ in Alexandria.

In order to hide the breaking of the Italian cypher, a flyby by an RAF Wellington bomber on a reconnaissance mission was ordered and the position of the ships were duly reported and the Royal Navy's 4th Destroyer Flotilla (Tribal-class Skih and Maori, L-class Legion and the Dutch HNLMS Isaac Sweers) left to intercept.

Although the flotilla was spotted, the Supermarina failed to order the convoy to increase speed, expecting the Royal Navy destroyers making a top speed of 28 knots to fail to intercept. Following additional Ultra decodes confirming location of the cruisers, the 4th Destroyer Flotilla increased their speed to 30 knows and moved to intercept, sighting the cruisers at 0230 hrs on the 13th of December.

With the destroyers being vectored in by a RAF Wellington equipped with radar, the Italians would alter course in an attempt to shake their pursuers but, lacking radar, unwittingly succeeded in increasing the rate of closure.

By attacking from a landward direction, the Royal Navy ships successfully masked their approach, making it difficult for Italian lookouts to sight the ships, worsening the Italian lack or radar. The Destroyers will attack at a distance of 1000m, opening fire and launching torpedoes, successfully striking the Alberico da Barbiano with a pair of torpedoes including one to her engine room at 0322 hrs. The swarming destroyers then sweep her deck with MG fire, setting alight much of the fuel supplies she had been transporting.

At 0326 hrs, the da Barbiano is struck again by gunfire from the Maori, as well as a torpedo from the Legion while the di Giussano is also struck by torpedoes and disabled. At 0335 hrs, the da Barbiano, burning fiercely, capsized, killing a good number of crew in the burning slick. At 0420 hrs, di Giussano, pounded by gunfire from the destroyers joins her at 0420 hrs.

The Cigno survives and escapes but later returns to pick up survivors, departing severely overloaded with 500 additional sailors on board.

**Today: 13th December 1944 (Wednesday) - Myōkō vs Bergall**

The IJN Heavy Cruiser Myōkō is attacked by the USN Submarine Bergall engage in a short clash South of French Indochina. The Myōkō is struck by a torpedo from the Bergall (out of a spread of six fired) but the Bergall is forced to withdraw when struck by an [8-inch shell which punctures her pressure hull](http://navsource.org/archives/08/312/0832024.jpg) and prevents her from submerging. Lacking resources, the Japanese are unable to repair the Myōkō before the conclusion of the war.

&amp;#x200B;

**Writers Note:** *The shell was luckily a dud or the Bergall would have been in real trouble.*

Even though I was down with a flu, I got out of bed and picked up my violin. I sounded shitty, but I thought ""hey, it's okay, I haven't properly touched it in a year and I'm sick. I'll get better in time."" Then I started reading new difficult pieces. The thoughts of ""I'm not good enough"" started to surface as I couldn't get my body to coordinate with me. I started to get frustrated and decided that I'd try again the next day. And so I went to sleep.

Today, I got up for work, tired and still sick and this time with a bad sore throat. I still went to work because the HR had been complaining that I took too much MCs (I'm on a 10 month internship but I'm not entitled to any paid leaves). The report that I submitted to them came back to me and they told me that:

1. I didn't put in effort
2. I was asking to be failed
3. I wasn't professional enough in writing my personal reflections (aka I can't be honest in my writing)
4. No one would want to employ me if they read this report

I felt so attacked (on top of the fact that they don't like me anymore because I screwed up a big project they threw at me) and I'm just so demoralized right now.

I can't do what I love most properly, and I can't take criticism. How am I going to survive like this? I'm weak! I might as well just end it all before tomorrow comes around so that I don't have to deal with supervisors who just criticize me day in and day out. I'm already harsh enough on myself, I don't need anyone else to bring me down. But who cares? No one! Because if I want to survive I'm going to have to pretend like I'm a fully-functional human being just like everyone else! But I don't want to be like everyone else. I want to be me. But that's not accepted in society. Fuck the status quo! I want out! And unfortunately the only way out is to kill myself."

This is somewhat hypothetical since nothing has been offered but I have to factor it in. I am an entry level accountant graduate so my only experience is a couple internships and classes. 

I have an interview Friday with an office that factoring rush hour will take me about an hour and a half to get to, and almost two hours to commute back home. A friend in that area works for them and says he makes about $40k. My issue with that id like to negotiate closer to $50k just so it A) makes the commute worth it and B) helps me save faster (not that I spend crazy) to move into the area to kill the commute. If I can’t negotiate I am thinking of turning it down, although I don’t want to seem picky where I am entry level. 

At the same time I have another interview lined up with a closer company, where with rush hour traffic, it would be about 40 minutes. If I get offered that same salary around $40k I’d be happy due to proximity to home. 

If either interview doesn’t work out I’m going to keep applying and keep searching, for now I’ve got a standard college grad keep busy job. 

Tl;dr: I don’t want to seem picky as an entry level hire turning down a job due to salary, but I would take a lower salary based off how much time spent In traffic

a5pr9w,55,2018-12-12,How to pass all 4 parts in 2.5 months -- AMA,rls6249,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/a5pr9w/how_to_pass_all_4_parts_in_25_months_ama/,"Forgot I had this written until I heard about the score release on Monday. This page helped me a lot during an anomaly of a summer. I thought it would be only right to return the favor and share my CPA experience. Feel free to ask questions about this strategy, or anything else that may come up as you read on. I plan to check back and answer as many questions as I can. While most of these tips are specific to this study plan, I think some of them can apply to more conventional plans as well. 

**Order (all Q3, 2018), study time, score:**  

FAR- 3.5 weeks, 78

REG- 2 weeks, 77

BEC- 1.5 weeks, 85

AUD- 2 weeks, 79

**NOTE:** 

I would absolutely not recommend this studying strategy to most people. It is also only possible if you have an extended period of open time before you start work. Time was also *very tight* with this schedule. I would start studying for the next part either the afternoon of, or morning after taking a test. 

This was very much a *study-to-pass* strategy rather than *study-to-ace*. There is nothing wrong with studying to ace, and actually with that strategy you should have no problem passing these exams. However, the study-to-ace strategy was just not possible with this timeline. 

**Social life:**

You *can’t* have a social life. This is a key distinction versus most people saying you *won’t* have a social life. Giving up Friday and Saturday nights every week adds up, and that is precious time when the summer is the only block you have to study. Find a way to explain that to friends and family. Hopefully they understand. 

**School:** 

A/B+ average in accounting classes. I had a strong foundation of journal entries going into studying which I thought helped a lot if I ever got stuck on a concept. Applied for NTS *immediately* after graduation. Despite reading horror stories about this, my process went quite smoothly. Was able to skip a master’s program, I already got 150 credit hours thanks to a lot of AP credits entering college.

**Material:** 

· Becker – provided by Big 4 firm

· Didn’t use flashcards

· Used the final review, but I don’t think it helped that much. It can be a nice broad refresher at the end, but it doesn’t really get into details

· Don’t know much about Becker FastPass, not sure if my firm would have provided it

**Exam day:**

I finished with roughly 1 hour remaining for all four parts – which I found odd since I thought there was a range of difficulty across all four. No issues with Prometric experience. I would bring my own earplugs. Was never concerned by the new format because I didn’t take any of the old versions. 

**The plan:**

***Studying***

7 days a week. 1.5x lectures. Kept notes of what I thought was important in a google doc. I prefer this over writing because I can easily command+F search for topics rather than flip through pages. By the end I had condensed each textbook into roughly 50 pages of notes. 

***MCQS/Progress Tests/Sims***

There was a point where I stopped doing the MCQs after each topic and instead did progress tests for each module. While I liked the immediate feedback from section MCQs, I thought doing 40+ questions on a single topic was a bit overkill. Instead I would do 50+ of a whole module as a progress test, and then checked to see which sections I needed work on. I usually aimed for the 70% range before feeling comfortable to move on. Definitely read the solution explanations – even the incorrect ones – they are really good at explaining why answers are correct, and how certain incorrect choices will try to trick you. 

At the end I would do progress tests of all the modules based on the number of questions for the real test (ex. 33 FAR, 38 REG, etc) and set the timer to 1 min per question. 

I *did not* do a single sim in Becker. I believe if you understand the material, you should be able to figure out whatever they throw at you in the sims. If anything, practice a few sims at the beginning to get comfortable with the format and layout. That being said, I did watch the tutorial videos walking you through the mock exam sims and found these quite helpful conceptually. 

At the beginning I did a few of the skills practices, but eventually found them to be a burden and skipped them. 

***Formulas/Acronyms***

If I encountered any formula or acronym I thought would be important I added it to a quizlet. Almost every night before bed I would go through the accumulated flashcards. This saved a lot of time and prevented cramming at the end – by the end your brain will likely be fried and at capacity, memorizing anything more at that point is the last thing you’ll want to do. 

***“Becker Bump”***

I would take the Becker mock exams a few days leading up to the real deal and jot down major topics I was lacking. I will admit I did *awful* on all of my mock exams – think 40-50s range. For me it was more about conditioning my brain for a 4-hour exam, and to see potential sim formats. After the mock exams I would go back to hammering MCQ progress tests. 

I’ll also take this moment to give my thoughts on the so-called “Becker Bump”. I do agree that these are harder than the real deal. However, having the mentality that doing bad on the mock exams isn’t a big deal might set you up for failure. Becker mock tests giving harder questions is not the entire story:

· Becker’s second MCQ section is fixed regardless of how you do on the first one

· Becker’s score is a raw nominal percentage based on all the questions

· All the questions are weighted evenly – not the case in the real test

· All the questions are counted – not the case in the real test

· I would only call the Becker mocks harder in the sense that they word questions very strangely – which the real test doesn’t do. Straightforward questions with tricky answers versus weirdly worded questions *and* tricky answers are very different. 

· I appreciated that the real test was usually very clear with what was being asked. If it wasn’t 100% clear what was being asked I assumed it was a pretest question and didn’t spend too much time on it. 

**General tips:**

If you are tired, stop. With this studying method there is no point in cramming if you aren’t going to retain anything. Take a power nap, watch a Netflix episode (or two), do whatever helps to refresh your mind. 

Keep a general schedule. Instead of each day, keep a rough idea of where you want to be at the end of each week. Although I studied every day of the week, the hours varied based on how I felt. Some days I felt like nothing was sticking and would only put in 4 hours. Other days I would start at 9AM and within a blink of an eye it’s been 13 hours. Also ignore the Becker calendar, when you set up your study plan the system won’t be able to comprehend what you’re trying to do. They also automatically set a 2-week review period, which I actually think would be a bit overkill. 

I am a nightowl so I clocked quite a few 4am nights. Just know that even on those nights I would still make sure to get sleep and wake up at noon or in the afternoon. Despite the psychotic nature of this study plan, I didn’t pull any all-nighters: (A) That’s where I draw the line, and (B) not getting any sleep would KO your brain for studying the next few days, which is detrimental to this strategy.

Make up your own acronyms: The fact that *you* made it up helps you retain it better. Also, some of the Becker acronyms just made no sense. 

Knowing broad topics very well beats knowing a few very specific details. This sounds odd but remember, this is a “study to pass” not “study to ace” plan. If you spend an hour memorizing every single required disclosure for a pension plan for that one possible MCQ, great. But if it’s at the expense of a better understanding of leases, you might be in some trouble. 

Know how to navigate the authoritative literature during Sims. The research question should be a freebie. Also, if time isn’t too constrained, you would be surprised how many answers to other sims you can find if you do a little digging…

Stay on top of your health. Change your screen to night mode if you have it. Coffee everyday catches up to you if you aren’t exercising. As noted earlier, make sure you get sleep. 

**FAR:** 

***In one sentence:*** Name should be changed to FARG -- if you’ve taken this section you know what the G stands for.

If you already have a basic understanding of financial accounting, I would recommend studying NFP and government accounting first. These are the last two sections of Becker, and I was absolutely exhausted and sick of studying at this point. I knew the importance of these two topics, yet it was still real struggle getting through these enough to feel comfortable going into the test.  

**REG:** 

***In one sentence:*** Get it done before it’s updated yet again for the new tax plan. 

Compile a running list of all deductions/exemptions/nontaxable items. Also make sure you distinguish individual and business tax rules/amounts. Those can get really messy if you aren’t paying attention. If you are good at navigating the tax code utilize that during the sims. 

Really not sure if you can do this in less than 2 weeks. I felt the worst prepared for this test. If I had 3 weeks I would have been more comfortable. 

**BEC:**

***In one sentence:*** The “easiest”. 

Yes, it’s the “easiest” but do not let that change your studying effort. Studying for BEC after FAR and REG seemed like a breeze. That being said, some topics (variances) certainly take time to hammer down, but once you figure it out it should be smooth sailing. *DO NOT* stress on the writing portion. They don’t check for correctness, they check for logical thought process through organized writing and look for certain buzzwords. You could even go so far as copying and pasting the prompt into your response. You can have a very wrong answer, but as long as it is grammatically correct and has no spelling errors you should be fine.  

**AUD:**

***In one sentence:*** Exam with the most memorizing. 

The test where usually more than one answer is correct. The major thing here is you just need to get used to catching the single word that makes an answer right or wrong. I thought this had the most memorizing involved. If I could go back I would have taken module A4 more seriously. I had previous audit experience from my summer internship, so that helped a lot with understanding internal controls. 

Hope you found this helpful. I enjoyed reflecting on this insane journey as I drafted this post. Please know I will ignore any questions specific to what I saw on my exams. Otherwise I am happy to help any way I can.  "

So after successfully completing my last large loan I realized how less stressful it was when I knew when and where the money was going instead of having to wait on my school to inevitably pay me late. So I want to take out a loan before they put me in a bind and that way I can stretch the payments and pay a little higher interest than normal.

So what I'm looking to do is take out the 2k now and then make monthly payments from now until July (I expect to have the financial aid based on previous years by mid june but if they are slow and it slips into early July I will make an additional monthly payment beforehand in July )

a5qk2i,2,2018-12-13,I often feel trapped,Pretty_Throwaway1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/a5qk2i/i_often_feel_trapped/,"Hello. I've always been an anxious &amp; depressed person, according to my parents I was grinding my teeth even when I was a toddler. My parents are divorced, do not like each other that much but other than that I had a pretty lucky lifestyle. I lived through depression almost my whole teenage years. I've always had friends, i was decent at school and a pretty good basketball player. To the outside world I was probably seen well-adjusted &amp; pleasant. 

University was ok but pretty uneventful. I got decent grades, i always had friends. I did a semester abroad as an exchange student, although i was often anxious adopting to a new environment, knowing I was gonna return home and making new &amp; excellent friends helped me through.

I decided that I was gonna move away from my home country (Turkey). Although it is not really dangerous, the situation is not getting any better (fuck Erdogan) and I would have to serve in the military. I chose Canada because they speak English and I thought it would be a good fit. At this point I started having anxiety attacks, (tho I am not sure since it was a self-diagnoses), felt dizzy, felt like throwing-up, short of breath, sweaty. I actually had the first on the plane to Canada, in which I threw up (don't have a fear of flying, had many flights before). I still have them from time to time.

I arrived august a year ago and studied in a college. The year went horrible, I lost 3 of my grandparents in like 6 months (I was close to them), the program seemed like a waste of money, I was missing my family (especially my mom with whom I am extremely close with and often dependent on), my home and my dog. I had a part-time job which I hated, I had an extremely busy schedule with internship and classes. Often made me even more anxious. But the year ended and I got my diploma for a graduate certificate (1 year program)

That brings us to now, I applied for my work permit. I got a job (starting in January). But I feel trapped. I want to go back to my home country, which would be a decision every single member of my family &amp; friends would find idiotic (even I know it is not smart, I do not think I would be happy in my county anyways), but my family made serious investment because I wanted to come here.  

I severely miss my family and my home, I have not seen them over a year now which has been very difficult. I again made friends here, who are very helpful, loyal, just great in general but they are not the same. I feel extremely anxious about my new job, in which, the commute is especially horrible. (but i need the money). I am just sick of being uncomfortable, anxious and feeling like I could throw up in any second. 

I do not know what to do. I am not sure why I created this throw-away or what I am looking for in responses. Just felt like I needed to tell somebody, thank you for reading. "

I know its really early to be looking for summer housing but SF is packed with interns over the summer so I know housing is going to be more scarce during that time. I want to lock down a place soon!

I’ve been dealing with a lot of problems for a long time now and sorry if I overshare to much information, I just have to get this off my chest and reddit is the only thing I have at the moment. I was born with a nervous system disorder that causes me to always shake and has been getting worse every year that goes by. It has has always been a thorn in my life because whenever I try to do something I lose control of my body. My father abandoned me at a young age which had a large impact on my life and my mother lets just say isn’t a very good role model. I was bullied through out my whole school life by classmates and teachers because of my irrational behavior and inability to concentrate. When I went to first grade I was told by my teacher that I should kill myself and was raped when I started the 2nd grade which I never told anyone about because I really had no one to turn too. 

I began hearing audio hallucinations near the end of middle school and at high school I started seeing visual hallucinations. I never told anyone about this (the hallucinations) until I dropped out of college which was due to the voices becoming constant screaming and the things I saw were terrifying. This made me fail most of my classes and barely pass some no matter how hard I tried. I did off the book jobs in high school and when in college did paid internships. Though I could never keep it for long because of my condition. I try the best I can to fit in and be normal, but I’m always told that I’m weird or harassed by others. I can’t tell you how many times when taking public transportation I been threatened by people because I couldn’t stop talking to myself. Always hearing people talking about me saying I have no friends or they look at me with disdain. It’s hard waking up to this everyday and putting a fake smile to tell people I’m ok. No one really expected much from me except a few members of my family and to be honest I never really had any ambition, goals or hope for the future. I endured this to take care of my mother and watch over my cousins, but my mind seems to be giving up on me now.  Plus I can’t even take care of myself because I can’t find work. I take multiple types of medication like Clonazepam, Sertraline and Aripiprazole to combat this, but all it really does is put me to sleep or give me headaches which isn’t productive. 

Life continues to go forward and I’m left behind unsure what to do. Life is hard everyone knows that and the world owes me nothing. I tried my best to make something of myself and was always inspired by Rocky saying 
“you, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. but it ain't about how hard you hit. it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much. you can take and keep moving forward that's how winning is done now”. 
It’s hard to talk about this sometimes because I don’t know the right words because I’m bad at articulating myself, but I just feel like there’s people in the world in worse conditions than me and everyone has their own problems, but here I am crying about my life. 

The only thing I see I can do now is to apply for SSI which I’m not really knowledgeable about. First thing I did was see a physiatrist about my hallucinations and went to a neurologist to get an MRI and EGG. Though it has been difficult financially. I’m currently under my mothers health care plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield and trying to find out how much this will cost. I had to pay off a lot of medical bills before this because when on my way to college I would collapse on the street a lot. My life is a mess and even if I qualify for SSI is it even enough to survive in New York? I really just want assisted Suicide to end this madness, but they don’t allow it here and even if I could I doubt I could afford it. My biggest fear is being thrown into a psychiatric ward. The pain is unbearable and I’m tired. It’s hard to think and actually plan out what I’m supposed to do. Does anyone have any advice or is knowledgeable about SSI to know what I should do. Thank you for taking the time to read this."

CHAPTER ONE

Nothing to see here.

Just an Elder god and a kid...

\~\~\~

Her innocent eyes stared at him, there was no fear there. 

Just, curiosity. 

Had she known what he truly was, she wouldn't just fear him... 

she would destroy him. 

He knew this, and thought to himself, *That is what this creature's job was on this realm of existence, is it not?* Her looked at her, *You have -one- job. Maybe two.* He chuckled, *Maybe if she was a little older...say, an epoch or so.* 

""Water please!"", she cooed. 

He slid his a long, grey and bony finger down the bridge of her nose, down to its end, and booped it. ""As you wish, M'lady."" This, of course, caused her to giggle while he got the glass. 

""You're thinking of death."", she said, quite proud of herself. 

""My, my... you are astute aren't you. Yes. Yes, I am thinking of death."" He took a moment to study the cup.

""Do you fear it?""

He raised a brow, 

""Is it an, it? Well. That is news."" He stooped to hand her the requested water, then returned to his chair. 

Slowly his body inched down, creaking and cracking, stirring up dust from his clothes. ""Can you not see for yourself if I am afraid? You're doing so well in seeing everything else.""

She crinkled her brow, looked hard... nothing. She sensed... nothing. *Closer*, she thought, climbing into his lap, leaning until her lashes nearly touched his eyes. She focused forward, slowing her breathing like he taught her. The world started to drown out around a black buzzing noise...  *There!* For a moment there was... a flicker... something. Something was there in the dark. Way at the back of his eyes. Hidden from her. But why? *He doesn't hide things from me. Never! What is this?*

 She ran her fingers up his cheeks and grasped his ancient temple, staring until her head hurt. Finally, she collapsed in a huff.

""No. I can't see anything about death in you. So do you fear it or not?""

He chuckled softly, ""You've grown impatient, little one.""

""Are you gonna answer me?""

""Do I fear death?"" His head went back, looking into a distant corner that wasn't there. There was a long sigh. ""Well... how do I say this? We all do, child. Even if it's in some primal way."" He suddenly locked his gaze on her, ""There is nothing wrong with being afraid."" 

He emphasized this with a finger and talked in a tone she knew all too well. *Teacher talk*, she noted. 

""However; at my age you don't so much fear death, but what death takes away when it refuses to come for you.""

""I can't tell... Has it taken a lot from you?""

""Oh yes. It has taken quite a lot from me.""

""It makes you angry.""

""Yes. Yes, it does indeed.""

""Have you ever tried to stop it?""

He looked down at her. 

It was a simple glance but whatever had stirred in the darkness behind his eyes before, leapt forth. The fury of it jolted her back, sending her scurrying away with a scared puppy face pointed to the floor.

 ""I'm sorry. I...""

""No."" He leaned forward and pulled her chin up. ""It is I who must apologize. I forget how sensitive you are.""

*She is quite astute. It will not be too much longer now.*

""Come child. Finish your drink."" He handed her the cup as she made her way back onto his lap. With the exception of a few of her sniffles, they sat in silence.  Pure. Comfortable, silence. He placed the cup on the floor when she finished. Then again, the comfort of silence. 

He enjoyed these moments, the very act of enjoying anything being such a rare commodity. After a time, he noticed that she was making little circles on his knee.

""Something is on your mind.""

""It's just...""

""Go on.""

""I just have a question. Is that, OK?""

""Certainly. What would you like to know?""

She sat up, looking into his eyes again, ""Is death afraid of you?"" 

He stared at her blankly, letting an uncomfortable amount of time pass before bellowing in a long and echoing laugh.

""Oh, oh my. Thank you for that."" It had been millennia since he laughed like this.

""Well?""

""Well, my child, the answer to that, is...

Chapter 2

""You're looking at now, sir. Everything that happens now, is happening now.""

\*Col. Sandurz to Lord Dark Helmet

\~\~\~

Way, way past the county limits of your universe, in the seemingly endless void of space and throughout the infinite possibilities of the omniverse that have been tossed into the dustbin of large ideas and mathematics; you will find, located in an unwanted timeline, a fairly average star. This star has, in its planetary collection, an insignificant speck of mud infested with a rather dull assortment of life forms. The most remarkable thing about the speck of mud; which, in and of itself is very unremarkable, is its curiously perfect spherical shape. 

Located on the surface of the perfectly shaped mud ball, is a vast array of drinking establishments: Saloons, speakeasies, bars, lounges, taverns, roadhouses, taprooms, ale houses, watering holes, gin mills, drinkeries, and, of course Addy's Pub. This pub has a 'nice' selection of craft beers and a farm-to-table taco truck. The main denizens who frequent this establishment are the folks who just, very recently in the grand scheme of things, ""moved to the area"". An area that just so happens to be in a state of late gentrification. They are all complaining that's it's 'just not as fun as it used to be.' That it doesn't have the same 'pizzazz' anymore. 

This was, in fact, true. 

Part of this is because the Pub Owner, (whose name was not Addy) had long brought daily, high-energy entertainment to his establishment. Entertainment that had been noticeably absent since the business was sold for a tidy sum to a chain corporation who happened to enjoy the pub so much, they immediately changed the look and feel of the place. The ink had barely dried on the transaction before the Pub Owner moved to a nice, tropical island with his Girlfriend. A Girlfriend who was gifting him a rather superior blowjob at this precise moment.

The other part of the equation was that the mere act of these patrons moving to the area forced the lesser dregs, drunks, dope fiends, freaks, and artists who used to frequent the joint (thereby breathing life and charm into its atmosphere) to move to a different city. Somewhere cheaper. Like a nice college town where they found fiscal possibilities, farm-to-table taco truck options, and rents were all considerably less. 

The only remarkable thing about this now otherwise wholly unremarkable and spiritless pub, was a curious fellow by the name of Mike Anders. At this moment, Mike found himself afflicted with a rather odd sensation of being extraordinarily curious. He didn't know what he was curious about, but he knew it had nothing to do with this wonderful midnight blueberry and jalapeño saison in his glass or the taco slathered in cilantro before him. Mike enjoyed those items while he pondered on this surprising, but ultimately vexing curiosity.

\~\~\~

Chapter 3

The Clock.

\~\~\~

*Time.* 

*It keeps the world moving with a never ending, steady tick.*

*Sometimes a bird jumps out at you or wooden men chase wooden women,* 

*but- for the most part- there is always that steady-* 

*Tick. Tock...*

\~\~\~

Chapter 4

""When will then be now?

\* Lord Dark Helmet to Col. Sandurz 

\~\~\~

Way, way, way out on the other side of the county limits of your universe (in a completely different void filled with infinite possibilities of an omniverse that had been tossed into an off-color blue dustbin of large magic and steam technologies) you will find, located in an unseemly and unwashed timeline, a fairly complex star. This star has, in its planetary collection, a magnificent set of uninhabitable planets. Planets that the surrounding stars were quite jealous of. In fact, that chump Vlaziut-3 of the Perameles Constellation desperately wanted the seventh planet in the system, a gas giant by the name of Zute. 

Good luck with that, chump.

 There was one planet in the collection that was inhabited and simply a keeper. It was so damn entertaining! This rather oddly shaped mudball is infested with a colorful assortment of life. The most remarkable thing about this lumpy speck of mud, was the large ring it had developed from two former moons. It seems that the residents of those moons had decided to go to war over a trade deal with some visiting aliens. One thing led to another and... BOOM! 

It was quite the show. 

This particular mudball had many of the same trappings as Mr. Anders' mudball, including its own vast array of drinking establishments: Drop-ins, wineries, whorehouses, barrel rooms, boozer halls, hostelries, canteens, sud dives, grog parlors, and, of course, The Dead Horse Inn. 

There was nothing 'nice' about the Dead Horse Inn.  Nor, in fact, was this place actually an Inn. This was because of the complete lack of the usual things associated with the word ""Inn"". 

Like rooms. And beds.

 The selection of drinks available ranged from dirty water with a generous helping of a combination of piss and spit, to rum and grog. No one was quite sure what grog was, as it varied from establishment to establishment; but at the Dead Horse, it was usually the strongest thing available that wouldn't kill you. 

The main denizens who frequent this establishment are the folks who have nowhere else to go, are looking for a fight, or are about on some other seedy business. Sometimes it's all three things at once. 

Recently, the regulars have been complaining that's it's 'just not as fun' as it used to be here. That it doesn't have the same 'debauchery' anymore. 

This was, in fact, true. If only temporary. 

The main reason for this was a group of Qalupalik who had taken up residence on at the docks on the island of Wade where the Dead Horse was located. 

The Qalupalik, usually referred to as Seahags or Goddamn Seahags, are a vampiric, shadow- dwelling, merfolk ancestor offshoot of your modern mermaid. This means they mainly look like a walking fish with opposable thumbs and suckers for mouths. The female of the species is more adept on land, thus are hunters for the roaming pods whose most annoying habit to is to grab anyone they can and cocoon them in their lair. Once cocooned, they feed off your humiliation or, according to some who have actually studied them, low level life force. For the majority of folks, this is just an inconvenience as they let you go after a week or so; however, there is the occasional pod that craves flesh. More often than not, in such cases, the flesh of children. The pod in Wade just so happened to be one of these, and the whole town was mandated to stay indoors at night. 

The other reason the Dead Horse was so slow is the fact that it is the favorite drinking spot of a certain Air Fleet Captain. The same Captain who was sitting at the back table with his crew, now. Having him there was like having a deranged skunk run about the room- it's just bad for business. All the Bartender could think was, *What can you do, eh*?

 The Grand Mayor of Wade had, some time earlier, contacted the Fleet to send someone in to help deal with the Qalupalik. Lucky for him, there was a ship right nearby. Unlucky for him, it was Ship 23, the oldest and worst of the fleet whose Captain had an odd liking for that shithole known as the Dead Horse. The Mayor sent an Intern around to give the Barkeep a sack of coin to deal with the lot so as to spare the rest of the town. *What can you do, eh?*  

Now, the second most remarkable thing about the Dead Horse, right behind the structure's ability to still be standing, was a curious fellow positioned just outside its doors by the name of Obadiah Axelrod. At this moment, Obadiah found himself afflicted with a rather odd sensation of being extraordinarily curious. Unlike Mike Anders, Obadiah had a range of things he could choose from to be curious about.  

There was his dereliction of duty at having come here and leaving the ship empty. He was curious if it would still be there when he got back. 

There was his curiosity as to why he was here, which was to deliver a message that was given to him for the Captain. 

There was the curiosity as to why the message was so vague. 

There was the curiosity of, despite the vagueness of the meaning behind this message, its undeniable intent.

There was the curiosity of how the crew would react once this intent was relayed along with a curiosity of how many drinks the crew had had, and if they were armed. 

 There was the curiosity about the messenger, which was from a strange entity called an Igigi, and why this entity was now taking up residence in his beard. 

And lastly, for Obadiah at this moment, there was the surprised curiosity about the dead man laying by the front door of the Dead Horse Inn. 

Obadiah wasn't a picky man, so he decided to just be overall curious about everything in the moment.

Unbeknownst to both curious men was the sheer fact that at this very moment, due to the functions of reality, their curiosities were linked via an exact and vast intersection of the Omniversal Leyline. It was a 'once in multi-versal' event that shall never happen again. 

Compounding both Mike and Obadiah's states of mind during this most brief of moments, was that, while Mike could have sworn he had just seen a dead guy, Obadiah had the strangest taste of cilantro and shitty beer in his mouth.   

\~\~\~

Chapter 5

Stop me if you've heard this one.

A beard with an Igigi 

walks into a pub past a dead guy...

\~\~\~

Obadiah- a short, wiry red-haired creature that seemed to be more beard than man- stood outside the Dead Horse Inn, the aforementioned stiff and mighty beard slightly fluttering from winds drifting in from the sea. He was taking a moment to figure out how to tell the crew that their shore leave had just been cut short. He was also wondering to himself, W*hy, in all da watering holes in da Kingdom of Wade, da Captain decided ta always drink here.* *There weren't no working women here, cause there weren't no beds. The grog's mostly water an' roach piss. The whole of the place looked like it hadn't been repaired since the last hurricane. There's literally a dead body sitting by the door. You go one road up, and Fatty Dean's had women, cards, decent liquor, and less rats.*

The wind shifted slightly, carrying the Dead Horse's stench into his nose. This was accompanied by a foul taste that welled up in Obadiah's mouth causing him to spit. 

""Gods, that's horrible."" His eyes found the body again. *You know*, he thought to himself, *if you drop dead at Fatty's, they don just chuck ya out the door. No sir! They have the common courtesy ta see you all the way out ta the pit wagon.* *Them's are right proper folk to be spending your time with.* 

There was a small tug from the center of his beard, so Obadiah parted his mustache. leaned over a good bit, and stares towards his belly. 

There was the Igigi, waving up at him right from where he left it. It, well she, had decided that his beard was a right proper place to relax while he went to find the Captain. He wished she had waited to tell the Captain her message instead of him, seeing as for some damn reason most Igigi can only verbally talk to one person a day. But, he was the only one on the Ship at the time. *What can you do, eh? Guess I'm stuck with her for now. It's not such a bad thing.* He pondered for a moment. *If I had a choice about it and I was dat size, I'd live in mah beard. I'd be damn proud of it, too!* 

 Obadiah had only seen a few Igigi in his lifetime, and most of them had been at Fleet Headquarters. He knew the Brass liked to keep them on hand due their ability to travel nearly instantaneously anywhere once a day. *Good for sending messages if'n ya don't mind all the damned once a day rules, Biggest pain would be da wait on the bugger to come back.* 

Obadiah'd never seen one like this, though. Small. Blue skin, with blood red hair and big green eyes. *Pretty little thing.* Most the one's he'd seen were red, with orange hair, about twenty feet tall, and ugly as the day is long. '*Guess dey come in all shape and sizes. Nuttin' wrong wit dat. Maybe dey're shape shifters. Nuttin' wrong wit dat either.I know plenty of good shape shifters.'* 

The Igigi seemed irritated that they were just standing there, and gave another hard yank on Obadiah's beard. 

""You comfy down there?""

""Quite."", she chirped back. ""So we doing this, old man?""

""Yeah. Might as well git dis ova wit.""  

The Igigi scurried back into his beard as Obadiah strode confidently up the steps, taking time to carefully step over the dead body.  He then threw open the doors... 

Which immediately fell off its hinges, teetering back and forth as gravity decided where it should land. Obadiah could have sworn he saw two rat-faced buggers making a bet on which way it would fall. 

""Alright, drags! Time ta go!""

Obadiah took the scene in rather quickly, just in case there was trouble from the crew. There wasn't any because the crew wasn't there. His flashy entrance was lost to anyone else in the room, except the two rat-faced buggers. The door finally fell away from the wall with a giant 'THUD'.  ""Ha! Pay up, Ferret."", exclaimed the hairier of the rat-faced buggers. 

The Dead Horse was surprisingly empty for the time of day, just the rat-faced fellas, a few stragglers playing at dice, a Minstrel haphazardly plucking away on a lute three strings down, and a trio of regulars trying to scrounge a free drink from the Barkeep. As the strong aroma of urine and vomit invaded his nostrils, Obadiah thought, *And I thought it smelled bad on the outside.* 

Honestly though, he was disappointed that there wasn't some sort of shenanigans going on. He was, in fact, *itchin' for a swedgin*'. 

Finally he caught sight of the crew, all sitting at a long table in the back room. Before heading that way, he stopped by the bar.

""Hey, barkeep.""

""Wat?"" The Barkeep slammed a mug on the bar, exposing the tattooed dagger that ran the length of his forearm- the mark of the Anndale Pirates. 

*The black oath gang. Now what foul thing did you do to be landlocked in this part of the world?*

His mind drifted back to his younger years when he had the misfortune to be a prisoner of those particular Anndale bastards. Obadiah would never admit it, but he was in a state of shock at the mere sight of the tattoo. 

*There's just some things dat always stick with ya.*

""Halloo?"" Obadiah hadn't even noticed the Barkeep had walked over to him. ""Wat's with you? You on the poppy?""

""Ah neva touch dat foul stuffs.""

""Well then, wat do you want?""

""I want ta be knowin where ya got dat tattoo 'o yours.""

""Oh, you do now?""

""S'right.""

""My mum gave it to me."" 

""Yer mum, eh? Well, she wouldnae be a Black Oather Anndale, now is she?""

""And if she was? Wat's that to you?""

""Jist curious, s'all""

""Aye. Curious, eh?"" The Bartender pointed to a sign on the wall behind him. 

It read:

***It kills other things too.*** 

Now alone, that would have been a strange sign. However, hanging directly above the sign was a rather ferocious looking large cat creature with a nasty jagged long-dagger protruding from its chest. To drive home the point, someone had carved the word 'Curiosity' into the hilt.  

"" Now. We gonna have any trouble here?""

""Nope. We're not gonna 'ave any troubles. I was jist curious about dat tattoo. My captain is in da back 'ere, and, uh, ya kno dere's a dead guy out front, right?""

""Yeah. That's Timmy. He's supposed to be dead. All zombies are dead. What's it to you?""

""Oh, nuttin'."" 

""You got something against dead folk?""

""Not at all. I was jus makin' sure ya knew. Dat's all. Say, dat table back dere good ta go if'n we hafta leave ina hurry?""

""You expectin' trouble?""

""No.""

""You're with them, then?""

""I'll say it twice now, dat's mah crew.""

""Then mayor's said he'll grab the bill, seeing as you guys actually brought everyone home from that child stealin' Qalupalik.""

""Seahags are the worst."", piped up the rather Greasy Regular. 

""Outta gather them all up and dump 'em way out in the ocean."", quipped the Smelly Regular.

 ""No. They'd just find their way back and start stealing kids all over again if you do that."", sneered the Wrinkly One.

Obadiah beamed, ""Jus doin' our jobs, sirs. 'Ere, fer yer trouble and yer dear ole Ma. Tell her to rot in hell."" He placed a gold coin on the bar, left the regulars to their debate about the child stealing Qalupalik problem, and made his way back to the crew. 

The Igigi, poked her head out for a moment, ""We're gonna be late! Move it! Move it! Move it!"" 

""Imma movin, lass. See, we're here.""

Obadiah decided he would use a different tactic this go around, having lost the element of surprise.

""Heya everbody! Good ta see yas having a fine time 'n all... but I 'ave bad news. Shore leave's been axed. Time ta head back ta da ship! Come on, let's git! Let's go! Everybody up!"" Those last few bits were accompanied by the motherly clapping of Obadiah's heavily clad leather gloves. No one seemed to hear, lifting their mugs of grog and chattering away at whatever conversation was going on before this unheard interruption. 

He doubled his effort, ""Let's go! Time be a wastin'. There's things dat needs be doin' before we ship out! Ands we gots ta ship out!"" He stopped midway at the table to see if this had any effect. Nope. They just continued drinking. 

*I hate dis shite assignment.* 

Obidiah shuffled towards a plain jacketed man at the end of the table. ""Uhh, 'scuse me sir."" 

The Jacketed man was savoring a last drag on his roll before dejectedly tossing the spent end at one of the crew. ""I could’ve sworn I just lit this damn thing."" Obadiah notice the Jacketed man's body start twitching, already fiending for another roll. His hands absentmindedly obliged. 

The Jacketed man didn't look up from his, ""Why aren't you with the ship?"" 

""Right sir. It's jist dat... uhh. ya see. There's dis wee.. well... it's one 'o da..."" 

""What is it, Obadiah?""

""Message from da brass. High priority. Dey has sent us o' one dem Igigi."" The creature poked her head through the thick red beard, and gave what the Jacketed man thought was a thumbs up for confirmation. He had often wondered what was under all the matted hair. Obadiah produced tools and cigars from it all the time, so while it was a rare sight indeed to see a horizon spirit taking up residence there, he wasn't exactly surprised. *I wonder if there's a nest or a house?*

The idea took to battle in his imagination as he finished the roll and fired one end. The Jacketed man toked hard, holding it as long as possible before releasing a practiced cough. ""Alright, out with it little fella. What's so important that they sent you?""

The Igigi pointed up at Obadiah. ""'Polgies sir. Already gave me da message. You know how's dese tings are. Dey tell it once 'n..."" 

""Yes, yes. What did it say?""

""She, sir.""

""Sorry?""

""Dis Igigi. She is a she, sir.""

The Igigi beamed a large grin and gave an empathic thumbs up.  

""Oh. Well, forgive me there. What's your name?""

""Her name is Melvin, sir.""

""Melvin? Alright then. Sorry, Melvin. I'm guessing you're a  one day Igigi? Right?"" The little Igigi wrapped the beard's coarse red threads around her face and gave a thumbs up. ""I see. One it is. Well, out with it Obadiah. What did she say?"" 

""Just dat we are expected in da docks at Fae-Elleen as quickly as we can make it. Didn'a say whys.""  

There was that little blue thumbs up again. 

""Ya know, Capt... I believe it best we be on our way as orders say. Den again, 'tis your ship."" 

""Anxious to leave?""

""Well, I'm thinkin' we should skeedat on outta here before we wear out our welcome. The bartender is one 'o dem Black Oath lot.""

""Right.""

""Best ta leave on good terms once in a while, if ya are catchin' mah drift sir.""

""Agreed. Fae-Elleen. That's going to take a the better part of a week to get there from here.""

""Week 'n a half, by my thinkin' if ya wanna take it easy, sir."" Marvin, scowling, gave a hard yank. ""Hey! You behave yerself! We's supposed to be on break! I'm just saying we's don have to give it the full put-out once we's pull out of port here, dat's all. It's not like they's gonna be missin' our boat anyways."" 

""I wonder if they are gonna finally mothball the ship.""

""Dunno, Cap. It seems ta be more urgent than an retirement if'n ya ask me."" 

 Thumbs up. Little. Blue.

""But not so urgent as to haul ass?""

""Dat's mah tinkin', sir.""

A tiny, but angry thumbs down.

""Maybe they want to ground me. That's been way overdue. Especially after that business on Kalwi Island."" The Igigi shook it's head, and looked judgingly at the Captain. ""What do you know about it, huh, short stuff?"" He blew smoke at the Igigi, who retreated back into the beard. 

""Another reason to be a buncha drags, if'n ya ask me. Seems a might wasteful ta me to put ya on soil, Cap. And sir, if'n'ya don mind, dat whole island ting wasn't yer fault. You didnae' know dat was the chief's daughtah. Besides, it all worked out best in da end."" 

""Says you. She had to marry a Umibozu. Fine. I'm guessing we've wrapped business here?""

"" Qalupalik problem is handled for da time bein'. Doc's sent word 'fore I left dat day be gettin' deir gear on board. Barkeep says everything's on da house, courtesy 'o da mayor, seein as what we rescued all dem kids. So yea. Job well done 'n I tink we's finished here, likes.""  

""Alright. Thank you, Obadiah."" The Igigi, who had somehow gotten a piece of cheese, looked a little mad. ""Thank you too, Melvin, for bringing me the message."" The Igigi beamed a wide smile. ""Prep up ship and let's hoist anchor!"" The Captain's voice broke through the table's various conversations, causing them all to snap to attention. 

""Ya heard da Captain ya bilge rats! Move! Did none o' ya hear wha' he said? I'll have ya cleanin da Doc's back room if'n ya don scurry on outta 'ere!"" 

Without hesitation or complaint, the crew moved like clockwork at Obadiah's words now, finishing their drinks and boisterously filing out of the pub.

""Week and a half, you say?""

""Aye. If we are a buncha' drags.""

""Let's make it two. Chart a course on the Rak-O'az run."" 

The Igigi rolled her eyes, and disappeared back into the red thicket with her cheese... and was that a thimble of beer?

""Aye, aye! I'll see ya on da ship, Capt."" 

With a salute, Obadiah left him to his roll. The Captain savored a last drag... ""I could’ve sworn I just lit this damn thing."" He tossed the butt over his shoulder and started packing another paper. Across the room he watched as someone stumble in through the doorless frame. The Captain finished the roll, fired one end, and toked it hard as the person moaned loudly. Suddenly, every glass in the room jutted into the air with a chorus of, ""Timmy!""  

At that precise moment, the supports of the ancient hanging candelabra of the Dead Horse Inn gave way, sending it crashing down onto Timmy who went right through the floor boards. 

The Captain released a puff of smoke with a practiced cough. 

""Gods, I love this place.""

Chapter 7

The Chronicler's tale.

Data entry: 

Facts on the Realm of Kathmere. 

\~\~\~

Deep within the blighted realm of Kathmere, at Castle Terrgoria, lives Grand Sorcerer Queen Delmorda. Known for her many \*ahem\* attributes, if you were to travel to the surrounding villages and kingdoms to ask those who dwelt there to describe their fair Queen, you would invariably find what one may call- a pattern. One such Chronicler, an unfortunate character whose name was outlived by his works, had once done just precisely that. When he released his works to the public, it came as no surprise to those in and around Kathmere (who could read, that is) that the following collected words were the ten most commonly associated with the Queen in conversation: 

Barbarous. Brutal. Cold-blooded. Cruel. Cancerous. Inhuman. Malevolent. Merciless. Sadistic. And, Vicious.

One of the more interesting things you shall find, should you visit, is that you would be hard pressed to find any resident anywhere in Kathmere to own up to the fact that such words were ever uttered from their mouths. Much less, ever existed in the first place. This handy amnesia might have to do with the 'release party' thrown by the Chronicler at a Pub on the outskirts of Castle Terrgoria. During the night's revelry, one Poor Drunken Bastard vehemently requested that his entry of ""Right Cunt"" be marked down and added to the list for posterity. This was right before the poor fellow found his head separated from his torso by a Castle Guard, who also happened to be at the party because the Queen wanted to know, ""What all the hubbub was all about. Bub."" 

Shortly thereafter, in a now infamous event dubbed ""The Chronicler's Bloodbath"", nearly four hundred towns folk were slain- one person for each word in the offending chapter. The effects of this being the aforementioned handy amnesia of not only any words on the list, but most words in the book as well. 

This, of course, has yet another side effect of making communication for those living in Kathmere a little more than difficult. 

Yet another side- side effect is, that Kathmorians who travel outside the kingdom are known to be extremely talkative, usually about their hatred for their homeland. To most Non-Kathmorians, this becomes tedious after exactly two minutes. One way to defend against a Kathmorian party conversation is to gather any visiting Kathmorians by any fresh, delicious fruit snacks that includes berries and let them talk amongst themselves. It's even been known that some people invite Kathmorians to their parties to place bets on which last longer- the conversation or the fruit. 

The longest Kathmorian party conversation took place over thirty days; during which, thirteen Kathmorians died. The Mople fruit also went extinct during the conversation due to being the party's ""berry of choice"" as well as the fact that both Coordinators of the event were unwilling to lose a bet, so they 'kept the fruit coming'.

One upshot to all this is that, although the unfortunate Chronicler's name was stricken from history and his flayed corpse left to dangle on the castle walls, his work (in its entirety with some added bits plus the Poor Drunk Bastard's suggestion) can be found at the many rest stops and village inns that dot the borders of Kathmere. This is so those traveling into the realm will have a precise guide of what ""to do"", and ""not to do"" during what will most likely be a brief stay. Many a traveler has noted that this is the most read book in all of Kathmere; partly due to its availability and partly due to the fact that there not many other books in Kathmere. 

Lost to most who skim through what visitor's call ""The Book of Horrors"" is in an incorrect footnote listed on page 23. It states that the two most common positive things that residents of Kathmere had to say about their Queen are: 

She is sexually deviant and ravenously horny. 

The error being that the Chronicler probably thought these were compliments due to his own sexual depravity issues. 

However, nearly every being that has entered the Queen's bedchamber found it quite the opposite of what one might call ""a good time"". This is probably due to the high mortality rate among the Queen's sexual partners. 

Two items the Chronicler did get right in the positivity footnote was, that the Queen was ""quite the looker"" and ""kept those goddamn Lamassu out of the goddamn Kingdom."" The latter of which, seems to be more popular along the border. 

 In a final observation, the ultimate down shot of the unfortunate Chronicler's conflagration is that no one chronicles in Kathmere anymore. 

Which is a shame really. 

They have all the best beer, food, and parties.

*A shift of a grain here, a mountain there. Small things no one bothered to notice, like a* *perfect sphere of planet slowly plotting its course in a cosmic dance. Like an undead man, basking in a late afternoon heat being stared at by a man who has an Igigi in his beard.*

a5r08b,1,2018-12-13,AnswerMeNow1 speaks to Pasifika activists,AnswerMeNow1,MNZByElection,https://www.reddit.com/r/MNZByElection/comments/a5r08b/answermenow1_speaks_to_pasifika_activists/,"Kia ora, tenā koutou katoa, talofa lava, malo e lelei, bula vinaka.

I’m going to be frank. Te Tawharau is the only party running in this election that has a coherent vision, plan and track record for Pasifika, let alone the only ones talking about it. It was the influence of me in the coalition negotiations that allowed the introduction of a bill on climate change refugees in the Pacific to be government policy, and the influence of Te Tawharau to hold the government to account and ensure that it is done. We at Te Tawharau embrace the bonds that tie us with our Pasifika whānau. After all, he kākano i ruia mai i Rangiātea- we are all seeds sown in the ancient home of Rangiātea.

And so, what else does Te Tawharau have planned for our Pasifika whanāu? We’ll invest in TaTapu- a social and economic organisation for transformational change led by Pasifika churches and communities, alongside building a Pacific Cultural Cetre in Auckland as an employment and economic development centre. We’ll establish scholarships and internships for Pasifika youth, and increase the number of government-fundedweight reduction surgeries up to 1,000 a year to help tackle obesity and prevent too many Pasifika deaths.

And who are the alternatives? More of the same from National? Neglect from New Zealand First? Bigotry from Labour?

Pasifika can do better. That’s why this election, if you want someone standing up for you, who has a coherent plan for you, who’ll hold the government to account to deliver on its promises, this election, vote supersteef2000! Vote Te Tawharau!

Thank you!"

My best friend's wedding is approaching and unfortunately my original travel plans with a mutual friend fell through as unfortunately he got a promotion and can't get time off for the wedding. I am aware that people may be weary with another large loan currently open but that is why I want to set the payments up consecutively that way I can ensure both are paid back in full in a timely manner
Payment dates
July 3rd $150
August 3rd $150
Septmber 3rd  $100
October 3rd $100
October 15th $2000

Additionally I'm in a paid internship and potentially could take that 2k payment and do a midway point $1k and then the final $1k on that final date

a5rjgj,2,2018-12-13,F4A - White Wannabe Cuckquean,dppsexygirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a5rjgj/f4a_white_wannabe_cuckquean/," Title basically covers it, haha.

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

We had gone through a lot together, I came from a messed up situation and she grew to be the only person who knew literally everything about me.

We moved into with each other when we were 16. We were the first for each other. We dated for 5 years and engaged for 6 months. Both in the same college her for nursing, me in another public service field.

Last term of college she was hanging out and studying with a second year guy. It didn’t bother me much I was pretty confident in myself and our relationship. Eventually she’d come home really late. I was doing an internship out of town.

One day I came home at 10pm she wasn’t home, called her, told me she was at the library studying with the guy. I knew the library was long closed. She eventually came home and I confronted her about it. I told her she needed to tell me that night if she wanted to be with me or not. She told me to get out.

Slept in my car that night, ended up staying with my brother for a couple months. Dropped out of my last class to graduate.

Buried myself in my work keeping my mind off of the situation and trying to better myself.

Since then became very depressed and socially anxious, I haven’t tried dating or talking to another woman. When I turned 21 had a pretty bad drinking problem. She ended up marrying the other guy in the wedding dress she’d gotten for our wedding. All in the span of a year.

I lost all confidence in myself and I’m just lost. Her mother seen me at a gas station and caught me up on everything. I just, froze.


I don’t know how to get pass this and how to move on. It’s been a while since the break up but I find myself questioning everything. Very little confidence in myself and my abilities. Before the thing happened I was a confident and capable person. Now I struggle and have developed an unhealthy view on life in general, mostly pessimistic. Every picture I had, had her in it so it’s like the last few years never happened.

I’m trying dating websites but find I’m not exactly the greatest catch admittedly but have been working on characteristics that help.

I guess I’m also missing a place to vent. I know this is ramblings and all over the place. Thank you Redditors for listening to this incoherent mess."

*Fragment #72- Why You Don’t Hire Gremlins*

Santa Claus once employed gremlins, but had to fire them after an accident. The workshop was the scene of a feeding frenzy. Hundreds of elves were devoured before GC finally arrived and purged the entire facility. The event further fueled Mrs. Claus’ descent into merry insanity.

*Fragment #73- Christmas Flee*

Christmas trees are often cultivated from government-owned land preserves, where they’re modified. Orbulog is injected into their roots as to make them more appealing. While relatively harmless, it should be noted that Orbulog will attract homeless angecites. Which attack kids.

*Fragment #74- Fear The White Lass* 

The infamous “White Lass of Ms. Pedeteria’s School for Wayward Children” is always spotted around winter time. She attends the annual Christmas Party held by the students, luring hapless lads underneath mistletoe to kiss. But those who feel her lips disappear. With a giggle.

After being displaced by the invading hungru, who quickly advanced on Gingeria, gingerbread men and women were forced to live in temporary housing complexes crafted by the world-renowned lebensmitth, Andro Fillipiski. FW2 lasted for seventy years.

*Fragment #75- An Escape At The Tower of Tesa*

Many people might be interested to learn how Saint Priscipus the Reclusive had managed to lock-pick his chains after being imprisoned in the Tower of Tesa. Four words. Long, long, long fingernails.

*Fragment #76- Diss Destruction*

Saint Disias the Destroyer is a controversial footnote in the annals of magical history. He was regarded as “incorrigible” and “offensi” by the elders and a “blasphemous heathen” by his subjects. His poisonous tongue dished out insults even when he slept. And after he had died.

*Fragment #77- Last Day of November*

On the last day of November, northern elves are allowed to take off their corrective-behavior collars and descend upon cages containing turkeys. This is revenge for Turk’ul cursing them with shortness. And because Santa doesn’t feed them until next spring.

*Fragment #78- Hell Hand*

The creation of the automated pentagomic tracer (or the APT) was facilitated by increasing accidental summonings linked to misdefined symbols and pictographs. It features a reanimated demon’s hand that grips a pencil carved from deadwood. It is 100% accurate.

*Fragment #83- A Cookie Conspiracy*

Uneducated mini-fooumen claim that Christmas cookies are actually UFFs scouting before an eminent invasion. Of course, UFFs don’t actually exist. They’re just a clever little ploy used by the Kitchegomian Republic to induce anti-cookie sentiment among the general population.

*Fragment #84- A Hair-Braiding Christmas Tradition*

Not all Christmas traditions are meant for everybody. Hijias of European decent are known to braid their lengthy hair into haireathes, which they hang on their front doors. This wards off evil scalpellets and other malevolent spirits.

*Historical Context- Paranoid About The Holidays*

Christmas joy was extremely rare during the early 1920s, which helped escalate the rapid militarization of the United Kingdom. The ruling class viewed such disinterest as a threat to its hold over commonfolk. To prevent them from rebelling, the SSM began hunting for an angel.

In 1953, a high-ranking angel general named Juniper Weskins proposed a treaty between God and the Dark. Seven drafts were written before both parties agreed to sign the finished form. During this time, however, anti-human sentiment was high among angels. They refused to honor it.

*Fragment #85- Angels Are Jerks*

Angels have always viewed humanity as being inferior to God’s other creations. They will willingly ignore certain prayers that ask for salvation and divine mercy, which leaves millions in perpetual suffering. The signing of the 1953 Angel-Demon Treaty was a sin in their eyes.

*Fragment #86- Crimes Against Holidays*

If someone eats Santa’s cookies, that person can be charged with holidial misconduct. Conviction could mean facing a ~37,000 fine and/or up to a century in Underground Prison. 

But this is for their own protection. 

Idols are known to curse.

*Fragment #87- What Does A Witch Use As A Christmas Tree*

Witches can celebrate Christmas. They just can’t put up a Christmas tree, which has its roots in Jesus’ crucifixion. Demons give them the dried bones of slain giants that had fought on Goliath’s side. Then, they can hang whatever they want.

*Historical Context- Blitzed Kids*

Reindeer helped evacuate children during the Blitz. While many of them were shot down by artillery fire, the majority fell victim to the smoke collecting over war-torn Britain. Rudolf the Pure-Nosed Reindeer couldn’t join them."

Great! Send me a picture and your kinks and I’ll handle the rest!

[One](https://i.imgur.com/QV67fop.mp4)
“Oh the same old boring thing, flowers” Your wife complained after you asked her if her class had bought her anything fun as they graduated and she wouldn’t teach them for two months over summer break.

In reality however the boys in her class had chipped in and bought her the most *pathetically whorish* lingerie set she owned, way more slutty and sexy than that pair of thongs you once bought her. She took her time and sent out a thank you snap to each and every boy while she wore it.

[Two](https://i.imgur.com/LM8UpuZ.jpg)

When you stepped into the bedroom with the fresh bouquet of flowers in your hand, your heart shattered. You were greeted by your wife literally gagging on a thick, meaty boycock atleast thrice the size of your own. And you could tell beyond any doubt that your wife was in LOVE with the thick meatpole she was making love too. What hurt even more was that she didn’t stop, not even for a second, even after seeing you. “Ms..” the boy panicked.

Your wife hushed him with a finger to his lips and just continued to gag on his fat cock, her ass in the air and her married pussy dripping on your bed.

[Three](https://i.imgur.com/MDvKyZF.jpg)

After that time you caught your wife fucking one of the intern boys at your job and you were to pathetic to stop her, even getting hard. She knew she had you around her finger. She invited him over to your house and you all sat down. 
“So, this is Kyle, and Kyle is moving in with us and he will sleep with me in our bed, you can take the couch or the floor...doesn’t make a difference to me.” She said, when you asked why with a tear in your eye she simply pulled up her phone and showed you the humongous cock on her phone and smiled “that’s why”

[Four](https://i.imgur.com/ADHgwuV.jpg)

Your wife found out that the boy she was babysitter for had gotten broken up with by his girlfriend and she saw it as the perfect opportunity. After the parents had left she told him to go shower. As he got clean she put on the lingerie you bought her and sat herself down on the couch with a balloon, it was valentines day after all. (It did hurt you a lot that she didn’t want to spend it with you, huh?) 

When he came out in nothing but a towel she called for him. “Timmy, I heard your girlfriend broke up with you, and that sucks. But to be fair that’s just how girls your age are, unpredictable. What you should go for instead are older girls, like me!”

en Werkgelegenheid en van Economische Zaken en Klimaat over de manier  
waarop pensioenfondsen de CO2-voetafdruk van hun beleggingsportefeuille  
berekenen en hierover intern en extern rapporteren  
&amp;#40;ingezonden 2 november 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
Bent u op de hoogte van de verschillende ‘scopes’ van CO2-emissie als  
gedefinieerd door het Greenhouse Gas Protocol, aan de hand waarvan de CO2-  
voetafdruk van een bedrijf berekend kan worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Klopt het dat het grootste pensioenfonds van Nederland, het Algemeen  
Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds &amp;#40;ABP&amp;#41;, bij het berekenen van de CO2-voetafdruk van  
een bedrijf alleen de zogeheten scope-1 en scope-2-emissies meerekent, en  
de scope-3-emissie buiten beschouwing laat?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Bent u op de hoogte van meer Nederlandse pensioenfondsen die op deze manier  
de CO2-voetafdruk van bedrijven berekenen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
Nee, dat is mij niet bekend. Er is geen wettelijke standaard voor de  
rapportage over de CO2-voetafdruk van beleggingen. Ik heb met genoegen  
kennisgenomen van het initiatief van een aantal vermogensbeheerders en  
pensioenfondsen, dat zich heeft verenigd in het “Platform Carbon Accounting  
Financials”. Daartoe behoren o.a. pensioenfondsen PME en PMT en  
vermogensbeheerders APG, Mn en PGGM. Deze instellingen hebben vrijwillig  
afgesproken volgens dezelfde standaard te rapporteren over de CO2-  
voetafdruk van hun beleggingen. Ik juich dit initiatief toe.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Bent u ervan op de hoogte dat het niet meerekenen van scope-3-emissie  
gebruikt kan worden om ervoor te zorgen dat bijvoorbeeld producenten van  
fossiele brandstoffen een relatief bescheiden CO2-voetafdruk krijgen, omdat  
CO2-emissie ten gevolge van de verkregen en verwerkte fossiele brandstoffen  
niet wordt meegewogen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
Ja, het klopt dat dit inderdaad dat gevolg kan hebben, bewust of onbewust.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Bent u het ermee eens dat het niet meerekenen van deze scope-3- emissie kan  
zorgen voor een vertekend beeld van de daadwerkelijke bijdrage aan CO2-  
emissies van een bedrijf?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
Nee, de emissies van een bedrijf zelf geven zonder scope 3-emissies geen  
vertekend beeld. Als het gaat om de emissies in de hele keten waar het  
bedrijf een schakel van uitmaakt is het wel nodig scope 3 emissies mee te  
nemen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Bent u het ermee eens dat het niet meerekenen van deze scope-3-emissie  
zodoende kan zorgen voor een vertekend beeld van de daadwerkelijke bijdrage  
aan CO2-emissies van de beleggingsportefeuille van een pensioenfonds?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
Bent u het ermee eens dat het onwenselijk is dat organisaties door het  
uitsluiten van de belangrijke scope-3-emissie, een vertekend beeld van de  
CO2-voetafdruk van een specifiek bedrijf of hun beleggingsportefeuille naar  
hun achterban en de buitenwereld kunnen presenteren? Zo nee, kunt u  
aangeven waarom niet? Zo ja, kunt u aangeven hoe u van plan bent deze  
onwenselijke situatie te verhelpen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6 &amp; 7  
Een vertekend beeld is nooit wenselijk. Voor een individueel bedrijf geven  
scope 1 en 2 – emissies over het algemeen een goed beeld van de CO2-  
voetafdruk van dat bedrijf. Pensioenfondsen investeren vaak in meer dan één  
onderdeel van een keten, waardoor keten-effecten &amp;#40;beperkt&amp;#41; in beeld zijn.  
Ik zie op dit moment geen aanleiding om ervan uit te gaan dat het  
uitsluiten van scope 3 emissies op dit moment leidt tot een ernstig  
vertekend beeld van de CO2-voetafdruk van een pensioenfonds.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De sector is sterk in beweging met betrekking tot het ontwikkelen van  
betrouwbare, transparante en vergelijkbare meetmethodes voor de CO2-  
voetafdruk van investeringen. De afgelopen jaren zijn er o.a. via het  
Platform Carbon Accounting Financials en de Taskforce on Climate-related  
Financial Disclosures heldere, data-gebaseerde methodes ontwikkeld om dit  
in kaart te brengen. Deze methodes maken vooralsnog ook geen gebruik van  
scope 3 emissies, onder ander om dubbeltelling en onnauwkeurige schattingen  
te voorkomen. De focus op scope 1 en 2 is nu een belangrijke eerste stap.  
Mogelijk zal er later aanleiding zijn voor de rapporteurs om &amp;#40;op  
onderdelen&amp;#41; uit te breiden naar scope 3.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
Bent u zich ervan bewust dat het deelnemerscollectief ABP Fossielvrij al  
langere tijd probeert om scope-3-emissie ook mee te laten rekenen in het  
berekenen van de CO2-voetafdruk van bedrijven door ABP?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
Hoe beoordeelt u het feit dat ondanks deze inzet van haar grootste  
deelnemersinitiatief, ABP deze wens vooralsnog niet heeft ingewilligd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
Bent u het ermee eens dat dit een voorbeeld is van een nadelig gevolg van  
de relatief kleine invloed van deelnemers op het beleid van hun  
pensioenfonds?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 9 en 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het bestuur legt binnen de wettelijke kaders verantwoording af en doet  
verslag, en treedt met partijen al dan niet in overleg.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij de eerdere beantwoording van Kamervragen[1] is aangegeven dat  
werknemers in Nederland in algemene zin willen dat hun pensioenuitvoerder  
op hun ingelegde pensioenpremies op verantwoorde en duurzame wijze  
rendement maakt. Voor sommige werknemers kan dat betekenen dat zij niet  
willen dat de beleggingen van hun pensioenfonds een CO2-voetafdruk heeft.  
Het is aan het pensioenfonds om deze afweging te maken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het ABP is het bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor overheid en onderwijs. De  
werkgeversvertegenwoordigers en werknemersvertegenwoordigers maken  
afspraken over de inhoud van de pensioenregeling. Het ABP-bestuur heeft het  
primaat van de uitvoering van de pensioenregeling, inclusief het  
beleggingsbeleid. Het beleggingsbeleid van het ABP past binnen  
&amp;#40;inter&amp;#41;nationale wet- en regelgeving. Het bestuur maakt de afweging tussen  
risico, rendement, kosten en ook duurzaamheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Werknemers kunnen op verschillende manieren invloed uitoefenen op het  
beleid van ABP. ABP heeft een paritair bestuursmodel, waarin  
vertegenwoordigers van sociale partners door de betreffende organisaties  
voorgedragen en benoemd in het bestuur.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast maken vertegenwoordigers van werknemers en gepensioneerden  
onderdeel uit van het verantwoordingsorgaan. Het verantwoordingsorgaan is  
bevoegd om een oordeel te geven over het handelen van het bestuur, over het  
gevoerde beleid en de beleidskeuzes voor de toekomst, maar uiteindelijk  
beslist het bestuur. Het ABP-bestuur neemt dit oordeel op in het  
bestuursverslag.

a5ucbt,2,2018-12-13,Career Advice...Fellowship to Ph.D.? Advice on next steps?,fleberky,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/a5ucbt/career_advicefellowship_to_phd_advice_on_next/,"Hello, fellow social workers, I'm asking for advice on my career/next steps.

**Some background:** I graduated from my MSW program in May 2017 and took a job in macro practice/ policy. I did not obtain my LMSW yet but I am eligible. My MSW focus was policy but I also completed 1 full year of clinical work and a clinical internship. I also have an MPH that I graduated from in 2015. I have always wanted to get a Ph.D. and know that I will someday. I am having trouble figuring out the best next step before my Ph.D. and think that my next step will also help me understand the specialization for my Ph.D.

&amp;#x200B;

**My issue:**

I find my current job unfulfilling and dull. I never really had a TRUE clinical experience because my clinical internship was as a health and housing case working with NYC City Council and I often find my self reflecting on what it would be like to work in clinical practice. Full disclosure, I got into social work because I wanted to work in health policy. I believe health is a human right and wanted to work with policymakers to provide research and data-driven approaches to improve health policy (i.e. quality of care and health care access, integrated care coordination, etc.).  In my current job, I am working for policy makers and leadership at a company (and within a government) who do not want to hear about ideas for improvement. They just want to hear about ideas for ca$h. My company is not interested in providing evidence-based analysis but more geared towards the thought of ""how can we win more work?"" and to me, this is heartbreaking/soul-crushing. I have worked at other companies in policy and they haven't been this bad but to be honest, they aren't much better. Influencing policy takes years and I'm not one to quietly tip-toe around whispering my ideas for evidence-based policy making into the perfect selection of lawmakers. I want to make a change and I want it now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been reflecting on the best next step for my career and I'm really interested in practicing as a clinician. I want to be able to see tangible results from my work and working directly with clients will allow me to see the impact of my work. I know I would like to work in a healthcare setting, specifically behavioral health. As with many social workers, I am very interested in the intersection of race, language, and healthcare outcomes. I am interested in studying how oppressive structures can negatively impact behavioral or mental well being and in turn portray physical symptoms that if left untreated can lead to chronic health conditions and even premature death.

&amp;#x200B;

**My idea for best next steps:**

I'm really searching for a job where I can work directly with clients, conduct research, and also use my research to eventually influence policy. I think a clinical fellowship may be the way to go. IMO it would provide the opportunity to test out the ""clinical waters"" and make sure that clinical work is where I really want to be. 

Also, one day, I would like to get my Ph.D. but I'm not sure what to focus on which is another reason why I think a fellowship may be the right fit for me. With a fellowship, I see myself working in direct practice at a university hospital or a different university setting in behavioral health while keeping up with best practices and research trends. Following the fellowship, I will know if I would like to pursue a Ph.D. in Social Policy, Social Work (with a focus on intersectionality and health), or Clinical Psych.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions:**

Has anyone completed a clinical fellowship?

Do my wants and needs sound like they will be answered in a fellowship?

If you have completed a fellowship, did you find it rewarding? (For me this will be a LARGE pay cut... as in more than likely over half of my salary will be cut so I want to make sure I am going to feel like I made the right choice.)

Any other advice?

&amp;#x200B;

***TLDR:*** *I am a macro-level social worker and I am unfulfilled in my current job. I am thinking about transitioning to clinical practice and taking on a fellowship in clinical work. If things go well with the clinical fellowship, I would like to get a Ph.D. in clinical psych.*

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all! :)

a5uhj6,6,2018-12-13,"Morning nanny, struggling with a 7 year old boy?",julesiscools0509,Nanny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/a5uhj6/morning_nanny_struggling_with_a_7_year_old_boy/,"Hi guys! So I figured I could use some advice from a nanny pro. I'm struggling a bit here with a particular seven year old I take care of in the mornings. So I nanny quite a few families, but there is one family I nanny for in the mornings for school drop offs. I'll make his breakfast, his bed, do some laundry and some other light housekeeping. He has a ton of energy but since day one of nannying, he has been blatantly disrespectful. The first few times it started, I went easy on the discipline since we did not quite know each other yet. That being said, I still did set some ground rules. 

But we've bonded a bit since then and have gotten to know one another. It's been about two months since I've nannied for him, but the disrespect has been continuing. On rare occasions he's great. Most days he's name calling, whining, and not listening. I only have about an hour and a half with him so it's hard to fit in play time, breakfast time, and clean up time all at once. So I started time managing a bit better. I had a hard time getting him to eat breakfast too, so I started setting a timer for fifteen minutes and if he is not done by then we will not have much free time. This has worked well so far, but he is still very disrespectful towards me. 

As another example, I've tried getting him to watch me make his bed so he can eventually learn how to do it on his own but he refuses or doesn't take it seriously. I'll say, ""hey Tommy, (I'm not using his real name) come watch me make your bed. Afterwards we can build paper airplanes together!"" and instead he'll complain occasionally throw a tantrum. There is no compromise with him. I realize it is difficult for children to compromise, but I'm offering a fun alternative for him to do when we're done. There are times too when I try to help him out with crafts he is working on but he literally starts pushing me away and tells me to leave. I will give him his space, but I will come back a few minutes later and tell him that what he did was not okay and I was only trying to help him. No apologies, he usually just ignores this though I'll tell him to look at me when I'm speaking. 

Today, I was at my wits end and told him that he was being disrespectful and that we will not have any playtime tomorrow for his behavior. Long story short, he refused to eat his breakfast and while he did eat a little bit, he consistently back talked me for telling him to eat up. It took him over thirty minutes to eat today! 

How do I feel about this? It does not hurt or upset me personally that he is behaving like this towards me. I'm not personally offended. But I am frustrated. I have tried developing a relationship with this child, and it just feels like there is so much strain already that I cannot. I just wonder if there is a different approach I could be using. I tried compromising with him on certain things, ""if you finish your breakfast in 15 minutes, we can pick out a book to read, and then we'll have plenty of time to play!"". I've tried taking a more relaxed approach, and I've also tried putting my foot down more often. But hardly any of these work. 

I just spoke to mom about the behaviors, and she will have a talk with him tonight. I felt like there was nothing else I could do, I think reaching out to her was a good idea. So hopefully this will help a bit. I really do not like blaming the parents in a situation like this, I always feel like I could be doing something differently. And I do try different approaches but for him, none of them have worked. I just think in the case it may be mom and dad to partially blame. Yesterday, mom told me good luck on my interview for an internship I have. Tommy overheard and said ""wow, she probably won't get the job"". While I do believe he was joking, mom laughed along with him and then told him that wasn't a nice thing to say. But I really think this may be a part of the problem. I also think I may need to drop the job come in January when school starts back up. If I can't get anywhere with him then it just may not be a good fit. 

Any nannies out there that can give me some advice here? So sorry for the novel I wrote!

TL;DR: I nanny for a seven year old boy who consistently mouths off to me and does not ever cooperate. I do like to let him have play time, but mom does want some chores to get done on his end too. I've tried multiple approaches on the situation but hardly anything has worked. I talked to mom, what's next? Do I try another approach? "

a5v2a6,2,2018-12-13,I want to apply for an internship in the US. I have a lot of questions.,Kywim,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/a5v2a6/i_want_to_apply_for_an_internship_in_the_us_i/,"Hello!

First of all, if this is the wrong sub for this kind of question, let me know. I don't really know where to ask this.

**What's happening:** I live in Belgium and I'm in a 2nd year of a CompSci bachelor. In february 2020, we'll have to do a 3 month internship to get our diplomas. Now, I'm pretty good at programming and have pretty good relations with some of my teachers. I asked them if that's possible for me to do my internship abroad, since I want to do it in compiler programming and there's basically zero companies working with LLVM/Compilers in general in Belgium. Laughingly, I asked if it was possible for me to go do my internship at Apple, in the US, and... My teacher told me that if I had an offer from Apple, he can try to get the school to accept the internship and help me fund the 3 month stay. No promises tho, but it's likely that the school will accept it.

**The problem:** I need to contact Apple first, without knowing if I'll be able to accept an offer, if I get one.

**First question:** Is it impolite (or can it  ruin my chances of working for Apple in the future?) if I submit my resume, get an offer, and refuse it because the school decided that ""nope, you're not leaving"" or because of financial constraints?

**Second question:** This one is probably the dumbest, but is it even legal to apply for a internship in the US from Belgium if I don't have a visa or anything like that?

**Last question:** How early should I contact them? I thought about contacting them next month (so I have enough time to start contributing to the Swift compiler, possibly increasing my chances of being accepted), but is it too early? Note that IF I do get an offer, It'll take months of preparation to plan the trip, get every paper signed, get my visa, get the money, etc.

Thanks!"

I'm a college student with good credit history, have never missed a payment, use my card responsibly, and always pay off the balance in full. That being said, I'm an older college student at 27 and have bills to pay each month, and general living expenses (gas for a long commute, car ins., groceries, eating out occasionally if I forget lunch, etc.) that top out around $800-$1000 a month, give or take. My take home as an intern at the moment is around 1300 per month, so living within my means and still able to save a tad here and there when I graduate in May. This brings me to my CC question. I usually put purchases and transactions all on my CC for the security benefit and to earn the little cash back I'm qualified for. This puts my credit usage at around $1000 per month, but with only an $1800 limit its dinging my credit score for having such a high usage. My question is: would it be worth while to ask BoA for a limit increase simply to mitigate the ding to my credit score? I understand theres a hard pull for limit increase requests. I've had this card open for 3 years now and only had a single limit increase, and with graduation coming soon, my fiance and I will be looking to make a few purchases once i begin my job, and look for an apartment, and I'd like the best possible opportunity for interest rates when this time comes. For reference, my current score is a 731, but I believe that could increase with a higher limit. Thank you for any advice!"

a5wmvj,10,2018-12-13,I'm really glad I found this subreddit! :D,GSerraS,mypartneristrans,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/a5wmvj/im_really_glad_i_found_this_subreddit_d/,"So, I'd really like to share my story here in the case that, if any other person like me or my fiancee finds this text they'll be encouraged to move on and pursuit their love!

Basically, starting this kinda long story, I've met my now fiancee on Tinder actually,(x-post on r/Tinder?) we chatted for a bit, we are both big nerds, so we found common ground in comics and alikes. She recently had came out as a trans girl for her parents, and weeeell,( here in Brazil mainly being trans is especcially tough since it's te country that kills the most transgenders per year in the world), they didn't accepted it very well,(basically threatened her of kicking her out of their house and basically were horrible human beings) she was devastated, lost and depressed(she was already in a clinical depression state, but taking her meds regularly), so she tried to take her own liffe away... that happened around mid of 2017.

Around the same time, I was at the beggining of my fourth semester as an egineering student at the federal Uni at our town, and welp, things weren't easy... I felt awfull and would have reocurring panic attacks at the uni, my grades were in shambles and I just lived a day after the other, lifeless just waiting for my death... FAST FOWARD to february 2018, I was on Tinder and saw the most stunning person EVER, she was pretty, nerdy, cute, just PERFECT, and in her bio was writen: I'm trans, pre-op, and starting hrt. I just swiped right, and we matched, I still remember my dumb first message to her: ""Secret wars or crisis on infinite earths?"" And she replied, we kept talking, exchanged discords and went to chat. After around 2 weeks of awkard flerting and alikes I asked her out on a date. She said she couldn't go because she was busy and wouldn't be able to... I said, oh... Okay, no prob, wanna play some more? We'll go out some other day! The next week I asked her out again, and she responded: ""Look, I wanna go, but I'm really emberassed because it will be the first time I'll go dressed as myself in public."" Then I said: Hey, go dressed as you want to, it's not the clothes on your body that make you less feminine, I'll see the same amazing girl I've been talking to lately. And she Accepted!!! :D It was a the end of february, and we went to meet with a group of my friends at a park... NNOW, I must take a moment to describe the pure magic that was meeting her: SHE GLOWED!!!! She was even prettier in person!!! I was flustered obviously and a little awkward for the first hour or so, but we kept talking and loosing the tension a bit, then we kissed and was just MAGIC!

Anyway, I think I've prolongued myself a bit there, flash foward march 11, we kept going on dates and I finally felt seelings in my little heart, was amazing...  And now we were in a serious relationship, now, I needed to tell to my parents about this amazingly sweet girl I was dating, and well.... their response for their son dating a trans girl was not particularly good. But I wanted everyone to know and meet my super cute girlfriend! Times were a little hard, I studied full time at Uni, living at my parents house, cause money, but we went through it, her parents were awfull, mine as well, but our love always kept us going, everyday she healed a little more from her depression and trying to find a job(Especcially hard to find one here in Brazil as a trans lady) I still at the Uni, then one day, I managed to get a job as an intern in a Software developing company, it didn't pay much(still doesn't... lol) But was enough to pay for her HRT, so she could keep a better frequency on the treatment, I offered her to pay for it, mainly because her family wouldn't help... But unfortunately after a few months in this fashion, my mom and I have a little argument(almost fist fight) about her being an old prejudice filled lady, and she doesn't accept me and my girlfriend, nothing out of the ordinary scuff, so after more fight  I ended up leaving her house, just a plastic bag of my clothesin hand and went on to live with my biological dad in a poorer region of town, now unfortunatelly I had to stop her HRT, cause I would need the money to go to and from work, pay bills and finish my drivers license, but I promissed her that I would find a way to solve everything....

Flahs foward again, yesterday, december 12, Ireceived a promotion on work, now I'll earn twice as much, she's going back to hrt and after all we've been trough together we are engaged!!!!

I'm the happiest man in the world, and I thank her everyday that she made me like this! We both saved each other, and we hold each other dear so so much!

So this is my little lesson to you, reader who may or may not be going through something similar: NEVER GIVE UP! FIGHT HARD FOR YOU AND THE ONE YOU LOVE, EVERYTHING WILL WORKOUT IN THE END!

a5wq7b,1,2018-12-13,CFA/Finance work experience,DeanOfBlockchain,CFA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/a5wq7b/cfafinance_work_experience/,"  

Hi all,

I am a Bsc. in Applied Computing (Honours) student. I will have completed three years out of four this coming August once I sit two exams I need to pass (I have taken some time out of the course). I am not Interested in it, nor do I enjoy the course and struggle with programming (even more so after the time out), so I do not wish to complete it unless necessary. If I were to leave after completing 3 out of the 4 years, I would have an ordinary level bachelors, not honours.

I am interested in trading and portfolio management, so I am exploring the CFA avenue. What I am wondering is, how difficult would it be to get finance related work experience with my ordinary bachelors in Applied Computing, along with say, being a level 1/2 CFA candidate. Obviously getting experience is key to success. I wouldn't mind doing an intern or fellowship of sorts - even if it was unpaid - for a year. What do you think my chances are given what I’ve mentioned to now?

Secondly, assuming I pass all three levels and get a couple of years of related work experience, would I be able to get a decently paid, finance related job? Or would I need to slog it out until I obtain chartered status? 

Surely once I obtain chartered status, getting a well paid job shouldn't be much of an issue?

Thanking you all in advance."
a5wuf7,3,2018-12-13,What do I do now? [29 M WARNING: Long],TeacherMask,autism,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/a5wuf7/what_do_i_do_now_29_m_warning_long/,"Incoming long post about what led me to think I am autistic.  

BACKGROUND: I'm 29 years old and male and I've been married for two this May.  In the Sept of our first year I finally felt comfortable enough with my wife to let her know I feel like I am polyamorus.  I didn't go about it well, hyper focusing on the stuff I wanted and completely ignoring her concerns.  It wasn't until November of that year that I realized what I was doing and tried to regain stability, choosing to ignore that part of my life.  My wife tells me later that year that she after having time to think about it she can try with me, I'm overjoyed.  I explore stuff, I meet some people, I get hyperfocused on someone and make a huge mistake that I'd rather keep private.  We discuss it and over the next few months things stabilize again.  One of my wife's friends moves in with us in July because his living situation became untenable.  I'm cool with this as he is a decent guy.  It adds a little stress, but nothing too major.  Come September I'm working my main job and an internship for school and find myself completely wiped out once it's time to come home.  My days of rest consist of me on my PC trying to regain my energy for the 6 day work week.  I get really sick, as does my wife.  I meet friends, make some mistakes and move on.  Come Nov I have decided to throw all medical science at my issues (details below) and start to feel human again after a long bout of continuous illness.  That's when I meet someone who has become special to me, someone whom I click with in ways I haven't before, someone who gets my issues and tries to embrace them, and I get hyperfocused again.  

And this is where we are right now.  My wife had a medical appointment that I spaced on when scheduling a date. When I let her know the date she reminded me of the app and I said I would reschedule...but she told me not to, to go and do my date (I could tell she was upset, this was over text, but she has a propensity of using indirect language when upset), I kept telling her that I want to be at the appointment with her, literally until the day before the date she continuously told me no.  So I let her go alone, the results of the appointment being overall better than hoped, and got a call from her on my way.  I won't go into all the details here because it hurts and because it won't change anything, but needless to say when I got home I was not expecting so much blowback.  This was about two days ago.  Since then it has been tense and hard here.  (EDIT: Wife and I talked and we are trying to regain stability.)

ANYWAY, with that background, and some references to stuff like hyper focus, the friend I made is diagnosed autistic and when we were on the date she suggested that I show many of the symptoms.  She sent me a link to the Aspie Quiz and the results came back as Very likely I am neurodiverse, specifically the talent, communication, and relationships sections.  This made so much sense; I've had issues all throughout my life with focus, attention, comprehension, the works.  I become hyperfocused on thinks I like and often push all else to the side, or give them half assed efforts.  I struggle with verbal or indirect directives.  Sounds and lights have always been overwhelming in certain scenarios, unless I have a centering agent.  I am very tactile, liking to touch smooth and cool things as much as possible and wanting to hold things that I like.  I often use my ears when cool as a way to center myself, or focus on something that makes me happy...like the Power Rangers theme song.  I have texture issues with some food and tend to like eating the same things over and over, with mild levels of variation.  I procrastinate to the point of failure.    


After minor levels of research I've learned these are all different aspects of autism.  This was a few days ago, with the quiz being taken last night.  I've called around to different places in my area to see if there are screenings available for adults, but no luck yet.  I know adult autism diagnosis are hard to pin down and even harder to do anything with, but I really want to know so I can try to mitigate the behaviors that have been hurting my wife and my partners.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 29M Poly trying to grapple with recently discovered undiagnosed autism and how to keep the behaviors I exhibit from hurting those I love.  Background given for context on why I say hurt, and looking for a good starting point.  "

I tried a lot of things for the first time (one-night stands, two guys at once, older men) and there were a lot of things I didn't try but I still think about (professors or TAs, stripping, getting paid, semi-public sex).

I would love to chat or role play about one of the many possibilities. What's your college girl fantasy?

Do you meet her at the strip club or the dance club? Maybe at the beach or the public pool? Is she your student or your intern or your daughter's friend or your kid's babysitter? A girl who showed up to the party at your place? Is she renting a room in your house?

And what do you do with her? Share her with your friend(s)? Take increasingly dirty pictures of her and post them online? Feel her up in a study nook in the library? Convince her to invite her girlfriends to your house in the suburbs for an adults-only event?

Turnoffs: raw dominance (she's pretty willing!), pain (you like her!), scat (wrong room!), incest (ew!).

Turnons: besides all the things in my prompt, I love cheating, creampies, facials, slightly slutty clothes, ageplay (18+ obviously, don't be gross), big dicks, and spanking.

I can play any kind of girl you want me to be, as long as it's true to my username. :) Feel free to describe me or share a picture of what you like, or I can send a couple pictures to you if you prefer that.

I know this type of prompt isn't everyone's bag, but hopefully there are a couple of you out there!"

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first ever post on Reddit so I hope I'm doing everything correctly :)

I was hoping someone on here that is currently working/has worked for/with a game localisation company could share their experience with me.

Growing up I was fascinated by languages and games and I thought to myself: translating games and earning a living with it - that must be a dream come true!

For some reason I thought I'd never make it this far (I thought it'd be very difficult to get into this area of translation), but here I am. I've been working in this field for around 2 years now and I'm really enjoying the work itself. And yet I am considering a complete career change because one aspect of it makes me lose hope: the conditions in the game localisation industry.

I don't want to go into too much detail about my current position/company, but let's say I'm currently keeping an eye out for new opportunities.

According to my research, the number of game localisation companies based in Europe (specifically Germany/Switzerland/Austria and the UK as that is where I am/I'd be interested in working) is rather limited. If you look around a bit and make a list of basically all of them, it does not take too much time looking up reviews for them.

So that's what I’ve been doing recently (on glassdoor specifically) and I am appalled.

According to user reviews it seems almost ALL of these companies do not treat their game translators well at all. Low salaries (I understand that you should not choose this industry if you want to make tons of money, but we are talking about below minimum wage...), exploiting interns, constant stress/pressure, unwilling to give even just one (!) raise/no career prospects whatsoever, management does not care one bit about their ""resources"" (aka translators) etc.

I am currently working under such conditions and due to my research, I'm afraid that even if I switched companies, my situation would never improve if I’m staying in this industry. So I'm having a bit of a crisis at the moment and am seriously considering doing something completely different (bit extreme, I know, but I am fed up and honestly burned out).

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: Could you please share your experience in terms of working conditions if you worked/are working in the game localisation industry? Is there any hope to find a decent company out there that treats their employees/contract workers well? I think that'd be the most important thing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my long rant above and thanks in advance for your answers!

a5ymkv,0,2018-12-13,Up and down moodswings all week long every time triggered by my so since I moved overseas to be with him,Broodjekroket96,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a5ymkv/up_and_down_moodswings_all_week_long_every_time/,"Hey redditors, 
I'm not English and on my phone looking for some advise or insight from you. 


Who am I?

22F from Europe that just moved to Australia to try a new adventure with my so. I have alot of guy friends through my job and hobbies : riding my motorbike and making furniture. I've had a very rough life with alot of loss and no parenting, which made me feel very alone and seeking out attention with the wrong kind of people.
It tought me very harsh about trust, respect and well saying no. Been in therapy since I was 11 due to this till 18 when things started to get better.



Relationship
Me and my so have  been together for 10 months now and things are okay between us.  Ups and downs I'd say.  He is from new Zealand where I had an internship - that's how we met. He came to NL to try it out after dating for 4 months but it didn't work jobwise that well and now I made the move to aus with him.



Situation
Things have been shit for the past 2 months. Normally I can find myself and do my own things and be happy but ever since I moved in with my so my mood is down. I'm not feeling myself anymore or really happy with the desicion. My mood goes like : doing stuff my myself during the day like walking etc make me happy and chill but as soon as my so comes home from work I just get irritated. 

He doesn't really ask how I am or how my day was. He asks when he feels good, but when he had a stressful day he just goes gaming or ignoring me and saying I'm making a problem out of nothing. When I let him be (alone time) afterwards he still ignores me, so he doesn't turn around or anything unless I talk to him about it the next day.


Now we are in a big City and I wanted to do things for myself, so I did.
I did a coastal walk today and when my so asked what I was doing I showed a picture. 
He responded with its good to see that you do all these awesome things without me. 
I don't know why, I know he doesn't like his job and wants to do things with me but that comment just stung. The rest of the day he was doing the negative critique  everything thing so I let him be. I had a new ppl get together in a bar anyway.


It's just since that comment my mood of like oh I'm happy I can see this and do this goes to well I'm apparently a bad person for doing things without him. I know he wants to do those things but I can't just sit in the house all day waiting for him.
I asked him if my thoughts were reasonable to think and he says no I'm making a big deal out of something that's teasing. He just ignored me the whole evening and didn't ask me anything, not even how my evening was or the bar or the people.


I just feel like shit. It triggered an old trauma of mine in the night and I've been crying in my sleep of all the nightmares of guys coming in and almost stab me to death in this little rented shared flat we now have and him just not caring in my dreams. In my dreams I was already looking for a flat myself to move out.


Something bad like a little situation as that just triggers me to go : this relationship is good to I am booking a ticket home and I don't love or respect you anymore. I just feel so vulnerable.


I gave up everything and trying my best to find a job here and to fix the visa and all but it just doesn't work. I applied for 40 jobs with 1 response that was a no eventually. After I told him today way was bothering me he said I'm spending too much money that we need for bills on groceries and some clothes (5 pieces for 7 dollars on sale) and dinner we need. He doesn't buy groceries, nor cook or clean in the house. I feel like he just doesn't get it.

On better days he is very caring and gives me hugs and all but I also get alot of comments during the day of like: why are you taking so long, why can't you walk normal (When I don't know where to go in the station and bump a little into him) why do you spend money on groceries etc. When I explain why I don't get a response or it's something on the negative side again.

TL;DR having trouble finding myself and my relationship in a new city. My so23M works fulltime and I'm trying to keep myself busy and happy, but his negative comments drag me down and when I go, I go deep down. I don't know what is making me go so down and if I'm the problem."

I had a girlfriend and we were happy. Everything was perfect. I landed a job in west coast and she decided to further her education in Florida.

It just happened that she cheated on me and we broke up in awful terms. I was devastated but as fate had it we got back together. I decided that I wanted to live closer to her, so decided to pursue a MBA from my alma mater. I left my job in Silicon Valley, gave up everything and moved back. I gave up the option to get a green card and decided to restart my career again.

And this is when everything went downhill. It was mid 2016 when I realized that D Trump and his anti immigrant rhetoric was scary. I second doubted my decision to go to B-school but I believed it’s all going to end well.

In 2017, I got an internship and worked with a reasonably established firm. They liked me, so they offered a six figure job in the city I lived in. I was ecstatic and accepted that offer. Things were going great with my girlfriend and I looked forward to every single in my life.

Fast forward 2018. The firm couldn’t apply for my visa due to some technicalities. We had to wait till I graduated. The government rejected my visa application with little explanation (so much for highly skilled individuals who spend a decade in school studying). They made me go through this process for several months before saying no. My heart was broken. I had to leave the country immediately. It was early August.

Things started to go downhill at that point. I returned to my country. I barely connected with my girlfriend.  I became sulky and cranky. I started frantically searching for a job. And fortunately,I landed a few calls.

This is when everything went downhill. I have given at least 12 interviews at this point, reaching final stages twice and landing nothing. My girlfriend is unhappy that I can’t see her anymore. I gave up a $100k plus an option to get a green card from my previous job just to be closer to her. I spent over $120k over the last two years trying to get another degree. It’s all gone. I have nothing working for me. I received a rejection from Google today. It’s just heartbreaking to spend months on interviews and not getting anything. I have lost interest in everything. I’m 28 and don’t know what to do next. Suddenly, I feel incompetent, helpless, and incredibly sad. My life has been turned upside down. I don’t know what to do. The longer I stay out of the job market, the more questions I get. I just don’t know what to do. 


I had to unload it off my chest."
a5yvmh,15,2018-12-13,Husband (21M) left for BMT two days ago; he decided to go on a break from the marriage while he was gone.,jellyfihs_,USMilitarySO,https://www.reddit.com/r/USMilitarySO/comments/a5yvmh/husband_21m_left_for_bmt_two_days_ago_he_decided/,"So we got married pretty young. He was worried about me being alone and not having insurance while he was away for a whole year. We had fought a couple times before he left and one of these times (about 3 weeks before he had to leave) he brings up that he has been thinking about taking a break or breaking up with me. Not gonna lie, I had a mental breakdown when he said that. I'm not completely sure of why he had decided this bc he didn't dive into the reason why. He said that while on the break he wants us to work on ourselves and become friends again before the relationship. But he also said that he wants us to know we'll both be okay whether we do or do not get back together. At this moment in time I wish I could talk to him and understand his side of the story, but I can't. So here's a few points from my side; I still very much want to be with him. I still see a future with him. I have noticed a few changes before he left, such as, him becoming more lazy. He started to run to prepare himself for BMT but eventually all he did was lay in bed on his phone all day. He would respond to me angrily even if I was trying to start a conversation about something he said. I believe his view of me had changed to something negative and thus he would respond in that way. Now, I know I didn't do everything perfectly. I have my own faults as well but I could only guess what had bothered him. My thoughts on that are that I wasn't entirely supportive of him in a few instances; (ex. He joked with the idea of interning for his favorite YouTube channel if he got stationed in LA. I got upset with the idea bc I know he would work long hours with the AF then intern whenever he had free time and also relax by going on his computer for hours. So where would the time for me be?) Another thing that I did could have been being too sensitive to things he said and did (or didn't do.) I guess why I'm making this post is just to receive some support and to help give me hope that things will be okay. That while away, he may come to miss me and understand my point of view a little more. I did see a post saying their SO had changed after basic and was more serious about the relationship and more emotional as well. Is it wrong if I hope that that happens to my husband?"

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I got an offer for Stanford's IHP program next summer 2019. I am a 3rd year Computer Science undergraduate, with focus in Robotics and recently delving into ML/AI. So far I am considering the following things to do :

1. Silicon Valley Innovation Academy (SVIA). What are your thoughts and opinions about this? Is it worth spending extra fee into this program?
2. Research opportunities : Is there any undergraduate research program with the professors offered during this period? I'm also thinking if I can meet some of the professors to have some research projects.
3. Internships around Stanford : Also wondering any websites or communities I can look up for applying internships near Stanford if possible. The internship distance is also one of my considerations since I am enrolling in classes if I accept the program.
4. I also read some threads about the summer session so far, but some are for high schools. In general, is the IHP program for undergraduates worth it?

Thanks a lot!"

Rear Admiral Henry H. Harwood, with full knowledge that Royal Navy reinforcements (Carrier Ark Royal, Battlecruiser Renown, Cruisers Neptune, Dorsetshire and Shropshire) are closing on Montevideo, sends a request to the British diplomatic corp at Montevideo requesting that in order to buy time for for reinforcements to arrive, the embassy should carefully stagger the departure of ships from Montevideo's port in order to utilise the Convention (XIII) concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War to trap and delay the Graf Spee.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Article 16 -  When war-ships belonging to both belligerents are present simultaneously in a neutral port or roadstead, a period of not less than twenty-four hours must elapse between the departure of the ship belonging to one belligerent and the departure of the ship belonging to the other.  
&gt;  
&gt;The order of departure is determined by the order of arrival, unless the ship which arrived first is so circumstanced that an extension of its stay is permissible.  
&gt;  
&gt;A belligerent war-ship may not leave a neutral port or roadstead until twenty-four hours after the departure of a merchant ship flying the flag of its adversary.

&amp;#x200B;

The Cumberland will arrive at the mouth of the River Plate on this day and join the patrolling British cruisers.

In full compliance with the terms of the 13th Hague Convention, Captain Hans Langsdorff will release the captive crews of the ships he had previously raided.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Article 21 - A prize may only be brought into a neutral port on account of unseaworthiness, stress of weather, or want of fuel or provisions.It must leave as soon as the circumstances which justified its entry are at an end. If it does not, the neutral Power must order it to leave at once; should it fail to obey, the neutral Power must employ the means at its disposal to release it with its officers and crew and to intern the prize crew.  
&gt;  
&gt;Article 22 - A neutral Power must, similarly, release a prize brought into one of its ports under circumstances other than those referred to in Article 21.

&amp;#x200B;

Capitalising on the rash of 'Ark Royal' sightings that had resulted from erroneous German propaganda declarations that they had sunk the Ark Royal, the British embassy also lets slip information that the Ark Royal and her battlegroup (Force H) are in pursuit of the Graf Spee (which they are) and that they are operating in the waters off Montevideo (which they currently aren't). Captain Langsdorff is successfully taken by the deceptive half-truth and convinced he will face overwhelming resistance when the Graf Spee leaves port.

About me..

I’m a senior at a small university in the greater Philadelphia area. I’ve completed 4 internships in my undergraduate career (all marketing/business development) and am currently interning at a leading software company with a US headquarters outside of Philly. I’ve started a marketing club on campus, hold other leadership positions, frequently attend local career events, reach out to people on LinkedIn, religiously apply for jobs, yet it seems near impossible to get into the industry that I want. 

Getting into sales at the company I’m currently interning at seems impossible. As a leader in ERP software, applicants are flocking in globally. Despite my experience as a sales development intern at the company, my chances are still slim. 

What advice would you have? What steps should I be taking to ensure I get a sales related job (preferably SaaS) lined up before graduation in May? When is the best time to apply? Any companies I should look into? 

Thanks!

TL;DR at the bottom dudes

I used to date a girl in freshman year of highschool (I didn't expect it to last but eh) I was the socially awkward and introverted kid of the class and only occasionally popped a joke here and there.  The 3rd marking period rolls around and we change seats in science class. I get sat in the front which was followed up by this random girl I had never spoken to getting seated next to me. Pretty cute, now I'd rate a 6/10 but eh.  I crack a joke here and there and she thinks I'm pretty funny.  This gave me a slight but of confidence so I decide to man up for once. 

She sat at the back of the lunchroom by herself most days so I decide to leave my shitty cramped table and go to hers and we hit it off right away.  A few months later and we're dating.  We had great times and little to no fights at all so everything was looking good.  

The year ends and I go off to a summer internship at a summer camp.  The reception was shit and I couldn't contact her all of the time and when I could it was brief, maybe 5 minute calls at best.  I wasn't even allowed to have my phone on me so I couldn't call her then either.  

It's the last week of the internship, I wasnt able to talk for long the day before so I wanted to hear her voice again. I called her and she said this. 

""Sooo, I like someone else."" 

I wasn't really sad or distraught, just shocked.  We had a bomb relationship going and she didn't seem like the attention hog kinda type. So I said.

""Ok, bye I guess."" And i hung up.  

Rest of the summer shoots by and when I get back to school, she's dating another guy, obviously.  Whiter than chalk and wearing fake gold chains too.  I wasn't bothered by this, she found someone else, fair enough.  This is where shit starts to take a turn.  

I find out from one of her close friends that she o ly dated me to make the guy she was dating now jealous and broke up with me after getting some from him.  This made my blood boil.  I didn't care about the breakup, I was pissed that I had been used and duped into caring about her.  So I hatched my plan.  

This girl was always against going to the local movie theater because the popcorn made her break out.  I had a friend in the theater who would give us deals on movies and candy so I asked him if he had any expired shit.  He brings out 2 good sized boxes of stale kernels and oil that hadn't been used and said I could take them.  

After school the next day, he and i brought the boxes into the school through the back entrance and went to the girl's locker.  We took the kernels and lightly dipped them in oil to make them more slippery because then started sliding them through the slits in the locker and it began to fill. After what felt like hours (only took like 45 minutes because we started putting handfuls in at a time after a while) we left and waited for the next time she'd open the locker.  

Morning comes and I wake up faster than I ever had before.  Biked as fast as possible to school and waited with my friend.  We looked on as she approached her locker and started to enter the combo.  When those kernels spilled all over her expensive ass boots and across the hallway floor.  She shrieked in anger when she saw how her shoes had been destroyed.  She never found out it was me.

TL;DR

Girl dates/uses me for a few months and breaks up with me for another guy.  She is allergic to movie popcorn or something so I jam pack her locker full of kernels and oil.  She opens the door and ruins her boots and embarrasses herself in front of the whole school.  

Edit, apparently her boyfriend was cheating on her too with 2 other chicks and she tried to get back with me. Hard pass."
a60aoa,14,2018-12-13,Assume referential integrity...,VBassmeister,tableau,https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/a60aoa/assume_referential_integrity/,"TL;DR I'm really dumb and you shouldn't do like 40 joins to select 1 column.

So I'm an intern with a BI group inside of a large organization, and one of my first tasks was to connect tableau to a data warehouse. I was given this task back in early October. (I had VERY LITTLE understanding of SQL, Databases, Data warehouses, and tableau.)

Luckily for me the joins had already been made for WeBI, so I just had to recreate them in tableau. Well, I hook all 30 or so dimension tables and views up to the fact table and then test it out.

""That's weird, it takes like 5 minutes just to select a single column""

So I try making an extract and come back the next day to an error saying it can't make a temp table big enough to make the extract.

I tell my mentor about it and he shows me how to pull the SQL out of tableau. we see that the temp table wants to be about 8 terabytes, which is way above the databases limits. The DBAs don't want to increase temp table size (something about not wanting this to be common practice). 

So a live connection then. My boss looks into the schema (it's an Oracle PeopleSoft system) and finds that nothing is indexed or partitioned. No one had noticed before because they're not trying to select the entire schema, and the machine is strong enough to be effective for most people.

Well I spend the next 7 weeks reading Oracle manuals, and this week I've been reading up on dimensions (for heirarchies, something about materialized views). I get sick of it and go back into Tableau for giggles and I notice that the live connection is taking 2 mintues to select a single column with 5 rows.

I look at the SQL and see that it's JOINING EVERY TABLE FOR EVERY QUERY REGARDLESS OF WHICH TABLES THAT QUERY USES.

After a quick google search I discover join culling, and the ""assume referential integrity"" option.

Boom. Live connection is lightning fast now. 7 weeks of work on database optimization is now basically useless.

Oh well. At least I'm going to Ace my data warehousing class next semester."

Here in California, taxes has gotten so high that there is a new proposition to text messages and the only type of people that can make a decent type of living here are engineers that has their housing in top companies that has their housing paid by the company(an average house here cost millions). Aside from taxes, I'm also tired of the amount of cultural degeneracy such as drugs. I currently live in Oakland so I see a lot of crime here. There are so much drug users here that needles are seen everywhere in the streets, kids as young as 12 are currently smoking marijuana, homeless people in hard drugs such as flakka are on the center of these cities. I want to be able to raise a family someday and I don't this is a good place to raise kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've already mentioned drug related crimes but there are more than that. Just recently, I just got my apartment got robbed for the third time these two year. There are also countless of times that I have been robbed and the police did not do anything about it. One example is that when I almost got beaten wearing specific colors when I was 17(I'm 25 now). Sadly, California has too much regulations on guns in order for me to protect myself. Hence, these parts that I stated is one reason why California.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I currently work as a security guard at a tech company, a sales representative with an internship in digital marketing. I hope that with these experiences that I'll be able to transfer to a job or find a job in Alaska.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason why I would like to go is because I'm interested in taking a masters in public administration in UAA. As of now, I plan to go there to make connections to get better jobs there. 

&amp;#x200B;

So would moving to Anchorage be worth it?

I only have experience in HTML and CSS, but I do want to learn more.  I'm passionate enough that I'm gonna power through it and learn them one by one. I just want to know if there are any recommendations for an order to learn them or if there is something else that would be as useful to help me wrap my head around OOP and such. They list the following to have some basic experience in.

* Ruby on Rails
* AngularJS and Node.js
* Redis, MySQL and memcached
* Amazon Web Services
* Docker and Concourse

I'm trying to start with ruby so I can have an understanding before going into Rails. But after research I'm thinking about maybe starting with mastering JavaScript first. Any advice is welcomed :)

a61pcl,1,2018-12-14,I am overwhelmed,dwray1,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a61pcl/i_am_overwhelmed/,"This year has been the worst year of my life. At the beginning of the year I started a new job that my then-girlfriend’s older brother offered me. The job is at a small machine shop, and I had no idea what I was doing. I had absolutely no experience with anything related to the job. My dad never taught me how to do anything “manly” other than how to be a drunk. From the beginning I was made fun of for not being manly enough, not knowing what I was doing, etc. no one took the time to teach me. I had to figure everything out on my own. I’m in college and this job was never supposed to be so time consuming or difficult. Before this I worked as a waiter for about four years, and the flexibility and relative ease of the job was perfect. 

I’ve struggled with depression since high school, and it was hitting me hard around the time that I took the job. My girlfriend’s family humiliating and emasculating me every day only made it worse. I didn’t want to do anything. Every day was an exhausting and repetitive slog. I talked to my girlfriend, who I lived with, about her family’s behavior and I learned that they had created a group on Snapchat without me where they constantly talked shit about me. My girlfriend never stood up for me. She joined in on the shit-talking. 

It started getting harder and harder to do the things I needed to every day. I would always come home, get homework done, and just collapse or zone out playing some video game. My girlfriend started getting annoyed with me more and more. She started pulling away, and she started hanging out with an old friend of hers she had cut off because of her toxic behavior. Eventually,  she told me she didn’t love me anymore. She broke up with me, and I just broke. We decided to be friends, and for a little while it was fairly amicable. I tried to ask her about why she broke up with me, and she would never give me an answer. She just got angry with me and pushed away again. 

I’m not proud of my behavior at this time at all. I was pitiful, naive, and I didn’t respect her boundaries. We still hung out for a while, and she actually started working at my workplace right after the break-up. I had set her up with my best friend’s dad who is successful in the field she wants to go into and he was supposed to set her up for a really great internship. We went over to their house together, and afterwards we went to see a movie. When I dropped her off she kissed me. We kissed for a while in her driveway and held each other for a while. It was the first time since the beginning of the year I felt comforted. After this she just cut me off. Nothing made sense to me anymore. I drove to her house to get my things because she kept avoiding me coming over to get them before. I got to the house and no one was home, so I went inside, grabbed everything that I had paid for including gifts, and put them in my truck. I also put everything that she had given me on her bed. There was a post-it note on her mirror that I had written “I love you - D” on. I still can’t comprehend why she would put that note there. 

I also took the dog we had gotten together. At first I agreed to let her keep the dog, but she had bumps and scabs all over her skin and this had been going on for weeks. My ex hadn’t taken her to the vet despite me asking her to repeatedly. At first I told her I’d take her to the vet, bring her back, and that would be that. We would never see each other again. The vet said that she had a skin infection, and if it had gone untreated much longer she would have died. It was hard for me to do, but I decided to keep the dog. Even though I gave my word to let her keep the dog, I couldn’t trust her to take proper care of it and I’m not about to have the death of that sweet puppy on my hands. I called her and told her. She tore into me. When she finally hung up I sat in my driveway and cried for what seemed like days. 

I drank a lot at that point. I was almost arrested. I thought about killing myself constantly. I started therapy for the third time in my life. A little while later I learned that my ex had told her sisters the story of my sexual assault when I was a child. She was the only person I ever told. She also told them that I made it all up to make her feel bad. I’m alive, sure, and things could be a hell of a lot worse, but there are so many knives in my back that I feel like I may as well be dead. The worst part isn’t even the pain of someone you love hurting you so badly. The worst part is the guilt and shame I feel for allowing it to happen and letting her fuck me over time and time again."
a61rqz,26,2018-12-14,Tips For Great Job Interviews,worldjobtrends,interviewpreparations,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviewpreparations/comments/a61rqz/tips_for_great_job_interviews/,"Want to ace your next interview and land that open job you’ve been seeking? Here are tips to help you prepare.

1. Research the industry and company.
An interviewer may ask how you perceive his company's position in its industry, who the firm's competitors are, what its competitive advantages are, and how it should best go forward. For this reason, avoid trying to thoroughly research a dozen different industries. Focus your job search on just a few industries instead.

2. Clarify your ""selling points"" and the reasons you want the job.
Prepare to go into every interview with three to five key selling points in mind, such as what makes you the best candidate for the position. Have an example of each selling point prepared (""I have good communication skills. For example, I persuaded an entire group to ...""). And be prepared to tell the interviewer why you want that job – including what interests you about it, what rewards it offers that you find valuable, and what abilities it requires that you possess. If an interviewer doesn't think you're really, really interested in the job, he or she won't give you an offer – no matter how good you are!

3. Anticipate the interviewer's concerns and reservations.
There are always more candidates for positions than there are openings. So interviewers look for ways to screen people out. Put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself why they might not want to hire you (“I don't have this,” “I'm not that,” etc.). Then prepare your defense: “I know you may be thinking that I might not be the best fit for this position because [their reservation]. But you should know that [reason the interviewer shouldn't be overly concerned].""

4. Prepare for common interview questions.
Every ""how to interview"" book has a list of a hundred or more ""common interview questions."" (You might wonder just how long those interviews are if there are that many common questions!) So how do you prepare? Pick any list and think about which questions you're most likely to encounter, given your age and status (about to graduate, looking for a summer internship). Then prepare your answers so you won't have to fumble for them during the actual interview.

5. Line up your questions for the interviewer.
Come to the interview with some intelligent questions for the interviewer that demonstrate your knowledge of the company as well as your serious intent. Interviewers always ask if you have any questions, and no matter what, you should have one or two ready. If you say, ""No, not really,"" he or she may conclude that you're not all that interested in the job or the company. A good all-purpose question is, ""If you could design the ideal candidate for this position from the ground up, what would he or she be like?""

If you're having a series of interviews with the same company, you can use some of your prepared questions with each person you meet (for example, ""What do you think is the best thing about working here?"" and ""What kind of person would you most like to see fill this position?"") Then, try to think of one or two others during each interview itself.

6. Practice, practice, practice.
It's one thing to come prepared with a mental answer to a question like, ""Why should we hire you?"" It's another challenge entirely to say it out loud in a confident and convincing way. The first time you try it, you'll sound garbled and confused, no matter how clear your thoughts are in your own mind! Do it another 10 times, and you'll sound a lot smoother and more articulate.

But you shouldn't do your practicing when you're ""on stage"" with a recruiter; rehearse before you go to the interview. The best way to rehearse? Get two friends and practice interviewing each other in a ""round robin"": one person acts as the observer and the ""interviewee"" gets feedback from both the observer and the ""interviewer."" Go for four or five rounds, switching roles as you go. Another idea (but definitely second-best) is to tape record your answer and then play it back to see where you need to improve. Whatever you do, make sure your practice consists of speaking aloud. Rehearsing your answer in your mind won't cut it.

7. Score a success in the first five minutes.
Some studies indicate that interviewers make up their minds about candidates in the first five minutes of the interview – and then spend the rest of the interview looking for things to confirm that decision! So what can you do in those five minutes to get through the gate? Come in with energy and enthusiasm, and express your appreciation for the interviewer's time. (Remember: She may be seeing a lot of other candidates that day and may be tired from the flight in. So bring in that energy!)

Also, start off with a positive comment about the company – something like, ""I've really been looking forward to this meeting [not ""interview""]. I think [the company] is doing great work in [a particular field or project], and I'm really excited by the prospect of being able to contribute.""

8. Get on the same side as the interviewer.
Many interviewers view job interviews as adversarial: Candidates are going to try to pry an offer out of the interviewer, and the interviewer's job is to hold onto it. Your job is to transform this ""tug of war"" into a relationship in which you're both on the same side. You could say something as simple as, ""I'm happy to have the chance to learn more about your company and to let you learn more about me, so we can see if this is going to be a good match or not. I always think that the worst thing that can happen is to be hired into a job that's wrong for you – then nobody's happy!""

9. Be assertive and take responsibility for the interview.
Perhaps out of the effort to be polite, some usually assertive candidates become overly passive during job interviews. But politeness doesn't equal passivity. An interview is like any other conversation – it’s a dance in which you and a partner move together, both responding to the other. Don't make the mistake of just sitting there waiting for the interviewer to ask you about that Nobel Prize you won. It's your responsibility to make sure he walks away knowing your key selling points.

10. Be ready to handle illegal and inappropriate questions.
Interview questions about your race, age, gender, religion, marital status, and sexual orientation are inappropriate and in many areas illegal. Nevertheless, you may get one or more of them. If you do, you have a couple of options. You can simply answer with a question (""I'm not sure how that's relevant to my application""), or you can try to answer ""the question behind the question"": ""I don't know whether I'll decide to have children in the near future, but if you're wondering if I'll be leaving my job for an extended period of time, I can say that I'm very committed to my career and frankly can't imagine giving it up.""

11. Make your selling points clear.
If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, did it make a sound? More important, if you communicate your selling points during a job interview and the interviewer doesn't get it, did you score? On this question, the answer is clear: No! So don't bury your selling points in long-winded stories. Instead, tell the interviewer what your selling point is first, then give the example.

12. Think positive.
No one likes a complainer, so don't dwell on negative experiences during an interview. Even if the interviewer asks you point blank, ""What courses have you liked least?"" or ""What did you like least about that previous job?"" don't answer the question. Or more specifically, don't answer it as it's been asked. Instead, say something like, ""Well, actually I've found something about all of my classes that I've liked. For example, although I found [class] to be very tough, I liked the fact that [positive point about the class]"" or ""I liked [a previous job] quite a bit, although now I know that I really want to [new job].""

13. Close on a positive note.
If a salesman came to you and demonstrated his product, then thanked you for your time and walked out the door, what did he do wrong? He didn't ask you to buy it! If you get to the end of an interview and think you'd really like that job, ask for it! Tell the interviewer that you'd really, really like the job – that you were excited about it before the interview and are even more excited now, and that you're convinced you'd like to work there. If there are two equally good candidates at the end of the search – you and someone else – the interviewer will think you're more likely to accept the offer, and thus may be more inclined to make an offer to you.

Even better, take what you've learned about yourself from your MyPath career assessment and use it to explain why you think this is the job for you: ""I've done some careful career self-assessment, and I know that I'm most interested in [one or two of your most important career interest themes], and – correct me if I'm wrong – it seems that this position would allow me to express those interests. I also know that I'm most motivated by [two or three of your most important motivators from your MyPath assessment], and I have the sense that if I do well, I could get those rewards in this position.

Finally, I know that my strongest abilities are [two or three of your strongest abilities from your MyPath assessment], and I see those as being the abilities you most need for this position."" If you follow this tip, you'll be (a) asking for the job, (b) explaining why you think it's a good match, (c) displaying your thoughtfulness and maturity, and (d) further disarming the tug-of-war dynamic that interviewers anticipate. You'll be making the strongest possible ""close"" – and that's worth a lot!

14. Bring a copy of your resume to every interview.
Have a copy of your resume with you when you go to every interview. If the interviewer has misplaced his or her copy, you'll save a lot of time (and embarrassment on the interviewer's part) if you can just pull your extra copy out and hand it over.

15. Don't worry about sounding ""canned"".
Some people are concerned that if they rehearse their answers, they'll sound ""canned"" (or overly polished or glib) during the interview. Don't worry. If you're well prepared, you'll sound smooth and articulate, not canned. And if you're not so well prepared, the anxiety of the situation will eliminate any ""canned"" quality.

16. Make the most of the ""Tell me about yourself"" question.
Many interviewers begin interviews with this question. So how should you respond? You can go into a story about where you were born, what your parents do, how many brothers and sisters and dogs and cats you have, and that's okay. But would you rather have the interviewer writing down what kind of dog you have – or why the company should hire you?

Consider responding to this question with something like: ""Well, obviously I could tell you about lots of things, and if I'm missing what you want, please let me know. But the three things I think are most important for you to know about me are [your selling points]. I can expand on those a little if you'd like."" Interviewers will always say, ""Sure, go ahead."" Then you say, ""Well, regarding the first point, [give your example]. And when I was working for [company], I [example of another selling point]."" Etc. This strategy enables you to focus the first 10-15 minutes of the interview on all of your key selling points. The ""Tell me about yourself"" question is a golden opportunity. Don't miss it!

17. Speak the right body language.
Dress appropriately, make eye contact, give a firm handshake, have good posture, speak clearly, and don't wear perfume or cologne! Sometimes interview locations are small rooms that may lack good air circulation. You want the interviewer paying attention to your job qualifications -- not passing out because you've come in wearing Chanel No. 5 and the candidate before you was doused with Brut, and the two have mixed to form a poisonous gas that results in you not getting an offer!

18. Be ready for ""behavior-based"" interviews"".
One of the most common interview styles today is to ask people to describe experiences they have had that demonstrate behaviors that the company thinks are important for a particular position. You might be asked to talk about a time when you made an unpopular decision, displayed a high level of persistence, or made a decision under time pressure and with limited information, for example.

Step 1 is to anticipate the behaviors this hiring manager is likely to be looking for. Step 2 is to identify at least one example of when you demonstrated each behavior. Step 3 is to prepare a story for each example. Many people recommend using SAR (Situation-Action-Result) as a model for the story. Step 4 is to practice telling the story. Also, make sure to review your resume before the interview with this kind of format in mind; this can help you to remember examples of behaviors you may not have anticipated in advance.

19. Send thank-you notes.
Write a thank-you note after every interview. Type each note on paper or send them by email, depending on the interviewers' preferences. Customize your notes by referring specifically to what you and the interviewer discussed; for example, ""I was particularly excited about [or interested by, or glad to hear] what you said about ..."" Handwritten notes might be better if you're thanking a personal contact for helping you in your job search, or if the company you're interviewing with is based in Europe. Whatever method you choose, notes should be sent within 48 hours of the interview.

To write a good thank-you note, you'll need to take time after each interview to jot down a few things about what the interviewer said. Also, write down what you could have done better in the interview, and make adjustments before you head off for your next interview.

20. Don't give up!
If you've had a bad interview for a job that you truly think would be a great fit for you (not just something you want badly), don't give up! Write a note, send an email, or call the interviewer to let him or her know that you think you did a poor job of communicating why you think this job would be a good match. Reiterate what you have to offer the company, and say that you'd like an opportunity to contribute. Whether this strategy will get you a job offer depends on the company and on you. But one thing's for sure: If you don't try, your chances are exactly zero. We've seen this approach work on numerous occasions, and we encourage you to give it that last shot.

If you follow the above strategies, you'll be as prepared as any candidate an interviewer has ever seen. Good luck!

a626ga,11,2018-12-14,Feeling genuinely proud of myself for the first time in a long time,KoffeeKoala21,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/a626ga/feeling_genuinely_proud_of_myself_for_the_first/,"To preface I’m shy by nature, I don’t command a presence and it takes me a bit to get close to people and comfortable enough to show my true self. I think of myself as a wallflower. When people give me compliments, I mentally cant accept them because I’m so hard on myself and don’t think I deserve any praise for whatever I do no matter how amazing may be. However, today I finally feel like I can be genuinely proud of myself for what I have accomplished so far.

For my program in college, we’re required to complete an internship pertaining to the major. I had been scrambling and freaking out since the deadline to find an internship for my Spring and final semester was coming up, and I have been getting no after no from every internship I had applied and interviewed for. 

Prior to this I already had been struggling with stress and my anxiety taking over me and my anxiety attack’s we’re becoming more and more frequent. I had felt like an absolute failure and loser. 

However just a few days ago I had interviewed for an internship in the corporate office of one of the biggest and the best hospitality company out there. I felt really good about my interview but I also had the thought “they won’t pick me because who would?” But I did get picked. I got a call extending an offer of internship. 

I was absolutely over the moon. I almost cried of joy over the phone telling the recruiting manager I accept. I went to share the news with my finance professor (as the internship is with finance and accounting) and he reassured me that I had nothing to worry about and I shouldn’t be surprised. He always tells our class “we are better than we think” and it was one of those “ I told you so” moments in the best way possible. In class he also asked permission to share my “success story” with everyone and had me tans up so my peers can congratulate me. I know that sounds kind of lame, but honestly it made me feel like an amazing, successful human being for once in my life.

This isn’t one of those normal off my chest posts and sorry if I’m brag-rambling but today was an important point in my life. I want to remember this feeling so whenever I feel like I’m not enough, I can think back to this feeling and affirm myself that I am enough. 

I hope sharing this can help people who can relate to the constant anxiety of not feeling like you are enough, know that you are. In the words of my professor, “you are more than you think and are more than you know. Believe in yourself a little and it will take you far.”

What can I do?,pinkhooker,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/a627gl/roommate_threatened_to_hit_me_what_can_i_do/,"I’ll give a little back story so it makes more sense but just keep in mind that this evil wench is seriously psychotic and I can’t put up with it any longer. 

Here’s the short version. Let’s say her name is Kat. 

Kat is an intern from another country living in the US on a working visa. It expires in May, the same month our lease is due. 

My boyfriend and I, as well as Kat’s boyfriend, and our other 2 roommates, ALL smoke. Quite often, too. We’re college kids, it’s what we do to unwind instead of drinking, sue us. Kat absolutely cannot stand the smell but instead of speaking maturely about it and confronting us, she just yells at her boyfriend and slams doors and acts all passive aggressive. Annoying, but my boyfriend and I dealt with that for a few weeks straight. 

Fast forward to the last few days. My boyfriend is currently traveling in another country and Kat and her boyfriend took it upon themselves to rile me and attack me. I did exactly what Kat had very rudely demanded- I smoked on the balcony. I even had the door closed all the way, even though she smokes cigarettes on the balcony with the door WIDE open and the entire house reeks like cig butt for a good hour. I’m on break from a double at work as this is happening, so I’m only trying to smoke and relax between shifts. Kat starts yelling how it smells in the living room. Not my fault, I’m outside. She sees me on the balcony and yells up to me “Get a job you lowlife”. I responded that I was on a double right now and flipped her the bird after some back and forth. 

Now just this morning, I’m in the kitchen getting ready for work, and Kat’s boyfriend takes it upon himself to stand up for Kat and make himself look like an idiot. This initiated the entire argument that was to follow. Kat then began screaming profanities at me, saying “are you retarded?” and I tried my best to calmly explain to her that there is no reason for her to be yelling ALL THE TIME. Once she realized I wasn’t playing into her rudeness, she got furious. She stood up and aggressively got 2 inches from my face and started shouting how she’ll beat the sh** out of me. eventually Kat’s boyfriend started pulling her back and just yelling stop (he’s seriously the most useless person I’ve ever encountered. He lets this girl scream at him every single day over nothing and he just sits there and takes it.). At this point my body was so riddled with anger and fear i ran downstairs to vomit. I LITERALLY vomited because of how afraid I was of what just happened. 

By the way I have witnesses to all of this happening. Not only did she threaten to beat me up but she went as far as to belittle my character. She made fun of how I was poor and needed to ask my mom for money on occasions. She also claimed that “my family doesn’t want me for the holidays” and poking at me any way she possibly could. 

She is truly an evil individual. I don’t know what it’s like where she’s from, but if people are like that over there, i never want to visit. 

My boyfriend and I plan to sublet our room when he gets back from his trip, and basically say F you. I guess I’m wondering, can I take legal action against her? With evidence to her threatening bodily harm to me multiple times, can I have her working visa possibly rejected? Please help.

a62cix,4,2018-12-14,I (21 M) just broke up with my first ever serious girlfriend (21 F) and I don’t know what to do or how to handle it.,CScoTX,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a62cix/i_21_m_just_broke_up_with_my_first_ever_serious/,"Hey everyone, 

I created an account just for this. I have always been on reddit and been on this sub before but never made an account. I feel like this is a good honest community that could help me out here. 

So background, me and my girlfriend had been dating 9 months. I attend a university where I have 3 semesters left until graduation. She lives in my hometown about an hour and a half away. She was a server at a bar and worked another job at the mall. Now she works a 9-5 as a receptionist. We met one night when I was back in town at the bar she worked at and ended up hanging out, going on dates and, eventually started dating rather quickly. 
We maintained our relationship through weekend and holiday visits until the summer, where I had found an internship at home. We spent all summer together, going on a couple trips, and seeing each other at least everyday, if not staying the night together.  Sometimes it felt like too much, but we both wanted to spend as much time together before I had to go back to school. Summer ended and we never really had a serious conversation about us, she just helped me move back and we went back to our weekend visits. It was as the semester went on she wanted less and less to do the same things I was interested in like going out with friends or having a real social life, but I went along as I did not want her to come down to see me to be unhappy. 
About a month ago we got in our first serious challenge to our relationship, we both agreed to communicate with each other more, and be more honest about our feelings. I felt a change in our relationship after, but I wanted to get through finals and come home to work on things and be with her. Then she started being distant and short talking me. On the night before the first of my 4 finals she told me she felt like we were drifting, I told her I felt the same. We both told each other the ways we felt, and I felt like the problems were coming from he distance and circumstances that ultimately were out of control due to our places in life. 

I needed to get back to my finals and focus on studying because they were crucial to my grades and passing or not. I asked for time to get through finals and talk after, but she wanted answers immediately about rather or not we were dating or what was going on. This put me under immense stress. I told her I needed a break from everything. After finals I realized I had stopped prioritizing my school and everything came second to her. I am content with breaking things off to focus on my school, as I also have a job this summer that will take me even further away from her.

Now though, it’s been days since my finals have ended, I’m back home and I just can’t find the words to say, I’ve told her I need a break. She told me she doesn’t want a break, but she’s  tried breaking things off with me during finals once before, and brought things on me during other important tests or things. I feel like it was not healthy. I just don’t know how to handle things with her now or what to say. She texted me drunk tonight and I’m worried she will do something dumb. I have things of hers I need to give back too. This is my first break up and I feel so lost and empty, even though I feel a split is right. 
Sorry this is so long, I have anxiety and this is really doing a number on me. Any advice would be helpful on how to move on from this state.

Is there any possibility that I could get an internship during sophomore year. I tried applying to several places but end up being rejected by most of them, some of them got back to me and gave me phone calls but that was all it...

I would really appreciate any help."

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years. We're both still in college. Most of the time we see eachother 1 or 2 times a week. 
Next year, my boyfriends is doing an internship, but the thing is there's only 1 company in our country where he could work. This means there's a big chance he's going to do his internship in another country. He also doesn't want to work where we are living, and wants to move countries after he graduates next year.

When he graduates, i still need to go to school for another 2 years. This means i'm not going to be able to go with him. What I could do is get my degree here and go live with him, but i have no idea if I will find a job there. 
I don't think I could do 2 and a half years of long distance. I already miss him when I don't see him for a few days.

Does this mean that a long distance relationship will not work out for the both of us? I don't want to take his dreams away from him but I also don't to make myself unhappy by moving to a country where I can't even find a job i'll enjoy.

And, if we decide to go for a long distance relationship, are there things we can do to make it  as easy as possible? 
Tips would be very appreciated :) 

Thanks! "

This week I have an interview for a Summer 2019 IT business analyst internship.

I live in Michigan, am I am going to grad school in Florida next semester. I took my car in for an inspection before I drive to my parents' (TN) for Christmas and then school (FL)...and to my chagrin they said it needs $1200 worth of work for it to be road-trip ready. I was expecting maybe $200 in little things, so I am $1000 short almost on the dot.  

**Update from last request** Some Redditors told me to get a second opinion and I did, and the absolute necessities will actually run about $1000, leaving me $800 shy. I did get a PM offering me a loan on my last post, but that was the last I heard from them.  :(

I have a &gt;$5,000 student loan refund coming that I can use to pay for the repairs, but my hitch is that the refund doesn't hit my bank account until 1/16. I have a paid internship waiting for me at school, so I don't need the loan refund for much besides books and emergencies. So I'm not ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"". It's really just a time-shift, I won't be digging myself any holes.

My Reddit account is well-established and inextricably linked to my business. I get 99% of my sales by posting on r/frugalmalefashion, so there's social and economic accountability...not being able to post there would cost me about $3k /month!  I use my PayPal for the business as well so it is a well established, verified account.

I can verify the loan refund amount from my school, can provide the written estimate from the shop, and anything else that might be necessary. I know this is a lot of money, I am open to changing the payback amount if it needs to be higher.

**Can pay $250 interest on 1/1 and the balance on 1/16...or all at once on 1/16.**

If you're even considering this, thank you!!!"

“The outlook wasn't brilliant for City Hall that day;
the scoreboard was malfunctioning with homicides climbing by the day.
And then when HQ2 went to New York so Google did the same, 
and then Apple said no thanks and instead chose Austin, to spite the Philly game

A straggling few moved on to Delco, The rest
clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
they thought, if only Kenney could do what he ran on –
they'd put up even money, now, with Kenney at the bat

Nutter preceded Kenney, as did also John F Street,
and the former lives in Manhattan now, and the latter (I think) works at Pat’s King of Steaks,
so upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
for there seemed but little chance of Kenney getting off the mat.

Nutter brought in the Pope to the wonderment of all,
and millennials even started moving in, things weren’t so bad after all!
and when the dust had lifted, and people saw what had occurred,
Philly was on an upswing and Love Park no longer smelled like a turd.

Then from multitudes of throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
it rumbled through the Wissahickon, it rattled in the Del;
it knocked upon the ‘Linc and recoiled among Temple Owl,
for the Eagles – yes the Eagles – had won the Super Bowl

There was ease in Kenney’s manner as he stepped into his place;

There was pride in Kenney’s bearing and a smile upon his fat face.

And when, responding to the cheers, he pretended to be urban,

And said “these terrorists aren’t Islamic will you now please pass the bourbon?”

Ten thousand eyes were on him as he tried to grease the wheels;
he took on the failing schools and soda which put the taxpayers back on their heels;
Then while Larry Krasner ground prosecutions to a drip,
A man carrying an AK-47 shot a Cambodian immigrant in the hip.

And now Air Force One came hurtling through the air,
but Kenney did a dance and said “we’re a sanctuary city so I don’t care.”
On Broad street the Dirt-bike and wheely kids went through red lights and sped —
""Who cares?” asked Jim Kenney, ""I think the Mayor’s drunk” A City Hall intern said.

From the SEPTA buses stinking with vomit there went up a muffled roar,
as the beating of random straphangers made multitudes flee to the Jersey Shore.
""He stole my parking space” shouted someone on the witness stand;
And with Provident Mutual another $40m gone with a stroke of the Mayor’s hand

But then from out of the darkness great Gritty’s orange hair finally shone;
Gritty stilled the rising tumult; and bade the peeps “let’s get fucking stoned!” 
Kenney signaled to the bartender, and once more heckles flew -
“shouldn’t you be at City Hall?” but Kenney ignored them and said ""Gimme a shot times two""

""Go back to work!"" cried the maddened thousands, while others screamed “Kenney’s a fraud;”
but one orange smile from Gritty and the audience was awed.
They saw his googley eyes wobble, they saw his hips swoon,
and they knew that Kenney would sober up and get back to work real soon.

But now the sneer is gone from Kenney’s lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;
he pounds his fist with cruel violence upon the bar because his wawa IPA is late;
The bartender holds the glass, then “accidentally” lets it go,
And now the air is shattered by the force of Kenney’s blow.

Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
the 76ers are playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,
and somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
but there is no joy in Philly — Mayor Kenney has blacked out.”"

He lied to me about it and then finally confessed, and then for a month afterwards he was telling me he loved me, wanted to work things out, the other girl was nothing and a nonissue, etc. Those were all lies and he had been with her at the same  time. He tried blaming me, mocking me, gaslighting me, everything. When I found out he’d been pursuing her the whole time I ended things. He made my life hell and told me to stop publicly talking about what he did. I got harassing anonymous messages on Instagram about it and people I thought were mutual friends iced me out.

He ended up dating the girl officially right after it all ended, and within a month they were engaged. They specifically chose to get married on the exact day she hit on him and they made out all night while I waited at home for him, the day the cheating went from emotional to physical. 

Since then, it’s been insanely hard to recover. I unexpectedly met someone new, and it’s been really hard at times trying to healthily navigate it because of everything I dealt with. I’ve been in therapy, I have good days and bad days. I’ve suffered from clinical depression and anxiety for decades and this has made me take monumental steps back in my progress. 

What kills me though is that it just seems like my ex is winning. He got his pick of the girl he wanted. They’re engaged now, with a wedding completely paid for by their parents. People couldn’t be happier for them. He got away with his reputation. He got his dream job right after he graduated, partly based off of the insane amount of help I gave him in school and making his resume. 

I’ve completely cut him and everything related to him out of my life but between random people, his friends, and living in a small town with a ton of people, I still get reminders. I know I’m probably thinking irrationally and I’m having a bad day, but are there any good strategies or ways to move forward healthily?

a66rmf,8,2018-12-14,New found love of trains Part 2,ThrobbingHood069,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/a66rmf/new_found_love_of_trains_part_2/,"After my encounter on the train, life descended back to the boring, crushing experience of the daily commute to Boston. There has to be more to life than just work, travel and sleep, I thought. I was young and in need of a girlfriend. However as I was at the bottom of the earnings ladder of the company, the thought of one of the personal assistants were way off. Only those with six figure salaries need apply was the general opinion of the interns!

So there I was day dreaming about one of the hot personal assistants when the train came into the station. Like a lemming on autopilot, I stepped off the train only to miss my footing and collapse straight on to my ass. Like an idiot I hobbled to work, only for the manager to take one look at my leg and tell me to ""Go to the hospital as it looks broken,"" and to ""stop bleeding on the floor"". Nice guy!

Off I went; as everyone is aware things do not progress in a fast way at the Hospital, I was eventually seen and x-rayed. Luckily it was not broken but sprained. As it was now lunch time I called the office only to be told by my boss, 
 ""You had better take the rest of the day off because by the time you get back to the office the day will be finished"".

Great; I had the afternoon off but had sprained my ankle. Might as well head home, I thought. So I managed to catch the next train out. I took a seat near the toilets just in case. Hobbling down a moving train was not going to be easy if I needed to go.

After about twenty minutes I heard a woman crying softly. It sounded like it was behind me. I looked over the chair and there she was, the woman from the other morning. As we had kind of been introduced, I said, ""Hi, are you all right?""

She looked up and I swear I was about to lose my head when she realised it was me. ""Oh, it's you. I'm fine,"" she said, ""What are you doing on the train so early?""

I told her about the sprained ankle and how it happened and she started to laugh. Funny how one person's misfortune can make others happy. Anyway she got out of her cramped seat and came and sat opposite. We chatted a bit about this and that and I found out why she was crying. 

She had gone in to the city to meet her husband and had a fight with him. He did not want to take her to lunch as he was busy. What an idiot, I thought. Instead I said, ""If you had turned up looking for lunch with me I'd have cleared my day.""

She smiled, the tears stopped and we continued chatting.

I slowly became aware that because of the rocking of the train her overcoat was sliding away from her legs to reveal the tops of what I swear were stockings. I tried hard not to make it obvious that I was looking. However, she realised I was becoming distracted and asked, ""Is anything wrong?""

Like an idiot I said, ""No, your legs are fantastic,"" then blushed when I realised how cheesy that sounded.

""They ought to be,"" she said. ""Do you have any idea how much hard work it takes in a boring gym to achieve this look?""

""No,"" I replied, ""but it's worked,"" I said. I was getting more confident a this stage.

""I wish my husband thought the same, I was going to surprise him in his office,"" she said with a grin.

""What was the surprise?"" I asked.

""Me,"" she said and opened her coat.

My mouth went dry. Underneath her overcoat she only had on her bra, panties, stockings and suspenders. My cock nearly jumped out of my pants. She said, ""I think you really do like what I'm wearing,"" as she stared at my trouser tent.

""Only a fool would not like what's under the coat and it's only putting icing on a cake anyway,"" I replied.

She got this look on her face and said, ""Well, fair is fair, I've had your young cock in my hand, where else shall we put it?""

Was I going to get to fuck this mature bombshell? I thought. She was a walking wet dream. To aid the reader she was about five foot six inches tall, with a curvy but toned body, flat stomach and fantastic long dark hair. 

""I know it's seedy,"" she said, ""but come with me.""

She helped me up and into the toilet where she locked the door and took off her coat. ""Let's have a proper look then,"" she said as she unzipped my trousers. She took my cock out and just held it like she was considering her next move and boy was it a winner.

She bent forward and just slowly sucked my cock into her mouth. It was the best feeling I'd ever had. Sure, some of the girls at college gave a good blow job but this was on a different planet. She knelt in front of me and just seemed to slowly move her mouth up and down my cock, running her tongue over my helmet and balls. I could not hold on long and said, ""I'm going to cum.""

She just sucked my cock deeper until my balls were against her chin. That was the final move and I sprayed the back of her throat. Even then she did not let my cock go and swallowed it all with my cock still in her mouth. She was a gifted lady. 

Being young I got hard again. I'm not sure looking back if I even went soft! Slowly she let me out and laughed. ""My friends have said I should get a toyboy because of the obvious benefit,"" she said staring at my still hard cock, which was now showing off, standing upright and pointing at the ceiling. ""Want to be an old lady's play thing?"" she asked.

Stupid question, I thought but all I could do was nod.

""We can do all the other stuff later,"" she said, ""what I need now is a nice, big, young cock inside me!""

With that she took off her panties, sat me on the toilet and lowered her pussy over my cock. This lady felt wonderful;, my cock was was being slowly fed into a hot, wet, tight pussy and then she started to fuck me. She rode me up and down with her head back sitting on the toilet. I was having my brains fucked out and I loved it.

Soon enough I could not hold off any longer and told her, ""I'm going to cum!""

""Do it, do it in me. I don't care,"" she said.

I seemed to cum again and again and could feel her muscles clamping around my cock. ""I needed that and god does it fell good to be lusted after by a young man,"" she said as she got off. ""My god, look at all your cum, it's running down my leg."" She laughed.

As she was putting her coat on and tidying her self up, she turned around, looked at me and said, ""Serious time, I'm married with kids and a husband, no one can know about this. Can you deal with that?""

Even if I couldn't I wasn't going to say no, so, ""Yes,"" I said.

""Good answer,"" she said. 

We returned to our seats and continued chatting while she kept teasing me with flashes of her stocking tops and panties. Before we got off I gave her my number and she discreetly gave my now-hard-again cock another squeeze and laughed. ""My god, my friends were right,"" she said.

She left the station ahead of me and jumped into a taxi.

It took me a minute before I realised I still did not know her name!"

I actually posted a few years ago using the same throw away account but deleted everything out of fear someone might figure out who I was.

My life got complicated a few years back when I came into some serious money. At the time I was worried about staying faithful to my wife because of the added temptation being rich was presenting me.

Turns out I shouldn't have bothered. Find out 3 months later that she's been sleeping with a friend of ours for over a year.

So I get divorced and decide to just fuck around as much as possible. Having sex for me and who gives a fuck how she feels or what she gets out of it provided she's willing sort of thing.

Yes, I was kind of angry at women in general... still am admittedly when I think about my wife too much.

So I fuck around and I'll admit it's fun. And I get to explore a lot of my fantasies that I honestly wouldn't have guessed I'd ever get a chance to fulfill.

But even that gets sort of boring after awhile and constantly being with new women is actually sort of mentally exhausting.

It's around that time I bump into someone at a wedding who used to work for me and who had a bit of crush on me at the time. She was an intern at the time and way too young for me and I was smart enough to know that was a terrible idea so nothing ever came of it despite her dropping some hints.

But this time around she's not an employee and I'm single so WTF? She's clearly still interested and I'm in my asshole stage still.

So we start a FWB sort of thing and it's pretty one sided. I basically call her up when I want to fuck and she shows up all dolled up and we have some fun. The sex is rough and violent and degrading most of time. I've found I really enjoy pushing a woman to her limits and a bit past as long as she's willing and this girl is willing.

At first I'm questioning what she's even getting out of it because the sex and everything about the relationship feels pretty one sided but she seems to really enjoy it and she keeps coming back for more so who am I to complain?

In most ways it's been great... except that this is the first sort of long term relation I've had since my divorce and I'm starting to catch real feelings for this girl. And that presents some problems.

For one thing she's young. Way younger than I am. Like I could be her dad if I'd been more stupid in my early 20s. She's legal but a lot younger than me.

I feel like I'd be cheating her out of something almost if we were to actually date.

Like WTF is she going to think a few more years down the line when she starts wanting kids or shit like that and I'm very past that.

And speaking of kids I've got a 16 year old daughter. I don't see her as often as I'd like but how do I explain to her that I'm dating a woman only a few years older than she is?

And to make it even worse, I've occasionally started to feel a bit of guilt about the sex itself. In the moment I'm not conflicted at all but after I cum I think about how badly I've just treated her and I feel like maybe it's wrong.

I realize this is more of an /r/relationships sort of thing but I actually tried them once and they don't deal well with non vanilla sexual relationships and no one was really interested in giving me any actual advice.

I guess I'm just looking for some advice. Do I just ask her if she'd like to actually date (I'm pretty sure her answer would be yes) and to hell with the consequences? I just enjoy the ride while it lasts and when it all goes to hell because she's in a different place in her life I say goodbye as amicably as possible?

Or do I cut her off now and get the pain over with immediately? I'm not even sure how she'd take this. Like I said I'm pretty sure the feelings are mutual and I don't want to hurt her emotionally that way either.

Having gone through a divorce like I'm still a little raw emotionally from it and I'm sensitive to that.

And with the sex, I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance from other submissive women that I shouldn't feel guilty about what I do to with her as long as she's willing and continue to claim she enjoys it.

I realizing I'm like dumping my feelings and history out here but this isn't the sort of thing I feel comfortable talking about to people I actually know.

So TLDR:

I'm in a BDSM flavored FWB relationship with a much younger woman who I think I might be in love with. I'm pretty sure the feelings are mutual but I'm feeling conflicted about the age difference the style of sex we have.

\---

Not sure how many people will actually follow up on this. But I spent the weekend hanging out with her and we had a great time.

Took her out to dinner and treated her like a normal girlfriend and used that as an opportunity to introduce the idea of actually dating.

We did some serious talking and decided we're we're both on the same page and both interested in seeing where that ends up going. So I hadn't misread her interest in something more.

We're taking it slow at first and not planing on announcing it or anything to family and friends.

Figure it's better to make sure we're actually good in a relationship before we go through the trouble of explaining why we're in a relationship with such a big age difference and so forth.  And as mentioned before not relishing explaining it to my daughter when/if it comes to that.

Also spent the time talking about the relationship dynamics a bit since I'd started to worry about consent and we've established a safe word and talked about what we've done already and it turns out we've sexually very in sync.

Which isn't really a surprise to me I guess given that she hadn't ever complained and still came back from more all these times but it was nice to really talk more and confirm that I wasn't just imposing my will and desires on her but that she was enjoying our sexual dynamic as much as I was.

Anyway, that's all. Just wanted to follow up and thank everyone for their thoughts and advice. It was genuinely helpful, especially to hear from some women about it."

The silence came suddenly. You'd expect an anourmous mechanism like this to slowly wind down, but instead every gear screeched to a halt at the same time once the crystal in the lowest chamber was smashed. The darkness that descended upon the dungeon when the glowing coming from the walls ceased was a more expected outcome and everyone lit their prepared light sources. And now, on a much more familiar ground, in the dark, with torch in hand, it was finally time to tally the loot.

a67klx,1,2018-12-14,F4F - White Wannabe Cuckquean,dppsexygirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a67klx/f4f_white_wannabe_cuckquean/," Title basically covers it, haha.

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"
a67ye4,3,2018-12-14,I Never Learned Math Past Algebra,whatsinabox,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/a67ye4/i_never_learned_math_past_algebra/,"Hello, friends. So over the last few weeks or so, I've been mulling over the titular thought of my post, and quite honestly, I feel worthless, uneducated, and stupid.

My math skills (save for geometry, I think?) started to deteriorate somewhere during late elementary school but didn't completely fall apart until I started taking Pre-Algebra (so around 6th-7th grade). Due to my weakness in math, I began to fall apart academically and was placed in Algebra 1E until I finished the course in my sophomore year of high school. Throughout the duration of that period, I attended summer school twice.

My weakness in Algebra also affected my ability to perform well in the hard sciences; I needed extra assistance with high school Biology and attended summer school for Chemistry. I never got the opportunity to learn Physics.

Throughout middle and high school, I was apathetic towards my studies. I couldn't relate to any of the other students there, so I did the only thing an insecure child would do -- I created a facade that celebrated slacking off instead of studying. To this day, I wonder, had I known the people I do now back then, would have I ended up in the predicament I am in?

I kept this persona up throughout high school until I begun to snap out of it during my final years of high school. By that point, I had discovered what I was good at: writing and history. I almost took AP US History in high school (the primary reason I didn't take the course was that I failed to turn assignments in on time for the standard history courses) and enjoyed the readings (particular medieval literature -- although Old and Middle English can be a bitch to read most of the time). I started to hone my focus in these areas in order to prepare myself for college.

As for my mathematical skills, I took Real World and Applied Mathematics after I finished Algebra. I never had the opportunity to take Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calc, and Calculus. I somehow managed to get into community college with my shoddy GPA and class rank, so I was able to evade the dreaded SATS and ACTS. Nonetheless, I had to take a math placement exam. I somehow managed to get a reasonable score and only had to take College Algebra, the only math requirement necessary for my major (History). I failed the course the first time I took the class in my first semester of college. I retook it my sophomore year when I decided to take the subject more seriously. With the help of a tutor and an instructor who allowed open book examinations (except for the last one which I failed), I was able to learn Algebra. Somewhat. The way in which I solved algebraic equations all boiled down to visuals; I would look at a problem I had already done, figured out the similarities between the new and the old problem and plugged in the numbers.

I was able to survive community college and eventually transferred to a four-year school. But now, as a senior on the cusp of graduating, I feel undeserving of everything that I've achieved, if you can even call it that. Sure, I made it through high school and college, but those are normative accomplishments. Besides, in celebrating these accomplishments we are devaluing those who may have dropped out of high school or college for one reason or another. Sure, I write for a few online magazines but I wish I could be doing more work or internships than being bogged by classes and a major that I now hate.

What does this all have to do with math? Well, it was only recently that I learned that it was normative for students to continue their math education after algebra -- even for those who were abysmal at it. Yet for some reason, I guess I wasn't intelligent enough to grasp Geometry, Trig, Calc, or whatever. Had I known this would trouble me so much later in life, then maybe I would've tried harder when I was still an HS student.

Right now, I feel like I don't deserve to be alive. I'm fully aware that I'm depressed, but I'm just so hung up on this one tidbit from my past. I'm stewing in regret, and I feel inferior and nowhere near as intelligent as the people around me. I feel so uneducated and stupid, that it's even impacted my ability to focus on my readings and articulate my words in a conversation. Almost like *I don't* deserve these abilities because I am *that* stupid. It makes me want to jump into a pool of lava.

It doesn't help that I have two overachieving younger siblings, who seemingly excel at every subject they put their minds into. That and they don't like to be humble with their accomplishments, so being at home can be triggering more often than not. I'm insanely jealous of both of them, almost to the point that I resent and loathe them because they make me hate myself more than I already do. That and I wonder what the hell went wrong with me to make me the failure that I am.

As for my friends, I love and appreciate them, but even when I explain the situation to them, there's a bit of a disconnect. Mainly because most of them are hard workers, unlike me. That and they learned math beyond Algebra (as they should), so I feel like they don't understand how fucking gross I feel being in my own skin. They don't understand the extent of just how stupid I feel in comparison to them, that I feel like dying every other second of my life, knowingly being tortured by my own brain. Even right now, my GPA is utter trash, and, thanks to my aforementioned brain fog, takes me hours to read the required readings for my class, leaving me frustrated and bored whenever I break open the books. All in all, there isn't a day where I don't feel like shutting down altogether or break down crying.

It's also made me wonder why the hell I'm still alive. I've known more deserving people who have died young, yet I'm still here. I'm not particularly spiritual or anything, but the thought has been tugging at my mind a lot lately.

Even after I graduate, I'm unsure as to what I want to do with my life. I've thought about returning to community college to figure things out (and get them right this time), perhaps with a minor in a math-based subject, but I don't know. I just need to get through today.

Thank you for reading."

My anger and jealously practically rolling off my body. I want to be her. I want to be the one on your arm. The one who gets to be openly affectionate. 

I finish off my glass of champagne and sit it down dramatically on the table. I’ve lost count on how many glasses that makes now but I’m definitely a little drunk. I let out a slight huff and I look up to see you give me a *cut it out* look. 

It all stared several years ago when I started out as an intern for your company and worked my way up. Now I’m the VP of Marketing and I’ve single handedly double your profits over the last two years. Helping you rebuild your company. Being the person that was able to put your vision to work. 

Naturally, we’ve spent a lot of time together. Our chemistry undeniable. Like magnets until we finally gave in 4 months ago. Since then we’ve spent a lot of late nights in the office with me bent over your desk, blowing you in the parking garage, and sneaking to my apartment for long lunches. We can’t get enough of one another and I want you so badly right now. 

Tonight is we’re celebrating with a huge Christmas party for employees and investors. You initially told me she wasn’t going to here tonight. I’m pissed but I still only want you. 

Our time together is rushed and secret but our chemistry is real. I think tonight I’m finally realizing that I want more than sex. 

I huff again and get up from the table. I’m being unprofessional and I know it. I practically stomp over to the bar and get a refill. "
a68ggm,25,2018-12-14,A fellow coworker is a terrible tech,xmonkey13,medlabprofessionals,https://www.reddit.com/r/medlabprofessionals/comments/a68ggm/a_fellow_coworker_is_a_terrible_tech/,"I went to school with this guy who I will refer to as LF for little fucker. We both became med techs at the same time, went and did our internship together, sat beside him in lab during our last year of classes and work with him. This LF thinks he knows everything, won't take advice or listen to MLT who have been there long than him/knows more. 

This LF has made so many mistakes as a student, as an intern and as a worker. I'm just wondering at what point will he get fired or wonder how many times he has to mess up before he really hurts someone.

I had my gallbladder removed and there were complications that happen and ended up getting pancreatitis. My lipase got to be&gt;1200 but by the time I got discharged it was down to 176. My first follow up appt with my doc they rechecked labs cmp and lipase. My cmp was completely normal but my lipase increased from my discharged results. Those results were drawn on a Monday. Following Thursday my doc wanted to check my lipase again along with a hepatic function this time instead of a cmp. Well Thursday rolls around got it drawn at 3 in the main labs clinic when I got off from work. Very anxious to see if my lipase was still increasing. Well 630 rolls around and finally get my hepatic function result but not my lipase. We are in the process of getting new instruments in chemistry and thought maybe for some reason they cannot perform lipase as it was down. So being I work in that lab I call and talk to the chemistry person LF and asked if lipase was down I'm very anxious to see my results. This was 8 in the evening. He told me he cancelled it as a duplicate.. in my mind I'm like wtf no reason it should've been cancelled. He then tells me the sample he got was labeled with cmp and lipase, so he duplicated out my other lipase. Instantly knew he had fucked up and used my Mondays sample for my hepatic function. I told him he needs to look into that a bit closer because that was the wrong sample he processed. I texted my manager who is in charge of that department telling him how LF cancelled my test, reported my hepatic function results under the wrong sample, and cancelled my other tests without looking into anything at all. If he went into my chart he would've realized the mess up and should've gotten my Thursdays sample not Mondays. My manager said he'll call the lab and get it taken care of and should have the right results within a half hour. Which I got a result correction on my hepatic function and lipase back everything checks out. Then the LF had the balls to call me and act like it was no big deal, he got it fixed for me don't worry about. Then continues on saying how the mess up happened. He said my tests were on his over due list and had someone go find my sample and they brought him Mondays sample. He tells me he didn't even bother to look at the collection time or date on that sample, assumed it was an add on and just went ahead and cancelled the lipase. Also worth mentioning that my director, manager have been sending emails out damn near weekly not to cancel labs without talking to the provider office or to do some investigating first before cancelling. Which he neglected to do. It would've been clear if he just looked into my chart to see the different dates or even looking at the sample itself before processing it and cancelling my lipase! This LF also knows I'm not a big fan of him because he's a cocky COCKY person. When he was done saying what he had to saying I told him I was pissed off, I'm talking to our lab director right away in the morning, how many emails do they need to send out on exactly this, I'm done talking then I hung up. Next day I did have a meeting with my lab director, the manager who I spoke to the night before and told them what had happened and how he stated he didn't even bother looking at the sample collection time which would've taken a sec and the minute of looking into my chart and investigating. Just pure laziness and lack of care. I don't know what they did or if he just got written up but he's still working there. I also told them how he was a terrible student, terrible intern and seen him mess up so much! Patient care went down the drain.. makes me wonder how many other results has he reported out that weren't the right result. 

So my question to other fellow lab people, do you think this is acceptable on keeping him on staff? Patient care wasn't he's priority and it's not the first time he's fucked up. Makes me even more pissed because I know he's terrible at this job and doesn't pay attention to detail which is so important in the lab. "

I'm just quite because I don't want to be creepy. I'm sure you're just dressed professionally right? I do try to catch a glimpse and not just stare. I mean I have my own job to attend to.

Do you even know how badly you torture me every day? Do you know that I'm a virgin and does that change things? Is it intentional the way you lean against my desk cross-legged like that?

So if you're one of the women or a fellow admirer I'd love to talk.

a6am8m,13,2018-12-14,[22F4M] Quiet Jewish Girls Always Have The Best Tits,Loungette,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a6am8m/22f4m_quiet_jewish_girls_always_have_the_best_tits/,"Now some of you may be wondering: just where the hell did that stereotype come from? Isn't that sorta weird and out of left field? Since when were Jewish girls stereotyped for anything other than big noses and obsessive grandmothers?

Well when you have a sample size of precisely one subject, outcomes are much easier to reach.

For this particular hypothesis, the subject in question was Kate Kleinberg, the nose of whom was actually quite diminutive and wonderfully complicated the remainder of her adorably girlish, mousy face that ensured she'd get carded for alcohol until she was at least forty. Her hair set a similar tone, falling across her shoulders and forehead in bouncy brown strands that would tickle at the tips of her eyelashes just above that set of bright blue eyes whenever she tilted her head down.

She did that a lot, by the way - tipping her head down. If there was one thing Kate had become intimately familiar with over the years then it would certainly be the view of her shoes. More famed for their loud and boisterous New Yorkian relatives on the 'State side of things, Kate herself was more of the silent sort - oh, sure, she was friendly enough once you got to know her, but that in itself was the hardest part. Coincidentally, considering the adjective used to describe her face shape, she was well-known amongst her peers back in high school for squeaking whenever she got embarrassed, which was pretty often. Less often now, in her early 20's, but it was still easy enough to spook her if you tried.

Adorable.

Yes, ""cute"" would probably be the first adjective that would enter the brains of most people she met with the shuffling and the squeaking and the overall aesthetic of such a meek young girl, but it would be lying to say that a number of other choice descriptors hadn't been tossed her way following her post-pubescent years.

For all her shyness, Kate was the farthest thing from an idiot one might imagine - naive and hilariously impressionable, sure, but not an idiot. Aside from the whole ""squeaking"" thing, her most famed moment in high school might've been her uncharacteristically emphatic reaction to receiving a B+ on her Chemistry midterm and, for as much difficulty as she had with looking other people in the face, strangely she seemed to infect many she spoke to with that exact same problem. Every shirt has cleavage when you've got a chest her size, and all those tight-fitting turtlenecks ever did was just showcase it even better! She distinctly remembered going red in the face for the better portion of an hour upon hearing one of her classmates use the phrase ""painted on"" in reference to such a sweater hugging at her bosoms, and had taken to only visiting the gym later at night after realizing just how much attention she was drawing whenever she used the treadmill.

---

So, what plans do I have tonight for the Jewish girl with the big ol' tiddies and atrocious social skills? Well, I'm sure you can at least get a *close* guess, considering the subreddit, but this prompt is ultimately pretty open-ended!

Obviously I'm looking for something factoring in her shy nature, but past that I'm fully open to ideas! I'll list out a couple of possible scenarios below, but keep in mind that they're hardly restrictive!

- Kate's been dragged along for some sort of road trip for either a class, work, or some other reason we come up with and ends up bonding with her trip-mate. Road-head is the ultimate form of bonding.
- Kate ends up getting dragged to her worst nightmare - a party - by one of her more extroverted friends. Since she's not much of a party animal she ends up awake after it starts puttering out and is surprised to have unintentionally drawn some attention. Maybe she gets pushed into joining a couple others in the hot tub, maybe she gets pulled into a game that turns out to have stripping involved, maybe she just gets chatted up by a cute guy that's hanging around.
- Kate's older co-workers at her internship takes an interest in her.
- Being shy and geeky, Kate is inevitably drawn to gaming groups, whether computer-based or classical pen and paper. Of course, a bunch of similarly introverted nerdy guys might not know how to behave themselves around such a good-looking girl.
-Kate is brought to an amateur photoshoot where she is continually talked out of more and more clothes.
- The classic study buddies sort of setup.

And so on! You get the idea, I hope. A lot of the above scenarios are written to be very purposefully flexible on how many male characters are involved and I would *love* if any of my potential partners would be willing to play multiple male characters, but that's completely an optional thing! I'll similarly offer to add in another girl just to slightly even things out, but no more than that and only if there are at least two guys! What can I say? I'm picky and a shy girl getting spitroasted is, like, *super* hot.

Some other kinks and general stuff that I'd like included:

 - Cumplay, the only thing that's pretty much a requirement. Spunk on me. Cum quick, cum a lot, cum on my clothes, cum in my food, just get a lot of splooge in a lot of places, y'know?
- Semi-public, which is basically just as close to public as you can get without getting arrested. Sure, she's shy, but I also mentioned she's *super* impressionable, right?
- Casual stuff. Grabbing her butt or stuffing your dick in her face un-announced, having her blow you while she studies for an upcoming exam, that sort of thing. Could happen before or after the proverbial ice is broken depending on how ""coercive"" you want these scenes to be.
- Casual group, which is basically just, you know, casual stuff but in a group setting! This can apply to people playing multiple characters or only one. For multiple characters obviously double+ teaming, blowbangs, and stuff like that would be loved along with Kate getting passed around a small group of friends or coworkers. In a scenario where you're only playing one, though, they can look but they don't have to touch. Maybe you like showing off to your buddies by having your new girlfriend blow you on the couch while you're all hanging out and chatting.
- Chubby guys! I love chubby guys. And any other sort of generally conventionally unattractive sort of dudes - something about the contrast makes me go crazy.

Again, none of those are required, just some stuff I like including! I don't do impreg, hard gore, bathroom stuff, or bestiality, but *most* other things are on the table, so be sure to ask if you want a kink included! Want to cum on the shy Jewish girl's feet? Then gosh golly, cum all over 'em!

Send me a message if you're interested! I only write in third person, but if you're only playing a single character and want to write in first person, we can work something out."

&gt; Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a Daily Beast story quoting Graham saying that he is fine with &amp;quot;Lying about sex,&amp;quot; writing, &amp;quot;Didn&amp;#039;t he impeach over the same thing?&amp;quot;.

&gt; ADVERTISEMENT.During 1999 impeachment proceedings for former President Bill Clinton, Graham said, &amp;quot;You don&amp;#039;t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic. If this body determines that your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your role.""

&gt; &amp;quot;Sen. Graham himself established a standard that demands Trump&amp;#039;s impeachment,&amp;quot; she wrote.

&gt; Ocasio-Cortez&amp;#039;s comments came in response to an appearance by Graham on Fox News Friday, in which the senator defended Trump, claiming that the president is &amp;quot;Always under siege.""

&gt; Graham dismissed allegations that Trump ordered his onetime lawyer Michael Cohen to make hush money payments to two women claiming to have had affairs with Trump in order to buy their silence in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election.

&gt; Graham later compared Trump to former President Bill Clinton, who was impeached after he was found to have lied about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

I was telling him how my best friend growing up was a Mumbaikar, and how I used to love the desserts his family would give to me during Diwali. So today, he brought in a prepackaged rasmalai for me.

The rasmalai still seemed pretty frozen, so I didn't think to ask him if he had started defrosting it the night before. I put it in the fridge at work and... left it at work at the end of they day. I won't be able to get the rasmalai until Monday either way because our building stays locked on weekends. It still may have another day or so of defrosting, and I think it is air-sealed, so will it hold through Monday?"

a6bl8p,1,2018-12-14,I’m a full-time graduate student and a full time engineer. I was let go today. What now?,Marenoc,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a6bl8p/im_a_fulltime_graduate_student_and_a_full_time/,"So the title says most of everything.

I work for a small time company (max 20 employees) and especially with a bachelors in Electrical Engineering was the most experienced engineer there. Been employed for 2 years and about 3 months ago they hired someone with no experience or knowledge (I work in the Electrical field) to be “my superior/ the team lead.” I honestly have no idea why they hired him, but more later.

I only have 1 on-campus class and  was able to work in the office for about 35 hours a week during school semesters. Today, I was called into a meeting a told another engineer was hired as full-time employee and so they were “eliminating my position.” I asked for letters of recommendation and if there was a severance available. I was told They would be happy to provide recommendations and I would be getting my normal paychecks up until today as well as my personal and annual bonuses. I left it at that and went my own way.

Now with my wife being a teacher, and me having little to no savings because school and high rate of loving, I am afraid that I cannot afford rent for long into the next school senester even with my extremely tight budgeting skills. I have weekly paycheck distributed to bills, rent, food, gas, etc to the sent. 

**What should I do now? I am willing to answer most questions**

More backstory:

I, plus a few other employees, were utterly shocked by me being let go. I was 100% the most knowledgable and experienced engineer at the company (besides the ceo/boss). I have trained several interns, other engineers who eventually left the company, and even was able to manage the responsibility of the office receptionist and the entire workload of the engineering office for over 4 months at one point.  I was also extremely underpaid for an engineer at $16/yr.

My worries:

-I feel as though they hired this new person to gain my knowledge so they could let me go. Kind of boils my blood if they have been planning this.

-I also feel like I may have been fired since immediately before and after my meeting, employees were pulled into the office and scolded about their performance. Although they did not bring up my performance, nor said the word “fired” in the process of me being let go. (Again “eliminating your position” was the exact wording) My worry is that they will dispute any unemployment claim if they claim I was fired.

-My wife and I are also trying to buy a house with our lease ending in April. What are the steps here?"

I have given the follwing explanantion. Should I send this through or does this sound unreasonable ?

I am not what my low undergraduate GPA may suggest. Early in college, I spent a lot of time in trying to find my interests by participating in various technical competitions and co founding a startup with reasonable success (my CV has more details). This was further expounded by the course structure which had an emphasis on electronics/hardware based subjects which I did not enjoy and little on artificial intelligence related subjects. I tried to further my knowledge of these in the form of relevant internships, MOOCS and self projects which cumulatively had a detrimental effect on my GPA in spite of helping shape my interests. However, the same will not be a problem at CMU given my ability to take on and complete challenging technical tasks at a high level and the course structure being highly related to my interests and future goals.

a6ceo6,6,2018-12-14,I feel like a failure at life.,WhiteFarila,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/a6ceo6/i_feel_like_a_failure_at_life/,"I'm sorry if this post seems like whining,.

If something can go wrong it will go wrong for me. I'm 18, and nothing ever works out for me. I work really hard on things, and I just watch them crumble.

I just recently got rejected from my dream college that I worked really hard to get into. It's not even hard to get in - it has like a 90% acceptance rate, and I'm a good student. I should have gotten in  if you go by statistics. I thought that this would be the one thing that worked out for me , but apparently not. I thought it would be a given that I would get in. Another person with my GPA, grade trend, and SAT scores would have gotten in easily, but I didn't because I'm me. That's the only reason I got rejected - because I'm me.  I centered this university in all of my college plans, and now they are all shattered. I'm heartbroken. I have other college offers, but they don't have good graduation rates, are too expensive, or are too far away from my family.   I expected it, honestly, but I guess I had this false hope that this would be the one thing that would actually work for me. 

I worked really hard to get an internship that I wanted last year, but didn't get it even though only five other girls applied, and I had a really strong application. I've been trying to get a job or internship at animal shelters around me, but it hasn't yielded anything so far.  I tried out for soccer, but I didn't make the team. There are multiple little things that I've applied for (ex: school leadership positions) and larger things, but they never work out for me.

I've been trying to talk to guys, and ask them out. Every time I get ignored or rejected.

I've also been trying to make new friends, but that isn't working well for me either. 

Nothing works for me. I mean absolutely nothing. I can't think of one good thing that I have achieved from my efforts. 

I just feel like I work so hard and nothing ever comes out of it. I'm a loser even though I put in all of my best efforts. I could be a loser if I just stayed at home and did nothing instead of exhausting myself socially, mentally, and physically. I' been optimistic for so long and I don't think I can be anymore. The university rejecting me has really hit me hard, and made me reflect on all of my experiences. I'm constantly putting out so much effort, and working so hard at everything, but nothing ever comes from it. I skipped three days of school this week because I have no idea what I'm going to do next Fall, and just want to curl up and cry. I feel like a failure. I feel like I'll never achieve anything, and that I was meant to be a joke for other people to laugh at. I don't want to do anything anymore. 

There are things that upset me that I can't control either. But it really upsets me that the things I can change, and work on don't work out either. It's like the universe wants me to be unhappy, or that I'm cursed. I have so many goals in life, and it hurts thinking that they'll probably never happen if things keep going the way they have been. I feel hopeless. I'm a failure. I'm an only child, and it hurts me knowing my parents have only a child like me to be ""proud"" of.  I feel stuck.

Has anyone else ever had this problem? Did anything ever change?"

a6dc3p,5,2018-12-15,I moved back to my nparents' house because I couldn't fight back,saki1196,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a6dc3p/i_moved_back_to_my_nparents_house_because_i/,"Caveat : long story. And given my terrible mental state, the story may be mixed up, jumping from one thing to another. Apologies for that.  

Yesterday, I moved back to my nparents' house. I finished my internship on the 10th and with no plan or mental stability, I couldn't fight back against my mom's wish for me to move back in. During my internship period, I lived with my aunt and met new people and had a breakthrough to deal with my mental illness. 

Of course, I told my mom, because as much as she is an enabler to my ndad, I know she cares. She pressured me to come back home. From the looks of her, she was confused, guilty and in denial. I was too tired mentally to fight, so I agreed. Explaining to her that I went to therapy and need to continue it because of their narcissistic parenting, turned out to be a bad idea when my mom started guilt-tripping me with ""why I suddenly changed because I was her ""bubbly"" and was so bright in character"" (paraphrased) and other things. 

Coming back home, I see my dog has put on weight. The story was my parents went on a 3 day trip somewhere and left my dog at the local vet/pet hotel, with instructions to give 3 servings of food to her daily. After that, she ballooned so much, she couldnt stand up. And their excuse was ""the hotel gave canned dog food. Goes to show how unhealthy it is"". I left my dog perfectly healthy, and this happens when I am gone. They said she lost weight and is back to being ""healthy"", which is how she is when I come home. I am at a lost for words and cannot bear to see my dog like that. 

Upon returning ""home"", I moved my stuff to my old room and began unpacking. The room smelt dusty, like it wasnt in use for a long time, which is true. There were no bed sheets on my bed, and floor had a thin layer of dust. My mom helped make my bed, but that is where it ended. I didnt know why she wanted to help when her right hand is temporarily out of commission from a surgery anyway. I opened my windows, swept my room and checked the water pressure in my bathroom. As always, no hot water there, because my parents just could never find someone to fix the problem. I lit up a scented candle for the whole night because it smelt so musty I couldnt stand it. 

I also checked to see if my stuff was were I left them, because whenever I come back home for semester break, at least 1 item of mine is missing. Well, something did went missing : my swimsuit, though I dont know if that is my fault because I forgot where I put it, or my mom moved it somewhere and she doesnt remember it. 

The whole night after that, I locked myself in my room, reading manga. Trying not to panic. Trying not to let the demons consume me. But my whole being was rejecting being in this house. There is nothing for me here. And yet here I am. I can only blame myself for not fighting to stay with my aunt, where I do have support to work on my mental health and build a life for myself. 

The moment my head hit the pillow, I immediately cried. For leaving progress. For leaving my friends. For leaving support. For coming back to this empty shell of a house that has and never would support me. For not fighting harder for my happiness.  My heart ached like a thousand needles mercilessly jabbing into my heart. The tears didnt last long, and I fell into slumber with the aid of music and a lighter heart. 

I woke up, feeling less panicky, stressed and hopeless. I couldnt get out of bed. I wanted to escape into sleep, and thought of suicide many times. Nothing was stopping me, except for the things I left behind to come to this hellhole.I am alone here, with a town filled with people and family that has continuously hurt me to feel better about themselves. I hate my town. Because all there is here are bad memories.  But then, I figured that I did leave the house once. I can do it again. And this time, there are people who will support me however they can. 

And hence, I decided to get out of here, for good. Making that decision is so scary, because I am truly on my own here. I havent done anyting to make that decision tangible, and honestly, am too scared to do so as well. I know my parents would not support me. I rather think they will try to control the situation by deciding where I am going to move and such. 

With a goal in mind, I now have to fight an inner turmoil, between fear of failure and the chance of success. And honestly, I dont know if I can win this. "
a6dt7v,62,2018-12-15,Gratitude post,Sonic_99,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/a6dt7v/gratitude_post/,"Hi, I'm a computer science undergrad student and I just got my semester results. I wanted to write a thank you post with the things I did differently this semester and this seemed to be the best place for it.   
So what's different this semester? This semester, I got a summer internship for 2019 with my dream company and achieved a CGPA of 9+ (out of 10) and I have r/GetStudying as one of the communities to thank for. Following are the techniques that I discovered across blogs (&amp; personal experience) and made it so far:

  
1. First things first. **THE WILL TO ACT**: I hope you guys are familiar with this dialogue from Batman Begins

&gt;The training is nothing, will is everything. The will to act.

You must know your goal, know what would it cost you and prepare to pay that cost - be it less social interaction or less time on social media. There is always a trade-off involved and any number of tips in the world won't help if you are not willing to act. I know because I have been there.

2. **Attendance in lectures matters**: When you attend classes, you have already gone over the material once. And it does not matter if the professor is shitty. If he/she is good, then no issues; if bad then just listen as he/she reads out the slides or whatever. Once in the class, make a point to sit in the initial rows. This will do two things - force you to pay attention most of the time and, you'll be less hesitant to ask doubts(I'm a bit shy when it comes to asking, hence this helped). Make a point to clear all the doubts in the lecture itself and note them down. This will help while revising and will give you a head start in the week before exam. 

3. **Textbooks**: Read them actively, engage with what the writer is saying. How to do this? Always have a pencil while reading book and write commentaries in the margin as if you are reviewing the book. Write down little puns, references, analogies, derivation, extra information you came across online- anything that helps you remain engaged. Reading textbook passively is as good as not reading it. What if the reading material is large? Then break it down into topics and NOT the number of pages. I cannot emphasise the importance of doing this. This has helped me go through hundreds of pages in days without burning out. You can even schedule topics across days if you feel like it. 

4. **Rituals and journaling**: Make up small rituals that you would follow. I personally had morning, evening and study rituals. They consist of 3 tasks, atleast, that help you slowly get into your tasks and stick to your schedule. Study rituals can be like checking if you have the material, water for the Pomodorro session etc. This will help reduce friction and get you into working atmosphere. Now about journaling. It is super underrated. Benefits include uncluttered mind and the best, you now have logs of everyday of the semester and hence better decision success rate. 

5. **Give yourself a break**: Be it Pomodorro breaks or weekend off, breaks are important for productivity and are a must. Also please, please, please, sleep properly. Saying that you pulled an all-nighter might look cool but it is stupid in the long run for your body. And if you can, 20 minute afternoon naps work like a charm! Respect your body.

6. **Kowalski, Analysis!** This is the GTD method. Have weekly, monthly audits where you look over what happened in past week/month and plan the next one accordingly. This also goes for exams. Look for previous years' papers and semester papers, quizzes etc. They'll give you ideas of what kind of question the professor asks and you can prepare accordingly. What do I mean by this? If he/she asks theory more see what kind of theory is asked - concepts, derivations, definition etc. If numericals then skim over theory and practice as much as you can. See if the subject requires focussed time or mix-and-match with other subjects. 

7. **After the exam**: Solve the paper(after the exams. This is called upsolving and is heavily recommended in competitive programming) and go to the class where the professor solves it. It was hard for me and still is but just go there and see what can be improved. Maybe the answer you wrote was different but correct and you can inform that to the professor. Also go to see your answer sheets. That will give you an idea of what to take care of next time AND report an error in correction! 

8. **Extras**: Try minimalism, don't overload your brain. Have 3 tasks per day that you are going to accomplish - no more no less. Exercise if you can. Express gratitude at the end of the day even if nothing went right. And best of all - meditate. Headspace is the app I would recommend and it doesn't cost much if you want to buy it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all I could think of right now. If anything else comes to my mind or I find relevant links or videos, I'll edit the post. Also, if you guys have anything to add or have any questions, please feel free to do so in the comments or you can message me- whatever is comfortable to you. Thank you for your time and all the best for your future :)

a6e6zs,1,2018-12-15,Feeling really lost,throwawaylundrani,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/a6e6zs/feeling_really_lost/,"So I’ve been a heavy weed smoker since about the last 3 years. I had quit for about a month the summer before grad school and somehow ended up smoking now and again that semester. (Fall 2017). Then I had a breakup out of nowhere in January 2018 and I ended up falling back into the patterns of heavy weed smoking. I had a busy semester so it was mostly when I had breaks for long stretches of days. I was able to quit in the summer for a few weeks but every now and again someone would offer and I’d fall back into it for a bit. 

The worst was this semester as I’ve realized I pushed a lot of people away since I was focusing on getting high and being high more than a lot of things as I had re-entered food service and made friends with stoners.

I made it almost 4 days last week and I felt great but then ended up smoking everyday until today. 

I’m done with finals and I have a semester of internships and I really need advice in helping to stop this. 

I journal. I meditate sometimes. I go to yoga when I can (1x a week), I used to go the gym and still have that as a coping mechanisms.
I have adult coloring books and candles.

I have identified that I need to do something different when cravings arise. But I have this crushing loneliness that I think I allowed to fester within me after my breakup and I wanna runaway and smoke - any advice in coping would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you for reading. "

I have had several experiences working as a freelance developer the past few months where I have successfully designed webpages by Elementor, making them fully functional and responsive, and I am finding it a struggle to adapt and use WPBakery to design this simple landing page.

To all you out there that maybe were in the same position, what do you think if I design this responsive page by using Elementor instead of WPBakery and then advise the team's web developer that I have used a different page builder?

I thought that it would not be that ideal since this is like a university exam, you work with what you are given but if I gain the same results by using a different way, would I be defying the purpose of the test? However, I will be more comfortable and in my working atmosphere since I have trained a lot using this Elementor as a page builder.

Any opinions from you are greatly appreciated since I am feeling really stressed out and I really would like this opportunity.

Have a good day all. :)"

a6gu7l,0,2018-12-15,"Wie kann es sein, dass sich eine Falschinformation über die FPÖ derart lange am Leben hält (CETA war nie eine Koalitionsbedingung)?",WowILikeSyriansNow,Austria,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/a6gu7l/wie_kann_es_sein_dass_sich_eine_falschinformation/,"Lese diese Behauptung heute schon wieder, und zwar in diesem ansonsten recht guten Artikel: https://derstandard.at/2000093952627/Worueber-Sie-sich-nach-einem-Jahr-Tuerkis-Blau-freuen-oder

Quelle dafür ist ein Österreich-Bericht, der heute nicht mehr auffindbar ist. Konkret zu Koalitionsbedingungen gefragt sagte Strache damals kurz vor den NRW, dass es der Innenminister wäre &amp; der Aussenminister als Forderung.

Ansonsten ist man ja auch immer sehr kritisch mit Behauptungen vom Boulevard. Aber wenn es gegen die FPÖ geht, wird nie mehr hinterfragt - stattdessen die Behauptung ad nauseam wiederholt, sodass es bald keiner mehr wagt zu hinterfragen.

Koalitionsbedingung wird ja intern zunächst einmal ausgemacht. Das wird nicht en passant einfach mal so hinausposaunt, schon gar nicht auf einer nicht-öffentlichen Feier (so war's laut Österreich-Bericht, wenn ich mich richtig erinnere). Noch dazu einmal und nie wieder. Völlig unrealistisch und dann noch ein Österreich-Journalist. Das kann man doch nur glauben, wenn man es wirklich will.

Und selbst wenn es so gewesen wäre: Die einzigen Personen, vor denen die FPÖ umgefallen wäre, wären die auf der privaten Feier anwesenden Wähler, denn als Koalitionsbedingung hat die FPÖ eine Volksabstimmung zu keinem Zeitpunkt öffentlich verkündet.

Was mich nur wundert ist, dass a) keiner Strache dazu mal an anderer Stelle befragt hat und b) Strache selbst in diesem Bezug seine Stimme nie erhob.

a6gw17,4,2018-12-15,[L][M][24] Going through what I think is a rough patch in my relationship with my SO[F][23]. Desperately looking for a voice...,bumblebee_throwaway1,KindVoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/a6gw17/lm24_going_through_what_i_think_is_a_rough_patch/,"Hi, 

I don't normally reach out like this. I've been with my SO for 4 years where we've had on/off bits. She's an amazing woman and is very strong willed, and to be candid I do think she doesn't manage her worries/anxiety well (will get to this later). We met in college and just hit it off. We've both grown into more mature adults and have built so much with each other that it's never taboo to talk about our long future together. We've also had our growing pains associated with said growth (e.g. I would always get anxious about her 'going out' but I'm over that... which I think that 'hump' for guys is quite normal when you haven't matured yet and haven't trusted someone fully but like I said, past that). The growing pain was also what introduced the 'on/off' bit I mentioned where she said she needed a break and wasn't sure that I wasn't the one. She felt suffocated and stuck like her destiny was 'pre-determined' and wasn't ready for that. Also, we're from different backgrounds/religions... so she has a real anxiety about having an inter-faith relationship (but neither of us are devoutly religious and I don't feel the same anxiety about different religions) But we've since patched (that was early on in the relationship like year 2). 

From that point I felt like we really connected more and matured. Still, there's always a spectrum of ebbs and flows but our arguments were never toxic or yelling/screaming etc. Just thoughtful conversations about working through our emotions. We're also no stranger to long distance and we grew stronger when I spent 6 months on the West coast for an internship (we're east coast). It was very tough for me during that time because I spent everyday feeling like she resented me for going. She was worried that I would find someone else (irrational anxiety) that wasn't managed well because she kept getting 'mad' at me for no reason via text. 

From there we both graduated college. She is an aspiring dentist and I helped her through the tough time of deciding when to take the dental admissions test. She decided to wait a year (gap year) to take the test. I don't mean to attack her just being honest, because of that major stressor she hasn't been the most pleasant person always (ebbs and flows ya know). During this time we were separated across the state because we were both getting on our feet. Again, because long distance wasn't a strain we had no issues besides dental school pressures.

Earlier this year I managed to move across the state and get a job close to her and her family. It's been a very tough year for me because I went from light financial responsibility to full financial responsibility. and adjusting to a new job isn't easy... So I admit I haven't been the best version of myself always. All the while she studied and took her dental test and passed with great results but her anxiety switched to hoping she'd be granted admission to school. We've both had a great deal of anxiety/weight on our shoulders...

On my birthday 2 weeks ago she was notified that she was accepted to dental school and is going to a dental school close to where we are and I am so proud of her and have communicated that as much as I could. 

Unfortunately during that week, her step grandfather passed away. So, for someone who doesn't always control her anxiety, the roller coaster of emotions has really impacted her... And back to the religious bit, I was present for the viewing and funeral and fully supported her and her family (to which I'm seen as another family member now and I love them). However after the funeral, she just flipped like a switch. She has barely communicated this week and initially I knew it was to give her space and I respect that and didn't intrude at all. 

But my anxiety bubbled up to an intolerable amount. Something told me things weren't right. I was frozen yesterday. I use the gym to help and I couldn't even lift the bar... then she asked me to pick her up last night from a work event (like boss takes employees out for a xmas dinner/drinks) and she was, very distant. It felt like she was forcing herself to be near me. 

This morning, she had asked me to drop her off with her aunt/uncle to go shopping. On the way, we talked. I don't remember how the conversation started but I was trying to hold her hand while I drove and I could tell she wasn't reciprocating how she normally does. I ended up saying something along the lines of ""i know things have been very tough for you and I want to be there for you anyway I can. I know you've asked for space."" I don't remember what she replied because my anxiety was bubbling up to which I basically asked ""are you questioning our relationship?"" and she started crying and nodded. 

The reason I gave so much context above is because I wanted to illustrate how complex we are and how deeply we love each other. Also because she's the kind of person that when there's an anxiety/event (i.e. passing of her step grandfather) everything becomes clouded in that anxiety and she enters a ""impending doom"" mode. And I know it isn't just the grief she's feeling.. she feels the weight of responsibility to be there for her family in their grief. She helps so much and sometimes to her detriment... 

&amp;#x200B;

So I did my best to try to stand for myself and our relationship. I truly think that her mind is skewed with grief (understandably. I'm stating that as a matter of fact) but I think that with her anxieties she enters a defense mode. and that defense mode (based on this past week and last night/today) has been directed towards me. She's processing a lot right now and is thinking about her future... add grief into that mix and you have someone who's 'unstable with anxiety.' I believe that our relationship is strong and I tried communicating to her that all relationships have highs and lows and this may be a low. But you don't just 'get' a happy relationship 24/7. You work through things. And I expressed my concern that her anxiety towards our relationship is being skewed by the grief and other anxieties.... I don't know how receptive she was to that. 

I admit, I also called her mother (we are close like that and it isn't really awkward that I called her) to express myself and ask for advice. She resonated with the paragraph above and attested that my SO's processing of anxiety/grief isn't the best right now because she has a lot to think about.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry I wrote a lot. I hope someone reads this. I feel very alone since I've moved to the other side of the state where my family is on the other. And although my SO's anxieties may just be skewed like I mentioned... it doesn't deter my fears. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to process this sudden change myself but my true hope, naive or not, is that she can think clearly...

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to sound desperate, but I really hope someone reads this...

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,

W"
a6gyc7,3,2018-12-15,Christmas wishes for a 2 year old,Hey_oheather,SantasLittleHelpers,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantasLittleHelpers/comments/a6gyc7/christmas_wishes_for_a_2_year_old/,"Hello there! I’m very new to this whole thing so please excuse me if this isn’t correct, just let me know and I’ll make whatever changes needed.

I’m requesting a little Christmas help, and appreciate that this is even an opportunity. I’ll start by telling you about us. I am a proud single mama of a silly and loving two year old boy. We’ve been on our own just over one year now, and my oh my I’ve made some major life improvements in this last year. 
My son is my number one, and I want to provide for him so so badly. Because of that, I’ve decided that this next few years need to be hard for us in order for me to provide for his future. So, by day I am a full time student, I take 5 classes currently and have straight A’s (semester ends Tuesday so hopefully I’ll keep those A’s 😂), I also am an unpaid intern for 20 hours a week at a small nonprofit (part of my degree). Nights I bartend and serve. I am doing all I can to get by for the next bit until I graduate and can get a better job. But, until then, we’re scraping by. And honestly I’m cool with that. We’re struggling now but in a few years it will be a different story. It will be worth it. We’re blessed to have all that we do. We have a roof over our heads, food in our bellies, a car, each other, and my family lives about an hour away and are extremely supportive and loving. 

I thought I would be okay not providing a Christmas this year. I keep telling myself that my son doesn’t know any better, so he has no idea what he’s missing out on. I keep thinking that Christmas morning won’t be hard because he doesn’t know. But I know. And I feel absolutely terrible. So here I am asking for help; I would be so so grateful and thankful if come December 25th my son gets to experience Christmas. Any bit of Christmas. 

I took the admins advice and trimmed his wish list. I’ll explain the items. My son doesn’t talk like he is supposed to at his age, he is involved in a state program with a speech therapist to try and improve his speech, so I put on his list some books. The books are all things he’s interested in, from trains to curious George. We love to read, and it’s supposed to help his development so we do it often. He may have some sensory development issues as well, he’s about to start occupational therapy as well. That’s why I put the sensory bottle on his list, the sensory bottle is supposed to help calm him when he’s overwhelmed.  The weighted blanket is for the same reason, to help him sleep and when he’s overwhelmed or having issues in public. The hot wheel track is because he is obsessed with cars. That’s one of the maybe 7 words he actually says, “car-car”. He LOVES cars. He also loves animals, so I added an animal puzzle. The clothing items are more or less because kids grow so fast, and it’s hard to keep up with. 
While I have hopes that someone will read this and want to help, I am not expecting anything, I am extremely grateful that Santa’s little helpers is even a thing, and that there are so many good hearted people out there. 
Thank you for reading this, and thank you to everyone who is involved in any way with Santa’s Little Helpers!

a6h3lw,1,2018-12-15,I'm just so lost,ApatheticEngie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a6h3lw/im_just_so_lost/,"Self diagnosis: I'm a self-aware, often anti-social, borderline narcissist and perfectionist (aka asshole) that struggles with anxiety and depression.

I don't know what to do any more. That's the cyclic theme of my life. This is a scattered brained shout out at crowd-sourcing/speeding up my next useless session with a therapist that's ""[i'm] really popular so unfortunately you have to schedule next month and half out and 3 at a time every 2 weeks."" I actually liked the last guy, but he up and suddenly switched to groups only. 

I'm 30 years old. I have no goals, no real drive, no meaningful relationships, and my good friends are all scattered across other states being normal people with normal lives. I have over $30k in CC+student loan debt. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering that I currently wish I didn't. I barely work part-time not in my field to cover my minimums after blowing all my savings and living at home for the last two years. I've never had to work for anything in my life, not in the handed life on a silver spoon rich manner, but in the ""i'm so smart"" sense that I could and did literally sleep (zzz) through a Private College Prep School and a top 25 Engineering school, that my barely middle-class parents worked hard for me to attend because ""you're too smart not to"". But it wasn't until HS that I realized I was a sheltered child. Until 16+, my schedule was loaded and set. 630 rise, door by 7, school 730-330, sports until 630+, home/dinner by 8, homework (routinely checked) til bed. Saturdays almost always were travel sports, and Sundays were church. I really only lived for the sports, but soccer/swimming aren't big money makers and eventually would fall off in exchange for education. I love football, but wasn't allowed to play. All my friends were sports related and I had no real concept of individualism/future or alcohol/drugs till I was 18/Senior HS and told to pick a career. At 16 I had probably the biggest fight I've had with my mom, when I told her there was no God and I was an agnostic/atheist and would no longer attend church. This was huge because my extended family is pretty close and fairly religious. But only my Mom's side. My dad is exactly likely me. And it took me WAY too long to figure out that the combination of my Mom and Dad's personality had fucked me. My mom is a scheduling, overbearing, possessive....teacher (sorry automod). That's biased obviously (she's actually nice), but if you ask me who is the most boring, predictable person I know. Its my mom. I'm honestly not sure if she has a concept of fun, because if so I've never seen her have it. Or if it is, its her blowing money at the spa or going on some vacation to the beach without my dad. Routinely we would go to the beach for weeks during the summer, and my dad never went (mainly he doesn't like the sand). I remember only a handful of trips out of a 100s that he went on. During HS my dad started referreeing to get out of the house more and help pay for my younger sister and I's schooling. The joke was if you were home, Mom would make you do something for her. Well it really wasn't a joke. 

My dad, like me, couldn't give a shit as long as I wasn't in trouble, the cops weren't calling, or mom wasn't yelling at him. He works, comes home, watches tv/soccer, gets yelled at for watching too much soccer, falls asleep snoring on the couch. That's literally been his life for the last 20 years. 

And I am literally the combination of them both. I got my mom's obsessive/meticulous nature in the form of perfectionism (which is reflected in her father as well), but yet my dad's high sense of general apathy and its nightmare combination. I love them both because they are family, but everything through HS just made me resent my mother. She just has to ask me something, and it irritates me. It was always seemingly about her, even when i know its because she was supporting me. College unsheltered me and relieved the tension because I was no longer around her. I grew into myself emotionally, ideologically, independantly and had an average experience. Socializing, friends, relationships, partying, internship, work, etc. Fortunately/unfortunately, I also found weed for my anxiety and been a basically daily toker for 10 years. Clinically they probably would call me a high-functioning self-medicating addict. Most people don't know/can't tell apart from my friends. Sometimes my friend's couldn't even tell. I'm not even sure my parents know but they must, yet never confronted me. I've definitely slipped grinding weed upstairs, and only my sister knew what the smell was at first when they got home, parents thought it was flowers (HA SO TRUE) and I just blamed it on the air freshner. I try to be discreet, stick to one-hitters outside or oil carts/vape. I don't smoke in the house, I'm not ripping a blunt stepping out the car and meeting people and or walking around with it my pocket smelling like weed all the time. I smoke to be normal and calm in social situations. It completely removes my anxiety and depression. Some people have a drink to relax, drinking just makes me a frat boy. I took almost all of my classes in college stoned. The only times I don't smoke are before/during work and playing competitive sports, because I want to be 100% mentally and don't want people to call me out over the stigmata/excuse that ""i'm high"" regardless of my beliefs and abilities while stoned. I recognize that sometimes weed can impair you depending on strain and strength of high, and its not easy to self-level discreetly for extended durations all the time (though it is easier with oil carts, but they're expensive). But I also recognize that I can do 95% of things in my life completely and obviously ripped out of my mind without a single meaningful impact on my abilities. I have no problem's quitting, other than the typical physiological symptoms like heightened irritabilty, anxiety, and temporary sleep distruption. I've quit many times, longest was 6 months and currently on a break thats pushing into week 3.

Everything was seemingly well, until after graduation and working, I realized I barely did any work at all on a given day. In fact for every hour or two I spent working, I spent 4 times that making sure other people didn't fuck up and/or doing their portion of work. I realized there was no point to working fast because there was nothing to gain from it. If I knocked my work out in half the time, that just means I got 100% more work, often other's people work. But If I did the work in the normal amount of time or refused other people's work, I was chastized for being slow, lazy, not a team player. It's a lose/lose. And because of my personality, I am NOT manager material. I'm not a smooth talker or negotiator. I'm stubborn, hot-headed, blunt and arrogant. I've wanted to be judged and paid on my skills and work ability, not my ability to kiss ass and socialize. If I think you can't pull your weight, I'll tell you. I have no qualms telling somebody off with blantant disregard for social, career consequences. If you never call someone out, their behavoir will never change. I never thought that an engineering career would entail more socializing and people management than actual work. 

This basically led to a spiral of depression, because I felt like I was doing nothing, was worth nothing, and my life was meaningless. It tore a rift with my 3+ year GF. I ended up quitting my job and moving states. I pulled out all my investments, blew it having fun, recovering, and finding a new job that was supposed to recover my investments, only to rage quit in an epic floor meeting with the company president and dept heads, and having to move home. If I had not moved and taken out my investments, I would have been over a half-millionaire. Yes, it was bitcoin. Yes I still made money, but no where near what I should have. I could have paid off both my student loans and my GFs insane amount of $200k+ student loans, and still had a nest egg. Now I just wallow in my nihilism and apathy, barely scraping by. 

When everything is seemingly accessible to you, nothing seems like a worthy career. Whatever drive that once said ""be a professional soccer player"" or ""be an engineer"" is gone. In its place is apathy. I don't have problems performing the actual work, just that nothing seems meaningful anymore for me to invest my time. 

I currently see a therapist. I've tried SSRI's. They made me feel the worst I've ever felt for two weeks+withdrawl and that I'll never go back. I REFUSE to go any sort of rehab, and have a general fear of being confined against my will, voluntary or not. In fact, I have a heavy disdain for therapists in general. I think they are significantly overpaid, and only really exist to keep people working and in line with current societal beliefs. If you're able to work, they don't care. They cash their $175/hour, short change you 10 minutes every session, and as long as you are not threatening anyone they send you on your way till 2-3 weeks later. But if they think you're a danger, suddenly they become worried, but its not because they care about you. It's because of mal-practice. If they really cared, they'd be paid the same as teachers, and do the job because they love it. No one solves shit in 50 minutes, they just talk in circles until you forget about what's wrong and you feel a little better. Then BAM what do you know, the hour is up.

I've taken various tests. Be a chef, be an entrenpaneur, be an engineer, be IT, be a programmer, be an athlete, be a chemist, be a builder, the list goes on because its not my aptitude that is the problem. I've been told I need a wife. I've been told I need a hobby. I've been told to meditate. I've been told that I really care to much, and I need to care less (and vis versa).

I know part of the problem stems from the fact that I also hate the daily life routine. You lose ~8 hours of every day on sleeping/prepping, you lose 9 at a job. You lose anywhere from .5-2 hours commuting, 1 hour for dinner, 1 hour of overhead/general wasted time, leaving 3-4 hours for personal time and responsibilities. So on a given perfect work day and zero responsibilties, you have less than 12-17% of the time to yourself. If we give weekends 12 hours of personal time, counting 8 for sleep and 4 for hygiene, meals, and general overhead, that gives us 23-26% of our weekly lives that is your own to do whatever you see fit with. In a world, where basic human needs are trivially covered and accessible, why do we spend so much time working just to maintain necessities? Collectively today, modern society is more about milking other people to better oneself than actual human advancement. We've been technologically and progressively stagnant since the 70s, and its been replaced with consumerism, homogeneity, and risk aversion. How am I supposed to be happy when 75% of life is predictable and almost predetermined? I feel like I'm playing a bad dating sim, just selecting A/B/C/D in the given scenario to get to the right ending, except I just bored and start mashing keys hoping something more interesting will happen. Which is why I love sports and competition so much, its controlled chaos that relies solely on various individual's ability and no two games are ever the same. 

In the end, I know I'm my own worst enemy. I'm the one who has to solve this problem. Its mine and mine alone. And Yet I have no idea how.

This is first relationship that went further than a month and it just ended out of the blue. It was 2.5 years and I'm currently at work on break crying because I'd usually spend my breaks texting her (if she were free). What makes it worse is she's been falling out of love since April and never gave me any indication of it until the last week. Every time we came across an issue, I would do my best to improve the situation, including the fight we had in April that caused all of this. It was about my ambition towards my own goals and she wanted me to apply to internships. I got a summer research position at my school just after that, and I worked to improve my grades in the next fall semester, and now, just before my last final exam, she tells me everything I did was ""too little too late.""

a6hd9r,14,2018-12-15,Why Computer Science at QC is pretty Good/How to Succeed Here,mouthOfTheGods,QueensCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/QueensCollege/comments/a6hd9r/why_computer_science_at_qc_is_pretty_goodhow_to/,"As someone who has taken the personal effort to see what Ivy league students are doing, we are all learning the same curriculum eventually and its about who is doing the extra to grow their technical skills. Our CS department teaches us the standard, or who knows I may just have been lucky.

The only issue students have is that they are either lazy or don't just know what to do or have a lack of guidance. CS field itself is very competitive and meritocratic. For you to succeed in CS, you must be a self learner and be a dedicated worker, like Obrenic says... Just do it!. The only difference between QC and a college like Stanford, is that Stanford  has  $25B in endowment that allow their freshmen to program electric pants....no kidding, but that does not mean they are the better software engineers. Many of their professors never even went to Ivy league colleges in fact.

In the end its about who a good programmer/software engineer/computer scientist and trust when I say I have met dumb students who go to Ivy schools. We've had so many students from QC who have gone to work at top companies, but in the end its them that did that for themselves. Yes, QC is a public institution, there is no denial that things could be shitty/ could be done better but its really up to you to turn the tables.

How to Succeed at QC: You have to think of here as a poor man's Harvard and do the work, nothing comes easy, ever! By your first year start applying for internships (point is to get you acclimated rather that getting an internship)  and Programs/ fellowships in top companies that help students grow their careers. By your first semester, go for every panel/meetup/hackathons/conferences you can find locally and out of state(provided they sponsor you), because this is where you expose yourself and learn more. By your second year, after doing all this, you must have been a better candidate who's been exposed and worked on some meaningful projects that are up on github... continue to apply for more and more internships!!! You also need a great resume! check peoples Linkedin and see what their resumes look like. Create yours in similar fashion whether your have experience or not...thats why you are doing for those panels and hackathons and conferences, to have them down!. It is also important to make sure your resume has skills directly/or at least somewhat related to the line of CS.

Also, the order of classes you take is important. Be sure that you take Data structures/Algorithms/Theory of computation by your third year, super important! Because recruiting season starts every fall for the next summer, try to see if you can take Algorithms latest by that fall. Do practices online, google interview questions that companies ask their interns... Practice more! keep going you will have a lot of rejections, but for each rejection you will be a better engineer/interviewee. By your third year, you must have gotten an internship, trust me. After your third year, focus less on having a great GPA, instead work on projects... Typically for your first 2 years, try averaging a 3.6. By your senior, 3.1 - 3.3 is fine no one cares at that point, what would speak for your is your experience. Note: Ideally this grade is for individuals not pursuing Academia...i.e PhD's

Also, by the time you have started getting rejections after doing things right, thats when you know your in the right track and all you need to be is more refined, welcome to the crew you'd definitely succeed in CS career...

a6hykp,1,2018-12-15,My [M][24] significant other [F][23] has experienced major life events within a week and is suddenly anxious about our future and I want to help clear her mind.,bumblebee_throwaway1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a6hykp/my_m24_significant_other_f23_has_experienced/," 

Hi. I'm sorry this is a long one. I just don't know how else to express myself.

I don't  normally reach out like this. I've been with my SO for 4 years where  we've had on/off bits. She's an amazing woman and is very strong willed,  and to be candid I do think she doesn't manage her worries/anxiety well  (will get to this later). We met in college and just hit it off. We've  both grown into more mature adults and have built so much with each  other that it's never taboo to talk about our long future together.  We've also had our growing pains associated with said growth (e.g. I  would always get anxious about her 'going out' but I'm over that...  which I think that 'hump' for guys is quite normal when you haven't  matured yet and haven't trusted someone fully but like I said, past  that). The growing pain was also what introduced the 'on/off' bit I  mentioned where she said she needed a break and wasn't sure that I  wasn't the one. She felt suffocated and stuck like her destiny was  'pre-determined' and wasn't ready for that. Also, we're from different  backgrounds/religions... so she has a real anxiety about having an  inter-faith relationship (but neither of us are devoutly religious and I  don't feel the same anxiety about different religions) But we've since  patched (that was early on in the relationship like year 2).

From  that point I felt like we really connected more and matured. Still,  there's always a spectrum of ebbs and flows but our arguments were never  toxic or yelling/screaming etc. Just thoughtful conversations about  working through our emotions. We're also no stranger to long distance  and we grew stronger when I spent 6 months on the West coast for an  internship (we're east coast). It was very tough for me during that time  because I spent everyday feeling like she resented me for going. She  was worried that I would find someone else (irrational anxiety) that  wasn't managed well because she kept getting 'mad' at me for no reason  via text.

From there we both graduated  college. She is an aspiring dentist and I helped her through the tough  time of deciding when to take the dental admissions test. She decided to  wait a year (gap year) to take the test. I don't mean to attack her  just being honest, because of that major stressor she hasn't been the  most pleasant person always (ebbs and flows ya know). During this time  we were separated across the state because we were both getting on our  feet. Again, because long distance wasn't a strain we had no issues  besides dental school pressures.

Earlier  this year I managed to move across the state and get a job close to her  and her family. It's been a very tough year for me because I went from  light financial responsibility to full financial responsibility. and  adjusting to a new job isn't easy... So I admit I haven't been the best  version of myself always. All the while she studied and took her dental  test and passed with great results but her anxiety switched to hoping  she'd be granted admission to school. We've both had a great deal of  anxiety/weight on our shoulders...

On my  birthday 2 weeks ago she was notified that she was accepted to dental  school and is going to a dental school close to where we are and I am so  proud of her and have communicated that as much as I could.

Unfortunately  during that week, her step grandfather passed away. So, for someone who  doesn't always control her anxiety, the roller coaster of emotions has  really impacted her... And back to the religious bit, I was present for  the viewing and funeral and fully supported her and her family (to which  I'm seen as another family member now and I love them). However after  the funeral, she just flipped like a switch. She has barely communicated  this week and initially I knew it was to give her space and I respect  that and didn't intrude at all.

But my  anxiety bubbled up to an intolerable amount. Something told me things  weren't right. I was frozen yesterday. I use the gym to help and I  couldn't even lift the bar... then she asked me to pick her up last  night from a work event (like boss takes employees out for a xmas  dinner/drinks) and she was, very distant. It felt like she was forcing  herself to be near me.

This morning, she  had asked me to drop her off with her aunt/uncle to go shopping. On the  way, we talked. I don't remember how the conversation started but I was  trying to hold her hand while I drove and I could tell she wasn't  reciprocating how she normally does. I ended up saying something along  the lines of ""i know things have been very tough for you and I want to  be there for you anyway I can. I know you've asked for space."" I don't  remember what she replied because my anxiety was bubbling up to which I  basically asked ""are you questioning our relationship?"" and she started  crying and nodded.

The reason I gave so  much context above is because I wanted to illustrate how complex we are  and how deeply we love each other. Also because she's the kind of person  that when there's an anxiety/event (i.e. passing of her step  grandfather) everything becomes clouded in that anxiety and she enters a  ""impending doom"" mode. And I know it isn't just the grief she's feeling.. she feels the weight of responsibility to be there for her  family in their grief. She helps so much and sometimes to her detriment... I'm not excusing her behavior. But not everyone is perfect. Neither am I.

So  I did my best to try to stand for myself and our relationship. I truly  think that her mind is skewed with grief (understandably. I'm stating  that as a matter of fact) but I think that with her anxieties she enters  a defense mode. and that defense mode (based on this past week and last  night/today) has been directed towards me. She's processing a lot right  now and is thinking about her future... add grief into that mix and you  have someone who's 'unstable with anxiety.' I believe that our  relationship is strong and I tried communicating to her that all  relationships have highs and lows and this may be a low. But you don't  just 'get' a happy relationship 24/7. You work through things. And I  expressed my concern that her anxiety towards our relationship is being  skewed by the grief and other anxieties.... I don't know how receptive  she was to that.

I admit, I also called  her mother (we are close like that and it isn't really awkward that I  called her) to express myself and ask for advice. She resonated with the  paragraph above and attested that my SO's processing of anxiety/grief  isn't the best right now because she has a lot to think about.

I'm  sorry I wrote a lot. I hope someone reads this. I feel very alone since  I've moved to the other side of the state where my family is on the  other. And although my SO's anxieties may just be skewed like I  mentioned... it doesn't deter my fears.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr: SO suddenly feels anxious about relationship after getting into dental school and the passing of her step-grandfather. I think her anxiety/grief is clouding her judgement and she thinks our relationship may be an issue. Trying to stand my ground and for me and her because I love her and myself and us... I don't think it's a dying cause. Any insight/advice appreciated.**"

a6ijie,4,2018-12-15,The day I almost joined wfg,arnamigamis,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/a6ijie/the_day_i_almost_joined_wfg/,"Recently I’ve become very intrigued by mlm’s and it reminded me of this story from a couple years ago. When I was 18 I moved away for university where I was to work towards my business degree. A family friend must have seen this as perfect preying grounds for his mlm and texted my mom and asked if I’d be interested in a part time job while I was in school that was in the same field as my degree. My mom passed on this info to me and of course I was excited about it. I got in touch with who I now understand was his upline and we scheduled an “interview” for later that week. I had never actually even had a job before at this point outside of my family’s business so I didn’t know what to expect. I showed up to a Starbucks on the day of the interview and it went for about half an hour and I was sold. I wasn’t so interested in the money aspect but I thought some actual experience in finance would be extremely valuable for getting internships and jobs upon graduation. She told me to show up to their office on a specific date and to not be overwhelmed by the other “employees” that were there for “training”. So after I left feeling very accomplished and excited that she’d liked me and been offered the job so easily. I told my friends and they were equally as excited and wanted to know if they could apply. But once I got home I realized something didn’t feel right and I questioned the whole thing which led me to do some research to discover it was actually an MLM and what that exactly meant because I hadn’t been exposed to much of that at that point in my life. I texted the lady and told her I was no longer interested as something came up but now, 2 years later I realize how disgusting and predatory that was and I still to this day wish I could have ripped that lady, and my family friend a new one. They attempted to take advantage of a young girl that didn’t know any better at the time and that just fuels my hatred towards these companies. "

Excluding scat, this includes whatever kinks you want to play. Want me to surprise you by pressing my face to your ass and taking a deep sniff? I'm there.

Personally my favourite way to start is with you as a bratty younger girl (probably early 20s) who I simply can't resist. Maybe you're my bosses daughter doing an internship in my department, or the neighbour girl flaunting your body by the pool, even my own daughter who I have to punish for whatever reason. Though I'm totally open to anything, just me know the age you're interested in, and whether you want to play dom or sub.

I'm more than happy with celebrity plots too if you have a famous ass you want to have played with, or I can offer plenty of references for non-celeb girls if you don't have a character in mind. As always, priority given to people willing to change their name and/or picture if we go with that, but not at all required.

**Potential babbling ahead - you have been warned.**

&amp;#x200B;

*I don't know why but writing this felt weird and I myself think feel a bit confused because re-thinking that was somewhat hard but thats on me I guess...*

&amp;#x200B;

We hit it off right away when we first met, we share so many interests and realized pretty fast that we had a lot in common. Our passion for gaming was a huge factor of starting all this off. We have been playing together every day since we met and since we live so far apart all communication is over TeamSpeak and Whatsapp or even Snapchat. The first weeks were kinda casual just gaming and enjoying the ""time we spend together"" but pretty soon we started really actively chatting via Whatsapp or sending stupid pictures over Snapchat. At the beginning it was mostly text but that changed rather quickly.

We spend one of our usual evenings together playing online and chatting away but we both had a few drinks so conversations were a bit more ""intimate"", we talked about preferences with sex, positions, kinks and what we both really enjoyed in bed. Stuff I usually don't talk about because I had some rather uncomfortable experiences, but that's a whole other story. I loved this day because she was the first person ever for me that I felt comfortable talking about my experiences be it good or bad ones. That night we sexted and boy was it hot, I am not sure how it started out but it soon became a story about us doing things I never in my life did before, besides the fact that I never sexted in my life before so this was new to me aswell. It was the best experience I ever had.

During our conversation about my bad experiences she told me that there was this guy she genuinely likes, they even made out once or twice and know each other for a long time. He has a girlfriend and yea he cheated on that gf with the girl I am talking about once. I never met him but I know from a friend of ours that he's some sort of scumbag but tbh a guy that is cheating on his gf is a bad person anyway imho.

After this day chats got really stuffed with Emojies, she was the first one to write me in the morning and we chatted all day, no matter what we were doing. *Sitenote: She is currently on an internship at a big media agency and works 9-5 being hella busy there and I am a student at univesity.* And we suddenly started to send us many pictures over Snapchat always of us, never just of things. Those Snaps could also contain a bit more skin than you'd usually see going as far as she showing herself before/after shower but never with her completely exposed.

So this went on for a few weeks and then I told her that I will be going to New Zealand early next year for a semester and she was the person that ""celebrated"" it the most ""for"" and with me. Later that day we talked about making christmas presents to each other and I told her that I thought about it aswell. I used my head and instantly came to conclusion that I would gift her Tights for her workout because I know she is working on herself really hard. Twist I needed her size, so I told her what I had in mind and she was so happy I was shocked. She told me she always thought about getting some aswell but never went throught with buying any so she happily gave me her measurements - which are amazing - and I bought a pair so I could send them to her. She keeps telling me it's the greatest gift someone made her on such a long time. She is still making a mystery about her present and it drives me nuts because she teases me so hard with it.

That night she mentioned to me that it'd be so awesome to meet before I leave for half a year.  Now this cracked something in me and I started thinking - *I am someone that keeps overthinking everything, this maybe being a reason why I am currently writing this* \- about all this and how the time with her and everything made me feel and it's kind of undescribeable ^(if that even is a word - lol). The day after that I asked her how she'd like it if I would visit her just after New Year and she was extremely excited about it, so I booked a ticket and now I am going to finally see her again and now I fear I am overthinking all this because it is a common problem of me.

I want to make a move when meeting her, I thought about asking if she'd want to go out with me for dinner or somthing but I am scared that I am going to ruin everything we have right now.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts reddit.

tl:dr - Met awesome girl, lives a good distance away, kept getting closer and closer, naked bodies were seen, sexting involved. Was invited to meet again at her place, booked tickets, seriously thinking about making a move. Overthinking?

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering how long it typically takes (from your experience/to the best of your knowledge) for MSFT to respond to applications for the Freshman/Sophomore Explore MSFT Internship program. 

I applied back in September/October for a plethora of internship programs, including the Explore MSFT Program, but have heard nothing yet. I even applied to an ML/AI role that I was extremely underqualified to test if I would receive a response back, and within a week I was sent an anticipated rejection email. 

I've read that spots fill up fast and they have had to push interview rounds back due to volume, but I would have expected something by now given that I applied right as (what I have been told is) the hiring season began. 

Also, since my applications, I have done a few projects and landed a local internship I will be at during the academic year, but I don't see any options to update my application to the program online. Is there a way to do it in particular? Or will I have to retract my initial application and apply again, 'resetting' my position in the queue of applicants?

Any insight is greatly appreciated!

Bill Clinton had a sexual affair with Gennifer Flowes for years while married to HRC. Bill Clinton had a sexual relationship with a young female intern and penetrated her with a cigar. The media portrayed his accusers and lovers as liars and opportunists.   


They even portrayed a 21 year old Monica Lewinsky as a seductress who lured Clinton into the affair by showing him the strings of her thong.   


Hillary Clinton, the great ""FEMINIST"" is a woman married to a man who has repeatedly cheated on her and raped women. The media adore her. Bill Clinton is still revered by the media. When he dies---which looks like sooner than Carter from his gaunt appearance---the media's adulation for him will dwarf the Bush 41 funeral. He'll be praised as an economic genius. No mention will be made of his rapist tendencies.   


Donald Trump very likely cheated on his Slovenian model wife with a porn star and a Playboy Centerfold. And he's a billionaire. I just sort of figured that's what the life of a billionaire was like. I suspect most ultra-wealthy men, especially those in high profile cities like NYC had mistresses, and their wives accepted that as part of being the wife of a billionaire. I'm not saying it's right, but I don't see Melania Trump wrapping herself in the cloak of feminism, either. No, Melania is raising her son and performing traditional FLOTUS duties---kids, charities, etc.   


President Trump is going to be portrayed as a vile pervert horndog by the media, but Clinton is beloved.

Hello Reddit, here is a kinda long post of my inaugural post. Warning, this is gonna be a long read. I'll try to break it up into sections. Obviously this is going be biased towards me because its my side of the story so just take that into account. I need any opinions or advice I can get. 

Background:
Kate, my girlfriend (20s F), and I (20s M) met in college at CalPoly and have been dating for a little over a 1 year and been a ""thing"" for about 1 and a half years. We both got similar interests and both studied in the same Major. 

The First Break Up:
This was exactly 6 months into dating. She was gone to a 5 month internship which was out of state so we had to do long distance for that time. We would facetime often and text all the time. I was still in school so my work load was packed. I would try to video chat with her on the weekends and talk to her when I could. I also helped her with the school assignments required that would allow her to get credit for interning. It started to feel like any freetime I had, I was spending helping her. Yes, it was good to stay in contact as often as I could but the issue was that anytime something came up (being a really busy semester) she would get upset at me. It became increasingly tough for me to juggle being a fulltime student, working, family, friends and the rest of life. I honestly disappeared off the map from my friend because I was so busy. It was just so stressful and just the stress of it all was getting to me. I started becoming really depressed because I felt like I was failing everything and just the added commitment of being in a relationship just felt overwhelming. I decided to break it off. How I did it was not the best. I kinda did it out of nowhere the night before our 6 months. It really broke her heart. We ended up getting back together that next week but the damage was done. My biggest issue was I really wasn't communicating what things were bothering me. I just got overwhelmed and gave up.  

Where I Am Now:
We've been together since, had rough and good patches. Here I'm just gonna spew out my throughts. 

Communication~
I've tried being more open to her but I just seems like the more I tell her about the things that bothers me the more adverse response I get like ""you are always complaining"". It just feels like there isn't actually any good dialogue about how to solve our issues and differences. I get that it seems like I'm constantly complaining but I'm trying to communicate so we can understand each other. When I try having a talk like that with her, she starts getting really distant and stops talking to me. It does hurt to be ignored but I do understand that it is her defense mechanism. I really want to get to a point where we are working together against our problems not against each other. 

Emotions~
Something that I've learned in the relationship is that I'm actually super emotionally sensitive. Im fairly good at it cause as a guy you are expected to be less emotional but it's hard to keep the act up in a serious relationship. When she gets upset, she starts pushing me away. It makes me feel deserted. When I change plans or I can't hangout with her, she gets upset at me. She will ignore me and not give me an opportunity to explain. It's stressful because I hate making her upset. I wanna make her happy but sometime it feels like I'm walking on eggshells. Also she will start getting annoyed at me for just doing random things, even letting out a break that sounds like I'm annoyed. Honestly, I get worried about everything I do cause I'm scared what will happen. 

I struggle with depression. I told her this from the very start but she has been increasely impatient with me when I'm feeling low. It seems like in her eyes up just being overdramatic. Im really not trying to be though. I try my best to hide it. She tells me to ""stop being so down"". Like honestly if I could just tell myself to stop, I would. I'm doing my best. It's really something I don't understand completely and I am trying to keep it a secret. I am planning on going to professional conseling though, it's just been hard for me to bring myself to it. Especially to convince myself that there is actually something wrong. It's been easier to try to ignore it but that is unhealthy and it's making things worse. My issue is, I feel no support. It kinda feels like there's opposition like am just too emotional and I'm making it up. She says that me being down just puts her in a bad mood which it probably would but I don't know what to do. I hate being such a burden that I've just been hiding it from her. But sometimes she catches me being out of it or forgetful so I try to make up excuses. I think what bothers he is when I'm down, I often don't have a reason to tell her. It's because a lot of the time I don't have a good reason. 

Commitments~ 
I'm working full time now 40 hrs plus any over time. I see my gf probably 4-5 times a week. Whenever I'm not spending the night with her (we don't live together), she usually complains. She is still in school and I help her with a lot of her school work. I already took the classes shes taking so I know what to do. What bothers me is that she expects me to help her with every assignment and there has been assignment where I pretty much did it for her. I am happy to help her but the amount of help I give her every other night just seems excessive. I've tried bringing up that I should take a more passive role in helping her with homework but I get the response ""oh so you don't want to help me anymore"" or ""you think I'm lazy"". 

It just feels like when I don't do what she wants exactly then she gets upset. It feels like she isn't taking my side into account. It's just what she want. It just feels one sided. Like I should expect anything back but it seems like I'm giving her all my time and effort and she still gets annoyed with me but I've really receive little back. Sometimes it really feels like she wants me for a ride, a meal, help with homework and affection when she wants it. If she doesn't get what she wants when she wants then she treats me like I'm a failure.   

One way street~
Just another note to add, it feels like a lot of the argument are onesided. Like she will get really upset if she feels like one of my comments is condescending and doesn't listen to me when I try to explain what I mean (I'm not a very good talker). On the flip side, she ridicules me often. I mean a lot of it is supposed to be in humor but sometimes it's too much. If I tell her then she says that I'm too sensitive. It's just the constant comments that make me feel childish, slow, dumb etc. It really gets to me, I don't have the best self confidence. I know I'm no the sharpest but it not constructive to keep making me feel bad about it. 


Aftermath~
These last few weekend were end of the semester aka deadlines and final so it was pretty stressful for her. The issue was she would take that stress out on me. It started with constant complaining and being in a bad mood. It progressed to being critical of everything I say and do including critizing how I drive. I tried brining this up with her but again with poor response. I've been exhausting so much energy trying to making things better for her and internalize the stress she passed on to me. But I still feel like a human punching bag. She demands me to help her with stuff but also treats me like a nuisance when I'm around. I've been so scared to set her off cause I'm so emotionally exhausted. 

One weekend, I was working on my car. I was revamping the whole audio system and installing noise dampener to make my work commute more enjoyable. She was aware of this. I told her that I would come over Sunday evening after I finish. Being a perfectionist and not realizing the project was much longer than I had anticipated, I realize it was gonna take me into Sunday night. It required removing a lot of body panels so I just couldn't get up and go. I told her about the situation, she got super upset with me because I should have told her sooner and now I was changing plans on her. I didn't know what to do. I had an anxiety attack. I felt like such a failure cause I couldn't even do this project at good pace and now I'm failing my gf again. I managed to get the stuff needed back together to drive the car so I could make good on my promise. It just felt like there was no flexibility on her end. 

This relationship has really taken a toll on my emotional health. Ive started getting anxious when I'm not sure if my gf is gonna get upset. I feel alone because there isn't emotional support. I feel put down by her words and how I'm treated. 

Idk what to do in the relationship. I've been trying so hard to try to prove that I'm a good person and not a quitter from the last break up. It's been such an emotional load like the axiety it tough. I've started eating and sleeping less. Sometimes I started to gag like I'm about to through up because of the axiety. Here is the thing though, she isn't a bad person. She a great person. I don't want to hurt her again. I feel like a monster how I broke up with her. I feel terrible if I end it because I've make her so invested in me and I'm gonna waste all the time when I promised I would make things better. I feel like such a failure but I don't wanna give up. She says that I make her happy and ive been holding on to that but it not been easy for me emotional. 

Please excuse the mess of stuff I wrote. I'm not gonna proof read it. I just wanted to unload what I had from my mind. Please give me any opinions or advice.

a6ko4g,1,2018-12-15,I'm (23M) Emotionally Exhausted and Have Emotional Issues But I Don't Wanna Give Up On My GF (22F),BlueSkies559,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a6ko4g/im_23m_emotionally_exhausted_and_have_emotional/,"Hello Reddit, here is a kinda long post. I'll try to break it up into sections. Obviously this is going be biased towards me because its my side of the story so just take that into account. I need any opinions or advice I can get. 

Background:
Kate, my girlfriend (20s F), and I (20s M) met in college at CalPoly and have been dating for a little over a 1 year and been a ""thing"" for about 1 and a half years. We both got similar interests and both studied in the same Major. 

The First Break Up:
This was exactly 6 months into dating. She was gone to a 5 month internship which was out of state so we had to do long distance for that time. We would facetime often and text all the time. I was still in school so my work load was packed. I would try to video chat with her on the weekends and talk to her when I could. I also helped her with the school assignments required that would allow her to get credit for interning. It started to feel like any freetime I had, I was spending helping her. Yes, it was good to stay in contact as often as I could but the issue was that anytime something came up (being a really busy semester) she would get upset at me. It became increasingly tough for me to juggle being a fulltime student, working, family, friends and the rest of life. I honestly disappeared off the map from my friend because I was so busy. It was just so stressful and just the stress of it all was getting to me. I started becoming really depressed because I felt like I was failing everything and just the added commitment of being in a relationship just felt overwhelming. I decided to break it off. How I did it was not the best. I kinda did it out of nowhere the night before our 6 months. It really broke her heart. We ended up getting back together that next week but the damage was done. My biggest issue was I really wasn't communicating what things were bothering me. I just got overwhelmed and gave up.  

Where I Am Now:
We've been together since, had rough and good patches. Here I'm just gonna spew out my throughts. 

Communication~
I've tried being more open to her but I just seems like the more I tell her about the things that bothers me the more adverse response I get like ""you are always complaining"". It just feels like there isn't actually any good dialogue about how to solve our issues and differences. I get that it seems like I'm constantly complaining but I'm trying to communicate so we can understand each other. When I try having a talk like that with her, she starts getting really distant and stops talking to me. It does hurt to be ignored but I do understand that it is her defense mechanism. I really want to get to a point where we are working together against our problems not against each other. 

Emotions~
Something that I've learned in the relationship is that I'm actually super emotionally sensitive. Im fairly good at it cause as a guy you are expected to be less emotional but it's hard to keep the act up in a serious relationship. When she gets upset, she starts pushing me away. It makes me feel deserted. When I change plans or I can't hangout with her, she gets upset at me. She will ignore me and not give me an opportunity to explain. It's stressful because I hate making her upset. I wanna make her happy but sometime it feels like I'm walking on eggshells. Also she will start getting annoyed at me for just doing random things, even letting out a break that sounds like I'm annoyed. Honestly, I get worried about everything I do cause I'm scared what will happen. 

I struggle with depression. I told her this from the very start but she has been increasely impatient with me when I'm feeling low. It seems like in her eyes up just being overdramatic. Im really not trying to be though. I try my best to hide it. She tells me to ""stop being so down"". Like honestly if I could just tell myself to stop, I would. I'm doing my best. It's really something I don't understand completely and I am trying to keep it a secret. I am planning on going to professional conseling though, it's just been hard for me to bring myself to it. Especially to convince myself that there is actually something wrong. It's been easier to try to ignore it but that is unhealthy and it's making things worse. My issue is, I feel no support. It kinda feels like there's opposition like am just too emotional and I'm making it up. She says that me being down just puts her in a bad mood which it probably would but I don't know what to do. I hate being such a burden that I've just been hiding it from her. But sometimes she catches me being out of it or forgetful so I try to make up excuses. I think what bothers he is when I'm down, I often don't have a reason to tell her. It's because a lot of the time I don't have a good reason. 

Commitments~ 
I'm working full time now 40 hrs plus any over time. I see my gf probably 4-5 times a week. Whenever I'm not spending the night with her (we don't live together), she usually complains. She is still in school and I help her with a lot of her school work. I already took the classes shes taking so I know what to do. What bothers me is that she expects me to help her with every assignment and there has been assignment where I pretty much did it for her. I am happy to help her but the amount of help I give her every other night just seems excessive. I've tried bringing up that I should take a more passive role in helping her with homework but I get the response ""oh so you don't want to help me anymore"" or ""you think I'm lazy"". 

It just feels like when I don't do what she wants exactly then she gets upset. It feels like she isn't taking my side into account. It's just what she want. It just feels one sided. Like I should expect anything back but it seems like I'm giving her all my time and effort and she still gets annoyed with me but I've really receive little back. Sometimes it really feels like she wants me for a ride, a meal, help with homework and affection when she wants it. If she doesn't get what she wants when she wants then she treats me like I'm a failure.   

One way street~
Just another note to add, it feels like a lot of the argument are onesided. Like she will get really upset if she feels like one of my comments is condescending and doesn't listen to me when I try to explain what I mean (I'm not a very good talker). On the flip side, she ridicules me often. I mean a lot of it is supposed to be in humor but sometimes it's too much. If I tell her then she says that I'm too sensitive. It's just the constant comments that make me feel childish, slow, dumb etc. It really gets to me, I don't have the best self confidence. I know I'm no the sharpest but it not constructive to keep making me feel bad about it. 


Aftermath~
These last few weekend were end of the semester aka deadlines and final so it was pretty stressful for her. The issue was she would take that stress out on me. It started with constant complaining and being in a bad mood. It progressed to being critical of everything I say and do including critizing how I drive. I tried brining this up with her but again with poor response. I've been exhausting so much energy trying to making things better for her and internalize the stress she passed on to me. But I still feel like a human punching bag. She demands me to help her with stuff but also treats me like a nuisance when I'm around. I've been so scared to set her off cause I'm so emotionally exhausted. 

One weekend, I was working on my car. I was revamping the whole audio system and installing noise dampener to make my work commute more enjoyable. She was aware of this. I told her that I would come over Sunday evening after I finish. Being a perfectionist and not realizing the project was much longer than I had anticipated, I realize it was gonna take me into Sunday night.

I managed to get the stuff needed back together to drive the car so I could make good on my promise. It just felt like there was no flexibility on her end. 

This relationship has really taken a toll on my emotional health. Ive started getting anxious when I'm not sure if my gf is gonna get upset. I feel alone because there isn't emotional support. I feel put down by her words and how I'm treated.

a6kqvz,21,2018-12-15,Working in a hospital setting with future goal of private practice- pros and cons,excuriositasscientia,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/a6kqvz/working_in_a_hospital_setting_with_future_goal_of/,"Hi all,  

First of all, I apologize for the lengthiness of this post (I have a lot of thoughts, and being concise is clearly not my thing). I find this subreddit to be so helpful and informative, and I wanted to konw if anyone can relate to my current situation and has any words of wisdom/advice.   

I am a counseling master's student, currently completing my internship in a hospital setting, and my initial plan has been to continue this work for a while after graduation because there are a lot of pros to sticking with this agency (stability, access to supervision, reliable pay and job security, and a clear path to licensure). However, I don't want to stay for too long and risk burnout- my long-term goals include private practice and being able to do more long-term work with clients. From a clinical standpoint, I am getting wonderful experience- staying calm in crisis situations, managing a group, seeing how different issues present, diagnosis, what approaches are effective, and getting a lot of valuable direct experience with clients. On the other hand, I am witnessing the way that burnout manifests in clinician attitudes; although the other clinicians I work with really care about our clients, I can see how the understaffing and caseload at my agency is exhausting and can be contagious if I don't actively work to keep my perspective fresh. I don't want to become frustrated with ""resistant"" clients, because I know change doesn't happen overnight. It feels like a lot of this ""resistance"" or issues that some clinicians refer to as purely ""behavioral"" come from trauma, and we are simply not given the time to patiently build trust that is essential to lasting therapeutic change. I am comforted by the fact that our clients are always referred to outpatient providers to do the deeper long-term work.  

A big concern is if the experience I'm getting will help prepare me to be a competent outpatient clinician. As I have little time with clients (about 2-3 weeks), and a lot of the work is done through groups, I'm afraid that once I get out into private practice, I will lack experience in long-term treatment planning, deeper therapeutic work, and my theoretical orientation might still be unclear because I'm limited to using short-term approaches and interventions. I do understand this takes time, and I trust the process. I'm getting good experience in crisis intervention, psychoeducation, and helping with coping skills, but I want to become more versed in things like attachment work and trauma work, and it would be unethical to ever begin this work when I know that we will be terminating therapy soon. I use a lot of solution-focused and very basic CBT interventions, appropriate confrontation, motivational interviewing, and quick rapport-building techniques, but I just wish I had more time to be patient, slow down, and practice using interventions to work with the root of the cause, so that their therapy really ""sticks."" I find myself unable to use some of what I have learned in grad school in this setting, and ultimately would like to pursue specialized training that can be used long-term (i.e. perhaps DBT) and discover what population I work with best, because right now, I'm unsure. It's so difficult wishing I had more time with clients when I can see that underneath the immediate crisis, there's deeply-rooted core beliefs or patterns of behavior that can't be changed in weeks/extensive trauma that needs to be worked through.  

If you have read this far, thank you! Can anyone else relate to this, and how was your transition from short-term work to long-term work? I'm worried about limiting myself if I continue working here, and wondering if I am better off pursuing a different type of work after internship to hone my skills, even if it might not be as comfortable. I'm afraid that I won't be well-versed in building a treatment plan that involves more than a few sessions. I think I'm just looking for perspectives and relatable experiences. Much love!"
a6ktpv,12,2018-12-15,[22F4M] Quiet Jewish Girls Always Have The Best Tits,Loungette,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a6ktpv/22f4m_quiet_jewish_girls_always_have_the_best_tits/,"Now some of you may be wondering: just where the hell did that stereotype come from? Isn't that sorta weird and out of left field? Since when were Jewish girls stereotyped for anything other than big noses and obsessive grandmothers?

Well when you have a sample size of precisely one subject, outcomes are much easier to reach.

For this particular hypothesis, the subject in question was Kate Kleinberg, the nose of whom was actually quite diminutive and wonderfully complicated the remainder of her adorably girlish, mousy face that ensured she'd get carded for alcohol until she was at least forty. Her hair set a similar tone, falling across her shoulders and forehead in bouncy brown strands that would tickle at the tips of her eyelashes just above that set of bright blue eyes whenever she tilted her head down.

She did that a lot, by the way - tipping her head down. If there was one thing Kate had become intimately familiar with over the years then it would certainly be the view of her shoes. More famed for their loud and boisterous New Yorkian relatives on the 'State side of things, Kate herself was more of the silent sort - oh, sure, she was friendly enough once you got to know her, but that in itself was the hardest part. Coincidentally, considering the adjective used to describe her face shape, she was well-known amongst her peers back in high school for squeaking whenever she got embarrassed, which was pretty often. Less often now, in her early 20's, but it was still easy enough to spook her if you tried.

Adorable.

Yes, ""cute"" would probably be the first adjective that would enter the brains of most people she met with the shuffling and the squeaking and the overall aesthetic of such a meek young girl, but it would be lying to say that a number of other choice descriptors hadn't been tossed her way following her post-pubescent years.

For all her shyness, Kate was the farthest thing from an idiot one might imagine - naive and hilariously impressionable, sure, but not an idiot. Aside from the whole ""squeaking"" thing, her most famed moment in high school might've been her uncharacteristically emphatic reaction to receiving a B+ on her Chemistry midterm and, for as much difficulty as she had with looking other people in the face, strangely she seemed to infect many she spoke to with that exact same problem. Every shirt has cleavage when you've got a chest her size, and all those tight-fitting turtlenecks ever did was just showcase it even better! She distinctly remembered going red in the face for the better portion of an hour upon hearing one of her classmates use the phrase ""painted on"" in reference to such a sweater hugging at her bosoms, and had taken to only visiting the gym later at night after realizing just how much attention she was drawing whenever she used the treadmill.

---

So, what plans do I have tonight for the Jewish girl with the big ol' tiddies and atrocious social skills? Well, I'm sure you can at least get a *close* guess, considering the subreddit, but this prompt is ultimately pretty open-ended!

Obviously I'm looking for something factoring in her shy nature, but past that I'm fully open to ideas! I'll list out a couple of possible scenarios below, but keep in mind that they're hardly restrictive!

- Kate's been dragged along for some sort of road trip for either a class, work, or some other reason we come up with and ends up bonding with her trip-mate. Road-head is the ultimate form of bonding.
- Kate ends up getting dragged to her worst nightmare - a party - by one of her more extroverted friends. Since she's not much of a party animal she ends up awake after it starts puttering out and is surprised to have unintentionally drawn some attention. Maybe she gets pushed into joining a couple others in the hot tub, maybe she gets pulled into a game that turns out to have stripping involved, maybe she just gets chatted up by a cute guy that's hanging around.
- Kate's older co-workers at her internship takes an interest in her.
- Being shy and geeky, Kate is inevitably drawn to gaming groups, whether computer-based or classical pen and paper. Of course, a bunch of similarly introverted nerdy guys might not know how to behave themselves around such a good-looking girl.
-Kate is brought to an amateur photoshoot where she is continually talked out of more and more clothes.
- The classic study buddies sort of setup.
- Something of a more traditional setup, like a date - or a double-date, perhaps.
- Something seasonally-appropriate! Maybe Kate gets invited to a Christmas dinner or office holiday party!

And so on! You get the idea, I hope. A lot of the above scenarios are written to be very purposefully flexible on how many male characters are involved and I would *love* if any of my potential partners would be willing to play multiple male characters, but that's completely an optional thing! I'll similarly offer to add in another girl just to slightly even things out, but no more than that and only if there are at least two guys! What can I say? I'm picky and a shy girl getting spitroasted is, like, *super* hot.

Some other kinks and general stuff that I'd like included:

 - Cumplay, the only thing that's pretty much a requirement. Spunk on me. Cum quick, cum a lot, cum on my clothes, cum in my food, just get a lot of splooge in a lot of places, y'know?
- Semi-public, which is basically just as close to public as you can get without getting arrested. Sure, she's shy, but I also mentioned she's *super* impressionable, right?
- Casual stuff. Grabbing her butt or stuffing your dick in her face un-announced, having her blow you while she studies for an upcoming exam, that sort of thing. Could happen before or after the proverbial ice is broken depending on how ""coercive"" you want these scenes to be.
- Casual group, which is basically just, you know, casual stuff but in a group setting! This can apply to people playing multiple characters or only one. For multiple characters obviously double+ teaming, blowbangs, and stuff like that would be loved along with Kate getting passed around a small group of friends or coworkers. In a scenario where you're only playing one, though, they can look but they don't have to touch. Maybe you like showing off to your buddies by having your new girlfriend blow you on the couch while you're all hanging out and chatting.
- Chubby guys! I love chubby guys. And any other sort of generally conventionally unattractive sort of dudes - something about the contrast makes me go crazy.

Again, none of those are required, just some stuff I like including! I don't do impreg, hard gore, bathroom stuff, or bestiality, but *most* other things are on the table, so be sure to ask if you want a kink included! Want to cum on the shy Jewish girl's feet? Then gosh golly, cum all over 'em!

Send me a message if you're interested! I only write in third person, but if you're only playing a single character and want to write in first person, we can work something out."
a6lftz,1,2018-12-15,Hit a rough patch with my SO this week and am trying to process my thoughts and anxiety,bumblebee_throwaway1,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a6lftz/hit_a_rough_patch_with_my_so_this_week_and_am/," 

Hi. I'm sorry this is a long one. I just don't know how else to express myself.

I don't  normally reach out like this. I've been with my SO for 4 years where  we've had on/off bits. She's an amazing woman and is very strong willed,  and to be candid I do think she doesn't manage her worries/anxiety well  (will get to this later). We met in college and just hit it off. We've  both grown into more mature adults and have built so much with each  other that it's never taboo to talk about our long future together.  We've also had our growing pains associated with said growth (e.g. I  would always get anxious about her 'going out' but I'm over that...  which I think that 'hump' for guys is quite normal when you haven't  matured yet and haven't trusted someone fully but like I said, past  that). The growing pain was also what introduced the 'on/off' bit I  mentioned where she said she needed a break and wasn't sure that I  wasn't the one. She felt suffocated and stuck like her destiny was  'pre-determined' and wasn't ready for that. Also, we're from different  backgrounds/religions... so she has a real anxiety about having an  inter-faith relationship (but neither of us are devoutly religious and I  don't feel the same anxiety about different religions) But we've since  patched (that was early on in the relationship like year 2).

From  that point I felt like we really connected more and matured. Still,  there's always a spectrum of ebbs and flows but our arguments were never  toxic or yelling/screaming etc. Just thoughtful conversations about  working through our emotions. We're also no stranger to long distance  and we grew stronger when I spent 6 months on the West coast for an  internship (we're east coast). It was very tough for me during that time  because I spent everyday feeling like she resented me for going. She  was worried that I would find someone else (irrational anxiety) that  wasn't managed well because she kept getting 'mad' at me for no reason  via text.

From there we both graduated  college. She is an aspiring dentist and I helped her through the tough  time of deciding when to take the dental admissions test. She decided to  wait a year (gap year) to take the test. I don't mean to attack her  just being honest, because of that major stressor she hasn't been the  most pleasant person always (ebbs and flows ya know). During this time  we were separated across the state because we were both getting on our  feet. Again, because long distance wasn't a strain we had no issues  besides dental school pressures.

Earlier  this year I managed to move across the state and get a job close to her  and her family. It's been a very tough year for me because I went from  light financial responsibility to full financial responsibility. and  adjusting to a new job isn't easy... So I admit I haven't been the best  version of myself always. All the while she studied and took her dental  test and passed with great results but her anxiety switched to hoping  she'd be granted admission to school. We've both had a great deal of  anxiety/weight on our shoulders...

On my  birthday 2 weeks ago she was notified that she was accepted to dental  school and is going to a dental school close to where we are and I am so  proud of her and have communicated that as much as I could.

Unfortunately  during that week, her step grandfather passed away. So, for someone who  doesn't always control her anxiety, the roller coaster of emotions has  really impacted her... And back to the religious bit, I was present for  the viewing and funeral and fully supported her and her family (to which  I'm seen as another family member now and I love them). However after  the funeral, she just flipped like a switch. She has barely communicated  this week and initially I knew it was to give her space and I respect  that and didn't intrude at all.

But my  anxiety bubbled up to an intolerable amount. Something told me things  weren't right. I was frozen yesterday. I use the gym to help and I  couldn't even lift the bar... then she asked me to pick her up last  night from a work event (like boss takes employees out for a xmas  dinner/drinks) and she was, very distant. It felt like she was forcing  herself to be near me.

This morning, she  had asked me to drop her off with her aunt/uncle to go shopping. On the  way, we talked. I don't remember how the conversation started but I was  trying to hold her hand while I drove and I could tell she wasn't  reciprocating how she normally does. I ended up saying something along  the lines of ""i know things have been very tough for you and I want to  be there for you anyway I can. I know you've asked for space."" I don't  remember what she replied because my anxiety was bubbling up to which I  basically asked ""are you questioning our relationship?"" and she started  crying and nodded.

The reason I gave so  much context above is because I wanted to illustrate how complex we are  and how deeply we love each other. Also because she's the kind of person  that when there's an anxiety/event (i.e. passing of her step  grandfather) everything becomes clouded in that anxiety and she enters a  ""impending doom"" mode. And I know it isn't just the grief she's feeling.. she feels the weight of responsibility to be there for her  family in their grief. She helps so much and sometimes to her detriment... I'm not excusing her behavior. But not everyone is perfect. Neither am I.

So  I did my best to try to stand for myself and our relationship. I truly  think that her mind is skewed with grief (understandably. I'm stating  that as a matter of fact) but I think that with her anxieties she enters  a defense mode. and that defense mode (based on this past week and last  night/today) has been directed towards me. She's processing a lot right  now and is thinking about her future... add grief into that mix and you  have someone who's 'unstable with anxiety.' I believe that our  relationship is strong and I tried communicating to her that all  relationships have highs and lows and this may be a low. But you don't  just 'get' a happy relationship 24/7. You work through things. And I  expressed my concern that her anxiety towards our relationship is being  skewed by the grief and other anxieties.... I don't know how receptive  she was to that.

I admit, I also called  her mother (we are close like that and it isn't really awkward that I  called her) to express myself and ask for advice. She resonated with the  paragraph above and attested that my SO's processing of anxiety/grief  isn't the best right now because she has a lot to think about.

I'm  sorry I wrote a lot. I hope someone reads this. I feel very alone since  I've moved to the other side of the state where my family is on the  other. And although my SO's anxieties may just be skewed like I  mentioned... it doesn't deter my fears.



**tl;dr: SO suddenly feels anxious about relationship after getting into dental school and the passing of her step-grandfather. I think her anxiety/grief is clouding her judgement and she thinks our relationship may be an issue. Trying to stand my ground and for me and her because I love her and myself and us... I don't think it's a dying cause. "
a6lm94,5,2018-12-15,A Different Perspective on Growing a Youtube Channel (LONG READ),HighSocietyGaming,NewTubers,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/a6lm94/a_different_perspective_on_growing_a_youtube/,"Hey everyone. My name is Nate and I am a pretty big lurker on this subreddit. I have seen a lot of great advice that digs deeper then the same schpeel you hear and read a lot of people say. But I want to give a different perspective that I believe will work. 

To have some initial context, I have been passionate about Youtube since I was 15. I tried a few different channels and always had other priorities from school and internships come in the way. But, over the last year, i decided to start my own business. I have had moderate success, but I am extremely happy with the results due to just how much I learned. And a lot of what I have learned I feel could be applied to someone starting a youtube channel. I will be using my own channel I have been working on for the last few months to reflect the methods of my madness.

So initially, you have to decide what kind of mindset you want to have when it comes to your channel. If you want to really just treat it as a hobby and whatever happens happens, then this process really doesn't apply to you. But if you do legitimately want to have youtube be a career for you in the future, then I believe the best course of action is to treat your channel like you are starting your own business. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to be all work and no play. It just means there is a healthy balance. Have fun in front of the camera, but on the back end, do whatever you can to market yourself and improve upon your content.

The first thing I would do once you have this mindset is take your time to come up with your brand. The brand is the essential foundation that will either make or break you long term. Every little detail comes into consideration. The name, Your logo, your banner, the color scheme, the professionalism, the personality that oozes off of your brand all needs to be thought out with as much detail as possible. Everything needs to meld together and come off as something professional, yet you. You are trying to create a platform to market yourself (through merch and content for example) and goods and services from companies that want to work with you. Since I knew I wouldn't be in a position to create content anytime soon in the past, I have been spending months workshopping, and tweaking my brand. (If you want to see what I have created just out of curiosity ask me to PM you)

The next thing I would focus on is a gameplan. Figure out what kind of content you want to make, and watch channels in your genre. Imitation is the best form of flattery. So take the time to find certain aspects of different channels you like and meld it into your own thing that makes you stand out from the crowd. Figure out who your target market is going to be and find a way to push yourself into that market. Let that be making kick ass content off the ground, timing your content release correctly to jump in on that sweet sweet algorithm nectar of the youtube gods. Or even using other social media platforms to market yourself. (I will go more into detail with this later). Then I would go the business route and fill out a business model canvas. Just google it if you don't know what it is, it's really self explanatory.

One thing I would also mention is long term you need to go (the what I like to call) the rooster teeth route. This mindset can be compared to a shopify store owner using the amazon affiliate program. It is a great revenue channel and sales funnel, but it isn't your main source of income. Don't expect Youtube to be your main money maker. Your money maker will be patreon, merchandise, subscription services, paid sponsorships. If you go the route that rooster teeth did where you create your own seperate domain and let youtube be a sales funnel to that domain, you will be much better off. And don't worry if you have all of this early on. Doesn't matter if people think you are taking yourself too seriously. Of course you're taking it seriously, you're essentially an entrepreneur trying to go your own way in this world. And if you can't afford this route initially, don't fret! You will get there eventually through platforms like patreon to give you a crutch. 

Take the time to figure out what the purpose of each social media platform is besides youtube. What kind of content will you be showing on those platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit). Take the time to do research on digital marketing and come up with a plan to market yourself. Or if you have the money, pay for a marketing consultant. There isn't anything wrong with setting up targeted ads on these platforms to grow. If you aren't scaling, you are failing. There isn't a business without good marketing (that doesn't just include SEO)

Another thing I would also do which can be considered not super popular is going with an MCN. Not just any MCN though, I would recommend Talentsy. And I am not just saying this because the CEO is a friend of mine. but they have a program focused on helping small channels grow. For 8 dollars a month, you get TubeBuddy Pro, Epidemic Sound, their own in-house SEO tool, and free consultation. It is honestly a great deal for all these tools. There's more that is offered with this $8 a month, I just can't remember it off the top of my head.

Finally, after you plan, stick with your plan and push forward. This isn't a get rich quick scheme. This is an incredibly competitive market, you just gotta take the time to plan and execute what will make you stand out from the crowd. If you do all this and stick with it. you will succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all so much for reading if you made it this far!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Treat your channel like your starting your own business. Innovate on content that is already there to make yourself stand out from the crowd. Focus on marketing yourself and building an awesome brand."

From an outside perspective, I shouldn’t have a reason to be depressed, but here I am. I have a wonderful girlfriend and extremely close friend group, which is why I haven’t offer myself yet, but I’m so tired of being in this hole.

After I graduated university I quickly found out how hard finding a job is. I am not 7 months unemployed, which makes me rethink my entire education. All of friends are far away, and my girlfriend is doing an internship for 8 months. I’m so happy for her. She just graduated and has something lined up. The long distance is going to suck hardcore, but we’ve been together for 5 years and I know we will make it. But here I am, living with my parents and dreading every day I wake up. I apply to jobs and hear back from 1-2% of my applications. I have no money, but my friends are helping me through it (covering food costs etc.), but it just makes me feel worthless.

I hate living at home. Nothing against my parents, but I just can’t stand it anymore. They are super overbearing and berate me about not having a job yet. It just sucks.

Every time I come back from seeing my friends I enter the door, go to my room, and just cry. My dreams are always nightmares, and I have so much stress surrounding me. 

Every life has a low point, and I just have to keep chugging and taking every opportunity, but I’ve been so low for so long it’s draining me physically, mentally, and emotionally. I just want a job and build a life for me and my girlfriend. Move in together and propose, but I’ve been unhireable for so long now. It hurts. "

1. I've read and heard that the degree at ANU is more theoretical and math-based, whereas UC is more practical and focused on building practical experience. Can anyone share their experience(s) with this?
2. What are the major differences between Advanced Computing, Software Engineering and IT and ANU? I've heard the first 2 years are similar, so I'm assuming Advanced Computing has a deeper theory/math focus, Software Engineering just goes into depth and IT isn't as in-depth (though it is a 3-year-degree).
3. What are the major differences between Software Engineering and Software and Network Engineering at UC? Is the Network Engineering the only difference, hence the added year of study? When comparing the courses I noticed the Software and Network Engineering degree contained several engineering units, so I was wondering if these were more concerned with Network Engineering.
4. I personally don't have an interest in further study or undertaking research in the future, so an honours degree doesn't particularly appeal to me, especially when a Masters Degree seems like an option. What I want from my degree is practical experience and opportunities for internships (potentially academic-based) as I plan on seeking full-time employment once I graduate. Out of the courses I have considered, Software Engineering at UC seems ideal to me; however, I'd like to consider input from those who have experience with any of the aforementioned courses."

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

I will be finishing my internship program by middle of Jan, go back home, and finally able to go outdoor again yeah !!!!

I have spend 2 months worth of climbing in gym learning techniques, persuing weird gym style of climbing. Now it comes to last month of gym climbing, time to trainsitioning back to outdoor, **felt like I wanna get the most out of it.**

First off, My expectation is not to climb many many problems in a day, but rather be sending my project or climbing a few hard problems at my limit in a day.  In the style hooking me into bouldering in the first place, being steep climbing, roof climbing, dynamic climbing.

I have been climbing for a little over a year now. So far, I have send 1 6C+ outdoor, and some 7a/7a+ indoor and load of 6C and below indoor

Goal : sending 7a+ outdoor, and hopefully break into 7b. And of course, they are in steep , overhanging, roof, dynamic style.

Training Structure: once every other day.

Day 1 limit bouldering : working on hard problem/sequence, 1 for 45, 30 degree wall, and roof, spreading time to work on each of them equally under 2 hours.

Day 2 : climb everything easier, get a lot of volume with low rest.

Supplementary exercises at the end of every session : 3x10 plance push up, 3x5 scapular pull, 2x15 reverse back hyper extension, 3x10 hanging leg raise.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated cheers.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

John Michael Edwards hated the cold.  It wasn't just a mild annoyance for him like it was for most people.  He absolutely hated it.  So much so, that he had left his life in Michigan behind and moved south to Florida for college to study biology.  What better place to learn than in the soupy melting-pot of invasive species that is the southern tip of Florida?  And when a research internship came open smack dab in the center of the Brazilian rain forest, of course he had jumped on it.  Jumped right in with both feet.  His hatred for cold had propelled him his whole life.  Pulled him along all the way to the middle of the stinking, hot jungle at twenty-four-years-old.  Waking up in a shallow pool of sweat every morning, throwing aside the damp mosquito net, dripping over to the coffee maker and brewing a nice, hot, cup of bitter caffeine, what could be a better life?  He was happy. 

 

This morning, however, he had woken up and felt immediately grumpy.  He felt off.  Off enough that he'd stayed in bed and rolled over, trying to get some more sleep.  After an unsuccessful few minutes of tossing and turning, he resigned himself to getting up and making coffee.  The others would be up soon, and he wasn't the only one with a passion for percolated energy.  He threw his legs off the cot and tossed the mosquito net aside, shuffled over to the coffee pot and initiated the ritual.  Rinse the pot. Fill it with water.  Change the filter.  Dump in the grounds.  Press Go.  Same as every morning.  Except this time, he didn't wait for the whole pot to brew.  In his agitated state he snatched the pot off the burner before it was full and poured himself a mug. 

 

He slurped the steaming liquid loudly.  Feeling the burning drink scorch the back of his throat and slide into his belly, paradoxically waking him up and calming him down, he smiled.  *Now that's the stuff*, he thought.  He could feel his irritation draw down and in, following the coffee to his stomach, and disappear.  He shivered.  Taking a second, loud, sip he wandered over to the window, as per his ritual, to look out on the jungle morning.  The third sip never made it to his lips.  It hovered an inch away, sloshing over the edge of the cup and splashing his bare feet.  The mug followed shortly, crashing and breaking, throwing ceramic and coffee across the floor.  John didn't notice.  He stood there, numbly, holding his empty hand in front of his face.  His eyes widened and his jaw fell slack to his neck as he stared out the window. 

 

It was snowing. 

 

~~~~~~~~ 

 

Billingsley held out his fist.  Four white plastic straws poked out of its center, each carefully lined up to the same length.   He ran his free hand through his black hair, pushing it out of his eyes.  He looked to each of his companions in turn, studying the slight apprehension on their faces.  He nodded to himself and looked back at his outstretched fist. 

 

""Ok, choose,"" he said. ""I'll go last, same as always."" 

 

Simmons immediately snatched a straw.  She sighed with relief at its full-length.  She was always the first to grab a straw.  Always willing to just get it over with, whatever *it* happened to be at the time.  She often said luck comes to those who act.  And it seemed to hold true for her often enough. 

 

Tellers went next.  She slowly reached for the straws, hovering her pale hand over one before quickly grabbing another.  It came out of Billingsley's fist whole and uncut.  She smiled quickly and handed her straw off to Simmons before walking to the back of the building into the women's sleeping area. 

 

Edwards watched her disappear behind the curtain wall before turning back to the group.  He groaned.  ""Come on, Robert.  Do we have to do this every time?  Just pick one for me.  I hate the suspense,"" he said. 

 

""You know I can't.  I know which straw is shorter.  Just grab one."" 

 

John stomped his foot like a child initiating a tantrum.  ""You're the team *lead*, Robert.  Just assign us a rotation again instead of this horse crap.  It'd be more fair."" 

 

Robert rolled his eyes.  ""Edwards, do we have to do this every time?  We *had* a rotation.  What happened to Johansson changed that.  I am *not* forcing anyone else to march off to their death!  Choose a fucking straw!""  He said the last with the forced deepening of voice that a parent uses on his child that won't get dressed in the morning.  

 

""Fine."" John said, then mumbled, ""I hate the cold."" 

 

Simmons laughed a short, clipped chuckle.  ""It's not even cold, you big baby."" 

 

John gave her a long look.  ""There's snow on the ground, Rebekah."" 

 

""Yes.  Snow.  We know.  But it's 65 degrees out there!  I don't have all morning and you're making Anderson wait out in the 'cold' while you wish and wash,"" she said.  She stared him in the face, a hint of anger tightening the folds of her eyes.  ""Get on with it."" 

 

John let his bluster die under her gaze.  Without saying anything he quickly snatched a straw.  It was short. 

 

""Shit.""  John's shoulders fell and he hung his head. 

 

Billingsley opened his fist to reveal the last full-length straw.  ""Sorry John, it's your turn on the blind."" 

 

~~~~~~~~ 

 

The blind was a square wooden basket rigged to a cable and wench on the edge of the clearing.  It connected to a pulley near the top of one of the taller trees, where it currently housed Mike Anderson.  The group had formerly used it as an observation deck to study birds and other animals of the canopy.  Back when they were just regular biologists not so many weeks ago.  Back before Johansson went missing. 

 

John trudged up to the base of the tree, kicking snow as he went.  It *was* snow, despite the temperature of the air being in the mid 60s.  It was cold when you touched it.  Freezing, actually.  Early on, before they knew better, it had even tasted cold.  But it didn't melt at normal temperatures like regular snow.  And, of course, it was summer in the rainforest lowlands.  It should be puddles of rainwater, not mounds of snow. 

 

A wind kicked up momentarily, shaking the treetops and sending a flurry of snow down on John's head.  *Just like home*, he thought for the umpteenth time and grimaced.  Brushing it off he shouted up, ""Hey Anderson, change of watch!"" 

 

""Heyo!  Coming down.  Watch yourself!"" Mike shouted back in his too-chipper voice. 

 

John stepped back as the cable vibrated and a fresh shower of snow drifted down, covering him again.  He cursed.  A few moments later the blind lowered to the ground as Mike eased the wench lever over one last time. 

 

Mike stood and stretched his back, flexing his well-muscled body taut, his Panama Jack button-down threatening to pop wide open.  ""Got the short straw again?"" He laughed.  ""The universe is cruel, eh?  You get watch twice as much as anyone else.""  He laughed again. 

 

John did not return the laugh.  He sighed and said, ""One of these days I'm going to strangle you, you hippy bastard.  How are you always so happy?"" 

 

Mike smiled.  ""The weather, my friend.  It's warm and sunny and snowy.  It's like a childhood fantasy come to life!""  He slapped John on the back and pulled him into a good-natured hug. 

 

""It is *not* warm,"" John moaned, pushing Mike back even as a small smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.  ""You're just a freak of nature."" 

 

Mike's cheery demeanor dropped at that and his smile slipped down to thin lips. ""A lot of that going around, eh?"" He fixed John with a stare. ""Keep your eyes open up there, and watch out for biters."" 

 

John took a step back and shot a glance to edge of the clearing on each side.  All he saw was heaped snow. Still, a small tingle ran down his spine like ice down his shirt.  ""I will,"" he said. And then, ""Why, have you seen any?"" 

 

""No, and that's what troubles me. It's been awhile. Too long."" He paused. ""Long enough I'd say use the horn if you see even a little one."" Mike took a deep breath. The air seemed to invigorate him and he cracked a smile and suddenly winked. He turned to leave. ""See you in 12 hours, Edwards,"" he said over his shoulder. 

 

John watched him walk across the clearing, taking his own path through the snow, until he reached the lodge and disappeared inside.  The slight sound of the lodge door closing carried across the empty space, muffled by the banks of snow, and passed over John, disappearing into the silent jungle undergrowth.  It would be at least an hour until the others made their way outside for chores and filled the clearing with the soft murmur of chatter.  John turned and studied the trees for a long moment before climbing into the blind and winching himself up into the snow-covered canopy.  

 

~~~~~~~ 

 

Hours later John sat swaying slightly in the treetop, bored. He fingered the valves on the trumpet they used as a warning system and wondered why he had never bothered to learn an instrument.  Could he even blow the trumpet loud enough if he needed to? He thought it likely it would just sputter and spit.  The horn had been Johansson's and John found himself thinking back to those first days in camp when Marcus played in the evenings.  The jungle had been deafeningly alive with sounds, then, and Marcus's horn had to work hard to silence it.  That was before they made it to the lodge in the clearing. Back when the guides were still with them and the most dangerous thing on their minds at night was the remote possibility of a jaguar stumbling upon them.  So they had built big fires and Marcus had played his trumpet, bleating a warning to all things that stalk the night that men were here and in control.  Funny how the trumpet still served as a warning but they certainly didn't feel in control.  

 

John leaned the trumpet to the side and picked up the blind's binoculars from his neck.  He made a slow scan of the trees, pivoting around to check the entire perimeter of the compound.  Having the blind on a single side of the clearing wasn't ideal, but no one had come up with a better plan.  No one had a concrete reason for having such a high vantage point, either, but they all felt it was needed.  As his view moved over the clearing, he realized it was snowing again.  Big plump flakes fell gently from a clear blue sky.  It made no sense but that was their reality.  Fresh fallen snow that didn't melt in the middle of a rainforest summer.  

 

*That's not the only weird thing going on, is it?* John asked himself as he completed his circuit.  The rest of his companions had gone inside for lunch around the kerosene stove and the clearing was once again silent.  *Too silent*, John thought.  *It's as if all the animals have left*.  Of course, that wasn't true.  They had seen plenty of animals and insects since the snow first fell.  But it *was* true that they had seen fewer and fewer as the days passed.  And every one of them had been completely silent.  No birds calling.  No insects buzzing.  No monkeys howling.  The *other* things were mute as well.  It was as if the snow falling had struck the world dumb.  Even the clearing was affected.  When they were outside working the sounds seemed to die off too soon.  Voices barely carried the distance to the blind some 40 yards away.  John would be able to hear someone if they called, but it was like listening through cotton in his ears. 

 

The only thing that didn't seem to be affected were the trees.  They still creaked and groaned in the wind.  Branches still cracked when you snapped them.  Or perhaps they were muted, too, their noises just that much more noticeable in the stillness.  *It's all so strange*, John thought again, as he had every day over the last few weeks.   

 

A small rustle in the treetops nearby drew him out of his thoughts and he looked up sharply.  He scanned the limbs quickly for the source of the noise and almost missed it in his haste.  It was a biter.  John froze.  The biter looked at him with dull eyes and worked its jaws opened and closed.  It's huge jaws were twice the size of its head and its head was the size of a large man's fist.  It resembled an ant but *wrong*.  It was all head and legs and mandibles.  Like an ant that had been pulled and stretched and squeezed until it was the size of a tarantula.  They called them biters because that's what Johansson had called the first, smaller, one they found.  The one that bit a hole in his canteen. 

 

The biter held John's gaze and widened its mandibles out and out and out in a wide grimace and then slammed them closed silently.  John's imagination filled in the click he *should* have heard and it snapped him out of his trance.  He slowly reached back for the horn, fumbling behind himself, but unwilling to turn away from the creature.  This was the closest he'd ever been to one and he did not want to find out if the things could jump while his back was turned.  Where was that stupid trumpet?  Finally, his fingers brushed cool metal and he grasped at it, knocking it over with a muffled clunk.  The biter scrambled backward down the branch and disappeared.   

 

John's knees gave out and he collapsed onto the floor of the blind and then leaped back up to the edge, searching to make sure the biter didn't come back from below.  He was shaking.  ""Get ahold of yourself,"" he said out loud and then laughed a breathy wheeze at himself for being so scared.  *It's just a bug.  Just a weird insect that no one has ever seen before.  You should be excited.  Scientific discovery like everyone dreams.*  Except he wasn't excited.  He was very much a cold, scared, college boy that wanted more than anything to go home and take a long, hot shower.  He picked up the trumpet and put it to his lips, not caring if the others thought he was overreacting, and blew.  A windy, whispery bluster came out.   

 

*Well, that answers that*, he thought. 

 

~~~~~~~ 

 

The rest of the watch passed uneventfully.  John spent his time alternating between watching the forest for creatures and quietly blowing at the horn.  He did not find success in either venture.  He gave up on both and instead watched the sun slowly sink down behind the horizon.  He shivered, even though the temperature had only dropped a few degrees.  He should be getting relieved, soon, by the first night watch.  They split the watches by one full daylight and two half night shifts.  The night shifts were a set rotation with the only exemption being if you had just pulled day shift.  In that case the line moved up.  It wasn't the best situation, but with only five members on the team, it was what they had to work with.  Of course, it would help if the rotation was set for the day shifts as well, but Billingsley wasn't having it.  He had taken Johansson's daylight disappearance hard.  He was sure Marcus was dead.  Taken by a jaguar or perhaps a snake.  Or something *else*. 

 

Johansson had been in the blind studying the wildlife in the snow.  They hadn't really had a watch at that point.  They were still going about their regular duties, documenting the odd snowfall and the way it seemed to hush the rainforest.  Marcus had been excited to go back out and look for more of the biters that he'd observed the day before and wanted to head out early.  He had taken a new canteen, the DSLR, a radio, and a fresh notebook. He was a man on a mission for scientific discovery.  The electronics still worked at that point. It would be a few more days before everything electric suddenly died.  When Tellers had called him on the radio for lunch and he hadn't answered, no one thought much of it.  When they went outside to yell for him, they saw the blind was on the ground.  Probably went to drop logs, Mike had said.  They had all laughed and gone inside to eat.  Later, Tellers had taken leftovers out to force Marcus to eat.   

 

John would never forget her screams. 

 

Even with the muffling snow and the lodge door closed, they had all heard her.  They had rushed outside and ran to the blind.  It was sitting on the ground, just like before, and Tellers was screaming Marcus's name at the top of her lungs.  Inside the blind was a neat pile of everything Johansson had brought with him, including the blank notebook.  Marcus had been a relentless note-taker.  They all knew what the empty notebook meant.  He had never made it up the tree.  They searched for the rest of the day and into the night.  And again the next day.  And then the next day the electronics died.  Without the radios and the GPS, Billingsley had called off the search.  He couldn't lose anyone else, he said. 

 

John shivered again.  Partly from the chill and partly from the memories but mostly because he really had to pee.  That was another change Billingsley had instated.  Use the blind to watch the perimeter.  Random shifts.  Only lower the blind at shift change.  Use a bucket for piss breaks.  John eyed the bucket in the corner and shook his head.  He just couldn't do it.  The girls had to use the bucket and he couldn't bring himself to soil it since he could just go over the side of the blind.  He had done it that morning, but after spotting that horrid, twisted ant-thing, he felt too vulnerable doing even that.  Couldn't risk it turning out like the canteen. 

 

""Where is Robert,"" he said aloud, ""He should be coming out for his shift.  Should have already been out.""  John looked toward the lodge, expecting to see Billingsley shuffling through the snow, but in the dimming light he saw nothing but humps of pristine snow and churned up troughs where his team had walked throughout the day.  He eyed the bucket again.  He shook his head.  *Fuck him, I'm not holding it any longer*.  He reached for the winch crank and started his decent.  When he touched ground he hopped out of the blind and made a beeline toward the outhouse situated between the lodge and the North side of the clearing. 

 

As he reached the outhouse his heart sank.  Mike's sandals were laying in the snow, tossed to the side as if he was in a hurry.  *Oh, gross*, he thought and wrinkled his nose.  *Must have the runs*.  He danced there in the snow, hopping from one foot to the next, trying to decide if he wanted to knock or wait.  His bladder decided for him and he ran around to the backside of the outhouse and unzipped.  His stream made runnels in the mound of snow at the edge of the clearing.  *Take that, snow!* he chuckled to himself.  When he finished, he zipped back up and kicked some fresh snow over the channels he'd made and turned back to the outhouse.  As he did, he noticed a trough in the snow off to his left that seemed darker in the twilight. 

 

It lead straight through the largest mound of snow in the clearing.  The one at the edge of the jungle. 

 

John's heart slowed and then sped up, pounding out a staccato beat in his ears.  The blood in his hands and feet disappeared in an icy retreat.  John lurched forward as if pulled behind a car with a dying engine.  Step, halt, step, halt, shudder.  *No one should go into the jungle.*  Billingsley's words echoed in his head.  But he couldn't stop.  His feet pulled him along without conscious decision.  As he angled closer, more of the trough came into view.  Step.  Halt.  He could see a small dark shape within it in the twilight.  Step.  Halt.  He strained to see clearly.  Step. Halt.  The shape elongated, filling more of the trough.  Step.  Halt.  He couldn't understand what he was seeing.  Step.  Halt.  Finally, everything seemed to snap into focus at once. 

 

It was Mike's legs. 

 

His bare feet splayed out, toes arched.  His hairy calves.  His knees.  The bottom half of his shorts.  And then a mouth.  Like a snake's.  It wrapped around Mike's thighs silently working the inches.  Beyond that, too many eyes.  A hulking lizard body.  And then shadows.  John couldn't see the rest.  Couldn't *comprehend* the rest.  The creature made no sound. 

 

John screamed.

a6oij8,30,2018-12-16,How to not slow-down your healing and screw the situation up any further - please learn from my mistakes,dsong_,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a6oij8/how_to_not_slowdown_your_healing_and_screw_the/,"Four months after my split with the girl I had my first relationship with and I thought was going to marry. Four months which carry with them progress, advancement, learning - but also regret, guilt, embarassment, fear and a lot more heartbreak than necessary. Here is my story.

&amp;#x200B;

K laments that we never had the chance to be friends as she breaks up with me, telling me she dearly wanted me in her life. I am respectful and happy for her decisions, guessing it really was time for things to close. The day after however had me doing the usual pleading. What follows is a painful period where I act try to cut contact, then go back to her and just confuses both of us and causes more pain until a week or two after our split I resolve to be friends, I just needed some space. K is happy, but also mentions that she doesn't know what the future holds and it's possible we can end up together again. I tried not to think on that too much. We go back to where I first confessed to her before departing and things are looking up.

&amp;#x200B;

K drops me off my birthday present at work and a heartfelt letter telling me that she misses me dearly, hopes to connect in the near future and thanking me for being an amazing partner. It was bittersweet. Month of NC follows.

&amp;#x200B;

During that month I learn a lot about why things failed and what I could've done to try and save the relationship. The knowledge that I could have imparted to her on both our failings to try and renew the relationship and make it stronger than ever fuel my curiousity that maybe I can make the dream happen. As I am inspired and hopeful - I dig through how-to-get-your-ex-back guides **(yeaaaah don't do this, at worst they are insidious and prey on you for money, at best offer some valid points but are better applied elsewhere).** After a month of NC I reach out to her, telling her of the exciting developments that happened with me and readying our mutual point of discussion that the guides suggested. I immediately suggest that I want to meet up but instead we just go talking and I ask to chat over the phone. Here I am expecting her warm, excited voice to be coming through.

&amp;#x200B;

What I get instead is a flat, rather disengaged tone throughout the conversation. She eagerly congratulates me on her internship and we talk a bit about other things. I instantly regret asking who she went with to an escape room which were her friends and a guy that she mentioned she was previously interested in prior to dating me. ""Oh, maybe she had a bad day? She was an extremely busy person and we have a lot of assessments around this time. Maybe I reached out at a bad time"" I apprehensively told myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It really should have stopped there, but I kept going. A month or two later I tell her that I'd like to play some games with her again and she seems happy to do that. She says no words while we have our single game. When I tell her I enjoyed playing with her again - to which she responds ""yeah you too :)"" and logs off immediately. I ask once more asking her if she would be free anytime soon to catch up and talk. I get a ""no I'm busy, maybe next time!"" We finally have a shared shift together where she acts both hot and cold. At least I get to gym with her after and ease into friendly conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later at the Christmas party and there she is looking gorgeous, happy and cheerful. K is drinking and celebrating with all my other colleagues and yet she says me nearby and evades me, I approach her and she delivers me a flat 'hi' and any attempt at conversation with her is sidewinded. Leading up to the day, I resolved that I would just make a move because I'm tired of waiting, and after drinking because I just wanted to at least enjoy myself with the rest of my team (terrible idea) I sit her down and I say to her that I want to give things another go. It goes as well as you'd think. I try to salvage the situation by telling her I will always cherish what we had. She says the same and affirms that she just wants me to move on and be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

A day after I try to text her to talk about the other night and establish boundaries between us. She agrees and she makes it clear that she got more and more deterred from a friendship after I apparently kept wanting to 'talk about us' whenever I reached out to her. However she did not tell me any of this and I clarified to her that I was just asking to catch up and talk. She realised she misinterpreted it but regardless was firm on her stance. I poked and prodded way more than I should have - but with the information I had of clear statements and a desire of mutual friendship, plus this lack of communication that she was misinterpreting my statements and responding in an amicable/neutral manner to my contact attempts resulted in the situation being far worse than it really had to be. I was confused and hurt. K was frustrated and annoyed. Both of us should have put our foot down and/or stepped away from the situation long before. Poor communication kills.

&amp;#x200B;

So my friends, there is my bumpy journey of regrets, guilt hope ignited and dashed and mistakes. Some key lessons:

1. You must take anything said after the break-up with a grain of salt. Emotions are highest in this stage and really any statement and/or intentions can lose its meaning and validation - as I have quickly learnt.
2. Hope is dangerous. Here I am trying to be a hero and fighting against the odds. I wasted my time, energy and spend a great deal of grief. I couldn't let go of the images of us together and building a much stronger relationship and achieving the future life I envisioned with her. So I tried to do far too much.
3. If you really really are trying to be friends - you both must be absolutely clear on wanting it and your expectations. I thought I was and look what happened to me. At any point after all these one-sided interactions I could have either been upfront about her previous intentions and desires, or backed away from the situation. K also was being difficult in that she expected me to read her mind and her ambiguous reactions didn't help.
4. What reactions are you hoping for when you break no-contact? I thought I had all the circumstances favouring me but look what happened to me. There are so many things that you cannot plan for, are blindsided from, or reactions you didn't imagine. They are all capable of causing you only more pain and grief because they delivered you the outcome you didn't imagine. Stay in no-contact and let them come to you. If it helps, imagine that your prodding becomes a subject for your ex to talk about to their new partner. I know K will definitely bring it up, just like with the stories she shared with all her other exes. It's not a comfortable thought.
5. Yourself. You are the only thing in control here. At some point she was hurting me but by continuing on, it was on me that I was hurting myself.

Now, because of my rash actions, the chance of us even having a friendly conversation, let alone staying friends or getting back together, is so hopelessly minimal. I am now focussing fully on living with my decisions, embracing my mistakes, letting go of everything and moving on.

&amp;#x200B;

That process is what I should have done a while ago but I got led astray on my path. I had to continuously deal with the consequences of repeated heartbreak including feeling off at work, being a liability to my colleagues, losing out on outlets of productivity, and all sorts of other things due to the time wasted in wallowing and ruminating. The biggest positive I can see from this is that I can share my experiences to you all. Please take care of yourselves and fight for someone who will fight for you, because I tried to fight a losing battle for far too long and held onto something that was long gone. I don't know about all your unique situations and breakups but the one constant in all of them is your thoughts and emotions and how you choose to react to them.

&amp;#x200B;

It is understandable that you don't want to give up even that slimmest chance of the dream life you sought with them. But I think, the surest way to achieve that is ironically - is to drop it and let go. If it is meant to be it is meant to be, but it won't happen unless they meet you halfway and it's not up to you to determine that. Relieve yourselves of this possibility which may never happen and embrace the uncertainty of an even better future on the horizon. If you read through it all, thank you for reading and I genuinely hope it can help your situation."
a6ojg6,2,2018-12-16,The Overlap,cbeckw,cbeckw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cbeckw/comments/a6ojg6/the_overlap/,"John Michael Edwards hated the cold.  It wasn't just a mild annoyance for him like it was for most people.  He absolutely hated it.  So much so, that he had left his life in Michigan behind and moved south to Florida for college to study biology.  What better place to learn than in the soupy melting-pot of invasive species that is the southern tip of Florida?  And when a research internship came open smack dab in the center of the Brazilian rain forest, of course he had jumped on it.  Jumped right in with both feet.  His hatred for cold had propelled him his whole life.  Pulled him along all the way to the middle of the stinking, hot jungle at twenty-four-years-old.  Waking up in a shallow pool of sweat every morning, throwing aside the damp mosquito net, dripping over to the coffee maker and brewing a nice, hot, cup of bitter caffeine, what could be a better life?  He was happy. 

 

This morning, however, he had woken up and felt immediately grumpy.  He felt off.  Off enough that he'd stayed in bed and rolled over, trying to get some more sleep.  After an unsuccessful few minutes of tossing and turning, he resigned himself to getting up and making coffee.  The others would be up soon, and he wasn't the only one with a passion for percolated energy.  He threw his legs off the cot and tossed the mosquito net aside, shuffled over to the coffee pot and initiated the ritual.  Rinse the pot. Fill it with water.  Change the filter.  Dump in the grounds.  Press Go.  Same as every morning.  Except this time, he didn't wait for the whole pot to brew.  In his agitated state he snatched the pot off the burner before it was full and poured himself a mug. 

 

He slurped the steaming liquid loudly.  Feeling the burning drink scorch the back of his throat and slide into his belly, paradoxically waking him up and calming him down, he smiled.  *Now that's the stuff*, he thought.  He could feel his irritation draw down and in, following the coffee to his stomach, and disappear.  He shivered.  Taking a second, loud, sip he wandered over to the window, as per his ritual, to look out on the jungle morning.  The third sip never made it to his lips.  It hovered an inch away, sloshing over the edge of the cup and splashing his bare feet.  The mug followed shortly, crashing and breaking, throwing ceramic and coffee across the floor.  John didn't notice.  He stood there, numbly, holding his empty hand in front of his face.  His eyes widened and his jaw fell slack to his neck as he stared out the window. 

 

It was snowing. 

 

~~~~~~~~ 

 

Billingsley held out his fist.  Four white plastic straws poked out of its center, each carefully lined up to the same length.   He ran his free hand through his black hair, pushing it out of his eyes.  He looked to each of his companions in turn, studying the slight apprehension on their faces.  He nodded to himself and looked back at his outstretched fist. 

 

""Ok, choose,"" he said. ""I'll go last, same as always."" 

 

Simmons immediately snatched a straw.  She sighed with relief at its full-length.  She was always the first to grab a straw.  Always willing to just get it over with, whatever *it* happened to be at the time.  She often said luck comes to those who act.  And it seemed to hold true for her often enough. 

 

Tellers went next.  She slowly reached for the straws, hovering her pale hand over one before quickly grabbing another.  It came out of Billingsley's fist whole and uncut.  She smiled quickly and handed her straw off to Simmons before walking to the back of the building into the women's sleeping area. 

 

Edwards watched her disappear behind the curtain wall before turning back to the group.  He groaned.  ""Come on, Robert.  Do we have to do this every time?  Just pick one for me.  I hate the suspense,"" he said. 

 

""You know I can't.  I know which straw is shorter.  Just grab one."" 

 

John stomped his foot like a child initiating a tantrum.  ""You're the team *lead*, Robert.  Just assign us a rotation again instead of this horse crap.  It'd be more fair."" 

 

Robert rolled his eyes.  ""Edwards, do we have to do this every time?  We *had* a rotation.  What happened to Johansson changed that.  I am *not* forcing anyone else to march off to their death!  Choose a fucking straw!""  He said the last with the forced deepening of voice that a parent uses on his child that won't get dressed in the morning.  

 

""Fine."" John said, then mumbled, ""I hate the cold."" 

 

Simmons laughed a short, clipped chuckle.  ""It's not even cold, you big baby."" 

 

John gave her a long look.  ""There's snow on the ground, Rebekah."" 

 

""Yes.  Snow.  We know.  But it's 65 degrees out there!  I don't have all morning and you're making Anderson wait out in the 'cold' while you wish and wash,"" she said.  She stared him in the face, a hint of anger tightening the folds of her eyes.  ""Get on with it."" 

 

John let his bluster die under her gaze.  Without saying anything he quickly snatched a straw.  It was short. 

 

""Shit.""  John's shoulders fell and he hung his head. 

 

Billingsley opened his fist to reveal the last full-length straw.  ""Sorry John, it's your turn on the blind."" 

 

~~~~~~~~ 

 

The blind was a square wooden basket rigged to a cable and wench on the edge of the clearing.  It connected to a pulley near the top of one of the taller trees, where it currently housed Mike Anderson.  The group had formerly used it as an observation deck to study birds and other animals of the canopy.  Back when they were just regular biologists not so many weeks ago.  Back before Johansson went missing. 

 

John trudged up to the base of the tree, kicking snow as he went.  It *was* snow, despite the temperature of the air being in the mid 60s.  It was cold when you touched it.  Freezing, actually.  Early on, before they knew better, it had even tasted cold.  But it didn't melt at normal temperatures like regular snow.  And, of course, it was summer in the rainforest lowlands.  It should be puddles of rainwater, not mounds of snow. 

 

A wind kicked up momentarily, shaking the treetops and sending a flurry of snow down on John's head.  *Just like home*, he thought for the umpteenth time and grimaced.  Brushing it off he shouted up, ""Hey Anderson, change of watch!"" 

 

""Heyo!  Coming down.  Watch yourself!"" Mike shouted back in his too-chipper voice. 

 

John stepped back as the cable vibrated and a fresh shower of snow drifted down, covering him again.  He cursed.  A few moments later the blind lowered to the ground as Mike eased the wench lever over one last time. 

 

Mike stood and stretched his back, flexing his well-muscled body taut, his Panama Jack button-down threatening to pop wide open.  ""Got the short straw again?"" He laughed.  ""The universe is cruel, eh?  You get watch twice as much as anyone else.""  He laughed again. 

 

John did not return the laugh.  He sighed and said, ""One of these days I'm going to strangle you, you hippy bastard.  How are you always so happy?"" 

 

Mike smiled.  ""The weather, my friend.  It's warm and sunny and snowy.  It's like a childhood fantasy come to life!""  He slapped John on the back and pulled him into a good-natured hug. 

 

""It is *not* warm,"" John moaned, pushing Mike back even as a small smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.  ""You're just a freak of nature."" 

 

Mike's cheery demeanor dropped at that and his smile slipped down to thin lips. ""A lot of that going around, eh?"" He fixed John with a stare. ""Keep your eyes open up there, and watch out for biters."" 

 

John took a step back and shot a glance to edge of the clearing on each side.  All he saw was heaped snow. Still, a small tingle ran down his spine like ice down his shirt.  ""I will,"" he said. And then, ""Why, have you seen any?"" 

 

""No, and that's what troubles me. It's been awhile. Too long."" He paused. ""Long enough I'd say use the horn if you see even a little one."" Mike took a deep breath. The air seemed to invigorate him and he cracked a smile and suddenly winked. He turned to leave. ""See you in 12 hours, Edwards,"" he said over his shoulder. 

 

John watched him walk across the clearing, taking his own path through the snow, until he reached the lodge and disappeared inside.  The slight sound of the lodge door closing carried across the empty space, muffled by the banks of snow, and passed over John, disappearing into the silent jungle undergrowth.  It would be at least an hour until the others made their way outside for chores and filled the clearing with the soft murmur of chatter.  John turned and studied the trees for a long moment before climbing into the blind and winching himself up into the snow-covered canopy.  

 

~~~~~~~ 

 

Hours later John sat swaying slightly in the treetop, bored. He fingered the valves on the trumpet they used as a warning system and wondered why he had never bothered to learn an instrument.  Could he even blow the trumpet loud enough if he needed to? He thought it likely it would just sputter and spit.  The horn had been Johansson's and John found himself thinking back to those first days in camp when Marcus played in the evenings.  The jungle had been deafeningly alive with sounds, then, and Marcus's horn had to work hard to silence it.  That was before they made it to the lodge in the clearing. Back when the guides were still with them and the most dangerous thing on their minds at night was the remote possibility of a jaguar stumbling upon them.  So they had built big fires and Marcus had played his trumpet, bleating a warning to all things that stalk the night that men were here and in control.  Funny how the trumpet still served as a warning but they certainly didn't feel in control.  

 

John leaned the trumpet to the side and picked up the blind's binoculars from his neck.  He made a slow scan of the trees, pivoting around to check the entire perimeter of the compound.  Having the blind on a single side of the clearing wasn't ideal, but no one had come up with a better plan.  No one had a concrete reason for having such a high vantage point, either, but they all felt it was needed.  As his view moved over the clearing, he realized it was snowing again.  Big plump flakes fell gently from a clear blue sky.  It made no sense but that was their reality.  Fresh fallen snow that didn't melt in the middle of a rainforest summer.  

 

*That's not the only weird thing going on, is it?* John asked himself as he completed his circuit.  The rest of his companions had gone inside for lunch around the kerosene stove and the clearing was once again silent.  *Too silent*, John thought.  *It's as if all the animals have left*.  Of course, that wasn't true.  They had seen plenty of animals and insects since the snow first fell.  But it *was* true that they had seen fewer and fewer as the days passed.  And every one of them had been completely silent.  No birds calling.  No insects buzzing.  No monkeys howling.  The *other* things were mute as well.  It was as if the snow falling had struck the world dumb.  Even the clearing was affected.  When they were outside working the sounds seemed to die off too soon.  Voices barely carried the distance to the blind some 40 yards away.  John would be able to hear someone if they called, but it was like listening through cotton in his ears. 

 

The only thing that didn't seem to be affected were the trees.  They still creaked and groaned in the wind.  Branches still cracked when you snapped them.  Or perhaps they were muted, too, their noises just that much more noticeable in the stillness.  *It's all so strange*, John thought again, as he had every day over the last few weeks.   

 

A small rustle in the treetops nearby drew him out of his thoughts and he looked up sharply.  He scanned the limbs quickly for the source of the noise and almost missed it in his haste.  It was a biter.  John froze.  The biter looked at him with dull eyes and worked its jaws opened and closed.  It's huge jaws were twice the size of its head and its head was the size of a large man's fist.  It resembled an ant but *wrong*.  It was all head and legs and mandibles.  Like an ant that had been pulled and stretched and squeezed until it was the size of a tarantula.  They called them biters because that's what Johansson had called the first, smaller, one they found.  The one that bit a hole in his canteen. 

 

The biter held John's gaze and widened its mandibles out and out and out in a wide grimace and then slammed them closed silently.  John's imagination filled in the click he *should* have heard and it snapped him out of his trance.  He slowly reached back for the horn, fumbling behind himself, but unwilling to turn away from the creature.  This was the closest he'd ever been to one and he did not want to find out if the things could jump while his back was turned.  Where was that stupid trumpet?  Finally, his fingers brushed cool metal and he grasped at it, knocking it over with a muffled clunk.  The biter scrambled backward down the branch and disappeared.   

 

John's knees gave out and he collapsed onto the floor of the blind and then leaped back up to the edge, searching to make sure the biter didn't come back from below.  He was shaking.  ""Get ahold of yourself,"" he said out loud and then laughed a breathy wheeze at himself for being so scared.  *It's just a bug.  Just a weird insect that no one has ever seen before.  You should be excited.  Scientific discovery like everyone dreams.*  Except he wasn't excited.  He was very much a cold, scared, college boy that wanted more than anything to go home and take a long, hot shower.  He picked up the trumpet and put it to his lips, not caring if the others thought he was overreacting, and blew.  A windy, whispery bluster came out.   

 

*Well, that answers that*, he thought. 

 

~~~~~~~ 

 

The rest of the watch passed uneventfully.  John spent his time alternating between watching the forest for creatures and quietly blowing at the horn.  He did not find success in either venture.  He gave up on both and instead watched the sun slowly sink down behind the horizon.  He shivered, even though the temperature had only dropped a few degrees.  He should be getting relieved, soon, by the first night watch.  They split the watches by one full daylight and two half night shifts.  The night shifts were a set rotation with the only exemption being if you had just pulled day shift.  In that case the line moved up.  It wasn't the best situation, but with only five members on the team, it was what they had to work with.  Of course, it would help if the rotation was set for the day shifts as well, but Billingsley wasn't having it.  He had taken Johansson's daylight disappearance hard.  He was sure Marcus was dead.  Taken by a jaguar or perhaps a snake.  Or something *else*. 

 

Johansson had been in the blind studying the wildlife in the snow.  They hadn't really had a watch at that point.  They were still going about their regular duties, documenting the odd snowfall and the way it seemed to hush the rainforest.  Marcus had been excited to go back out and look for more of the biters that he'd observed the day before and wanted to head out early.  He had taken a new canteen, the DSLR, a radio, and a fresh notebook. He was a man on a mission for scientific discovery.  The electronics still worked at that point. It would be a few more days before everything electric suddenly died.  When Tellers had called him on the radio for lunch and he hadn't answered, no one thought much of it.  When they went outside to yell for him, they saw the blind was on the ground.  Probably went to drop logs, Mike had said.  They had all laughed and gone inside to eat.  Later, Tellers had taken leftovers out to force Marcus to eat.   

 

John would never forget her screams. 

 

Even with the muffling snow and the lodge door closed, they had all heard her.  They had rushed outside and ran to the blind.  It was sitting on the ground, just like before, and Tellers was screaming Marcus's name at the top of her lungs.  Inside the blind was a neat pile of everything Johansson had brought with him, including the blank notebook.  Marcus had been a relentless note-taker.  They all knew what the empty notebook meant.  He had never made it up the tree.  They searched for the rest of the day and into the night.  And again the next day.  And then the next day the electronics died.  Without the radios and the GPS, Billingsley had called off the search.  He couldn't lose anyone else, he said. 

 

John shivered again.  Partly from the chill and partly from the memories but mostly because he really had to pee.  That was another change Billingsley had instated.  Use the blind to watch the perimeter.  Random shifts.  Only lower the blind at shift change.  Use a bucket for piss breaks.  John eyed the bucket in the corner and shook his head.  He just couldn't do it.  The girls had to use the bucket and he couldn't bring himself to soil it since he could just go over the side of the blind.  He had done it that morning, but after spotting that horrid, twisted ant-thing, he felt too vulnerable doing even that.  Couldn't risk it turning out like the canteen. 

 

""Where is Robert,"" he said aloud, ""He should be coming out for his shift.  Should have already been out.""  John looked toward the lodge, expecting to see Billingsley shuffling through the snow, but in the dimming light he saw nothing but humps of pristine snow and churned up troughs where his team had walked throughout the day.  He eyed the bucket again.  He shook his head.  *Fuck him, I'm not holding it any longer*.  He reached for the winch crank and started his decent.  When he touched ground he hopped out of the blind and made a beeline toward the outhouse situated between the lodge and the North side of the clearing. 

 

As he reached the outhouse his heart sank.  Mike's sandals were laying in the snow, tossed to the side as if he was in a hurry.  *Oh, gross*, he thought and wrinkled his nose.  *Must have the runs*.  He danced there in the snow, hopping from one foot to the next, trying to decide if he wanted to knock or wait.  His bladder decided for him and he ran around to the backside of the outhouse and unzipped.  His stream made runnels in the mound of snow at the edge of the clearing.  *Take that, snow!* he chuckled to himself.  When he finished, he zipped back up and kicked some fresh snow over the channels he'd made and turned back to the outhouse.  As he did, he noticed a trough in the snow off to his left that seemed darker in the twilight. 

 

It lead straight through the largest mound of snow in the clearing.  The one at the edge of the jungle. 

 

John's heart slowed and then sped up, pounding out a staccato beat in his ears.  The blood in his hands and feet disappeared in an icy retreat.  John lurched forward as if pulled behind a car with a dying engine.  Step, halt, step, halt, shudder.  *No one should go into the jungle.*  Billingsley's words echoed in his head.  But he couldn't stop.  His feet pulled him along without conscious decision.  As he angled closer, more of the trough came into view.  Step.  Halt.  He could see a small dark shape within it in the twilight.  Step.  Halt.  He strained to see clearly.  Step. Halt.  The shape elongated, filling more of the trough.  Step.  Halt.  He couldn't understand what he was seeing.  Step.  Halt.  Finally, everything seemed to snap into focus at once. 

 

It was Mike's legs. 

 

His bare feet splayed out, toes arched.  His hairy calves.  His knees.  The bottom half of his shorts.  And then a mouth.  Like a snake's.  It wrapped around Mike's thighs silently working the inches.  Beyond that, too many eyes.  A hulking lizard body.  And then shadows.  John couldn't see the rest.  Couldn't *comprehend* the rest.  The creature made no sound. 

 

John screamed.

I guess I'm trying to seek help because I know I need the help. It'd be great to have someone to talk to too.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently on an internship for 5.5 months and December marks my 4th month in the company. It has been an extremely tough journey for me and I'm constantly anxious at work. I'm not being bullied at work nor is my workload as insane as it used to be but somehow, I've grown fearful and scared of my colleagues and being in that environment. Just sitting in my seat makes me extremely anxious. I've cried at work many times and I think my managers and supervisors are sick of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I have developed some sort of anxiety and I keep getting panic attacks recently. I have no appetite and would constantly want to lay in bed and cry my eyes out. I would wake up earlier to cry and gag/try to vomit before I head to work. As my internship is tied to the school, I have tried seeking for help from my lecturer only to be told that I need to learn how to change my mindset. I've tried my best and it's not working and now I'm just constantly on edge 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm unable to get help from people in authority and I have no idea what to do anymore. Although it's only about a mere 1.5 months to go, I feel like I can't survive anymore."

*Uw Semi-wekelijkse overzicht van wat er gebeurde op RMTK*

##Actualiteit:  
-	**D'18 heeft nieuwe Vice-Voorzitter, maar niemand snapt waarom:**  
Oud D'18-gediende /u/Der_Kohl is Vice-Voorzitter van D'18 geworden, al is hij zelf ook niet helemaal zeker waarom eigenlijk.  
De nieuwe Vice-Voorzitter gaf aan eigenlijk helemaal geen behoefde te hebben aan post en dat hij het nut er niet echt van in zag, maar dat hij de post dan maar zal accepteren omdat hij het gebaar waardeerde.  
Intern schijnen meerdere leden gemopperd te hebben dat ze nu alweer voor de 300ste keer moesten stemmen over een statutenwijziging en een leiderschapswissel, maar toenmalige Partijvoorzitter en huidige Vice-Voorzitter Streepje (/u/-___-_) stond op deze wijziging (al weet nog steeds niemand zeker waarom eigenlijk).  



-	**Nobelcomité presenteert winnaars jaarlijkse Nobelprijzen voor de ModelWereld:**  
De Zweedse r/iksdagen presenteerde de winnaars van de jaarlijkse Nobelprijzen voor de ModelWereld:  
-	De Nobelprijs voor de Vrede ging naar de Amerikaanse Vice-President /u/Ninjjadragon voor zijn werk in het opzetten van de vernieuwde r/ModelWorldUN.  

-	De Nobelprijs voor Literatuur ging naar de Britse krant *de Guardian*, voor hun actieve bijdragen aan het medialandschap. (Dit ondanks dat r/MHOC in een referendum koos om de ModelWereld te verlaten en andere Modellanden niet langer te erkennen, iets wat het toch wel raar maakt dat ze een krant die actief is in MHOC de Nobelprijs wint).  

-	De Nobelprijs voor Leiderschap ging naar de Duitse politicus /u/christianlindner, voor het opzetten van een pan-Europese Liberale partij.  

-	De Nobelprijs voor Media ging naar de ModelTimes-journalist /u/AnswerMeNow1, voor zijn artikels over de Australische en Nieuw-Zeelandse verkiezingen en zijn scherpe interviews met politici uit verschillende Modellanden.  

-	De Nobelprijs voor Economie ging naar /u/padanub en de *Nub International Group*, voor het opzetten van de zogenoemde *NubBank*, die een nieuwe economische dimensie geeft aan r/MHOC en zeer binnenkort r/ModelUSGOV door salarissen te koppelen aan verschillende posities binnen de desbetreffende Modellanden.  


Er waren geen prijzen voor Nederlanders op RMTK, uit zeer diepgaand onderzoek blijkt dit te komen omdat niemand de moeite nam om een RMTK'er te nomineren en er geen Nederlanders beschikbaar waren om deel te nemen aan het Nobelcomité. Hierdoor was niemand in het Nobelcomité op de hoogte van alle Nobelprijs-waardige dingen die er op r/RMTK afgelopen tijd hebben plaatsgevonden.  


##Activiteit Kabinet:
-	**Ministers beantwoorden vragen over activiteit:**  
Tijdens afgelopen vragenuurtje zijn alle Ministers van Kabinet-graansmoothie opgeroepen om uitleg te geven over inactiviteit. Enkele Ministers (waaronder de Premier) beloofde beterschap, maar een groot deel van de ondervraagde Ministers lieten hun gezicht niet zien tijdens het vragenuurtje, waardoor de kwestie van de inactiviteit blijft doorspelen.

a6q4jg,1,2018-12-16,I [24][M] hit what I think is a rough patch with my SO [23][F],bumblebee_throwaway1,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a6q4jg/i_24m_hit_what_i_think_is_a_rough_patch_with_my/," 

Hi. I'm sorry this is a long one. I just don't know how else to express myself.

I don't  normally reach out like this. I've been with my SO for 4 years where  we've had on/off bits. She's an amazing woman and is very strong willed,  and to be candid I do think she doesn't manage her worries/anxiety well  (will get to this later). We met in college and just hit it off. We've  both grown into more mature adults and have built so much with each  other that it's never taboo to talk about our long future together.  We've also had our growing pains associated with said growth (e.g. I  would always get anxious about her 'going out' but I'm over that...  which I think that 'hump' for guys is quite normal when you haven't  matured yet and haven't trusted someone fully but like I said, past  that). The growing pain was also what introduced the 'on/off' bit I  mentioned where she said she needed a break and wasn't sure that I  wasn't the one. She felt suffocated and stuck like her destiny was  'pre-determined' and wasn't ready for that. Also, we're from different  backgrounds/religions... so she has a real anxiety about having an  inter-faith relationship (but neither of us are devoutly religious and I  don't feel the same anxiety about different religions) But we've since  patched (that was early on in the relationship like year 2).

From  that point I felt like we really connected more and matured. Still,  there's always a spectrum of ebbs and flows but our arguments were never  toxic or yelling/screaming etc. Just thoughtful conversations about  working through our emotions. We're also no stranger to long distance  and we grew stronger when I spent 6 months on the West coast for an  internship (we're east coast). It was very tough for me during that time  because I spent everyday feeling like she resented me for going. She  was worried that I would find someone else (irrational anxiety) that  wasn't managed well because she kept getting 'mad' at me for no reason  via text.

From there we both graduated  college. She is an aspiring dentist and I helped her through the tough  time of deciding when to take the dental admissions test. She decided to  wait a year (gap year) to take the test. I don't mean to attack her  just being honest, because of that major stressor she hasn't been the  most pleasant person always (ebbs and flows ya know). During this time  we were separated across the state because we were both getting on our  feet. Again, because long distance wasn't a strain we had no issues  besides dental school pressures.

Earlier  this year I managed to move across the state and get a job close to her  and her family. It's been a very tough year for me because I went from  light financial responsibility to full financial responsibility. and  adjusting to a new job isn't easy... So I admit I haven't been the best  version of myself always. All the while she studied and took her dental  test and passed with great results but her anxiety switched to hoping  she'd be granted admission to school. We've both had a great deal of  anxiety/weight on our shoulders...

On my  birthday 2 weeks ago she was notified that she was accepted to dental  school and is going to a dental school close to where we are and I am so  proud of her and have communicated that as much as I could.

Unfortunately  during that week, her step grandfather passed away. So, for someone who  doesn't always control her anxiety, the roller coaster of emotions has  really impacted her... And back to the religious bit, I was present for  the viewing and funeral and fully supported her and her family (to which  I'm seen as another family member now and I love them). However after  the funeral, she just flipped like a switch. She has barely communicated  this week and initially I knew it was to give her space and I respect  that and didn't intrude at all.

But my  anxiety bubbled up to an intolerable amount. Something told me things  weren't right. I was frozen yesterday. I use the gym to help and I  couldn't even lift the bar... then she asked me to pick her up last  night from a work event (like boss takes employees out for a xmas  dinner/drinks) and she was, very distant. It felt like she was forcing  herself to be near me.

This morning, she  had asked me to drop her off with her aunt/uncle to go shopping. On the  way, we talked. I don't remember how the conversation started but I was  trying to hold her hand while I drove and I could tell she wasn't  reciprocating how she normally does. I ended up saying something along  the lines of ""i know things have been very tough for you and I want to  be there for you anyway I can. I know you've asked for space."" I don't  remember what she replied because my anxiety was bubbling up to which I  basically asked ""are you questioning our relationship?"" and she started  crying and nodded.

The reason I gave so  much context above is because I wanted to illustrate how complex we are  and how deeply we love each other. Also because she's the kind of person  that when there's an anxiety/event (i.e. passing of her step  grandfather) everything becomes clouded in that anxiety and she enters a  ""impending doom"" mode. And I know it isn't just the grief she's feeling.. she feels the weight of responsibility to be there for her  family in their grief. She helps so much and sometimes to her detriment... I'm not excusing her behavior. But not everyone is perfect. Neither am I.

So  I did my best to try to stand for myself and our relationship. I truly  think that her mind is skewed with grief (understandably. I'm stating  that as a matter of fact) but I think that with her anxieties she enters  a defense mode. and that defense mode (based on this past week and last  night/today) has been directed towards me. She's processing a lot right  now and is thinking about her future... add grief into that mix and you  have someone who's 'unstable with anxiety.' I believe that our  relationship is strong and I tried communicating to her that all  relationships have highs and lows and this may be a low. But you don't  just 'get' a happy relationship 24/7. You work through things. And I  expressed my concern that her anxiety towards our relationship is being  skewed by the grief and other anxieties.... I don't know how receptive  she was to that.

I admit, I also called  her mother (we are close like that and it isn't really awkward that I  called her) to express myself and ask for advice. She resonated with the  paragraph above and attested that my SO's processing of anxiety/grief  isn't the best right now because she has a lot to think about.

I'm  sorry I wrote a lot. I hope someone reads this. I feel very alone since  I've moved to the other side of the state where my family is on the  other. And although my SO's anxieties may just be skewed like I  mentioned... it doesn't deter my fears.


**tl;dr: SO suddenly feels anxious about relationship after getting into dental school and the passing of her step-grandfather. I think her anxiety/grief is clouding her judgement and she thinks our relationship may be an issue. Trying to stand my ground and for me and her because I love her and myself and us... I don't think it's a dying cause. Any insight/advice appreciated.**"

a6qvs2,3,2018-12-16,This crush I cannot seem to get over. I get over ended relationships and love easier than this.,Ashamedclub8,heartbreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/a6qvs2/this_crush_i_cannot_seem_to_get_over_i_get_over/,"I met  this girl who was an intern at my job for 6 months. It's been a little bit since she left my life forever and I cannot get over it. Which is particularly weird considering my track record so far in life. I don't usually fall in love and even crushes are rare. Sure, I'll find a girl attractive, nice and more. But that's not something special. I don't think about it and certainly do not feel so down when the girl goes away. Love is different, I've been in love maybe once and have had girl friends. Obviously, when it fell apart I was sad. But this one girl, who I wouldn't say I loved because we were never more than acquaintance, is crushing me into little pieces. Why. I think a big part of it is that she gave all the right signs. Not necessarily that she wanted to be more than friends, but certainly that she wanted to be more than an acquaintance.

&amp;#x200B;

It started slow, for the first 4 months I basically had close to 0 meaningful interaction with her.  We didn't work that closely together and I am very shy and quiet among people I don't know well. My shyness was even worse around. There was something about her that made it worse somehow. I liked her as much as you could like someone you do not really talk to or know but that didn't mean much. I'd smile and laugh to her jokes when i was on my breaks and when were in the same room but that was the extent of it. In the last two months tho, we started working more closely together and our shifts aligned basically all of the time. I tried not to do small talk and stuff while working but we still did a fair bit and talked more about life and stuff as time went on. 

&amp;#x200B;

During that time, she clearly stated that she liked me, that she would want to do something outside of work that she wanted to be touchy, etc. Obviously NONE of it means she wanted to be more than friends if even that.  But it was something. But she did all of this in the safest most non committing way. She was putting it all on me. I had to ask her. Which felt and still feels weird because she is definitly aware that isn't something I'm likely to do. I considered doing it, but I guess I never built up the courage. Well, I did, but by the time I thought I'd be able to do it (last two weeks or so) she started being cold and distant. With like one exception on the day she presumed we'd last see each other. She had told me that day that her shifts were moved around and she would end on a different day than expected and this was the last day we'd see each other. She wasn't working with me that day so we barely interacted. I had intended to do a little something on her last day you know just to show that I cared about her and I'd miss her. It wasn't a big deal to me. I'm a very nice guy so I don't think it was out of character either, I'd likely have done the same for any girl. Or guy really, I did have a close coworker leave a month before she left and I did do something. I also improvised something for another guy friend who I unexpectedly learned would go on paternity leave the same day she was leaving.  In fact, that's kinda how I decided to give her the same treatment. I had basically told her about what I did for my guy friend right before she told me this was the last day we'd see each other. She gave a clear and obvious sign that she'd like/appreciate the same kind of gesture and even asked me if I had something planned for her too. That she'd like that. I told her that I did not because I expected to have two more days before I had to say good bye and good luck. She again reacted in a way that would indicate disappointment but also understanding that I couldn't have known the last minute changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, I did improvise something for her too. I had to leave work and then come back a little later for it to happen. So she REALLY wasn't expecting it. She probably thought I didn't care for her much during that small window because I just left with minimal interaction. I had to do it fast but I think it felt even more genuine and authentic when we had our last interaction and good bye as I unexpectedly came back to see her. Honestly, at the time I thought something might happen, she was acting different, way more shy and subdued than her usual self but someone kinda came in and put a stop to our last 1 on 1 moment. Kinda made fun of me as well for doing something ""special"" so to speak. We kinda just went our separate ways. For what I thought was the last time. I was feeling surprisingly well then, after 2 weeks of her being so indifferent and cold she finally had given me the reaction I wanted. She was all joyful, excited and everything. Sure, someone kinda interrupted it and I might never have seen her again but at least I thought it ended on an excellent note. I thought she cared about me more than she'd ever truly expressed so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Something came up unexpectedly 2 days later on her actual last day and I was called in for an emergency. I didn't interact with her then. Went home. Two hours later another emergency. This time the work place was quiet, barely anyone left. I knew she was there and I'd face her again. I felt weird about it, probably because I was actually gonna do something so I would see her again. I kinda hesitated as I would be expected to and came in much later than I could have. Pretended I ran into some trouble on the way to work. But I did come in and she was there. First or second person I talked to. Her welcome wasn't very warm, it reminded me immediately of how she had acted throughout the last two weeks. I was getting cold feet. And our actual final good bye has to be the single biggest let down I've ever had. I'm usually very good about ending things on a good note. I'm sensitive but self aware. Just enough of both for things to go swiftly, sweet and thoughtful but not awkward. I wish I didn't see her that one last time. I think I'd already have been over it. Not every crush works out, I can't keep in touch with every single person I meet and like, but I can at least turn the page knowing we were good. That everything ended on a good note. And who knows maybe I'd have seen her again in the future and something would happen then. Nope, instead we basically told each other good bye. She said good bye to other coworkers that were grouped together. Gave then a hug, And she walked away. I wanted to walk with her til she'd have to take the bus or whatever. But I couldn't. Well, technically it was possible but I was on pay and we were only given like 5-10 minutes for the farewell. So I didn't. It ended like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have not been able to get over it. I spend way too much time thinking about her and why/when/where things went wrong. I have three theories that I keep overthinking in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

A. Some people started joking around that I loved her (before I started having a crush) and she started to believe it when I got the crush on her. I could have been a little obvious from then on and she wasn't interested so she tried to get some distance.

B. She mentionned off handedly that she was in a bit of a pickle. She didn't want to share details and in the context that she told me about that it didn't feel serious or bad. I thought she just didn't want to tell me more because it was silly. She missed 1 day that same week for unknown reasons. This is around the time she started acting off. Maybe I just overlooked something that was actually serious and nothing actually had changed between us.

C. She was a sweet and gentle girl and was never that much interested in me but acted nice and all because it's in her nature. She didn't expect me to have crush for her and when I starting getting a little to close to her she backed off. This both seem plausible due to her personnality and unlikely because she had previously told me harsh truths,

&amp;#x200B;

I think I just need closure. But I've no actual way of recontacting her that wouldn't come off as creepy. Let alone things I'd want to talk about. I don't know what she knew/knows or didn't about my feelings.  I will never have closure and I don't know that I'll completely get over it any time soon. Time isn't doing much for me right now where as I usually get over crush very quickly. "

**Employment history**: 

1. Paid research assistant in RadOnc

2. Taught young children math and reading as a private tutor

3. Gap year job is working at the CMS in Baltimore as a social science research analyst (I haven’t begun yet, will start in January)

**Immediate family members in medicine? (y/n)**: Dad’s sister’s husband (uncle) and all three of their kids (my cousins) so I’m not sure if that falls under immediate or not. 

**Specialty of interest**: heavily leaning towards IM (and not specializing further), but honestly everything sounds so interesting

**Shadowing experience**: why is this here again on the template? 

**Graduate degrees**: nope, but in med school/residency/soon after I’m going to pick between an MPH in health policy, MPP or MBA

**Interest in rural health (y/n)**: rural health in a global and policy perspective yes, but not in settling into a rural area and practicing there full time.

**Letters of Rec**: 1 is absurdly strong, and I think the others will be pretty lukewarm. So basically 1 good one and probably the rest mediocre ones (the type where I got a good grade in a class but the professor doesn’t know me yet still cheerfully offered to write a letter and asked me to provide them with a narrative and my resume). Hopefully can get up to 2 really strong ones once I begin my gap year job from my next supervisor

**Notes**: 

1. concerned about no LOR’s from my formal research professors (considering so many hours spent, a poster presented, and like...15 credits of research taken). By virtue of bad choices on my end for the first lab and extremely bad luck with the second lab, I’m not getting letters, especially because I hated every second of wet lab research and did it when I was still trying to be cookie cutter. Eventually it became a paid position so I slogged through it. But ya is this a red flag? Because if they contact my PI’s, there’s a chance they say something bad about me. Don’t really wanna get into this. If necessary I’ll deflate the numbers so that they seem like less of a commitment, esp considering I hated research.

2. My grades. They sank because my close friend hung himself sophomore year at a time when I was also really going through it. This destroyed me and I ended up fully depressed. Stopped going to classes, stopped showering and eating. Took an entire year to become functional again (which is when I got most of those bad grades with the exception of Econometrics), and then another year to really gain vitality back w extensive help from a psychiatrist and my therapist. As you can see even with a retake I still did shit in Organic chem 2 when I really should’ve just taken a semester or two off. Econometrics was my last semester senior year and I just cannot for the life of me figure out coding so I just sank. The modeling was fun but working with the data sets was absolute ass. As mentioned above, research credit buoyed my GPA.

3. Schools I’m shooting for: T-20/30 as in title. Unfortunately, the field I want to enter within medicine/healthcare demands prestige so the more I can get, the better. **EDIT: what about T-30through50??**

4. I’m extremely confident in my writing abilities. I wrote/edited essays for 6 friends and 4 of them have already been accepted with each one of them being told they had essays that were compelling and styled in an interesting manner. So I think coupling my ability to advocate for myself as well as my experiences, I’ll come off as a competitive applicant. 

Can I clear the hurdles of my grades, MCAT, and suspect LOR’s though?

**EDIT:** Curry boi, so ORM

**EDIT 2:** By field I want to enter, I don’t mean IM. It’s tough to explain, but it’s a combo of policy/business/development. For examples look up Dr. Bob Kocher, Dr. Sachin Jain, Senator/Dr. Bill Frist among others. I want to spend the first half of my working life practicing and policymaking, before I move into administration and business."
a6r3xw,28,2018-12-16,"Spectrum Internet: Save the $50 Router Installation Fee by choosing ""Store Pickup"" at checkout and doing it yourself! Also Spectrum Internet: There's a $50 store pickup fee.",GordieSBD,LateStageCapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/a6r3xw/spectrum_internet_save_the_50_router_installation/,"I tried switching from FIOS to Spectrum and it was a roller coaster of a ride. Here's my tale:
 
FIOS and I had a good run. Steady, reliable service, yet  parallelled by steady, reliable, annual bill increases. 

Our relationship began four years ago. My $39, 50/50MBPS plan was like driving a Porsche while paying for a Kia. My IPad uploaded videos to youtube as my Galaxy S2 downloaded the songs that my Dell was uploading to Napster, all while my Chromecast streamed Netflix 24/7 to TVs that weren't even on just because 50mbps meant I could. I had a fined tuned, super charged, state of the art machine of a network. Anything was possible. 

Fast forward 4 years, things are different. Gaming consoles, streaming services, a dozen and a half WiFi hogging smart home devices running 24/7 are controlled by information spewing Hubs and network interfering Bridges, that clog network channels 2.4 and 5 like they were LA freeways. They've taken the shine off that Porsche. The ride's not as smooth, the paint has dulled just a bit, and over time the monthly payments have nearly doubled. And all the neighbors drive them now, making mine not so special. It gets me where I need to go just fine, but its possibilities are no longer boundless like they once were.

A few weeks ago I went and took a look around the lot of the Porsche dealership. I was thrilled to learn that Porsche has upgraded everything: their cars, their pricing, even their business model.  My mind ran wild. The payment I was making 4 years ago would now fetch twice the performance of what I had currently. And 20 times the performance with my current payment! No longer are 2 year leases standard. $50 Amazon Gift Cards are given out like candy as a token of appreciation for the purchase of the basic model. The supercharged model would get any Joe who walked in off the street a top of the line smart home device and a year of Amazon Prime. My mind ran wild with thoughts of what a long time, dedicated, loyal customer like me would get. 

With a few weeks before my FIOS contract was set to expire I couldn't take the anticipation. I was losing sleep, wondering what my new plan would look like. For almost a year, I've been paying the price of the GB plan, but receiving the same speeds I've had since Obama Administration. My mind ran wild. Maybe FIOS had 2GB plan that no one knows about, and they're saving it for their very best customers like me! Or maybe since I'm such a loyal customer they'll give me a year of free service, or name a new Router after me. Okay, I told my self as I called FIOS, don't set your expectations too high. At the very least you'll get 100mbps for $39, an Amazon Gift Card, and won't have to sign a contract. And that would be great. But I couldn't fool myself, that's what they were giving brand new customers. People who haven't spent a dime yet. As the Customer Service Rep looked up my account, I couldn't help but glance out the window, halfway expecting to see reporters from Gizmodo or The New York Times. They should arrive anytime now to interview me about being the first customer with the secret 2gb plan, or to review the about to be released router that would be named after me and probably be somehow portable and wireless and fit in my wallet so I could always have 2gb speed.

The Customer Service Representative came back with the details of the new agreement. I blacked out. 

I was finally able to come home yesterday. The doctor tells me his reports to the judge won't recommend any changes to my status as he's not a doctor, doesn't make reports to a Judge, and doesn't know who I am or why I keep calling him. 

Anyway, so I'm leaving FIOS for Spectrum. I goto the  Spectrum website. Enter my address and several options pop up. I pick 100mbps plan for $44.99. Goto next page. At the top is the cart with my address, saying ""Ongoing Monthly Charge $44.99"". I click inside and a drop-down shows the detail: ""Spectrum Internet: $44.99, Monthly Total: $44.99"". I go down the page and pick free upgrades: 400mbps(!) and a free WiFi router.. Cart at top hasn't changed. Next page. Cart at top of the page still shows address and reads ""Ongoing Monthly Charge $44.99"". Looks exactly the same as the last page, so why drop it down again? Because inside is how they screw you. A new section is included that says ""One Time Charges: ""Professional Installation"", $49.99"" and below that the Total for first bill is $94.98. If you close that again, the misleading banner at the top still reads ""Ongoing Monthly Charge, $44.99"" just like the last pages did, and despite what the inside says.

After reviewing the cart, and filling in some more personal information, the last section before submitting asks you to select an installation option. ""Professional Installation"" is the preselected default option and has no price listed. An alternative option, ""Pick Up"", is also available if you want to goto the Spectrum Office, pick up a router and install it yourself.  Spectrum describes it as a way to ""save money with no installation fees"". 

Now, if like me, you somehow happened to stumble across Spectrum's plan to charge you $50 next month, you'd probably uncheck ""Professional Installation"", click ""Pick Up"", then submit the form (or not) and go about your day, concerned with Spectrum's business practices, but relieved you weren't victimized.

You were.

When you uncheck ""Professional Installation"" and checked ""Pick Up"" (the option that will, according to Spectrum, save you money with no installation fee), if you were to scroll back to the top of the page, click back into the cart, click to view your one-time charges, you'll see that the $49.99 Installation Fee has been removed. And is now replaced with a Pick Up Fee of $49.99.

I'm almost impressed. Spectrum just DGAF. I'm imagining it's a Tuesday afternoon and a group of old rich Spectrum Executives are in the back room of some fancy Country Club, smoking cigars with Senators and Congressman when an intern walks in with the results of a million dollar FCC study showing that installation fees are unpopular amonst Spectrum customers and some badass executive gangster stands up and is like ""Who do they think they are telling us what they like and what they don't. We're Spectrum Communications. We give them the goddamn internet. If we didn't do it for them they'd install it themselves then pay us for letting them have the honor to do so!"" and then the other executives and Senators and Congressman erupt in cheers, and grunts, and they clink they're whiskey glasses in a toast to all of their brlliance and then decide to eliminate the installer department, raise the self installation pick up fees, donate those profits to the Senators and Congressman, wait for more deregulation,  merge with FIOS, crush all competition, raise rates, cut jobs, blame the Unions/Mexicans/Democrats, elect more friends to Congress, wait for taxes to be lowered again, take giant bonuses,  run huge deficits, get government bail out, cuts social safety nets, take millions in bonuses,   retire and spend the rest of their lives talking about how poor people need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. https://imgur.com/gallery/ptORKeV"
a6raqc,7,2018-12-16,CMV: Earning a single degree in an American University is by no means as difficult as people make it out to be,Dynamix2442,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/a6raqc/cmv_earning_a_single_degree_in_an_american/,"**I want to clarify a couple things I am not trying to argue here:**

* University is financially taxing and difficult on students. I am talking about difficulty of achieving proper grades and completing the degree

* Earning a degree becoming difficult while taking on other responsibilities such as a **full time job** or child, I do believe that working a **part time job** while earning a degree is still a relatively easy task


**My situation**

Dual matriculation student, music and software engineering. Part time job and internships.


**My belief**

The act of earning a degree, even while potentially working a part time job, is a relatively easy task. I am not saying it does not require work to be able to pass classes and complete the degree, however the amount of work needed to attend a typical class schedule and study enough to pass classes, even for weaker students or test takers, is by no means unreasonable or exceptionally difficult. I believe anyone who tries to claim that University is a generally difficult task, or claims that graduating with a single degree as the most difficult part of your life or something similar, simply lacks the ability to commit an average amount of time and energy needed to attend University. It is no more difficult than many other things that require work in life, and in fact may be substantially easier given a simple schedule.

a6s5ar,6,2018-12-16,"How X-men , Queer as Folk (USA) and World of Warcraft helps to shape my (queer) identity?",Trustthesocialworker,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/a6s5ar/how_xmen_queer_as_folk_usa_and_world_of_warcraft/,"## How X-men , Queer as Folk (USA) and World of Warcraft help shape my (queer) identity?

As a small kid I remember watching the X-men cartoons on television. People who were born different and were oppressed because of it. When the first X-men movie was released, I was 9 and I was still a big fan. The X-men franchise thought me that there is nothing bad about being different. And being different meant you have to create your own path. The X-men movies gave power to a lot of young (LGBT) people  (and/or autism) I met over the years. But in all those years I never accepted I was different aswell, I tried to fit in. In school, in my family, as a volunteer, as a student and so on.

Being somewhat different shaped me from even before kindergarten up till today. I was bullied the second I started going to school until I was 15. Because I didn’t really fit in, I wasn’t as skinny as average, had no interest in girls or sports whatsoever. I did play video games, watch a lot of films and series and I kept myself busy thinking, planning and reflecting.

## Contact (also the movie)

When I was 10 I virtually met the first ever gay person in my life. We talked on a daily basis for some time. I didn’t realize it at the time until I asked (after some time) if anything was new in his life and he answered with “I have a relationship”. I asked “ what her name was” and he replied; “it’s a he”. I was so awestruck that I quit the chatroom until 1 year later. But he was gone. After some internal conflict I realized I was gay as well. It took me a few months to process of meeting someone who *also* had similar feelings. I’m sad to say I never knew who that boy was and we never chatted again. This person gave me the nudge of realizing there are other people like me. Another X-men, you might say.

## Representation and early role models

In 2002 I discovered Queer As Folk (Usa). I was 11 years old at the time. It was broadcasted on a Belgian commercial network. It started late but I would be still awake when it started. I remember my mother diving to the remote control if she would see a glimpse of gayness on the television. So I would just continue watching in my room. While X-men empowered me to deal with my “being different”, Queer As Folk gave me hope and examples\* and a sense of identity. Even when you re-watch Queer As folk today, it is still as relevant as it was in the past. Maybe even more so. Expect they totally left out trans subjects.

\*\* I was shocked that the Belgian LGBT scene did not resemble my QAF filled imagination at my first gay party at the age of 16. Even at age of 27, I still retained a lot of that nativity which helped to see the smallest light in the most dark situations as a person, professional, friend, partner,...

At 14 I would be outed by classmates. At the time I thought denying it, would only make it worse. In a course of months I was bullied to such extent that I didn’t pass my grade, had to switch schools in a different city and my self-image ruined. My next school was more inclusive towards being different (in any form or way). I started studying photography and cinematography which gave me role models in movies, series, artists, art and games but also mentors in various teachers, other pupils.

## Gaming, World of Warcraft and my early family of choice and school

I started retreating into the world… of Warcraft when I was 14 (2005). I started casual but when I ended up in a starting raiding guild and even some raiding! Fellow  European players, usually a lot older than me, became friends and confidants and some of them even role models. I had one classmate and 1 cousin which I gamed with. It also gave me the chance to meet other LGBT people (by chance) and to realize I was not alone. Online I was appreciated and I talked with a lot of people. I would talk with people between 17-50 as there were my close friends. Most of them did not realise I was only 14 years old. Some of them were parents of their own children but I would enjoy their conversation untill late at night or even early mornings. And I still felt like an x-men, which I started enjoying more over time but also trying to force myself into the expectations, norms and values of the changing society. When I was 16 they organised a so called ""Guild Meeting"" in Amsterdam. I joined and stayed over at some sleazy hostel in the gay district of Amsterdam. I did not however book the hostel though! My guild mates took me under their wings for a few days. It was the first time since a long time I felt part of a family again. I ended up keeping in touch with alot of ex WoW people. And they enriched my life and gave me hope and care without even realizing it.

But it wasn't enough. I ended up dropping out of school after I had to redo another year of high school. I dropped out because I was exhausted by my lack of confidence and positive outcomes. My parents were not able to take care of themselves properly, let alone their own children. They suffered from mental health problems, addictions, physical health issues, poverty,... And still X-men and Queer as folk gave me strength, prospects, insights and perspectives. And I used games to escape into a different word. I needed to pass on 2 more exams to get my high school degree. I would start working without a high school degree for a marketing company I helped found for about 1.5 year. I was still 2 courses short for my degree after that job due to lack of time, energy and resources. I ended up getting my high school degree in my second semester of my first year of university college at the age of 23. Just in time to get my scholarship for school, 10 days before the deadline.

## The 22 year old social work student

A lot of people grow up with a hetero normative framework. Which works fine for most of us but it should never limit us being ourselves. Lack of representation and diversity but also role models forces people (not only queer people) to build their own frameworks to build their own identity. Mine were based on movies, series, cartoons, books and online interactions. These all shape your own identity, morals, values and person. They serve as a catalyst and building blocks.

At the age of 21 I realized I could look people in the eyes again and look straight while walking on the street. At the age of 22 I forced my way into a university college and  after 1 semester of social work I was forced to live alone and temporarily keep my own parents out of my life.  I was still the weird and different one. A white cisgender  usually presumed male to have some privilege, gay in a predominantly female environment. I also started to do a even more  volunteering for LGBTI and other causes. And I still used the framework of games, series, movies, my friends, my examples, my own values as a blueprint to create and force path.

As a social work student, living on welfare to finish his studies, I started to learn more about social work methods, sociology, psychology, social security and human rights. I would start implementing these frameworks in my own life, volunteering, work and later my own practice. I started seeing my own movies, series, games through a more evidence and practice based evidence perspective. During my studies I would try to become the best possible social worker out there and be there for my friends and family (of choice). I'd still listen to my favorite movie soundtracks and re-watch some movies over and over again. I'd binge watch Queer As Folk with friends contemplating about the series and my own life. And I still game on my pc (or Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 on the PS3).

## Empowering myself, random strangers, friends, my work, my clients

In my personal life I had to empower myself to overcome the problems I faced: lack of money, no decent home, being (a lot more) different, no reliable parents and just a few friends supporting me.  I created a family of choice which proved to be a great source of power for me to overcome adversity. Even other healthcare workers are amazed by the amount of energy I invested in improving my situation. And in all this time people entrusted me with their biggest fears, trauma's, hopes, goals. Even from a very young boy, later as a teenager and for a 20 year old something (actually 27).

After my final internship I started working for a Rainbow House in Belgium while writing my bachelor paper to graduate. It started as a replacement but there was a big chance it would become a more permanent position. In my personal life I was struggling with a relationship combined with my work, studies and own problems. I ended up losing my job even because of some changes the organisation went through. Even though my work was fine and I tried hard to fit in. I finished my bachelor paper, did my presentation and after this I collapsed. On welfare and later unemployment I looked for work. Which proved to be hard without a car or driver license (or money to buy/get one). But I wasn't planning to sit still so I started my own practice as a social worker while retaining some unemployment benefits (yes this is possible in Belgium).

## Empowering and solution focused social work with a focus on human rights

My practice is a mix of evidence based and practice based evidence. I combined my social work studies with my volunteering and first work experiences in the non-profit and profit sector. Social work as a method combined with a solution focused, a human rights and empowerment approach. Because that's what society need, that's what my clients appreciate in me. And guess what I do in my downtime? I still watch the same and more movies and series (some on repeat). And i'm still inspired by X-men and Queer as folk but movies and series in general. And maybe along the way or even at the start, I was an X-men all along, even though I did not feel that way because I tried to fit in and blend into the crowd.

## Develop your own role models, values, priorities an hopes

We all have our own role models, values, priorities, hopes and perspectives. Very different ones, based on the people we see, the stuff we witness, the chances and privileges we get, the conversations (we are forced to) have,... All these different aspects influence the way we think, perceive and act in this world. And I work with these theory's of mind, change of a client or organisation. But this should be the default setting of every interaction instead of dividing each other because of differences, different backgrounds or morals. Let's talk more about what drives us, what are role models and major influences are so we can enrich each other through diversity, dialog and consensus.

Thank you for listening to my story, hopes, perspectives. I did not tell my story correctly, only results, without (barely any) pain over all those years. Being different forced me to create my own path, methods, hopes and goals over the years. Not just for me but for almost every client, person, volunteer I met over the years. Through our setbacks, minority stress we develop the tools, attitudes, some form of education to navigate this world. And this is where the power of minority lies, to change the world of the better. Gamechangers, rule changers, hardworking people trying to survive and make the best of their lives. Empower yourself and let yourself be empowered. Seek guidance in trustworthy persons, social workers and institutions but not just any. Trust your intuition, your gut, your self and let your own stories be told to they can inspire other people aswell. Educate others and be patient with them and let them process things. We need to stay on course. This is my story so far. I'm hoping to hear more similar stories. I hope I contributed in some meaningful manner. Not usually a Reddit user but wanted to spread my message. Not sharing my full name on Reddit.

a6s5k1,3,2018-12-16,Feeling lost,TheLostIdealist,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/a6s5k1/feeling_lost/,"3 months ago I've become single again after being in a relationship for over 1.5 years. 3 days after my ex broke up with me I have been busy with my graduation internship for which I work 5 days a week from 8 till 4. I also work parttime on Saturday.
For those past few months I've been quite busy throughout the week and barely had a lot of free time available for myself. Only Saturday afternoon and the Sundays.

Now I have a 12 day holiday break from my internship and I suddenly realise how lost I am actually feeling by having all this time for myself. It hasn't been in a while since I have had to spend so much time alone and it truelly is just overwhelming me at the moment.
The realisation that I barely have spend time and activities by myself, like going shopping and such, for over more than 1.5 years now just mindblows me. 

I find it basically a very daunting experience that I realise how simply we can get used to certain things and take it for granted, being ir either work or a relationship, that when we are denied those things we can feel so tremendously lost.

Really needed to get this off my chest.

a6ta7a,7,2018-12-16,Identifying real cases,cheesy5739,Gangstalking,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/a6ta7a/identifying_real_cases/,"During the summer of 2016 I was an intern working for a left-leaning, union affiliated political campaign firm in Toronto, Canada. I was a part of a four person team recruited from a local arts university to study and engage with local youth on the issue of precarious work, an issue very close to my heart. 

During the course of my two month employment at this firm I was given a loaner computer to use, one that had screen-viewing utilities enabled. This was not disclosed or discussed with us, but I found that to be relatively normal in this day and age. 

As time went on I found evidence of more sinister motives. We were valued primarily not for the work we thought were doing, we were instead subjects being studied in preparation for the 2016 American federal election.

On the final day of my employment myself and three of my peers were given 5 Photoshop files to edit. Four small (2 gb) one huge (~150 gb). All four of us remarked on the size of the file, but didn't think much of it. Upon opening, my computed immediately froze up. My mouse did the hundred clicks in a second thing, going all over the screen. I immediately recognized it as a malicious file, navigating to Photoshop's scripting function to find scripts running. I suspected a hack, but couldn't say outright if it was really true (and if so) weather I had any evidence to prove it. 

I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Going out into the larger office I found literally the whole full-time staff of 20 or so busily talking around my bosses computer. As soon as they saw me everyone froze. Extremely confused, I asked for a flash drive to back up my work. I was told no one in the office had a flash drive (ha!). I explained my issue with the file, they said ""We don't know anything about that"" I went back to our office, and began to research hacking methods that could have used photoshop. Not soon after the file is deleted from my email and I am locked out of all work accounts. Not five minutes later, my boss comes in and informs me that they need to take my computer. I (stupidly) allow this, trying to think of a way to tell my peers that these bright-eyed progressives might actually be two-faced politicos. 

I asked to see my bosses' alone. I told them about the hacking and about how I knew they were studying us, and asked them for evidence to the contrary. They broke into tears and lied like children do. I escalated the meeting to include my peers. I talked for almost an hour, getting no answers to my questions except empty denial. I was told that my school had been called, but not the IT department as we had discussed, no it was the school's mental health team!

Leaving quietly that day, I walked home admittedly shook and paranoid. I had no evidence of anything! But my peers believed me, and that meant I had leverage. It was obvious to all in that office what had happened, the only question was would anybody try to prove it, did anybody care? 

Three days later I was scheduled to fly out to visit my parents for summer break. 

For three days a black Honda CR-V followed me, driving away if I walked up to it, lights on in front of my house all night. But there was no way I could prove it, at least I was going home in three days. 

So- I get to the airport happy to be done with what I considered at the time to be ""union thugs"", private investigators or something in that vein, nothing too unbelievable. 

As soon as I get to the airport, I see a man with what I would appear to be fake ""spyglasses""- think glasses with a obvious camera between the eyes. This is weird, but he's also talking about me. Saying things that if I repeated them would make me sound grandiose and crazy. I immediately see another, wearing a prop camera and talking about me. I go through security behind one of these glasses-wearers, absolutely stunned and confused. Inside the terminal, I experience what I would estimate to be ~40 of these people. They bombard me with sensitizing information, and then gradually, they take off their glasses, but keep talking about me, making it impossible to identify a stalker from a non stalker. At this point I am terrified that I am going insane and try to pretend not to notice. But I know its all real. The stalking ended as soon as I got onto the plane. 

There are many more details to this story, and thats what makes it so hard to tell. They wouldn't do this if it was believable. If you have any questions please ask.

a6ucwh,5,2018-12-16,(21/M) Extremely lonely after break up.,CommaUnoDosTres,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a6ucwh/21m_extremely_lonely_after_break_up/,"Hey guys and girls,

Just thought I'd vent/seek advise here, I've just been so lonely in terms of people to talk to and friends in general.

I got out of a three year relationship last month, I broke up because there were things we both were unwilling to change about ourselves which impacted the health of the relationship, and this obviously wouldn't work long term. To be crystal clear we broke up around 2 months ago but she cried and forced me to be friends with her (promising that relationship baggage wouldn't turn up in this friendship lol). I tried talking sense into her, telling her that friends would only work if we took some time apart to let go of our romantic feelings but she insisted and I turned weak and gave in to her demands, which led to friends turning into friends with benefits, and FWB turning back into a relationship, bringing back the fights and arguments. This ended a month ago, after which I realised how lonely I really was without her. 

A little about me, I'm the kind of person who takes a few meetings to get comfortable with a person and I'm too picky for my own good in terms of friends and relationships. I have no segregations such as friends, best friends, bffs or whatever, it's pretty much binary for me, either an acquaintance or a friend. A friend would be someone else's definition of a best friend, literally in my head I think of the tight knit group in the TV show friends when I think of the word friends. I hate socializing and making small talk. It's dumb obviously since friends won't just fall into my lap and I have to make an effort myself, but to be honest, recently I've been trying but I just think none of the people I've talked to or met so far are ""real enough"" for me to be friends with.

I'm also kind of heartbroken because it didn't take my ex even a week to go on tinder and sleep with someone else (we were each other's first), the reason I didn't want to be friends with her originally is because I didn't want to witness this, she told me that I didn't have to worry about it, guess she was wrong... I found out about this after my weak ass messaged her after a week to find out how she's holding up (low key, I wanted things to work out again). I pretty much wished her luck and blocked her off all outlets, although I haven't deleted our pictures, her pictures, I keep postponing it. I just want some sort of validity that the last 3 years of my life weren't a waste and I actually had fun! She did help me become better in some ways and I want to keep the mementos for it. 

I can't help but feel sad whenever I look at her and our pictures of having fun, when I compare it to now, the bland - boring - lonely life I'm living right now, it feels as if I made a mistake breaking up. But I know that it wouldn't work out long term, I live with my parents and elder sister, in my final year of college just finished a full time internship (didn't want to work final trimester of college since final project). My home life isn't the best, I have the worst relationship with my sister and there's a constant riff between her and my mom which causes dad to be involved and it's a whole thing with screaming and violence atleast a few times a week, in short; there's no peace at home. And a major factor of me being unable to cope with the relationship was the constant arguments we were having there and the lack of peace there was in the relationship. 

I tried downloading tinder, trying to look for drinking buddies, horrible idea, I know, but it doesn't matter since in Dubai, tinder is filled 95% with hookers for guys. I've legit given up all hope on that now and I'm just lost on what to do, how to feel normal and not depressed from the loss of my partner and best friend. We used to always be out atleast 4 days a week I used to never have time for other things, we used to do all sorts of things, go all new places, drive around, it was never boring. But now it's just like there's nothing to do for me, I wake up at 5 pm I realise there's nothing to do, nowhere to go. The friends I had prior to the relationship weren't really friends, they kept me company but as acquaintances, the group we used to hang out and drink with in the relationship were her friends (acquaintances), I neglected mine because I barely had time to hang with them (shitty thing to do, I know, but I would never do so if they were actually my friends). Right now I just meet up with old school friends once or twice a week and it's just a time waster, something to help me forget and despise my current situation. 

I'd like to think I'm an ambitious fellow and I've been trying to research and form my own startup. I've even started kickboxing to get in better shape and physically vent in spars (lmao). But whenever I think of her, come across her photo or anything about her, I just go into a downwards spiral and remember how much better the good times with her were, I know we broke up because it got to a point where the bad outweighed the good, but the brain has a funny way of working, in the relationship it only reminded me of the bad, now it is only reminding me of the good. I've been meaning to burn these romantic physical notes and Polaroids of herself and us that she kept surprising me with by hiding them in my wallet, but I don't know if I want to, I don't want all of it just *poof* gone. 

I get that 3 years might not seem like a looong time to many of you, but it's been the prime years of my life, 3 years ago I was a different person, an 18 year old dork who just graduated school. We spent all the 3 years shaping each other and it's just empty and odd without that person still there. I don't know I'm just typing really, I don't know what I expect to get out of this but I haven't got the chance to vent to anyone in real life, I've kept all this and much much much more inside me all this while with no one to talk to, no one to share with. I don't want rebounds, I don't want flings, I don't want relationships, I'm honestly just looking for a true friend, why is it so hard to come across someone you can click with. 

Anyways, I commend you if you've read all the way through here, there won't be a tldr because that was the tldr, probably just 5% of everything I want to let out. Like I said I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, but some advice or constructive criticism would be great. "

I also want this laptop to last me at least 4 years. I will continually use it in my grad school. Will need to do some programming like Python on this. Though, I haven't decided which field I am going to for grad school, either continue with HR or jump into Business Data Analysis.

Note that I will not play game on this. This is exclusively for school work and maybe internship.

a6wmau,28,2018-12-16,I'm afraid of myself. What did it take to kickstart you on your weight loss?,foodkrisis,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/a6wmau/im_afraid_of_myself_what_did_it_take_to_kickstart/,"Feel free to skip to my last paragraph for the main question.

I've always been a bit bigger than the girls my age since I was little and I believe that instilled in me a major insecurity from an early age. Although I wasn't grossly overweight at the time, if I didn't have a flat washboard tummy then I may as well not even exist. So I of course developed an eating disorder, bulimia, when I was 12/13. It wasn't severe early on but by the time i was 16 I was purging upwards of 6 times, even 10 times a day with a series of ""micro"" meals and occasional bingeing. I got to about 190lbs in high school at 5""7ft tall and thought that I was so huge. Honestly what I wouldn't give to be 190lbs now. 

After high school my bulimia tapered off but I kept gradually and slowly getting bigger until I went to culinary school and hit a high of 235lbs. This freaked me out and during my Summer break I went down to 200lbs on the dot from pretty much starvation (that wasn't a decision I made, I had been living abroad for work and was so terribly overworked that I did not eat that whole Summer). I came back from that Summer internship and my weight bounced from 200 to 220 and I yoyo'd between those weights for about 2 years until this past Summer where I went from my usual 220 back up to my highest ever at the time 240. 

Now this shocked me so I talked to my mom and we decided to pay for a diet called ""ideal protein"". It was a keto diet and although I was fairly apprehensive about keto I dove into it because I needed something to change. I lost 20lbs in less than 2 months and then I crashed. The weight I lost piled on even quicker than I lost it and I gained a few extra pounds for good measure. 

Anyway, the Summer ended and I started my first year of (ironically) a nutrition and food science program at university. The stress was too much for me and I pretty much closed off to everyone in my life. Since then, I have been eating on a daily basis to the point of being in pain. It got so bad that in the past 2 months I went from 240lbs to my current 266lbs. This is the point that I'm at right now. I am actually afraid of myself. My weight was only ever a cosmetic issue for me prior to this year, I had some back issues I needed to work on but other than that I was fine. These past few months though, I've noticed that I can't bend over or even sit comfortably, I get exhausted from walking to my car in the morning or just walking in general. I've gotten in the habit where if I have to climb a flight of stairs I mentally have a plan of action where I will b-line it for the nearest washroom at the top floor so that I can sit in a stall and regain my breath just to save myself the embarrassment of panting and gasping for air in public. I'm experiencing acid reflux regularly and brain splitting migraines. 

I feel as if I have literally all the tools to turn myself around. I have extensive knowledge about food from a culinary perspective and I am studying nutrition and have a good grasp on that as well. So I know what to eat, how much to eat, and to boot I can make healthy food taste really good. I come from a privileged background and have parents who are willing to pay for groceries and therapy to help me out. I have a loving boyfriend and tons of friends who adore me and support me. But I literally cannot bring myself to even try. I want to, but I feel so tired of it all. 

I have been telling myself for years the same old ""I'm starting my diet tomorrow and it's all going to be fine."" and often I even follow through on a diet for a couple months. But I always end up back to square one and in the end with a few extra pounds. I feel though, as if I am at my breaking point right now. I never thought that I could possibly gain 20-25lbs in 2 months, but here I am. I want to start working on myself again but I feel like i'm going to fail again and that this time is going to be like all the other times I tried then failed. 

I am so sorry for the novel, but I guess what I'm trying to ask is this, what was your breaking point? What finally catapulted you into a successful weight loss journey and how did you know that this time was going to be successful? I feel as if I want everything now without the imput of hard work and I know this is my biggest downfall. How did you deal with this?

(ultimately i stayed but she refused to talk to me until the day before i left and then tried to intimidate me. also asked me to swear on my mom's name. ok.) watching eric make excuses for leida and basically throwing away his relationship with his daughter is painful and i really empathize with tasha. and i commend her for standing up for herself because i was always told that i couldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

i do feel some sympathy because he's so afraid of being alone that the alternative -- having a partner again -- is worth drastic measures. but he's kicking his daughter out and acting like it's the ""right choice."" the right choice for who? because it certainly isn't the right choice for him and his kids. it's the right choice for leida but now she's just gonna pull that card whenever she doesn't get what she wants. 

&amp;#x200B;

i wish he'd stand up to leida as well but i've seen it too often in my dad; too afraid of being alone so he'll just do what she wants. at this point she's trying to alienate all ties to his ""former"" life so she can have total control and he doesn't even see it. "

The very first step for a startup is to design a brand for establishing an identity in marketing. After designing you need to develop your website or content in order to make your visibility in search engines in a higher position. An inquiry declares that people will specify those sites upmost which are visible on top in a search engine.

Digital marketing is the next huge thing in the marketing world. In today’s digital world having an online existence is an essential for every business. As per the job point of view, digital marketing is one of the quick blooming sectors in India and worldwide. Every big brand hires a personal for their digital promotion. Getting an exposure in this field can add some spark to your boring CV. Many people today study it after joining digital marketing academy and are ready to pay big amounts for the same. If you got money than you could absolutely go for this option. However, the best and the most economical step of learning this technique are through internships in the field of digital marketing. 

**Our Solutions:**

To overcome these challenges, we had to think out of the box. Some of the path-breaking techniques we implemented were:

· In order to achieve long-term goals, we came up with the strategy of launching AMP landing pages and increased conversions with the help of Google Optimize.

· Through the SEMRUSH tool, we researched paid keywords that competitors were using and their creatives. This information was used to start a competitor search campaign and bid higher on their keywords as well as increase location bids.

· We enabled RLSA with effective copies and bid higher for them to improve conversions.

· Through A/B testing of campaign and effective ad copies of AMP landing pages, conversion rates increased to 0.24% in a short period of time along with low cost per lead.

· Google Analytics is a very useful tool that helped us get useful advanced audience insights that were used for search and display campaigns.

· The move from Last-Click model to the Position Attribution Model allowed us to understand the process more efficient.

a6yl2n,1,2018-12-17,[M4A Playing F] The Multiple prompt list. Something for everyone! I hope.. (Multiple prompts) (Open prompts) (Light or dark) (Very long!) (,Soapydopey69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a6yl2n/m4a_playing_f_the_multiple_prompt_list_something/,"Hey people of DPP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:**
There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.



**The Virgin:**
I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas! 

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:**
Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very *bad* luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Tight clothing, CFNM and outercourse:**
Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!



**Incest is Wincest:**
A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing. 

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:**
Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more! 

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me.

**(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary)**

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes;)"

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant young and are wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

Tight clothing, CFNM and outercourse: Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me.

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes;)"
a70l8w,10,2018-12-17,Averting Disaster. So happy I could scream.,AltruisticDegree,QuittingTianeptine,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingTianeptine/comments/a70l8w/averting_disaster_so_happy_i_could_scream/,"I have been addicted to tianeptine, in all its forms, since January. 

At any given time, I would have hundreds of grams of each variety - more often sodium and free acid - around, thanks to some vendors with great bulk pricing. I couldn't sh*t properly for a year. My urine looked totally tired and diseased; consequently, I was having severe kidney pains on both sides. My eyes were hollow, my affect dulled. Many times, I wouldn't be able to get out of bed in the morning - this scared those I lived with, and seriously impeded my busy life. I knew this would go nowhere good - I have previous experiences with addiction, now in the distant past, but I underestimated tianeptine. Fully, entirely and utterly.

And the thing is, I never once felt ""high"" off of the damn stuff. Simply, ""contented."" And I grew to believe that contentedness was only possible in the presence of this chemical; this, for me, was the primary reason I couldn't bring myself to quit until the tipping point.

Had a few experiences with accidental cold turkeying it. I've never felt that sick from another opiate. It felt like my spine was snapping at each vertebrate. And so my secondary reason for not quitting was fear; fear of feeling *that* again.

In September, my finances were running thin. I was sick and tired of this cycle, and knew I wanted to move away from it. I began by ordering, then using what I had, experiencing a day of withdrawal, and then receiving my new order. I did this probably eight times, and each time I received a new order, I'd decrease my dose by 150-300mg. I switched to sulphate in October; likewise, thanks to you all, I learned about ULDN; I was able to get a prescription for 50mg naltrexone tablets and used the dissolving in 500ml of water method. 

I went from 5-300ug of Naltrexone in about a week, and over the next week upped it to 500ug. I have maintained this now for 2 months while I hovered at between 100 and 150mg of sulphate, 2x/day. I was that close.

Finally, my last six days I only had 100mg each day. I filled my empty baggies and containers with water and dumped them in the toilet and trash.

Because I get drug tested (which includes drug testing for kratom), my options were limited. Can't get tramadol; I didnt want either of these things, anyway, to be honest. Something else I could get hooked on... f*ck that, you know? But...

I have a long history with Akuamma (Picrilima nitida) seeds from Africa. They have a mild mu-opioid analgesic effect (Menzies, et al., 1998; Otoo et al., 2015) and I chose to go with that to assist me. I don't ""feel"" any (euphoric) effect from them, personally, but are traditionally used in Africa for pain, but there's no euphoria involved - and it's now been 10 days since I jumped.

I was really sick the first day, waiting for the Akuamma to show up, but not so much so that I couldn't be involved in the things that I had to be involved in. After the Akuamma arrived, my sickness (like a mild cold) diminished, but I was *****SO***** tired. I slept in class, I slept for 25 hours at home, I slept at an internship I was involved with... it was bad. Those were the first 3 days. 

But now... my mind is clear. I wake up at 7am, happy to be alive. I feel clear. I go to the bathroom regularly. My uring appears normal, and the pain in my organs is gone. I'm no longer exhausted, and the psychological boost from not being dependent on carrying around my next doses with me is indescribable. Me - with a history of addiction, and a history of that addiction running it's full course until I smash into a wall and harm everyone around me - I did it. Quietly and discretely.

But it was only possible with the help I found here.
My gratitude... I dunno, all. I feel like I can honestly say this: My gratitude reaches the stars for you.

a70ndm,5,2018-12-17,My boyfriend’s parents don’t like me because of religious reasons.,allusernamesrgonee,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a70ndm/my_boyfriends_parents_dont_like_me_because_of/,"First time poster over here. I would really appreciate some advice. 

I am 21(F) and my boyfriend is 24. When I first met my boyfriend he was part of a fraternity and quite still in the party, drink, drugs and rave phase. We met in first year of university undergraduate studies and have been dating for 3.5 years now and I have been blessed to grow with him into the mature man he is now. When I first met him I was a very motivated academic that studied all the time. We clicked because I always encouraged him to stay true to himself and he admitted that he hated going out but just did it because those were the only type of friends he had. He said My work ethic in school And maturity inspired him to get his life together and he actually began to go for what he valued rather than succumb to peer pressure. He started focusing on his grades more, securing internship positions, stopped doing drugs, stopped partying every weekend, and reduced binge drinking by a lot (but by his personal choice). 

Fast forward now 3.5 years later and he said he sees a future with me with potential marriage in the picture. I see the same so we both agreed to at least inform our parents of how serious we are. We have met each other’s parents but have never brought up the topic of how serious we are. I bring up the topic with my parents and their absolutely fine with it. My bf”s mom said that she would disprove of the marriage.

My boyfriends parents are very religious and traditional. I am Shia Muslim and he is sunni Muslim and if I am not willing to convert it is an automatic no for them. I was also shunned by them for celebrating Christmas because it is not in Islam. They also expect me to pray six times a day and be very involved with the Sunni religious community if I were to pursue marriage with my bf. My bf acknowledges that his parents are really traditional and apologizes for them and even sticks up for me in front of them but he said he just can’t pursue a lifetime commitment like marriage without his parents blessing. 

Some background info about myself:
I don’t drink. I have never done drugs. I was the virgin going into the relationship. I haven’t even been to a club because of personal preference. I completed my undergraduate degree in three years instead of four with a 4.0GPA at a top 10 university while working 30 hours a week to support my low income family. I basically had to raise my brothers because my parents worked all the time which forced me to mature at a young age. All my scholarships went towards mortgages and groceries but I appreciate the humility that I have gained in helping my family. Despite all of this, I was able to stay away from all the bad influences in uni and remain focused. I just don’t see how much more I can prove myself to be a suitable wife. Should I even have to? 

I just don’t understand how one can judge a person without getting to know them. I feel quite insulted but am proud of who I am. I feel like there is a double standard being placed on me when I was the only person that really brought their son out of a bad path. Also my bf (and all of his siblings) moved out at 18 because their parents were too strict so they don’t know any of what he has done.

How should I go about this? Is there even hope? Is it worth dealing with when I have kids and their grandparents are living in archaic mindsets?"
a70oki,3,2018-12-17,Anyone else super excited about the future?,insertnamehere255,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/a70oki/anyone_else_super_excited_about_the_future/,"I know a lot of people have been down for whatever reason because I too get like that from tine to time. But then my mind drifts and I start imagining what the future holds and my attitude completely changes.

I’m so stoked for what’s to come technology-wise.  Space travel, clean energy, graphene, etc.  Like we are going to send people to Mars, how crazy is that?! A lot of it is speculation on what will happen, but I can totally picture the majority of America driving Teslas in 15-20 years when used ones are affordable for low income people. 

Call me an optimist but I really feel happy when I think of all the cool stuff that is to come in my lifetime and future lifetimes.

Also, personally, I start an internship in less than a month, and it’ll be my first ever “real” job experience.  I’m looking forward to this next step in growing up and I’ve also been thinking a lot of what’ll happen when I finish school and move on to bigger and better things, like starting a family, buying a house, travelling the world, etc. Idc if this all sounds cheesy, thoughts like these legitimately keep me going with a positive outlook on life.

So what are you guys excited about for the future??   Any cool technologies you’ve read about? Anything coming up that you are excited for?"
a70put,10,2018-12-17,Watching Over The Purse Strings-TRUST GRASSLEY !!!,CaptainRoyD,u_CaptainRoyD,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CaptainRoyD/comments/a70put/watching_over_the_purse_stringstrust_grassley/,"**NOTE:** Originally posted at Dustin Nemos

Senator Chuck Grassley. R-Iowa, has moved from the chair of the Judiciary over to the Finance Committee. Grassley has initiated investigations into the Clinton Foundation/Uranium One political scandals.

Post **Q# 2451** on 11/7/18 (in part):

**THE SENATE WAS THE KEY.**

Chuck through the Senate Judiciary  was critical in getting President Trump’s two USSC and Federal Judges appointed. The keys to governmental tax and spending flow from the Senate Finance. Also remember Grassley valiantly held the line with BHO's Merrick Garland attempt.

Post **Q# 1345** on 5/12/18 (in part):

**U1 \[donations to CF\].**

Sen. Grassley is taking over from retiring Orin Hatch and has twice before served on this important committee. Chuck vows to return to bipartisan common sense solutions to tax relief and tax fairness policies.

Post **Q# 49** on 11/21/17 (in part):

**Follow Sen Grassley.**

**Why does Grassley (one example) have a higher than normal amount of security detail?**

Additionally Sen. Grassley will become the Senate Pro Tempore (2nd highest). Grassley will be remembered by the high number of Federal Judges he help shepherd through these part two years.

Two important probes that Grassley is interested in getting resolved are with Susan Rice \[SR\] and Joe Pientka. Sen. Lindsay will help ensure both are followed through in the Judiciary.

Post **Q# 2444** on 11/7/18 (in part):

**Shift to Senate Judiciary.**

Susan Rice wrote an “unusual” classified memo and sent it to herself on January 20, 2017 (Inauguration Day). Rice was immortalizing an Oval Office meeting from 1/5/17 that she attended.

Post **Q# 1496** on 6/13/18 (in part):

**Nunes/Grassley/Freedom C push for docs.**

In attendance besides BHO and SR were Biden/Comey/and Sally Yates. Rice’s C.Y.A. bizarre memo to herself after she was no longer employed emphasized BHO stressing “by the book” (BS).

Post **Q# 49** on 11/2/17 (in part);

**Why is Grassley and others held in a secure location?**

Grassley has a longstanding interest in receiving the documents from General Flynn’s FBI interview in early 2017. FBI agents Peter Strzok and Joe Pientka talked to Flynn with no lawyer present.

Post **Q# 2650** on 1/5/19 (in part):

**CONTROL/POWER.**

**POWER OF THE PURSE.**

Sen. Grassley has been demanding the records of these FBI’s 302 forms for months. Mueller’s court filings have backed up Grassley’s hunch in suspecting shenanigans were at play,

Post **Q# 2445** on 11/7/18 (in part):

**TRUST GRASSLEY.**

**Senate Judiciary Chairman.**

**\[House of Cards\].**

Patriot Chuck Grassley is truly beloved by Iowa and all of fly-over country.  Chuck has always promoted youth internships and mentoring programs.

When QAnon states that we should TRUST GRASSLEY, that is good in my book fellow Patriots!

I am going to university in August, it’s about 3 hours from home, I have a full ride due to academics so following him or go anywhere else is NOT an option. While he goes to University really close to home. He graduates in one year where I have not even started for four years yet, then his career will be starting. He has so much potential, he has had internships out of the country and upcoming ones out of state. It is not doubtful that he will be out of state or out of country when he graduates next year. 

He is the best man I have ever met, so loving, so kind, so funny. It is so devastating to be breaking up while still in love with him. But it’s just the right thing to do. 

We are at different points in our lives, we have different cultural backgrounds, we have different sex drives. 

We get along so well, he is my best friend in the whole world. My whole heart. My number one. But fundamentally we are not going to make it to have a future. So we believe that the best thing for both parties is to end it now, save pain and time now. 

So please give all advice on how you healed, did you ever move on, what is your life like now? 
I am currently in the state of I believe it’ll always be him, in every guy I ever pursue afterwards, they will never match up to him. I feel like I am always going to be beyond devastated and saddened. 

TLDR:So I just need advice on how to heal, how to move on, how is your life now after going through a breakup while still in love

You have great advice so I'm turning to you. TL;DR at the bottom! 

**Background**

I arrived in the US end of September for a six months internship. I wanted to have friends and maybe friends with benefits, as it's a type of relationship I enjoy a lot (the actual friendships and discussions, but also the physical affection, with no long term commitment as I'm not here for long, it's a good package for me) , so I hit the dating apps. I meet a few people, including this girl, Mary. She's not looking for anything serious either, but really quickly, I feel like my relationship with Mary is going to be different from usual FWBs. 

We text every day, not all day long but still. We have a lot in common, but also a lot of things where we're different which makes it interesting. She's super smart, super cute, we connect in a lot of way. She's on the asexual spectrum, so we take our time, I know she's quite inexperienced so we go at her pace. It's also okay with me because even though I'm quite sexual, I have other people I can have sex with. I know she's not seeing anyone else but me, she knows I have other FWBs but she doesn't know the details. 

We've now been seeing each other for over two months, we see each other once a week, rarely twice, we've been on two weekends getaway together (2 and 3 days), she's been telling me that I really inspire her to be better and to grow as a person, and honestly I also find her super inspiring. I like her a lot, she's an awesome person, and I've had moments of freaking out about ""omg am I developing feelings for her"" (answer being yes, most likely). 


**Now**

A week ago, she texted me that she almost told me ""love you bye"" when leaving, that it might slip up, and was I okay with that. She then texted me that she meant it as a friend and that's how she says goodbye to all her friends.

But then, just a week later, she texted me this after we hung out :

""No wait! (I wanted to ask you this in person but I kept getting distracted with interesting conversations) Would you consider dating? I know you're not looking for romantic commitment so it wouldn't have to mean that, I would just personally like to be your girlfriend rather than a friend. You don't have to respond right away, but will you think about it? 🙂""

That confused me a lot, because I don't know what dating means if we don't have a form of romantic commitment. But I also didn't panick, which is a good sign for me. I told her I would think about it.

And the truth is, I would really like to date her. But I'm afraid about getting attached in leaving in 3-4 months, and I don't really want to stop seeing my friends with benefits. I care genuinely about these people as friends, and they also allow better to have my sexual needs met since Mary and I are not really having sex. I would be ready to see my FWBs less, to be super transparent with them that she's my priority, to cut off any of them that wouldn't respect that relationship, and not to look for anyone new, but I would still like an open relationship. In the past, I have been in one monogamous relationship where it didn't feel right to be sexually exclusive but I didn't dare to speak up. I also know this is somewhat unfair to her because she probably wouldn't be seeing anyone but me, but if she wants to see other people I will support her in that.

Of course I need to discuss this all with her, but she's away on holiday, so I'm thinking of sending her a message to give her my answer and spark the conversation.


**The message :**

""Hey! So I've thought about us dating. And to be honest, I was already thinking about it before you asked, because our relationship is basically already a dating relationship much more than a friend with benefits relationship. I also really like you, I love spending time you, I feel way stronger about you than I feel for a FWB, I know that I like you more than a friend. So yes, I would love to date you 😳 I would be really happy to have you as my girlfriend. 

But then I also have questions, concerns that we need to discuss. First I'm leaving in just a little over 3 months. So I'm afraid we're setting ourselves up for heartbreak when I will leave SF, I'm afraid we will get more attached and it will hurt more. That might be just a future problem though, and maybe I'm looking too much ahead, but you know it, that's what I do :P and I still think we might want to give it a thought. 

Secondly, I'm not sure where we would stand on physical exclusivity. I feel like I can definitely give you romantic commitment. But you know that I'm seeing other people, I don't feel the same way for them as I feel about you, but I do care for them as friends, I have sex with them: I dont share the same type of connections with them as I do with you but I do value these relationships. Would you be okay with me keeping up these relationships, maybe with some boundaries that we could discuss together to make it more comfortable for you, or is that a dealbreaker for you ? In other words, would you be willing to consider having an open relationship where we would be romantically committed to each other but free to have other sexual partners, with communication and transparency all around of course ?

 There is no right or wrong answer to that, and I understand if you need time to think about it. I will absolutely understand any answer you have on that, and please feel free to ask me any questions or express any concern you may have. I really care about you and I dont want you to feel pressured into anything. ""

What do you think?

**Tl;dr : I've become very close with one of my friends with benefits, and she wants us to be girlfriends, but it could be"" without the romantic commitment ""(??). I'm ready to give her romantic commitment, it's sexual exclusivity that I don't feel ready for. I want to ask her for an open relationship, what do you think of my message to suggest her that?**

Edit : I also would prefer to tell her all of this in person, but she's away for two weeks and I don't want her to have to wait two weeks for an answer. Plus, maybe the distance could help her think about it? And then she would give me her answer / we would discuss boundaries in person?"

a732uf,64,2018-12-17,Christmas cheer came our way,Hey_oheather,SantasLittleHelpers,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantasLittleHelpers/comments/a732uf/christmas_cheer_came_our_way/,"I hadn’t really been into Christmas this year. I’m a single parent of a two year old, and didn’t think I’d be able to provide anything for Christmas so I just sort of shoved Christmas off as a whole. 

My sister invited my son &amp; I to spend Christmas Eve at her house, so our kids could wake up and have Christmas morning together. I imagined going up north for Christmas with her, and having her kids receive gifts and my son would wonder why he doesn’t get any. I politely declined the invitation, and admitted to her that Santa wasn’t coming for my son and I was a bit embarrassed. I wanted to stay home where he wouldn’t know that Christmas includes gifts. That’s when I broke down about Christmas.

I googled what to do when you can’t provide Christmas and stumbled across Santa’s Little Helpers. Thanks to two very kind &amp; generous members, u/mistydawnk76 and u/allthedaquiries , my son now received three gifts to open and be excited about. But the giving didn’t end there.

After joining this group, I told my best friend about everything. I hadn’t told her about how hard things were financially for me because well, it’s embarrassing and tough to admit. I’ve had a lot happen this year and generally have been focusing on the positives. I left a 5year long emotionally/mentally abusive &amp; controlling relationship a year ago—I’ve since gone back to college, for my internship (needed for my degree) I was placed at an amazing nonprofit that does such great things for the community, I moved my son &amp; I out of a relatives house and into our own apartment, and we have been doing really well spiritually. I didn’t want to tell my friend about Christmas because I didn’t need pity, I was proud of how far we’ve come and wanted to keep focusing on that.
Fast forward. I worked a long double shift this weekend with that best friend, at the end of her shift she went to her car and came back with two target bags. She went and bought my son a toy car, a fishing game, pants, and two shirts. I started bawling immediately. Part of me at first felt bad that she did this, she’s not in the best financial spot either, but her &amp; her husband insisted that they help provide Christmas for my son. I realized it wasn’t out of pity, it was 100% out of love.

After all of that I was feeling so incredibly blessed. The next day I went to pick my son up from my parents (they had him while I worked 4:30-4:30), I told my mom everything. I was feeling the Christmas spirit and was thinking of finding a small used Christmas tree to put in my apartment. She stopped me and said she had one that I could have. It’s pre-lit and everything. I was able to get ornaments that a woman online was giving away on Facebook for free. 

I put our new-to-us cute little tree up, and decorated it with my son. He was enamored with the shiny ornaments and lights!  I’m about to wrap the Christmas presents for my son. We’ll be joining my sister and her family for Christmas, and my son will have gifts to open alongside his cousins. 

I guess the point of this is that because of this group my son is going to have a beautiful Christmas. Without all of your generosity, I would have never opened up to my friend, I wouldn’t have been interested in putting up a tree, and I wouldn’t be taking my son to celebrate with family until after the gift giving was over with. Because of this group, one act of kindness snowballed into multiple acts of kindness, all leading to what I’m sure will be a Christmas to remember. 

It’s just so beautiful to me that everyone came together. My son won’t know how many people kindly opened their hearts to provide his Christmas, but I will. I will never forget any of this and I look forward to being in a position where I too can give. Thank you to everyone involved with Santa’s Little Helpers, I can’t say thank you enough, with every inch of my being I thank you. You have restored my Christmas spirit and I can not wait to teach my son to have this kindness and compassion for others. Thank you."
a73qvx,21,2018-12-17,Amazing Consultation with Excision Specialist,mysterycorgi,endometriosis,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/a73qvx/amazing_consultation_with_excision_specialist/,"I wanted to share my wonderful experience during a recent consultation with an excision specialist. Feel free to skip my history to read about the meeting, I won't be offended! I'm just including the history to give perspective on why I feel this consultation was such a positive experience.

**A bit of history:**

 I'm 26 and have suffered from terrible periods since I was 9 or 10 years old. Between my dysphoria and the general attitude of medical practitioners I saw growing up, I had no confirmation that anything was wrong. I felt like it was wrong for me to be so sick, but everyone had a ""that's just how it is"" attitude. Even going to an all-girls school and seeing that none of my peers were having issues to the degree I was couldn't get me anywhere as far as being taken seriously. At one point I stopped functioning from the waist down due to the pain and I had to drag myself using only my arms to try to get help. (Apparently that wasn't alarming to anyone who witnessed it? I can't fathom it.) Eventually my doctor told me to suck it up and had me take three 300mg Ibuprofen, three times per day for about five years. I'm glad I still have my liver, tbh. This entire time I was prescribed hormonal birth control pills to try to manage my symptoms.

I was sexually assaulted in 2011, and everything went downhill from there. By 2013 I was bedridden due to pain and hallucinated frequently. In less than a month I gained 80 pounds. I became a frequent flyer at the ER and was blown off frequently. I evenutally gained 190 pounds in a little over a year and a half. No one took me seriously before the weight piled on, and no one even bothered to try after. One ER nurse told me that I was overreacting to period cramps and would need to learn how to stop being so dramatic. A CT scan revealed that my appendix was swollen and about to burst, so I had an appendectomy in February 2014.

I finally got an OBGYN to agree to do an exploratory lap in May 2014. I was diagnosed with endometriosis and uterine fibroids. They burned some of the endometriosis off of my right ovary. For about a month I started to feel like my old self again and thrive. And then I was struck down by the pain again, despite being put on depo-provera immediately after surgery to try to maintain my symptoms. While at the ER (to pick someone else up) I bumped into the nurse that told me to stop being dramatic about my ""cramps."" She asked how I was and I said that I'd just had a lap and been diagnosed with endometriosis. She told me that she had endometriosis too, ""what a small world!"" I seriously contemplated murder in that moment. I can't imagine being so unsympathetic to blow off a patient, knowing full well the hell that endometriosis is first hand. Since I found out about endometriosis/fibroids/PCOS, I have encouraged everyone I know to get checked the moment I hear that they have any unusual pain or symptoms. I don't want anyone to be screwed over like I have. But what's done is done.

Fast forward to 2017, I managed to drag myself through life, hating every second of pain I endured. I finally had a job I was enjoying and succeeding at. Until the pain got so bad I was unable to sit in an office chair, stand, lay down or do much of anything. The surgeon I met with was great, but ultimately hesitant to do surgery until I lost weight. At 5'4"" and 340 pounds, I was too much of a risk. I was encouraged to keep taking the depo-provera, which we all know *doesn't cause weight gain*, just prevents the body from being able to tell it is full. We also found PCOS during an ultrasound at one of these appointments. So I've got the triple-whammy of endo-PCOS-fibroids. Joy. And when you treat one with hormones the other two get worse, at least in my case. I lost my job and my home and my spouse and I stayed a short while with my mom, starting October 2017.

In January 2018 I was prescribed depo-Lupron because once again, I was considered too fat for surgery. The first shot sent me to the ER with some sort of bizarre anaphylaxis. At one point I didn't know where I was, I thought I was in a hospital in a different city and I needed to be wheeled around in a chair or gurney because I was completely dazed. Despite this, the OBGYN insisted I finish out the next two months of shots. The side effects were hellish and I was still in pain. I'm still getting hot flashes, and it'll have been a year next month. 

I'd given up hope after this. I felt like the local OBGYNs were not meeting my needs or taking me seriously at all. I had a bad case of despair. 

But on a whim I started to look into excision specialists to see if there were any nearby who might accept medicaid. I'm in southern Illinois, so four hour drive up to Chicago seemed like it would kill me on a good day, and I couldn't tell if the specialist up there actually took my brand of medicaid, so I went out on a limb and got a referral to an excision specialist in St. Louis. St. Louis is only about an hour and a half away, so more doable for me. 

**The Consultation:**

The specialist in question is [Patrick Yeung Jr, MD](https://physicians.slucare.edu/details/639/patrick-yeung_jr-obstetrics__gynecology-st_louis), who is based out of the St. Louis University Hospital. When I met with him, he was extremely professional and courteous. But as we talked I came to realize, he actually cares. Though he has a calm demeanor, there is a passion in the way he speaks about spreading awareness and educating people about Endometriosis. He firmly believes that patients should not have to endure abnormally painful periods. Any cramping that goes beyond a mere annoyance is a sign of potential illness, and to say otherwise is to forego the health of the patient in favor of outdated and biased misinformation. 

He says that he hopes to help solve the issue of underdiagnosed endometriosis that plagues the population. The fact that  an estimated one in ten people have endometriosis (those who are diagnosed, anyway) while research and funding is put on the backburner is unacceptable to him. I gotta admit, even though he was calmly stating his thoughts and feelings, I was getting a bit excited, because I felt incredibly validated. I was having to keep my voice lowered, but I was about to shout from the rooftops, I was so thrilled to be taken seriously by Dr. Yeung. 

He never brought up my weight, unlike the scores of other doctors I've been to. I waited and waited but he never mentioned it. So I tested the waters a bit, and threw out a comment to see if I could gauge his reaction. I told him about how on the depo-provera I'd gained 190 pounds and just couldn't seem to get rid of it despite my best efforts. He smiled in a knowing sort of way and said, ""It's funny, officially depo-provera does not cause weight gain as a side effect, according to drug studies and official documentation. But if a patient experiences a side effect in which they do not experience feeling full and thus have difficulties moderating what they eat or how much, they can still gain weight. Even if the official side effect is worded a little differently."" I commented that it was a ridiculous practice, and he nodded his agreement.

By this point I was feeling very confident in Dr. Yeung as an option for surgery. He walked me through the process of excision and details about endometriosis--most of which I already knew from copious amounts of research online, but he took the time to make sure we were on the same page about everything. And then he asked me something I never thought any medical professional would ask me: if I was comfortable with my uterus being removed if they felt it was medically necessary during my surgery. I've wanted to have my uterus removed basically since I got my first period. I've never wanted children and I am extremely afraid of pregnancy. But every time I've asked about it doctors always gave the ""you're too young, what if you change your mind"" or ""you have to wait until you're 35"" or ""you need to have two children first"" or ""we need to ask your husband for permission"" runaround BS. So when he just offered it, I almost cried. I did tear up a bit. I told him how I feel about pregnancy and that my spouse and I don't want children, and if we ever were at a point in our lives where we felt we could raise a kid, we would prefer to adopt. And Dr. Yeung took me at my word. No questioning my motivations or feelings. No guilt trips. I started tearing up a bit at this point. I almost hugged him, but decided to save it for after the surgery.

When I asked what had gotten him into excision, he noted that even though it's a less common specialization, it ultimately helps in a way that simply burning the endometriosis does not, and that another goal is to help patients not have to go through repeat surgeries, if possible. He then told me that his wife was eventually diagnosed with endometriosis after he had specialized in it. He was already passionate about treating endometriosis, but the added 'close-to-home' factor just fueled the fire, it seems.

He performed a pelvic exam, was very professional and managed to not cause me a great deal of pain, which is awesome and rare. Even more rare is I almost hugged him after the pelvic exam, which is a miracle considering I've punched nurses, doctors, interns, and my spouse on more than one occasion. While waiting to schedule my surgery I ended up getting sniffly and teary-eyed and had a bit of a cry. I wasn't the only one who had done so after meeting Dr. Yeung, according to the lovely staff who helped me schedule everything.

I'm scheduled to have surgery in April. I am thrilled. I really feel like I'm going to be in good hands. I will keep you posted as to how it goes!

Also I would like to note that Dr. Yeung now has a partner who also performs excision, [Jose Eugenio-Colon, MD](https://physicians.slucare.edu/details/1120/jose_-eugenio-colon-minimally_invasive_gynecologic_surgery-obstetrics__gynecology-chesterfield-st_louis?FreeText:Last+name=Eugenio-Colon). Also the SLUCare Center for Endometriosis has teamed up with a research group. I opted to allow my tissue to be donated to help out other patients, in case any is viable for the studies/trials.

If you are in the Southern Illinois/Missouri or surrounding areas, I can only recommend looking into getting an appointment at the SLUCare Center for Endometriosis. I definitely will vouch for Dr. Yeung. But do it sooner than later, it seems like the surgery waitlists are filling up, as April was the soonest I could schedule out when I went to the appointment in November.

Thank you for reading. If you have any questions let me know and I'll try to answer them! Also if you are a patient of Dr. Yeung's I'd love to hear what you have to say. And last of all, please don't give up. I was in a really dark place and contemplating terrible things, but persisting really helped, and I finally feel hope. I know it gets difficult when you aren't taken seriously as a patient, let alone as a human being. But you deserve better. To be happy and healthy. Please keep fighting."
a73seq,32,2018-12-17,I wish I had never pursued medicine as a career,Mimikyu030,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/a73seq/i_wish_i_had_never_pursued_medicine_as_a_career/,"I feel burnt out, depressed.

My family is financially strained because of my parents paid for what my student loans couldn't cover (I ended up attending a private institution with one of the highest tuition costs. Believe me, if I could have gone to a state medical school I would have). I am about 300K in debt last time I checked, including undergraduate. I did have part time jobs in undergrad to make ends meet, but I wasn't able to earn money during medical school because I was barely keeping afloat with school work. 

I'm an intern, now 6 months in, feeling like the only things I am doing are making phone calls and getting paperwork necessary for discharge. I don't think I improved in the actual ""doctoring"" skills. I think the third year medical students in my institution do a better job managing patients. 

Basically, I'm unhappy. I've been coming back home each day and find myself curled up in bed. House is a mess because I can't bring myself to clean. I've been missing out on meals because I can't find the energy to cook or go out. I've been eating microwaveable food if I could bring myself to get up.

Some of the higher ups in the program know that I am unhappy, but I am afraid to tell them the whole extent because they already see me as weak and whiny. I had wanted to pursue a fellowhip when I started (not sure about this now) so I can't tell them about my problems anymore for the fear that if I somehow make it out of this residency my fellowship/job prospects would be screwed.

I want to quit. But realistically, there isn't anything that I can do if I quit residency. Any other training would require additional tuition and time, all the while my loan would be accruing more debt.( I wonder if declaring bankruptcy would be an option? )

I don't have an active plan to kill myself, because I know that my parents don't have any money saved because of me, and if I killed myself noone would be able to financially provide for them later on.

I just wish that I never pursued medicine."

&amp;#x200B;

Hello /r/prephysicianassistant, I’m nutsfornutrition. Skip this paragraph if you don’t want the backstory. I’m 25/F. I’ve been a registered dietitian for about 4 months now, in an ICU, NICU, and stroke unit. I absolutely love it, but many days I feel like medicine’s a video game and I’m watching other people play. In rounds I make a difference helping RNs and physicians decide how to manage nutrition support, if/when it’s necessary/feasible, etc etc, but that’s it. There’s so many other interesting and fascinating medical issues that come up that I just don’t get to be a part of with my discipline. In my dietetic internship, we learned how to do physical assessments for malnutrition, including how to use a stethoscope for heart/lung/bowel sounds, but in practice, dietitians don’t use stethoscopes. I want to be more involved. My favorite part of this job is when I’m able to make a difference in people’s lives, and I know I can do more. I want to go to PA school and not med school because I don’t want to be limited to one specialty. I get to do so much as a dietitian (preemies to hospice), and I want to be able to maintain that flexibility throughout my career because medicine fascinates me so much. I also know I don’t want to go to nursing school, because I like being a decider. I’ve had nurses come to me with nutrition problems about a patient, and I start thinking out loud about it and they say, “I’m just a doer, I’ll let you decide”. I don’t want to just do things. I want to decide what to do to make an impact. And I know NP isn’t right for me because I’m not a nurse and those programs are made to fill in blanks from experienced RNs to mid level providers.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get started/what do I need to be doing now (see tldr at the bottom)? I know theres other peices to the app like personal statements, etc. I'll have to do. Here’s my stats so far, let me know if I left any important ones out:

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline: right after highschool did 5 years of college, 1 year of a masters, my 10 month dietetic internship, then worked as an RD for 4 months and here I am now

&amp;#x200B;

Graduated undergrad 2016 in nutrition and dietetics, minor in biochem 

&amp;#x200B;

Undergrad total GPA: 3.47

&amp;#x200B;

Undergrad science: 3.01 (I THINK I have calculated this right. I have many C’s in chem classes that brought it down.)

&amp;#x200B;

Unfinished master’s degree in nutrition: 4.0 (I might finish this for free through my current job)

&amp;#x200B;

GRE in 2016: Verbal 160, quantitative 147, analytical writing 4.0

&amp;#x200B;

PCE/HCE: All my hours working as a dietitian/intern, since we make decisions involved in directing patient care as well as performing nutrition focused physical exams where we must touch the patient to assess fat/muscle loss. So \~1840 hours now, will increase once I’ve been a dietitian for a year or two

&amp;#x200B;

Undergrad volunteer hours: 684 (98 from a hospital ED/couplet care) from various college volunteer clubs, BBBS, etc. I also have several scholarships/awards/deans list I received

&amp;#x200B;

Classes: From what I can tell I have taken pretty much all of the commonly required science classes. I just don’t have Medical Terminology

&amp;#x200B;

Research: I was a student research assistant in undergrad, I’m on 1 publication (a cooperative extension article if that counts)

&amp;#x200B;

References: I know I can use my boss, my undergrad director, probably graduate director if I finish my masters, and probably a physician and/or PA from work as I continue to work there and build relationships

&amp;#x200B;

Shadowing: 0 hours shadowing a PA, so I know I will have to do this. I do work with PAs.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Arizona, but I know from applying to dietetic internships, that I can’t limit myself to only applying in Az if I want the best chances of getting in. And I know my fiance will move with me wherever I get in. I know a lot of programs say you need classes to be taken within the last 5 years so I feel like I’m running out of time! ALSO I am paying off student loans from undergrad/grad… will I be able to take out more loans for PA school? If not, I can’t do it. My fiance only takes home a little over $1200 a month, so it might be doable but more loans would be helpful… and necessary for the tuition at least.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: RD to PA. Do you see any glaring holes in my stats? Is there any stat missing up there I should be paying attention to? What do I need to work on currently? Should I finish my masters in nutrition first? How long should I wait till I apply?"
a73xdi,3,2018-12-17,recommendations after (slight) bra size change?,agalthatlovescoffee,ABraThatFits,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/a73xdi/recommendations_after_slight_bra_size_change/,"Hello ABTF!  I'm looking for a couple bra recommendations.  Been a lurker on this sub for months, and finally found a CK Ellace in 30G that fit me perfectly (with an extender).  Seriously, I loveddd this bra, but after almost 6 months of wearing it, I feel like I'm bursting out of the stretch lace.  It could be tissue migration, but I also started taking birth control in Sep., so it might be that also.  My size seems pretty constant throughout my cycle, but I could remeasure in a couple weeks.  The band still feels fine, cup width is fine, depth at the bottom of the cup looks fine, and the gore still tacks pretty well, so it's definitely still wearable, but it doesn't seem to fit perfectly anymore.  I can post pictures if that would help.  I tried a 32G Ellace in black (the band is pretty tight with the elastic along the bottom), but the wires were too wide and the stretch lace was kinda floppy and not very supportive.

**My measurements:**

Loose: 32 in

Snug: 31.5 in

Tight: 30.5 in

Standing: 39 in

Leaning: 41.5 in

Lying: 40 1/4 in

Calculator recommended 32G, which is the same result I had when I first started my ABTF journey.  However, I originally went down a cup size because that seemed to fit better with my short roots.  My shape is even fullness (I think), short roots, and projected, but I'm not very tall, so very wide wires aren't comfortable.  Width of the 30G Ellace is perfect for me (14.4 cm according to Bratabase).

**I currently own:** 2 Ellaces in 30G, Panache Cari in 30G, and Fantasie Rebecca in 30G.  I've been wearing 30 bands with an extender because I feel more secure in that than a 32 band, but 32 would be fine if that band was snug enough!  Cari is fine, probably slightly too shallow, but it gives me a really great shape in a shirt.  Rebecca is also fine, but makes me look very wide from the front.  Gore tacks on both but not as firmly as it did when I first got them.

I'm a grad student, so I unfortunately don't have the time/money to try Polish bras.  I also have an internship in a professional office, so I need something that's smooth enough under clothing/with a cami.  I really prefer a rounder shape if possible.I feel like I tried every bra out there before I found the Ellace, but I'm willing to try things again since I think my size changed a little.  I'm in the US, and I have access to both Nordstrom and Prime Wardrobe.

I'd be so grateful if you guys have any recommendations!

a7458v,3,2018-12-17,I'm really not asking that much,XenomorphXXIII,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a7458v/im_really_not_asking_that_much/,"I've been asking my ndad for years to give me just a little more notice if he wants to hang out. Years. And I get a text yesterday that just says ""I'm going to grandma's."" He doesn't write any more because he just expects that I'll be there. Funny thing is that he hates going there, and only does because he know I prefer it to going to his house. Except yesterday I didn't go, I just muted him and ignored his calls. Which I know is going to make it worse. 

I know he only does it so that he has control over me, but the worst part is that I usually just do it cuz I know that if I do he'll be less upset later. And now that I've ignored him I'm worried that he's going to show up at my house because he's done it before. My neighbor's car sounds like his and when they turned it on it spooked me pretty bad. 

It's almost funny because my ndad always complains about his brother who ""comes to town and expects everybody to drop everything to come hang out with him."" He never realizes the irony in his own words. 

One of the main reasons I'm so upset is because he told me that he was going to help me pay for some of my classes and then conveniently ""forgot."" Every now and then he remembers and dangles his money over my head, talking about how he wants to buy expensive cars. I ended up having to pay for two of my classes out of pocket and get a job last semester while my ndad was discouraging me from doing well in school. He has literally told me to study less and get lower grades so I can spend more time with him. 

I want to go NC, but I can give away until after next semester and even then its depends on if I get an internship out of state. Also I don't want to lose connections with my extended family. 

This man has literally told me in the past that he regrets having my brother and I, and that he wishes he would have bought a car instead. He has told me that I don't make any contributions to the family. He consistently tells me that his problems are my fault (thanks for the trust issues and constant feelings of guilt, dad). 

He's done things that were so much worse but this is what comes to mind. Well actually probably the worst was when he threatened my mom to her face that he would murder her, or how he beat her when I was a kid until she finally left him. What i don't understand is that i know he doesn't actually want to spend time with me. He just wants to control me and what I'm doing. When i don't listen to him he gets angrier and angrier and starts guilting me, talking about how neither of his kids talk to him anymore. Which I know is just another way to control me. The true worst part of it is that I don't really see this situation ever ending without cutting ties to him, and i don't think i can do that without also cutting ties to his family.

I don't know. I just needed to vent.

Tl;dr my ndad refuses after years of me asking, to give me even just a little notice when he wants to get together. So that when I tell him I'm busy he can justify getting angry to control me into spending time with him before everything gets worse. If I don't spend time with him he eventually just shows up at my house"

I just finished my bachelors degree in information technology with a certificate in web design and development. I took my courses online and found this to be beneficial and detrimental to my learning. I learned that I can teach myself a lot of concepts and that was very rewarding. Having any kind of mentorship, the ability to ask questions/have a dialogue about topics and concepts, group projects, and exposure the field were pretty non-existent. I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript skills. I took some classes in C and Visual Basic, and I have a basic understanding of SQL, Python, ColdFusion and Ruby. 

I don't feel confident in my skills or knowledge to get a junior developer position. I haven't used any of the frameworks and honestly a lot of it is still so abstract to me. I feel like I don't really even understand what a developer job looks like; I feel so far behind even though I just finished my degree. And it doesn't seem like many junior positions are open to teaching you - it seems like you need so much experience to get those jobs.

I'm not partial to web, but I do like it. I really enjoyed my C classes but that could have just been the instructor I had. I like being able to be creative, which is what lead me to add the certificate to my coursework. 

I took my courses online to be able to keep my job full time. I currently work on a web team at smallish company, but my job requires almost no coding, and is more of a marketing position. I write blogs posts, run our social media, film and edit youtube videos, keep our internal product database updated, and add/remove content from our website. I make almost no money and I am very eager to leave this job - but as you can see not much relevant work experience for becoming a developer.

Anyway. My real question is should I enroll in a bootcamp to get more practical experience actually building functional sites and applications or should I just try to get a job? Maybe just look at internships (although most of the internships I see require you to still be in school)? I don't really know what kinds of jobs to even look for.

If anyone has any input or suggestions I so appreciate it. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. I don't have any friends in the field and I don't have any resources from the University I attended. There isn't any career support for their online students, plus I am out of state anyway. I'm just scared I'm too under-qualified still. 

Thank you!"

Nachdem die Finanzaufsicht BaFin gerade erst der [Pensionskasse der Caritas](https://finanzmarktwelt.de/system-schieflage-bafin-verbietet-erstmals-pensionskasse-neugeschaeft-110206/) verboten hatte Neugeschäft anzunehmen (offensichtliche Schieflage der Pensionskasse), so hört man ganz aktuell von der Pensionskasse unserer Öffentlich Rechtlichen, dass auch hier eine massive Schieflage vorherrschen muss.

Allgemein wird immer wieder gemurrt, dass die Betriebsrenten der ARD-Mitarbeiter sehr gut ausfallen sollen. Ist das vielleicht der Grund dafür, dass die bbp mit zu den ersten gehört, bei der nun eine Schieflage auftritt? Offenbar können Leistungen nicht mehr in vollem Umfang bezahlt werden. Daher sei die bbp laut [BamS ](https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/unterhaltung/tv/tv/neue-finanzloecher-bei-ard-drohen-uns-hoehere-rundfunkgebuehren-59051174.bild.html?wt_eid=2154438221679462742&amp;wt_t=2154504592607216518#remId=1619402215214761680)bei einem betriebsinternen Stresstest auch durchgefallen. Laut einem Dokument der ARD werde die Pensionskasse gegenüber der BaFin in Kürze eine entsprechende Mitteilung machen.

Intern ist die Sprache von enormen Finanzrisiken für die ARD. Im Klartext: Durch die Nullzinsphase und vielleicht zu hohen Pensionen können die aktuellen Ansprüche der Bezieher nicht mehr komplett durch neu hereinkommende Gelder gedeckt werden. Denn die Verzinsung ist ja fast auf Null. Also muss wer für die Lücke aufkommen? Die Beitragszahler, so darf man es vermuten. Wenn die Pensionskasse ein Loch hat, muss der Betreiber der Kasse das Loch ausgleichen, also die ARD. Und weil die ARD ja eh schon Tag ein Tag aus rumjammert sie habe viel zu wenig Geld, werden die Löcher der Pensionskasse mutmaßlich dazu führen, dass das Drängen der ARD auf noch höhere Rundfunkbeiträge massiv zunehmen wird.

Die Rede ist von dreistelligen Millionenbeträgen, welche pro Jahr zusätzlich in die Pensionskasse der ARD gepumpt werden müssen. Was für wahnsinnige Zahlen. Was läuft da schief? Es ist schon merkwürdig, dass mit Caritas und ARD die beiden ersten Pensionskassen mit konkreten Problemen gerade solche Kassen sind, deren Betreiber nicht aus der freien Wirtschaft kommen, wo die Unternehmen unter dem Druck steht Gewinne erzielen zu müssen. Haben sich auch die Pensionskassen solcher nicht privatwirtschaftlicher Einrichtungen bislang ein zu einfaches Leben gemacht? Zu hohe Auszahlungen, zu wenig geachtet auf schwindende Erträge dank Nullzinsen? Die Zeche wird der Beitragszahler blechen dürfen. Macht die ARD nur genug Druck mit ihrer mutmaßlich kaputten Rentenkasse, werden die Bundesländer schon nachgeben und einen höheren Rundfunkbeitrag genehmigen, nicht wahr?

It's middle of the night where I live so my therapist sure isn't awake, but the incidents from today triggered something in me and I fell into that self-hating sadness again, would be fine to talk to someone. This is a very long post, thanks to everyone who read through it. 

After high school I moved to a different city than all of my friends did. I've always had a hard time making friends and bonding to people, since starting college all I've made are acquaintances, no friends. So my old high school friends have become more important. Even though I am very busy with my life but I would still use every opportunity to see them.

For the holidays I decided to go visit one of them with another friend who goes to the same college as she and even stay at her house for a few days. I've sensed it before but although they are still the best people in the world, now it's become apparent how detached from each other we've become.

One thing is they would do things without telling me and by this way I missed out a lot of things in their lives. For example, they had this birthday party for one of my friends at our home town and they told me about it only afterwards. I'm not mad that I'm not invited and I understand when they say ""it's middle of the week and you sure wouldn't be able to make it"", but it would be nice to know about it beforehand and not only find out when they accidentally mentioned it...? One time they even together went to a concert in the city where I live now, and didn't say a single word until today. Again they use the excuse ""it's outside of the town and it's not worth it for you to come"". I mean, at least they could've asked and maybe I could have make it? Because I do tell them every concert I go to. I know long distance is a difficult issue but I kind of saddens me that they wouldn't include me at all.

Also I am amazed at how much sexual encounters they've had in this one year of starting college. I am going to turn 21 soon, so I'm the eldest of us all yet the most inexperienced. It's not only because I'm introverted and don't trust people easily (now even worse with depression), I was simply busy with my own life. I try to fill my life with school, part time jobs and internships. I find it hard to make friends but I would go out and try out new interests, although mostly alone. Listening to them talking about blow jobs, ONS and all, meanwhile I haven't even been on a date, kind of makes me feel bad about myself while also wondering where they've got all the time.

Sometimes I have the feeling they only stay my friends simply because they just ""consider"" me their friend, not because they think I'm a cool person to hang out with. Whenever I talk about things I enjoy they would be like ""oh good for you"" but wouldn't show any further interests. I also caught myself a few times getting completely bored out by our conversations. All in all I'm just so disappointed and sad."

I had a seasonal job in the summer that I now looking back am wondering how I managed to get it. I think the company I was applying to was so desperate to find someone and I later found out that I was the only one who actually showed up for the interview...so I got the job. 

Anyways, since October i have been without a job. I have been actively applying for jobs since August because I knew the job I had was seasonal. For the life of me I cannot find a job or someone who wants me. I feel like something is wrong with me because I have all he qualifications I did really well in school even had internships and did an honors thesis. 

I am desperate to find a job so I have been applying to jobs that I guess I am over qualified for but I just need something to get by right now while my dream job awaits. So I applied to be a barista at a hotel,  I worked as a barista in college so I have experience. The guy in the interview immediately picked up on my nervousness and told me that I was ""scarily quiet"" even though I felt like I was being pretty outgoing for me (because it was a job interview and I really needed this job) the guy said he would be in touch early last week but I have yet to hear from him. 

I also applied and was interviewed at a dog kennel for minimum wage. I thought the girl really liked me and she said she would call me but I still haven't heard from her. 

Does anyone have any advice. I just feel like my anxiety is inhibiting me for some reason in getting a job. I am going crazy being home all the time with my thoughts and thinking i'm not good enough or that my degree wasn't worth it. I feel like a failure to everyone I know. "

I recently was thinking about my current situation as it makes me rack my brains if I should follow them or nah. My current status is I am on holidays till next year from school, I am honestly not sure when school will start next year, I am currently just waiting for my results to be released so I can see from there. I have also just returned from a 6 month internship, schooled till this november and ended. Waiting to go into a higher level of schooling. I also came back with the mindset of not studying at all after my internship. I just played around during my last few months of school.
I am currently working part tine at the moment with my parents. My parents job’s are as school food store sellers and if the students are on holidays, same goes for my parents. So they will be returning next year to sell food at their stores in schools at jan. While I have holidays till most likely april, its a long holiday. So my parents told me yesterday “why dont you work till april?” So another 6 months, the company I am currently working at is at the airport where we just wash dishes and stuff. Having to stand for 8 hours with a 45 min break. Work timing being 3-11 pm. The contract is a 10,20 &amp; 30 days contract. They only have that weird number contract where as other companies are by months.

Pay/hour - $10, 10 days - no break days / $560, 20 days - 1 break day / $1120, 30 days - 3 break days. / 1680

We have a thing here which is “CPF”, it takes a certain % of your pay if you earn more than a certain amount. Mine being 20%.

So if I counted the days it would be 162 days of work and 18 days of break. So when I thought of that in my head I instantly had regrets in my head about working with my parents for this part time job. At first I had plans to buy a new pc as my laptop was 4 years old and tends to has something dying or two, its second hand too. I told my mother about it and she instantly gave me a angry and unsatisfied face. I am a IT student that will be studying game programming too if I do make it to my chosen course of study.
My bro recently bought a new laptop because his had died a long time ago. Price tag being 1.8k. Me and my bro being gamers, we intend to put a big one time investments on our computers and leave it that way. But while I was with my parents, they were complaining about my bro’s purchase. Like how it was a waste of money and what not. And I, hearing that, am probably not surprised if I get the same treatment if I bought a new pc too. But thing is...

Its my own hard earned money, my parents wants me to work till april, but I cant buy anything with the money, it just stays there for food at most, nothing else. I am currently wondering on what to do about this situation, has anyone been in the same situation?

tl;dr Worked hard earning money, but cant make purchase of something I want and Should I be working straight for 6 months?

I am sorry if this was not supposed to be on this subreddit because 
I was googling on this type of situation where parents didnt allow their kids to buy stuff they want with their own money and what they would do in that situation, saw a post on this reddit and decided to try my luck here too. Thank you for reading!"
a78rx5,0,2018-12-18,Planning Stages: committing to applying,6491-throw-away,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/a78rx5/planning_stages_committing_to_applying/," For most of my life, I’ve wanted to go to law school. After working for a year, I am forcing myself to pursue this opportunity. 

I am someone who works best under methodology and structure. So, I want to approach this from the best possible angle. I plan to take the lsat in June, and create a study schedule to work towards it. Here are my stats for an application:

&amp;#x200B;

# Goods:

* First generation college student
* High paying finance job and  2 internships (1-2 years of experience outside of internships) 
   * I have a job that I’m very fortunate to have. Making money no one in my family ever has 
* Rough and dirt poor background and upbringing. I consider my situation unique (not good, however I am proud of what I have come from and believe it shows some strength and due diligence)
* Ability to score highly on the lsat. I’m sure this is a common trope on this sub, but I say this knowing two things: 
   * 1.) I have tested in the 99th percentile my whole life 
   * 2.) the amount of time i'm willing to dedicate
   * 3.) I believe it is necessary with the following bads
* Graduated in 3 years 
*  Reasonable college involvement 
   * had a job, started and led an org, was in an academic program  
* Not sure if this is relevant: turned my life around the past year. Now I live and very orderly and healthy life style. Lost 100 pounds (in the past few years), ran a marathon in June, traveled the world before starting work

# Bads:

*  Low gpa, 2.8 I think, from middle of the road west coast state school
   *  I associate with depression and financial/ family stress.  I do not have a reason such us ""I was very ill."" Rather, I had to travel home often to take care of family, and I was struggling to pay the bills. In hindsight, I could have done better, in the moment, however, I was happy I was going to graduate. 
   * **This is my biggest mark to overcome**
* No strong academic recommendation letter. I just didn’t bond with professors 
   * however, I do have people who can vouch for my background and the unlikely circumstances
   * Additionally, I am doing well in my job, so I plan to have a decent letter from my superiors
* Business major 
* Minimal recent volunteer experience
* Lack of truly distinguishing attribute  
* Not URM

Even though I am doing well now, I feel something missing in my life. There’s something about this long term dream that keeps drawing me back in. 

If I were to go, I would want to go to a top school, as that is the only reason I could rationalize leaving my current position. T14 is a dream but T25 would be School’s which I would want to shoot for. If this is not a possibility, then that is fine, too. It is better to know now then be rejected by all.

Please feel free to give advice, be honest, and ask any question.

I am looking for the best ways to work toward the best possible application I can make. I know it’s an uphill battle, but I’m not someone who is afraid of failure. "

Zu 1: Grundsätzlich kann zu jeder Zeit wenn etwas drückt eine Modmail geschrieben werden. Wir diskutieren das ganze dann intern und entscheiden ob es eher etwas ist, was für den Feedbackthread passt weil wir auch von anderen Usern noch eine Einschätzung wünschen bzw das offen diskutieren wollen oder ob es direkt ne Antwort gibt wenn das Thema nicht von allgemeinem Interesse ist. Grundsätzlich sind Feedbackthreads insofern sinnvoll, als dass sie eine konzentrierte und für jeden einsehbare Anlaufstelle für Kritik gibt. Andere Subs machen für sowas Metasubs auf aber da guckt erfahrungsgemäß keine Sau rein.

Zu 2: Feedback löschen wir hier nicht. Was wir löschen sind wiederholte Versuche einer bestimmten Nutzergruppe alte Brühe wieder aufzuwärmen um Stimmung gegen uns zu machen. Besonders wenn es um einzelne Banns oder private Nachrichten geht, hat das in der Regel keine Relevanz für die breitere Nutzerschaft abgesehen von denen die sich an der Mods=Nazis/Arschlöcher/whatever Geschichte aufgeilen. Das ist nicht der Sinn der Feedbackthreads.

Zu 3: Flamebait ist nicht hundertprozentig genau zu definieren weil da immer Aspekte wie Nutzerhistorie, Strikes, Kontext des Threads uvm reinzählen und bei jedem Kommentar geschaut wird ob da jemand ne unschuldige Frage stellt oder ob jemand gezielt versucht andere User zu baiten indem er oder sie in bad faith irgendwelche Diskussionen anstößt. Besonders wegen der o.g. Faktoren gibt es Regeln die insbesondere dem Außenstehenden nicht immer ermöglichen, direkt zu kapieren warum die eine Sache als Flamebait entfernt wurde und die andere nicht.

Zu 4: Wir haben grundsätzlich kein Problem mit Communities die sich spezifische Themen vornehmen oder für bestimmte Leute / Interessen eine isolierte Diskussionsplattform zu bieten, die auf r/de untergehen würden. Solche Communities fordern wir über Sub des Monats oder Neue Subs der Woche ja auch aktiv. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es aber auch Subreddits die sich nicht nur als Gegenstück zu r/de sehen sondern aktiv versuchen das Geschehen dort zu beeinflussen, die Mods anzugreifen oder mit Brigaden zu manipulieren. Das bedeutet nicht, dass wir solchen Subreddits niemals eine Chance geben würden sich in die Atmosphäre von r/de zu setzen und im Rahmen der Communityförderungen zu promoten aber die aktuelle Handlungsweise schließt das definitiv aus.

I really think that I have a problem because I consider myself a pro at shopping. I’m great at it, I find the best deals and the best things. I’m 26, and just started seeing a new therapist. I plan to bring this up to her, but I am kind of nervous just because I’ve never really confronted it before.
I’m already in debt from college loans, and on top of that, medical bills. The area I live in is posh with high rent and I’m currently unemployed because I need an internship in fashion design to graduate. My domestic partner is working hard to pay for rent and food while I’m still trying to get my life together.
I had maybe 2k in savings but it’s gone quickly when I’ve tried to feel like an equal in helping buy groceries or paying for basic things. 
I also have clinical depression and anxiety. So I’ve spent a lot of days hiding in the apartment on my phone. This week I ordered $50 worth of red lip sticks. Along with $20 for a poster to put in my studio. I don’t need any of those things but in the back of my brain I thought maybe I could give away the shades I don’t like as Xmas gifts, or the poster If i felt guilty. 
Oh yeah and I ordered a $20 silk pillowcase to help with my skin and hair. 
I’ve been getting late night anxiety about my spending, making it difficult to fall asleep. My partner is disappointed in me and tells me I shouldn’t be buying these things. I just have such a strong impulse and I’ve been getting lured into sales from Instagram or even Facebook.
I need to stop buying things so that I can have a better credit score and my partner will feel more comfortable to eventually marry me.
I just get a very compulsive while shopping and tend to over buy. At the moment it will bring me joy, but the guilt has been getting heavy. 
I know a lot about the fashion and apparel industry since it is my college major. I want to keep up with fashion trends, but I don’t want to impulsively buy every fast trend I see. 

What are your best tips to save and not buy things ? What is your thought process ?"

Additionally, I participated in an open class drum corps for two years (2 silver medals and 2 drum titles, world class semi-finalist) and a WGI world class indoor percussion ensemble (world class finalist) for one year. 

* Employment history -  I intern at an orthopedic surgery clinic (16 hrs/wk, ~100 hrs so far). Percussion instructor and Percussion Program Coordinator for high school marching band and indoor percussion ensemble (18 hrs/week). private percussion instructor (highly variable, ~1 hr/wk, accumulated ~40 hrs). math tutor (2 hrs/week, 18 hrs)

* Immediate family members in medicine? (y/n): N
* Specialty of interest: Emergency Medicine or Orthopedic Surgery
* Shadowing experience: Pediatrics (7 hrs), Emergency Medicine (31 hours), Orthopedic surgery (4 hours)
* Graduate degrees: None
* Interest in rural health (y/n): N

**Notes**: 

* I am a reapplicant. I applied to about 40 of the 60 schools above. I received two IIs (NYMC and Hofstra) and was waitlisted at both schools, and was subsequently rejected.


* Should I consider retaking the MCAT? I'm signed up to retake in March, but my studying hasn't been as great as it should be considering I'm heavily involved in many things at the moment.


* Letters of recommendation - I will be updating these with letters from MDs and my employers/supervisors. I anticipate that these letters will be much stronger than my professor letters, with the exception of the letter from my band director who is now the chair of the music department at my undergrad.

a79nql,10,2018-12-18,CE Student Looking for Internship Opportunities in Romania,Baycosinus,Romania,https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/a79nql/ce_student_looking_for_internship_opportunities/,"Hello there!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Computer Engineering Student from Turkey, i'm currently in 4th grade and i'm looking for an internship opportunity in Romania. I'm going to apply Erasmus+ Internship Project this January, so my internship will probably be in next September. But i have to write emails and send my resume to convince them to accept me as an intern because finding a company is a part of Erasmus+ application. And i don't want to leave this up to my college because i want an internship in Romania. Because my grandparents were born in Romania and i kinda want to know more about the country, the best way to do this is obviously taking some time there.

&amp;#x200B;

But sadly, i don't know much about software companies in Romania. Is there any sources that i can find internship opportunities? The point of internships are testing skills and improving anyways, right? For anyone might ask, here's a summary of my skills. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Unity 3D (I can create game mechanics, editor scripts and i can even create some 3d props with Blender3d)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- .NET (Both web and Desktop) (I can say i'm proficient in .NET)  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Java (Android and Desktop) (Need to improve more.)  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Python (ML basics) (With some Stack Overflow help, i can do good stuff.)  
&gt;  
&gt;\-HTML/CSS/JS (I can understand and code basic stuff.)  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi (I have some PIC experience too, but it's not proven with a project and i'd rather not focus on hardware as a career right now).

&amp;#x200B;

Also some things that i need to point out to make sure:

\- I need that internship to require English as working language, not Romanian. Obviously.

\- While EU provides some scholarships, i might need some extra budget depending on the city i'm gonna do my internship in. I need to be cautious about that. I'm not that social and i don't have expensive habits but, switching from TRY to EUR will be a financial shock for me.

\- If i find an internship in Bucharest or Craiova, i have two friends on each city that ""might"" help me about housing.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is appreciated.

Mulţumesc!"

Bij beantwoording de datum en ons kenmerk vermelden. Wilt u slechts één zaak in uw brief behandelen.

Hierbij bied ik u de antwoorden aan op de schriftelijke vragen die zijn gesteld door het lid Jasper van Dijk &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; over het bericht dat de IND de eigen regels overtreedt bij het beoordelen van verblijfsvergunningen.

&amp;nbsp;    
De Staatssecretaris van Justitie en Veiligheid,

Antwoorden van de staatssecretaris van Justitie en Veiligheid op de vragen van het lid Jasper van Dijk &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; over het bericht dat de IND de eigen regels overtreedt bij het beoordelen van verblijfsvergunningen &amp;#40;ingezonden 23 november 2018, nr. 2018Z22067&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht dat de Immigratie- en Naturalisatie Dienst &amp;#40;IND&amp;#41; de eigen regels overtreedt bij het beoordelen van verblijfsvergunningen? 1&amp;#41; Wat is hierop uw reactie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Ik ben bekend met het artikel. Voor mijn reactie zie verder het antwoord op vraag 2 en 3.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het een goede zaak is dat bezwaarschriften tegen het intrekken van verblijfsvergunningen van statushouders niet mogen beoordeeld worden door IND-ambtenaren die bij eerdere besluiten betrokken waren zoals in artikel 10:3 van de Algemene wet bestuursrecht is vastgelegd? Waarom is dit bij de IND toch gebeurd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, die mening deel ik. Het Bureau Integriteit van de IND doet daarom op dit moment onderzoek. Het gaat hier om een individueel onderzoek naar een integriteitsschending. Zo lang het onderzoek nog niet is afgerond, kan de vraag of, waarom en in welke mate dit is gebeurd nog niet beantwoord worden. Indien hiertoe aanleiding bestaat, zal ik uw Kamer hierover informeren. Bezwaarprocedures vinden overigens alleen plaats bij reguliere aanvraagprocedures en niet bij de intrekkingsprocedures van statushouders.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat met het besluit om die ambtenaren wél dezelfde zaken te laten behandelen, bewust het risico op tunnelvisie werd genomen teneinde de wachtlijsten weg te werken? Veroordeelt u dit besluit? Heeft u enige indicatie om hoeveel zaken het hier gaat?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, die deel ik niet. Er is geen besluit genomen door de IND om medewerkers zowel eerste aanleg- als bezwaarzaken te laten behandelen. Het uitgangspunt, met betrekking tot de behandeling van bezwaarschriften, is dat een bezwaarschrift niet wordt toebedeeld aan een de medewerker die het primaire besluit heeft genomen. Indien het vanwege capaciteitsgebrek wel dezelfde medewerker betreft, dan stelt deze een concept op, een soort raamwerk, en legt dat voor aan een collega die de uiteindelijke beslissing op het bezwaar neemt. Onder de verantwoordelijkheid van deze medewerker wordt de beslissing op bezwaar genomen. Dit wordt het vier-ogen principe genoemd: er kijken dus altijd minimaal twee mensen naar dezelfde zaak. Deze werkwijze is toegestaan op grond van de Algemene wet bestuursrecht. De IND werkt daarmee dus volgens de wettelijke regels.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat een snelle afhandeling van procedures niet ten koste van de kwaliteit van die afhandeling mag gaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, die mening deel ik. De IND hecht veel waarde aan de kwaliteit van haar beslissingen en haar dienstverlening. Om die reden is de IND ook van mening dat degene die uiteindelijk verantwoordelijk is voor de beslissing op een bezwaarschrift nooit degene kan zijn die de zaak al in eerste instantie heeft behandeld.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is iemand dwingen om met een andere naam te ondertekenen strafbaar? Zo ja, bent u van plan strafrechtelijke stappen te ondernemen naar individuen die zich hier mogelijk binnen de IND schuldig aan hebben gemaakt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
In zijn algemeenheid kan worden gesteld dat het iemand dwingen om met een andere naam te ondertekenen een strafbaar feit kan opleveren. Of daar in dit geval ook sprake van is zal uit het onderzoek moeten blijken. Dan kan ook pas worden beoordeeld als aangifte wordt gedaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat de IND geen toezichthouder kent? Zo ja, waarom? Bent u bereid ervoor te zorgen dat er een onafhankelijke toezichthouder op de IND komt waar klokkenluiders intern terecht kunnen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, dat klopt niet. Een agentschap als de IND werkt conform een sturingsmodel waarin drie rollen worden onderscheiden, te weten die van eigenaar, opdrachtgever en opdrachtnemer. De eigenaar is verantwoordelijk voor het toezicht op het beleid van de opdrachtnemer en op de algemene gang van zaken in het agentschap. Binnen het ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid is de rol van eigenaar belegd bij de secretaris-generaal. Medewerkers van de IND die melding van een vermoeden van misstanden willen doen vallen onder de rijks brede Interne klokkenluidersregeling Rijk, Politie en Defensie.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat zal het gevolg voor alle bezwaarschriften van statushouders zijn indien duidelijk wordt dat dit inderdaad een of meerdere malen is voorgekomen? Welke procedure moeten die statushouders volgen en bestaat er ook de kans dat voormalig statushouders die Nederland al ten onrechte hebben verlaten weer terug mogen komen? Zo ja, hebben zij de mogelijkheid om vergoeding van de overheid te eisen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals gezegd, is het bij de IND staande praktijk dat een bezwaarschrift niet door dezelfde medewerker wordt behandeld die ook de beslissing in eerste instantie heeft genomen. Het lopende onderzoek moet uitwijzen of en zo ja in hoeveel zaken hier van is afgeweken en wat daar aan ten grondslag ligt. Als de uitkomsten van het onderzoek daar aanleiding toegeven dan zullen nadere maatregelen volgen. Bezwaarprocedures komen overigens alleen voor bij reguliere procedures en dus niet bij procedures om verlening of intrekking van een verblijfsvergunning asiel. In de asielprocedure kan de vreemdeling direct in beroep tegen een beslissing van de IND.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat het bureau integriteit van de IND onderzoek doet naar de klokkenluider? Bent u bereid dit onderzoek vanuit uw eigen ministerie te beleggen zodat het verbreed kan worden en niet enkel naar de integriteit van de klokkenluider gekeken wordt maar ook naar de chefs die mogelijk bewust de eigen regels overtraden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, dat klopt niet. De betreffende medewerker heeft geen beroep gedaan op de klokkenluidersregeling en is onderwerp van een integriteitsonderzoek naar aanleiding van een vermoeden van &amp;#40;ernstig&amp;#41; plichtsverzuim. Het onderzoek hiertoe wordt nu eerst afgewacht alvorens nadere acties en/of aanvullend onderzoek te initiëren. De resultaten worden op korte termijn verwacht.

a79wh1,8,2018-12-18,Finishing undergrad in biology .. hard time deciding about which post-undergrad option to pursue (job/masters/other),Daffodil509,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/a79wh1/finishing_undergrad_in_biology_hard_time_deciding/,"Finishing up a bachelor's in science at McGill and am very glad to be finishing, but at the same time, I feel like I haven't done quite enough courses in some areas, like ecology, psychology, and computer science (areas that I took a particular interest in late). I was a bit blind going into my cell biology major, and realized my distaste for it, so I switched to a liberal biology program. Although I am quite intrigued by genetics, I've had a pre-undergrad vision of being a wildlife biologist, but earlier chose a Biomed program that seemed to be interesting with good employment outlooks, but in the end, less so. I'm considering taking a field course in the summer or do an internship of some sort, or even extend my degree to take more courses (but it'll cost an extra year..). I've already had an exchange experience which was awesome, but I'm still soul searching..

I'm considering to pursue my Masters down the line (writing GRE soon), but am considering multiple fields--either genetics, bioinformatics, ecology, biological/env engineering, bioethics (as I've done legal research)--and have also considered comp sci, law, and management to have options. I can't say I love love research (at least not yet), but I enjoy researching on a narrow topic, going further into depth with it and collaborating/presenting. I do want to go back and travel as well. I really seem to be split in all directions.

I want to take some time off to work, but not quite sure which field. I guess I should try and apply to all the ones I'm interested in? If anyone can offer some advice that would be great. :D Thanks all

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: There is a summer field course that I was considering doing but they are in Barbados (tropical ecology) or Newfoundland (marine mammals) :0 so the cost is offputting. Do you think having this experience will help me understand if I want to get into this type of work or not? Or should I just finish up my degree winter 2019? Alternatively, I could try doing field work in the winter before I graduate or in the summer, but not sure this type of experience will be the same... "

I know this is pretty old by now but I never got to have a roleplay of this, and recently saw a picture that reignited my interest in this little art show. More or less, I'm looking for a scene involving one or more of the patrons, anyone of them is fair game besides the guys. There are two scenarios I'm currently tossing around in my head at the moment.

One Boy Party: The shop had been bought out for the day, a kid's birthday having filled up the slot as the doors closed to anyone not on the list. It started off rather normal, the parents dropping the little one off... But then they left, claiming they had business to attend to. The pizzeria going quiet for nearly half an hour as the boy waited for guest to arrive, no one did. With a frown on his face he'd let out an upset sigh. Why not give the kid a birthday to remember! Who knows, he might even be good for seconds~

The Intern: With the start of a new internship program the slots filled rather quickly. The list full in a manner of days yet none of them were really the target audience. Eccept one, a rather young guy set up to advertise the rather impressive new sasuage on display. And with his first day coming soon, a smile on his face, and a few thoughts in his head. He might just let the crew get a sample of what the customers ordered!

And that's about it. Now its rather late here and I've got no clue if I plan on rping tonight, moreso looking to gauge an jnterest in it and get some starters. If you've got an idea, hit me with it. Till then. I'll just drop my kinks and leave it at that. You can message me on Kik and Wickr, just asks me whats what. Anywho, see ya.

Kinks: Ageplay me younger , big dick (1ft - 3ft+), excessive cum, body bulge,  pain, rough, dom/sub, cumflation, name calling, cursing, Powers, cum from mouth/ nose, cock shock and more.

Limits: Scat, Gore, Vore, Farting."

For me, it wasn’t about pass/fail, it was whether I got an A or not. Turns out I got the A but its ironic that in the classes I wasn’t worried about, I made straight C’s. 
This semester I worked 3 jobs: a part-time internship, an on campus part-time job, and a side hustle. This plus my four classes kept me busy. Very busy. In my undergrad career I’ve made a total of 5 C’s. Three of them came in my last semester. But in the end, I’m done and I have a full job that I’ll be starting in January. So why do I care so much about them Cs? Well because it’s true, “Cs get degrees” and although they might not look so pretty on my transcript, I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished in the past 4.5 years.

So I posted almost 2 months ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/9rhe3w/i\_feel\_like\_im\_losing\_my\_grip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/9rhe3w/i_feel_like_im_losing_my_grip/)) about how I felt like I was falling apart 4 months into intern year and was having all these dark thoughts and emotions. You guys were all so amazing so I just wanted to give you a little life update in hopes that it will help someone else!

So...1) pretty much as soon as everyone here told me to hit up my program leadership, I did that. I emailed my APD/faculty adviser for a meeting. This was maybe one of the hardest e-mails I've ever sent. Admitting that you need help is never easy. I felt weak, like I couldn't hack it. I know now (and even knew then) that that's not the case , but damn was it hard to take that first step. 

2) pretty much as soon as I walked into her office everything just came spilling out, also like some of you said it would. It was so damn cathartic. A couple takeaways from that meeting: my program absolutely has my back; I am not the first nor will I be the last in my program to feel like this; we have resources available for residents (literally how did I not know this...?); they were super accommodating and willing to give me any time off I needed to recover. I ended up not taking time except to just go to a couple of therapy appointments, because despite how my post seemed, I still love medicine and working. 

3) A lot...like A LOT of my feelings of despair were stemming from one bad patient encounter early in residency. i won't go into a ton of detail, but I had a bad patient outcome that intellectually I knew was the natural disease course, but I internalized everything from it and let it tear me apart. I honestly didn't even realize it was still affecting me as much as it was until I had this meeting. My APD told me about something called ""Second Victim Syndrome,"" and set me up with a therapist who specializes in that. I encourage anyone who feels like they might be handling a bad patient experience to look more into it, or PM me for some resources I was turned on to. 

4) I only had a couple therapy appointments, but she gave me a lot of tools to help ground myself back into reality every time I felt myself spiraling. I've only had to use it a few times, but I can tell there's a HUGE difference in my mentality now. 

5) one thing that also really helped...i ended up showing this post to my best friend and my significant other. I couldn't verbalize how I felt to them, but they knew I was in a pretty dark place, so this seemed like the best way to do it for me since all the words were already out there. They were both incredibly supportive and just having people know that I wasn't okay and that they weren't going to treat me differently for it was pretty great. 

I still definitely have some bad days...I know this is the start of a very long journey to getting mentally better. I know it's only been 2 months. But the change is pretty amazing. I encourage anyone/everyone to reach out to their program leadership if they're feeling like I did. It made a huge fucking difference to me. 

Please remember that you're never alone. We all go through shit and residency fucking sucks as it is. "
a7bt2q,1,2018-12-18,I don't understand what my GF expects of me,Iggy-The-Fool,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a7bt2q/i_dont_understand_what_my_gf_expects_of_me/,"I'm in a relationship with this girl for about 3 months, and I don't understand what she expects of me. I like her, I trust her, but there are some mixed messages that leave me uneasy.

&amp;#x200B;

we travelled together with some friends this weekend, and it was awesome. I wanted to go to a friend's house party in another town this new year's eve, asked her to come and she said she'd come even though she do not like house parties and she don't smoke weed. I asked her what did she expect of me for going out, since she found the last hangout with this same friend boring and I love hanging out with these guys, but I went to her friend's birthday party in a pub without complaining even though I don't like pubs and bars and she loves it. I told her I wanted her to go with her head open, and that what was important is that I was with her, if she didn't want to go to the party, we could stay around here and spend the new year's eve together. but since I don't have shit to do in the new year's eve, only going to the beach with my family which is kinda sad because my family is fucked up and I don't want to go, I invited her to spend it at my house (I live with my parents and they're cool, the rest of the family is the problem), and she said she didn't want to come to my house... for no solid reason at all. I found that weird, but did not think much about it.

&amp;#x200B;

and now's where the shit goes down. she lost her job this month, and it was expected, her contract ended and there's no possibility to renew it. but also her mom is gonna lose her job, and she lives with her mother in the condo her mother works as a gatekeeper, so her mother will not want to live there anymore even tho the house is her's and her parents are divorced. I offered them help, asked my lawyer friend what could be done in that situation, and my GF did not want my help at all, but I just asked around. I did nothing and will do nothing because this is not in my power to change and I'm ok with it. and that's how I've been acting for the past few months. I've been trying to help her with her life problems, but I try not to bite more than I can chew since I don't have power nor money to help. anyway, I offered her to pay for her bus ride or her part on the gas if we took a ride in my friend's car to the party. its not expensive and I can pay since we wouldn't have to pay for a place to stay. she never wanted me to pay for her shit, and nor does she now, but sometimes I pay for everything without complaining when its not expensive and she's out of money. she said she didn't want to go if we took the bus, but she could go if we went on the car. I offered to pay, she said only on these terms. I told her that since she wouldn't spend the new year's eve with me in my house, I'd go to the party by myself... and she lost her shit.

&amp;#x200B;

she said I'm abandoning her in a really rough time, and that there would be no problem for me going to the party by myself if I told her in the beginning I'd go. but since I said in the beginning I wouldn't go without her and now I've changed my mind, she's disappointed, didn't even know how to react, and there was nothing I could do to justify or make it up for it. I know what I did was wrong. saying one thing and then saying other. but man, her dad is going to travel with his new family and will leave her here. if  she's not spending the new year's eve with me to stay in her mom's doing fucking nothing (since her mom don't celebrate new year's), what difference does it make if I stay here, go to the beach with my family or go to the party? what does she want me to do? and now that I've come to think of it, there are a lot of shit she does that really bothers me.

&amp;#x200B;

she said she wanted to rent a place for herself, but none of the places in her price range she looked at yet were good enough. she claims that if she gets a place that does not please her, she'll not be able to live there. she also said she left some of her stuff in the place she used to live because she didn't want to live there anymore because  problems with the landlord. she never really told me about it in detail.

&amp;#x200B;

she always thinks she has the right to tell me how to do my shit. how I should act, what I should do or not, how I should speak to people... and she's always asking me stuff like she's giving me orders. I don't like taking orders and I don't like people telling me how to live my life. I have my problems but I'm a decent man, I'm graduating college, searching for a job in the area, smoke weed but not everyday and not too much, don't drink too much, practice sports, look good, good driver, I can cook and I'm kind to the people I like and try to help everyone. but it really grinds my gears everytime she tells me to do something in a different way, and she insists and insists to prove she's right until I lose my shit. I'm not a child and I don't want arrogant people treating me as such. I don't like asking people for help even on simple tasks, I'm pretty independent, but when I ask someone for something, I say ""please"" and ""thank you"". she doesn't. she gives me orders, and I tell her ""are you saying please or not?"" and she gets surprised because she's not used  to say ""please"", she's used to order people around.

&amp;#x200B;

she does not like coming into my house. last month, I fought my mom because of personal problems, and now my GF is apprehensive on coming into my house because she's kinda afraid of my mom, or does she say so. but me and my mom have a pretty good relationship, and my mom really did like my GF, and none of my parents mind if I stay with her inside my room with the door locked. and it is free. she came to my house a couple times before, and no one treated her bad, my parents like her. but I only went to her mom's once, and never got to meet her mom or her sister again. she doesn't live with her dad because she fought her stepmom and before things got really ugly, she left to live by herself and let her father with his new family. the only time she sometimes spends with her dad are in pubs in the happy hours since they work in the same company, and in these happy hours people make it up so the ones with the smaller income pay for less shit. she told me she didn't like dancing, but then she dances in these happy hours. sincerely, I have fear of her going by herself in these parties, since she's a pretty social person and I'm kind of an outcast. but if she says she's not betraying me, she's innocent until proven guilty. sometime ago she asked if I wanted to get to know her beloved dad the next sunday, and I said yes. the week went on, and I asked if I was really going to meet her father and she said she forgot to talk to him about it because of her finals. wtf? but I let it slide. also: the travel we went on this weekend was planned because her aunt would come over, and she wanted to go to the beach with her aunt. she found a nice place for a great price, and invited me and some of my friends and some of her friends to come over, so it would be really cheap for everyone and everyone would have a lot of fun. it was really fun, and I don't regret going. her aunt even paid for the travel, but in the end my GF said her aunt cancelled in the last second because she found out she'd have to work this weekend. but everyone else went anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

she asked me to go out a couple days on the week, on the friday and saturday, but asked me to have the sunday for herself so she could study and rest. I have no problems with it, and I like to have a time for myself too. but she always ends up cleaning her mom's house, and complaining about it. I ask her if she wants just to hang out at my house and rest, and she says no. what the hell does she want? does she only want to do shit outside that we have to pay for? every pub I went with her because she asked was too fucking expensive for me, what's wrong with doing shit without spending too much money or going too far away from home? I don't complain about picking her up by car, but we have to pay for gas, you know? it'd be cheaper if she just took the bus that drops her close to my house.

&amp;#x200B;

I like her and I want to be with her, and I don't doubt it when she tells me the same. but she's used to older guys who can pay for expensive shit, and I can't do it all the time. at the same time, she's giving me these strange messages. I don't know her family, I never go to her house. she's searching for a place to live by herself and asked if I could help her with a little money. I know it would cost me the same amount I spend when we spend the night in a motel and I could spend some nights with her there, but I said no because since I'm graduating, my internship is going to end and I don't know when I'll have a stable income again, and she said it is OK. and yet, these are HER life problems, not mine, and I should not mix them. even if her mom's gonna be fired, stay in the fucking house and search for another job, don't come up with stupid ideas of leaving ""because she'll hate living there"". the apartment is in her mom's name anyway, she can't just be dropped out.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her if there was something I could do to make it up for ""abandoning her"", and she said that for now, nothing. but she's not leaving me for that. should I have stood for what I said even though she didn't want to be with me in new year's eve? what should I do? this is my second relationship in my life, I started late and I have little to NO experience in relationships, and she's experienced. this is all so confusing. we're trying to act normally and talking like everyday, but... this is all so weird.

I wholeheartedly believe that should be the norm, the politically inclined or those who choose entertainment careers are weirdly subjected to these “The devil wears prada” style intermships and its crazy because many students simply can’t afford to work for free. These sectors then lose out on what could be top tier talent due to people being financially unable to accept these offers.

Sorry if this breaks any rules but I couldn’t tell some other kids as I feel like it would come off arrogant. Thanks for listening!

Tl;dr: get a 4.0 and an internship as a first semester freshman. Can’t tell most of my friends without seeming arrogant.

Edit: MY FIRST SILVER!!! This is unbelievable lol. Also crossed 1k upvotes for the first time. You people are truly the most amazing people!

Edit: MY FIRST GOLD!!! WOW! I just got all three of these awards for the first time! Thank you to all the kind strangers presenting these to me!!

Edit: I will update my post with my methods/ tips for studying and getting the internship as many of you have asked. It prob won’t happen today, but by the end of the week.

a7cifa,3,2018-12-18,30 days: Personal Experience Report,Dedicated_Short,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/a7cifa/30_days_personal_experience_report/,"**About me:** I am 23 years old - came in contact with Nofap in Februar this year and tried to make it to 30 days ever since.Before that I masturbated basically every day since I turned 13 years old (approx.) and around age 21 I started to get into anal porn - which was strange, because this kind of thing used to totally weird me out.I never had a girlfriend so far, I never had sex and I never kissed a girl (except for a game of ""spin the bottle"" that involved french kissing - which was about 8 years ago). Anyways, I decided it cannot go on like this and thankfully I discovered this movement.

&amp;#x200B;

**About the journey:** Saturday, Nov 17, was the last day I fapped before this streak of 30 days.

*Days 1-10:* In the first ten days of nofap, I experienced the testosterone boost that many other people in this movement have experienced as well. Immediate benefits were:  
\- a firm handshake (usually my handshake was quite awkward)  
\- prolonged eye contact (I have never been able to hold eye contact, this has gotten better in the first week already)  
\- more connection with people

*Days 11-20:* This period was very difficult for me. I had a constant peeing urge that was very irritating. Medication against UTI (urinary tract infection) seemed to help a bit - I made sure to take only pills with 100% natural ingredients such as cranberry extract.Additional benefits during this phase were:  
\- a positive attitude towards life  
\- slightly increased discipline  
\- more empathy with other people

*Days 21-30:* This period had many ups and a few downs. I finally experienced what it means to not being able to hide. Emotions are hitting very hard - both happiness and sadness. Additional benefits in this phase:  
\- a strong sense of calmness  
\- more outgoing personality  
\- more focussed and clearer mind

&amp;#x200B;

**Drawbacks:** It is really not always fun to see your problems more clearly. Additionally, I am always worried about wet dreams. They usually destroy my streak, because I feel like I failed. Just today I had a weird dream in which I watched porn - thankfully I woke up early enough - I had a boner, but nothing more happened.

&amp;#x200B;

**Success (a short story of big personal wins):** I was always described by my friends as ""smart, but awkward"" and had very good grades in both school and college - however, I never had what some people call ""a life"". Which means, if a had nothing to do I would just hang around in my room and mostly watch movies or TV series or YouTube videos.

Since in 5 months my college time will be over, I was on the search for jobs already for some time. I scored two amazing internships in the last 30 days and I attribute this to a large part to Nofap. Why? Because I got a lot of rejections from possible employers before that and the reason was never a lack of professional competencies - but my personality. In HR-terms: ""other candidates were a better personal fit"" - I just did not bond with people on a personal level - and 30 days of Nofap have already significantly changed that.

&amp;#x200B;

**The road ahead:** My goal was always to do 30 days of Nofap, which I now achieved. I see now, that I am on the right track and I have to keep going. I will try do get to day 60. It will be very hard and I am really unsure whether I will make it. However, if I do make it, I will let you guys know how it went with another comprehensive experience report.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thank you:** I want to end this post with a big thank you to the Nofap-community on reddit. Without you guys, I would not have made it so far."

I’m having a horrible time trying to decide what school to attend. I’m in the surprising position of having been accepted to 6 programs, but I’m deciding between 2; MGH IHP (Boston) and the University of Hartford (West Hartford, my hometown). MGH IHP is my dream program, from facilities to clinical connections to their 3rd year full paid internship. UHart couldn’t be more different in that it is a smaller program, fewer facilities, and they use a flipped classroom model currently. 

The biggest thing making this difficult is cost, MGH is 146k and UHart is 90k (before living expenses which are higher in Boston too). I know that I can succeed at both programs, but I just don’t know how much weight to give convenience, cost, comfort, etc. I’m scared of making the wrong decision at the end of the day, if there really is one. 

If any of you are in the same boat, or have any advice from your previous experiences it would be much appreciated! 

Thanks! "

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a relationship with this girl for about 3 months, we're both 23, m and f, and I don't understand what she expects of me. I like her, I trust her, but there are some mixed messages that leave me uneasy.

we travelled together with some friends this weekend, and it was awesome. I wanted to go to a friend's house party in another town this new year's eve, asked her to come and she said she'd come even though she do not like house parties and she don't smoke weed. I asked her what did she expect of me for going out, since she found the last hangout with this same friend boring and I love hanging out with these guys, but I went to her friend's birthday party in a pub without complaining even though I don't like pubs and bars and she loves it. I told her I wanted her to go with her head open, and that what was important is that I was with her, if she didn't want to go to the party, we could stay around here and spend the new year's eve together. but since I don't have shit to do in the new year's eve, only going to the beach with my family which is kinda sad because my family is fucked up and I don't want to go, I invited her to spend it at my house (I live with my parents and they're cool, the rest of the family is the problem), and she said she didn't want to come to my house... for no solid reason at all. I found that weird, but did not think much about it.

and now's where the shit goes down. she lost her job this month, and it was expected, her contract ended and there's no possibility to renew it. but also her mom is gonna lose her job, and she lives with her mother in the condo her mother works as a gatekeeper, so her mother will not want to live there anymore even tho the house is her's and her parents are divorced. I offered them help, asked my lawyer friend what could be done in that situation, and my GF did not want my help at all, but I just asked around. I did nothing and will do nothing because this is not in my power to change and I'm ok with it. and that's how I've been acting for the past few months. I've been trying to help her with her life problems, but I try not to bite more than I can chew since I don't have power nor money to help. anyway, I offered her to pay for her bus ride or her part on the gas if we took a ride in my friend's car to the party. its not expensive and I can pay since we wouldn't have to pay for a place to stay. she never wanted me to pay for her shit, and nor does she now, but sometimes I pay for everything without complaining when its not expensive and she's out of money. she said she didn't want to go if we took the bus, but she could go if we went on the car. I offered to pay, she said only on these terms. I told her that since she wouldn't spend the new year's eve with me in my house, I'd go to the party by myself... and she lost her shit.

she said I'm abandoning her in a really rough time, and that there would be no problem for me going to the party by myself if I told her in the beginning I'd go. but since I said in the beginning I wouldn't go without her and now I've changed my mind, she's disappointed, didn't even know how to react, and there was nothing I could do to justify or make it up for it. I know what I did was wrong. saying one thing and then saying other. but man, her dad is going to travel with his new family and will leave her here. if she's not spending the new year's eve with me to stay in her mom's doing fucking nothing (since her mom don't celebrate new year's), what difference does it make if I stay here, go to the beach with my family or go to the party? what does she want me to do? and now that I've come to think of it, there are a lot of shit she does that really bothers me.

she said she wanted to rent a place for herself, but none of the places in her price range she looked at yet were good enough. she claims that if she gets a place that does not please her, she'll not be able to live there. she also said she left some of her stuff in the place she used to live because she didn't want to live there anymore because problems with the landlord. she never really told me about it in detail.

she always thinks she has the right to tell me how to do my shit. how I should act, what I should do or not, how I should speak to people... and she's always asking me stuff like she's giving me orders. I don't like taking orders and I don't like people telling me how to live my life. I have my problems but I'm a decent man, I'm graduating college, searching for a job in the area, smoke weed but not everyday and not too much, don't drink too much, practice sports, look good, good driver, I can cook and I'm kind to the people I like and try to help everyone. but it really grinds my gears everytime she tells me to do something in a different way, and she insists and insists to prove she's right until I lose my shit.

a7f46s,27,2018-12-18,Any recommendations for pursuing a career in hardware &amp; ML research closely related to FPGAs?,Felkin,FPGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/a7f46s/any_recommendations_for_pursuing_a_career_in/,"I'm soon going to be finishing my BSc in computer science and have to really start planning for the next step and have found myself at quite the crossroad. While I've been writing emails to random professors, I thought it could be a good idea to ask the FPGA community too on what their takes are on making a career in research around hardware, ML, FPGAs.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I've spent my BSc really focused on ML/AI, having learned to effectively use LSTMs, CNNs, other optimization methods like PSO, SA etc etc and also working a lot with FPGAs. Managed to write 2 papers out of it, now working on a 3rd to all act as my portfolio for Masters, however, the Masters itself is where things are getting messy.

&amp;#x200B;

My end goal is to work in research with topics being about optimizing hardware and software. A lot of ideas around the use of self-organizing patterns and machine learning on FPGAs, working on new hardware architectures as a whole. Xilinx's FINN framework is a very good example of the sort of work I want to gravitate towards. Heck, got my uni to buy me 4 PYNQ boards to play around with, love them to pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Lithuania (Europe) and my financial situation is not the greatest so I'm hard pressed with options for Masters. US is still probably an option given that I might be able to snag a lot of scholarships, but still a bit scary. I've been considering Germany (Munich, Aachen) for their computer engineering MSc courses. Munich, in particular, has an NVIDIA office hiring interns for an AI position there, which could be perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from that, I'm really not sure how to proceed. Do I take computer engineering now that I've dabbled in AI enough (AI courses feel like a bit of a waste given how quickly the field is advancing) while a hardware course could be very stable and actually useful to get mentorship on. Could also continue with a general CS masters and continue focusing on algorithms then gain the hardware expertise at a company. I imagine instantly trying to apply to some of the big hardware companies is an option, though Xilinx, for example, seems to only wants MSc and up people. There's also always the problem of losing your IP if you do research under a corporate lab, but then the loss of resources if in a uni group...

&amp;#x200B;

So has anyone found themselves in a similar position in the past? Any thoughts? Any tips would be greatly appreciated, because I've 5 months till my BSc ends and so have to start sending out applications for the next step now.

a7f71j,1,2018-12-18,I have no energy to be productive,TrashAccount445,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a7f71j/i_have_no_energy_to_be_productive/,"I (19M) am currently going through my first year of college, and I'm renting an apartment with two other roommates.

Before I moved here, I was apart of a summer internship (paid) with a major company. I requested at the beginning of the summer for an internship throughout the schoolyear. Unfortunately, the team I was working with did not have any work available for that period of time. My intern coordinator told me this, and I ended up having to find work elsewhere.

About a month or two later, I found a job that payed very well. Despite that, the job required a lot more travel than I expected, and I have a car that I am not too confident in putting a lot of mileage on. This coupled with the fact that winter is coming up, I quit the job about 3 weeks ago.

Here I am now, the college semester is over, my friends are all working jobs (mostly interning with the major company), and I am at home feeling like an unproductive piece of shit.

On the bright side, I'm thankful that I worked my ass off since my sophomore year of high school, and have built up an emergency fund to get myself through the year no problem and then some. I also have been invited back to the major company for another summer internship (almost twice the pay), and I'm going to be paired with a team that has a history of extending internships.

In the meantime, I have seen places that are hiring that are low pay, but I think would be kind of fun to do. For some reason, I don't know if it's laziness, no motivation, no energy, anxiousness, or what, but I just can't get up and apply to these places. I fear coming home to my family for Christmas, and having them get the impression that I am a lazy piece of shit that has changed for the worst after moving out.

I want to know if any of you have gone through a similar experience, and what you did."

My wife and I are both 30, and have been married for 6.5 years. Last march my wife said she wanted a divorce, but I committed to change and she agreed to try and work things out. We have a 4 year old child. Between then and now she has been diagnosed with a fairly serious mental disorder (bipolar type 1), and went more than $11,000 in credit card debt as a result. She has since begun treatment for her bipolar, and had been making good progress both mentally, and paying off her credit card debt. However last week she had another manic episode even though she claims she had been compliant with her medication. We had the biggest fight we've had since last march and even though we made up and I felt good with the resolution of that fight, I came across a messages between her and her high school friend where she expressed the thought ""Is this something I can use to get out"".  As well as other statements where she completely misrepresented things I did and said to make herself seem like she had no fault, and I was completely at fault. The next morning I got up early and talked with her again, apologizing for our fight and addressed things she said in her message (without her knowing I had seen it). We again talked for a couple hours and things seemed to have a good resolution by the end. I checked her app to see if she had messaged her friend from high school again, and she had (the friend from high school is another woman, not a man, just to be clear). Her message this time made it clear that even though she accepted some of what we talked about the day before, she still refused to take any responsibility and completely discounted many of my issues I brought up. At one point she said that she is ""giving me until august or September of next year to change, or else she will be gone."" Now I think I've come to the realization that no matter how hard I try, or how much I change, I don't think it will be enough for her. So I'm trying to prepare myself both emotionally and financially. I am here to ask if anyone has any idea of what I can expect if we were to go through with a divorce in the next 6 months as far as spousal support goes since I'm currently a medical student. She is a stay at home mom that runs a business on the side, so she actually makes more money than I do currently, although all of that money is spent on herself (i.e. she does not contribute to the household income with it) and she has contributed nothing to my education financially. I am in my 3rd year, and will not expect to have a pay check for another 1.5 years when I become an intern. I have paid for everything by taking out loans for our time in school. She dropped out of college with enough credits to be a junior, not because she wanted to stay at home to be a home maker, but because she couldn't pass her classes. She was planning on being a stay at home mom anyway so it was no problem at the time. However we had no children at the time so this choice was completely her own. I still love her very much, but I know that I want the marriage to work out now because of our 4 year old son. What I don't want to happen, is for her to stay with me until I become an attending, then decide to leave me, leaving me stuck paying out a huge alimony, which is something that I fear she may be planning on, even subconsciously. I'm not really sure what to do at this point, and if my wife is going to leave me, then I'd rather just do it now, than wait for her to do it 5 years from now, leaving me with more of my time wasted on someone that doesn't want to be with me. Any advice or experiences anyone could share would be hugely appreciated. Thank you."

I have recently earned my CCNA 2 months ago. I have a 4 year degree for IT and have 1 year experience doing a hybrid IT all around with networking internship that I do 40 hrs a week based in NYC. I am wrapping up a master's program in Telecom/networks this spring.

I have been really putting myself out there on Indeed, LinkedIn, Dice ect... With no avail. Often places take 1 month to call me back asking if I am still interested. I am looking for a network role, junior net engineer, administrator ect... Recruiters have reached out for me to fill help desk roles. I have received offers/interviews in Philly, Albany, CT, NJ, and Long Island but 2 hours travel one way is too far. I have been on 2 interviews here in NYC but I feel like employers want the perfect candidate even for junior roles. Breaking into networking is a challenge.

I'm trying to gain more network experience at my current place of employment but I think the long term intern title turns them off despite me working as a full-time employee. During the winter break, I'll jump into CCNA security before the spring semester starts. Hopefully this will make me stand out.

If you have any input or suggestions on how I should present myself to employers or similar experiences, feel free to reply or PM.

Before i begin, want to say sorry for formatting and gramamtical errors. On mobile in the airport and my autocorrect is not working.

Anyways, I am currently a student studying both German and a CS major. I am a sophmore but did not take any CS classes due to studying abroad. Something that has dawned on me recently is the idea of internships.

I spoke with my CS advisor and said that I would not be able to recieve any credit for an internahip this summer , but could next summer. He did mention that by the end of this spring semester I should be able to apply for a basic internship.

So far at my college i have taken 2 CS classes over the basic logics(for loops, arrays, hierarchy, etc) and designing basic applications with them such as a bank gui with withdrawl, deposit, and login features, a homemade styles game of flappy bird running through key events and a thread, or other simple things. All of which werr writen in java. 

When i return i will be taking database management , intro to web design(very basic cover of HTML &amp; CSS i understand) and intro to animation(essentially a welcome to JavaScript). I believe these three classes should be relatively easy to pass as the first two classes I was ahead of my class normally and passed with 'A's. 

Final thing, since location does affect job markets, I live in northeast Ohio. 

My question now is if it's realistically possible for me to get an internship with my experience and if so, what can I do to help sell myself compared to more senior students applying? Is there any recommendations upon what to do in my meantime to help improve my odds?

You have to go through the darkest tunnels to see what light you can create. 

Present: I’ll be 27 in a couple weeks, earning my masters in math, have a weekend job, a stable relationship, and paid internships possibly next summer. However, I’m pregnant, 7 weeks, and for once I couldn’t be more happier about it. When I was younger I was so heartbroken and just filled with sadness. It took a years to recover, and I learned that it was because the decision was not on my terms. Where this time I automatically knew I didn’t want to continue with this pregnancy. Both my partner agree, I brought it up as the option first. 
Also this pregnancy has been a living hell, I haven’t worked, I can’t keep a lot of food and water down, my back is sore, can’t sleep, and I just think this has been the hardest journey, the pregnancy part. 

However I think I need to the support of conquering the fear of the pain possibly endured during the in-clinic abortion. Is it painful? What should I truly expect? 

All the information would be great. Oh and it’s happening tomorrow, and even with all the pain, I just want to feel like my normal energetic, happy, and able to eat self.

He asked if I were the home owner and started talking about how ""we are putting water filters in the neighborhood."" Started talking about galvanized pipes and installing filters inside or outside of the house... it was clear jargon.

Anyway, about a year ago I interviewed to be a recruiter for outfits like this. They wanted me to do a 6 month unpaid internship. I would learn how to recruit and train these people and was promised that I would ""learn things they never taught in school.""

This type of scam is similar to scams that have been going on in the Toronto area for a while now. [See this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/2ldntx/psa_water_quality_scam/) for more information.

I told this guy we weren't interested so I don't know exactly what the scam might be. But [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axSkJa6IGes) is a video of how the scam is sometimes carried out. Sometimes the scam can be carried by putting a tablet of something that reacts to minerals normally in your tap water. Sometimes the scam is just a really pushy sales person pushing an overpriced water filter product.

The water is quite bad here in Peterborough in some areas. But it's not hard to install your own whole house water filter. [Here's a guide from Home Hardware.](https://www.homedepot.com/c/how_to_install_a_whole_house_water_filter_HT_PG_BM) If you're not a handy kind of person, you can go to any local plumber or handyman to get this kind of thing installed. But don't let some stranger in your house who is trying to sell something like this.

This is a small sub but hopefully this thread will reach the right people. Please share and watch out if you see this happening.

a7i1zi,2,2018-12-18,Paora Moyle: A Submission on the Terms of Reference for Historical Abuse in State Care Royal Commission,lolpolice88,Maori,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maori/comments/a7i1zi/paora_moyle_a_submission_on_the_terms_of/,""" I wrote this public submission a year ago to help form the terms of reference for the Royal Commission, and nearly everything I warned against, has happened. I presented it in person to Sir Satyanand and it was quite clear to me that he had not read it. Nothing he talked over the top of me about, remotely referred to any of the points I made. So here it is again, Sir.

A Submission on the Terms of Reference for Historical Abuse in State Care Royal Commission

1. My name is Paora Moyle. I am a proud descendant of a long line of Ngāti Porou wāhine toa and also many strong Celtic women through my Welsh ancestry. I write on behalf of my siblings (both blood and whāngai) who spent our childhoods raised in the care of the New Zealand state. (Read our story here).

2. When my only child was just seven years old he announced confidently, “you know mama you're not a state care kid, you're a shero because how would we ever know what it's like for those kids if they didn't go through that. It teaches us what we most need to learn about ourselves aye mum?” I never saw my 14 years of being raised in state care in that light before. My son was expressing how he saw vulnerability as a privileged position and how we have a choice to either see that for what it is, or to ignore it.

3. From the mouth of a babe, I was given permission to speak out about what it is like to grow up disconnected from my bi-racial parents, my culture, my whenua, tikanga and reo. That vulnerable positioning has become my life's purpose. Thus, I use my experience to speak about the need for positive change in New Zealand's child protection system. This positioning also inspired my 27 year career in social work, and to be the kind of parent where there was no chance of the state taking my child.

4. Thank you Sir Anand for your letter inviting me (as a survivor and long serving social worker) to comment on the draft terms of reference (TOR) for the Historical Abuse in State Care Royal Commission (RC). In your letter you outline the four elements you would like me to comment on. The first being the “scope and purpose.” The second element being a “suitable reference to the Treaty of Waitangi."" (I will not comment on all as many others will also provide their views).

5. My FIRST key comment is te Tiriti o Waitangi as a founding document of this nation should be first and foremost in the RC going forward to address multiple failures of the Crown to keep our tamariki safe in state care. Particularly when it is Māori who have been the predominantly targeted people over the time stated in the draft TOR.

6. One of my gravest concerns is that the government officials who put the TOR together appear not able to think and operate in equal partnership with Māori. Despite the RC website stating, “the Inquiry will adhere to the highest of standards of professionalism and integrity” and “we will work in partnership with Iwi, Māori and whānau. How do you do this when the RC operates from a dominant white-stream worldview? Being secondary speaks volumes of a deep underpinning assumption that we as Māori are incapable of deciding for ourselves, much less looking after our own child protection needs. Why does my tikanga have to be less than yours?

7. I stated in my opening address to you at a two-day survivor hui in February Sir Anand, “Te Tiriti was not even mentioned in the draft terms of reference and if we are to get this get this right, we must begin how we mean to carry on. Māori MUST have their own stream within the RC.” This means, our own panel of experts (including lived-experience) and advisory survivor roopu, if we are to engage successfully with our hard to reach people. Our world view, our experience, the loss of our mokopuna to genocidal, policy and practice in Aotearoa, is not EVER secondary. It is first and foremost in our living breathing existence. Has the state become so immune to the continued disproportional statistics of our tamariki in state care that, when we call for our own safe processes, we are still treated as an add-on? I don’t think Taika Waititi was kidding when he said, “New Zealand is as racist as f..k!”

8. An example of “racist as f..k” is the way the TOR, (p5.2.2) lumps Māori in with other groups of people. “In considering this, the Inquiry is also invited to have particular consideration for Maori and any groups where differential impact is evident, e.g. by gender, LGBTQI people, Pacific people and people who have experienced mental health issues.” Genocide and intergenerational trauma are not merely a “differential impact.” Cease othering your te Tiriti partner. Is this truly adhering to the highest of standards of professionalism and integrity and working in partnership with whānau, hapu and iwi?

9. My SECOND key comment is there are NO nor has there ever been any safe spaces/processes for our Māori state abuse survivors to tell their stories. (Which is why we have had to take our concerns to the Waitangi Tribunal: Wai 2615 - The Māori Children placed in State Care Claim). A best example of this is voiced by one of my brothers, who at 8 years old (among a raft of other abuses) was put into psychiatric care with adult patients. He had this to say:

10. ""Your MSD historical abuse claims process is there to make YOU feel better. It blames me and you get to distance yourselves from an unpleasant occurrence and thereby confirm your own invulnerability to the risk. Your process puts the onus on me to 'prove' that I was raped, beaten, abused and in doing so it labels me; makes me responsible for all that happened to my small body.

11. The whole claims process is like facing your rapists again. Like the Judge who took a fancy to me and would take me in the school holidays and on long weekends. A Judge although much older now, is very senior and still there. I see his face, when you all sit there assessing my words, my innocence, my stolen childhood. Where I have to recount the detail and you look at me with eyes, that spell out neon words in the air between us, “troubled” “broken” “dysfunctional” and “cognitively impaired.” Your labels and pathologising is like a knife to my guts, cutting me into bits and telling me I am to blame for your re-rape of me.

12. You have no understanding of inter-generational trauma, layered like “whaka” “papa”…heck you don’t even know what that means. How the mamae and energy of it is passed on through our cellular memory. Your homogenised approach is an affront to me and re-traumatises my being.

13. You all (MSD process/panel) can then see yourselves as different, impartial and independent (the good guys, expert, well-intentioned). You are NOT! Your espoused tīkanga process does not help us, it repels us. Your victim-blaming marginalises me as a survivor. Your offer to access my notes for me is a load of BS also. I get my DSW notes and they are all redacted. Further, confirming to me that I am to blame and that you are protecting yourselves as state representatives, as colonisers, allowing me little to draw from.

14. My file notes were written by culturally ignorant social workers to cover their racist missionary-styles decision-making and NOT for my wellbeing. Nothing in my notes remotely relates to my recollection of how I was treated. You (MSD) call yourselves “a tīkanga informed process with culturally competent professionals.” You are not even able to voice your knowledge of Māori models, modes and methods of healing, that are vital to us as Māori. Even my medical notes were not to be found which, could’ve corroborated many of my injuries. Such as the burning of my genitals through electrical convulsive treatment (ECT) intended to punish me for telling or crying out for my mother.

15. All your privileged arrogance and assurances that you offer a “flexible” and thus “tīkanga” approach are just more lies; more layering and fracking od my Māori’ness. When you ask me to prove my rape to you, you ask me to undress to offer up my small body, so that you may inspect, poke and prod, measure, sodomise me and then calmly get up, and leave me lying exposed whilst you wash your hands and make your findings.

16. There are thousands more of us, whom my sister and other advocates are tireless in providing us with a voice. We want and deserve our own process according to our rights under te Tiriti"" (Personal communication: June, 2016).

17. My THIRD key comment is with the time frame of the RC. Genocidal policies and processes impacting our mokopuna did not miraculously end on the 31 December, 1999. Sir Anand, your stated reasoning for the draft timeframe is, “After 2000, people were not in institutional care, by and large; people were in the community, and New Zealanders had available to them a number of mechanisms — Human Rights Commission, Health and Disability Commission, Ombudsmen, etc.” With respect, this a monumental cop-out because those processes and others since (such as, CYF/MSD/CLAS), have not provided a true tīkanga space for Māori survivors to tell their stories. Just because Big Tobacco says smoking is good for you, does not make it so. In exactly the same way posters adorning OT offices declare we are “tika, pono and with aroha.”

18. Further, I contend that not a single one of these toothless processes has been able to STOP the tide of racist targeting of our most vulnerable mokopuna from the NZ state. 62% of youth incarcerated into care and protection residences and 73% in youth justice are our rangatahi. All part of the brown pipelining of our babies as fodder to fill NZ's prisons. The proposed TOR timeframe only serves to protect the current model (Oranga Tamariki) from being investigated as continuing to fall short in its statutory duty to keep our stolen mokopuna safe from harm.

19. The New Zealand government not only fails in their obligations to te Tiriti o Waitangi but also to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The declaration recognises “the right of indigenous families and communities to retain shared responsibility for the upbringing, training, education and well-being of their children, consistent with the rights of the child.” Secondly, the declaration recognises “the collective right to live in freedom, peace and security as distinct peoples and shall not be subjected to any act of genocide or any other act of violence, including forcibly removing children of the group to another group.” Let’s call it what it is, not “cultural genocide” but straight up genocide!

20. In 2014, I wrote about the new focus upon Māori newborns (aka under 5s) by CYF. “In New Zealand, the statistics of newborns uplifted by the state are not made public; these requested through the Official Information Act process. In the 2012 – 2013 year, 13 new-born Māori from a total of 26 were removed from the birthing table, and 80 Māori babies from a total of 157 were removed from their mother within 30 days of their birth (Bernadette McKenzie, Deputy Chief Executive, Child Youth &amp; Family, personal communication, June, 6, 2014). In the first instance, these infants are most often placed with state approved non-Māori caregivers until the concerns held can be addressed via a FGC. Māori make up 15% of the total New Zealand population and the uplift of nearly 100 infants a year from their mothers, many of who are not returned, essentially wipes out future generations of Māori. The actual number of infants uplifted is likely to be much higher as the primary ethnicity is recorded by the social worker and often this is discretionary depending who that social worker decides the child may go to.” (See Moyle, 2014).

21. In 2018, I am still talking about our babies being uplifted where 45 over the last year were taken from their mother the day they were born. The number has climbed in the last three years, with 225 in 2017 - 38 more than 2016 and 63 more than 2015. Over the last three years, 574 babies ended up in state care within the first month of their life, according to figures released under the Official Information Act (See article source here). The percentage of these infants being Māori has increased from 50% in 2013 to 70% in 2018.

22. This targeting of our mokopuna is the structural/systemic/institutional racism (not unconscious bias), that the Puao te ata tu inquiry spoke at great lengths of, and like the Brown inquiry of 2000, was largely ignored. These uplift statistics of our mokopuna also correlate with what is being reported in other colonial jurisdictions such as the USA, UK and Australia, that right now are greater than they have ever experienced before. For example, ten times that of the stolen generations and the 60s scoop. And whilst the Chief social worker commented in this article, “some of the babies would have been taken for planned adoption rather than protection reasons.” This is misleading in order to distract from the truth of the increase. There is a vast difference between children taken with a mother's consent to adopt, and those uplifted for reasons of concern for their safety.

23. It is also not true that these infants are taken as a “last resort.” My FGC findings with over 30 whānau members showed that often the under 5s (including newborns) were often uplifted as a first resort in family violence situations (See, Moyle &amp; Tauri, 2016 for further reading). Especially where predictive risk modelling type assessments were being used by police, social workers and contracted assessment services. They are deficit focused rather than strengths, and accentuate weakness from a white-is-right worldview. ‘Child centered’ as a policy/practice is about as state centered as the term ‘child poverty.' It is ludicrous to assess a child apart from their collective environment and connections.

24. The under 5s are the largest growing uplift group under Oranga Tamariki. (A title that grossly misrepresents the meaning. Rather than tamariki ora, is more aptly Tamariki Trauma.) An organisation where the social work 'elite' fail to challenge the brown care to incarceration pipeline. That rebranded itself from CYF, promising to have NZ child protection sorted in 5 years time. And in 12 months of rolling over its same senior staff into the new model; it did so assuring the same “partnership with whānau, hapu and iwi” (stated earlier in this submission) yet minus any acknowledgement of te Tiriti or the need to address institutional racism. Not even the Expert Advisory Group with its ‘no social work experts at the table' could utter the words 'institutional racism' in any of its shiny reports. A year on, under Oranga Tamariki the total number of children in NZ state care has skyrocketed from 5,600 to 6,100 and 63% of those are ours.

25. These numbers are unprecedented and result from racist practice window-dressed as cultural competence to work with our mokopuna. Supported also by Family Court practice that often put our women and children at risk of further harm. (See Backbone Collective reports on this). Employing overseas social workers and new graduates (like interns doing fine brain surgery) to deal with complex cases, high workloads, in a robotic risk averse work environment, with little understanding of dynamics of colonial fallout/domestic violence, historical trauma and with no external culturally competent supervision, adds to the bush picnic. (See more on institutional racism in child protection here).

26. In a recent report commissioned by the new child protection model, it quoted 12% of children in state care have disclosed being abused, since being placed in care. That is, those who have had the courage to tell. It, like other disclosure research states that the actual number is thought to be considerably higher. If we were to take that 12% and apply it to the 100,000 survivors that went through state care from the 50s to the 90s, then we are looking at 12,000 at the very least. And we've probably transacted at least another 70,000 children through state care since 1990.

27. Which leads to my last two questions. If it took the Confidential Listening and Assistance Service (CLAS), 7 years to listen to 1,100 survivors, what does the RC hope to achieve with 12,000 potential survivors in 2 ½ years (by end of this political term)? And if it cost the Australian Royal Commission 500 million over 5 years, realistically what will we achieve with 12 million?

28. I, my brothers, my whāngai siblings and wider whānau have contributed multiple times to this kaupapa over the years. My/our final comment, is if we are to learn anything about what we are not getting right for mokopuna ora in Aotearoa, then we have to listen to, and cease dismissing the experiences of those most affected. Lived-experience is everything. It is true knowledge. It is vital that the voices of Ngā Mōrehu and all survivor groups are centralised in this RC. It is essential that as Ngā Mōrehu/survivors are supported to speak out. Our silence does not belong to Crown Law, Police, MSD, Oranga Tamariki, the Family Court and positional people that 'trough feed' off the backs of our mokopuna. We will no longer be silent so that others can remain comfortable. These systems have no right to keep us from protecting ourselves, our whānau and future generations of our people!

RECOMMENDATIONS

29. Tangata whenua must have their own stream in the Royal Commission, their own panel of chosen experts, and advisory survivor roopu, all with appropriate resourcing.

30. Change the 1999 cut-off to include current abuse experienced by our young people state care.

31. Consider an appropriate restoration process that includes not just an apology but compensation for all survivors that come under the final terms.

32. If faith-based institutions want to be open and accountable for the way they failed to care for some of their wards, I suggest they combine their resources and establish their own inquiry. Perhaps run it alongside the Royal Commission, with an appropriate resolution process and compensation for survivors.

33. In the learning about how to make it different, the RC must investigate how institutional racism within the current model of child protection contributes to the gross over-representation of our mokopuna in state care.

34. Look to establish a totally independent (of MSD) quality assurance and accountability body to act as oversight to the practices of Oranga Tamariki. A body which also processes compliments/complaints from families and individuals experiencing this practice.

35. Look into a tangata whenua model/body responsible for approving social workers as culturally competent (fit and proper) to work with tangata whenua in need.

36. Look into the need for OT social workers to engage in external ‘culturally competent to work with Maori’ supervision for OT social workers.

37. If, the RC cannot do anything to put matters right for survivors (both present and historical), then just hand it all back to us, our lands, resources, our babies, everything!

I will NOT be silent so that career bureaucrats can maintain their positioned comfort.

a7i5h9,1,2018-12-18,Don't like myself,throwawayact56,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a7i5h9/dont_like_myself/,"I'm 22 years old and am about to finish up college. On the surface my life probably looks pretty good because I get good grades and I've held down really good internships. I usually put on a smile for the world and act like everything is great but in reality I am miserable. I am extremely dependent on weed to get myself through the day. I have to smoke to be able to sleep and its pretty much been like that for 2 or 3 years now. After my freshman year of college I broke up with a girlfriend of 3 years and from there started to mess around with drugs. I've tried shrooms, DMT, LSD, ketamine, coke, xans, pain killers, and a couple other random things. When in high school I would never even think of smoking weed let alone doing any of the above mentioned substances. I'm embarrassed to myself that I have done so many different things let alone random combinations of things. I got so wrapped up into drugs after I broke up with my ex that I stopped even caring about relationships with girls. For two years I didn't get laid as a college student while a ton of my friends were getting laid all the time. I attributed it to the fact that I was fat and unattractive. Unintentionally I lost like 40 pounds when I was depressed last year and have recently gotten back into weight lifting  to try to get out some of my pent up aggression towards the world and myself. I am in a better place now than I was last year this time but now I am extremely critical of my own body and appearance. I think about how I look and look into the mirror way too much and still dont think I look good enough.  I put on a pretty tough front and never show emotion other than happiness or anger when around my friends. I am posting here because I'm afraid to ask from help from friends and family because I dont want to admit to them the things I have done. While in the period of not getting laid I attributed all my sadness to the fact that I couldnt get girls. Then a couple months ago I hooked up with a really hot girl which gave me a temporary boost of confidence  but now I am depressed again because I realize that wasnt the solution to my problems. I have an extremely addictive personality and I feel like I'm completely addicted to checking social media on my phone and comparing myself to the happiness people portray on social media. Just kinda wanted to type this all out and see what if anyone had any advice as to ways I can learn to like myself more and be less anxious. "
a7i987,1,2018-12-18,Unexpected meeting of an amazing girl. Heads messing with me? Girl + Tigers &amp; Lions,Kagemusha2085,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/a7i987/unexpected_meeting_of_an_amazing_girl_heads/,"So I had an unexpected thing happen in the last couple months and its got to the point where I really don’t want to fuck it up.  So a while back I was talking to another girl and we were hanging out a bunch.  Well she started wanting to go to this big cat sanctuary that at the time I couldn’t give two shits about.  I was only going because she wanted to and it made her happy.  After we went a couple times I really started getting attached to place and the amazing animals that they took care of there.  Shortly afterwards, I stopped talking to the girl, because she was crazy, but I kept going out to the sanctuary and spending times volunteering at the place.

So after the last chick, I really wasn’t interested in looking for “the next one” so I just started enjoying my time with the tigers while I learned how to take care of them.  I was getting trained by one of the interns that was currently living there.  We really seem to hit it off and really become friends by bonding from our passion for the animals.  I was amazed at how interesting this woman was and the experiences she has had in her life.  Her passion for the animals and work ethic to take care of them was awe inspiring.  Then it hit me, she was going to move back to her home which is very far from here.  I realized I needed to try something because she was just so amazing to talk to so I decided to ask her out and show her the town.  When I asked her about that she said she couldn’t get a day off but would be coming back after she left her internship.  

So here is where this started messing with my head.  I start thinking maybe her response was just a nice way to let me off and say she isn’t interested.  We continued talking though afterwards and it started to make me think that maybe she just really couldn’t get the time off.  Then I thought that she is so passionate about the animals that maybe she feel bad not being there.  Over time we continued talking regularly and learning more about each other.  She is amazing person to talk to and is one of the few people I have met that I could sit and talk for hours.  It’s a rare occurrence to find someone that I seem to feel that comfortable with and really way out of my league. 

Eventually the day came and she moved back after finishing her internship.  It makes me realize how much I really want to get to know her and want to see where something can go.  I am not an idiot and I know how hard a long distance thing can be.  The reality of the situation is now I really don’t want to fuck this up.  I am the type of person that doesn’t like to hide my feelings and I know that communication is the key to a great relationship.  My gut is to say something like “Hey, I really enjoy talking with you because you are such an amazing and interesting person.  I know long distance things are hard but I would love to see where something like this could go.  When you are back in town I think we should go out sometime to see what happens.”  I realize that this could possible explode in my face and ruin a good potential relationship but doing nothing could do the same as well.  I am thinking the risk is worth taking but I am still not sure. 

So what do you think?  Any recommendation you may have?"

a7ir5x,1,2018-12-18,DUI arrest and WOFT,D3CKRD,Militaryfaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Militaryfaq/comments/a7ir5x/dui_arrest_and_woft/,"Hey guys, 

Im gonna make this short and quick.  Im a senior in college, graduating in may 2019 (BBA Finance - 3.3 gpa). 
I have a solid internship and anticipate having a pretty good job after graduating, but I’ve always wanted to serve.  I have been looking into the WOFT program, would otherwise feel pretty optimistic about my chances, except for a few big problems:

1) I was arrested for DUI in march 2018 and plead guilty to reckless driving for which I served 2 days in jail and will soon be completing 6mo of probation
2) I smoked pot when I was in high school/early college
3) I was prescribed vyvanse for ADHD when I was 19, which I stopped taking soon after and have not sought further treatment since (im 24 now)

Anyway, I figure my biggest barrier is obviously the recent arrest.  Is this waiverable?  If so what are my chances?  Would I have a better shot at WOFT if I worked for a year or two and then applied?  Would it be better to enlist and then try for WOFT?

Last year today I started my journey from r/nofap and here i am with a clean nofap record. **Yes, 1 year of nofap**. Year 2018 was by far the best year of my life. Here the list of things i was able to achieve, because i decided to change my life starting from no flap:

1. lost 45 pounds (200 --&gt; 155 Ibs)
2. Exorcise regularly
3. Become more spiritual (Reading, Meditation, and Yoga)
4. Became vegetarian
5. Finished my PhD in engineering from a top 5 engineering school
6. Got a summer internship in silicon valley
7. Got a full-time job, recently (my dream job)
8. Found my spiritual partner,recently (girlfriend)
9. Paid off all my credit card debt (i used to sleep on a coach since i could not pay rent)
10. Bought my dream car
11. Change my friend's life (one was at a verge of suicide, now graduating)

When i look back i cannot imagine i came this far in my life. I was able to conquer most of my fears and shape my future. No fap was just a small tool to give me confidence to change other aspect of my life. I was in a deep shit (look at my old post!) and i was able to come out of it strong. For all you guys who are looking to stop fapping. YOU CAN DO it. I fapped for 16 years. now i am clean. You need to change the way you live: the prospect of your life, how to control your emotions, physical health, and etc...

Do not be ashamed of who you are and what you have done. It is not too late to change. LOVE YOU ALL"
a7iyey,23,2018-12-18,Post college graduation vent / reflection,bigwilly39,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/a7iyey/post_college_graduation_vent_reflection/,"So I just graduated college about a week ago and I've had a few days to sit around, pack my shit, and let it all sink in. I remember graduating high school thinking to myself it's no problem I didn't get anywhere with girls because college would change everything. Well, I just went through 4 and a half years of college without kissing a girl or even going on a single date.

Looking back, I was definitely somewhat depressed freshman and sophomore years and I powered through that, but I wonder how much that held me back. I did fine academically picking up an engineering degree and ending up with a top 3 GPA in the department. I was also lucky to be athletic enough to become a part of a club sport team all four years. Team members come and go, but we all had each other's backs. I went to probably over 100 sporting events combined and solo traveled a lot over breaks. Picked up guitar and trivia contests as new hobbies. Snagged a decent internship that lasted 3 years. Went to at least a couple big parties every semester usually with the club sports team. Yet in spite of all that, not a single girl from class, parties, tinder, or anywhere ever showed a hint of interest. I've seen plenty of girls give obvious signs to guys around me but never my way. The handful of girls I matched on Tinder over the years were radio silent. (Funnily enough, I used my same style on my friend's tinder account and had several convos within minutes.) The couple of girls I asked out in person where I thought there was a nonzero chance of success all shot me down.

I'm sorry if I come off as flexing but I just wanted to show that I think I did really well for myself and it didn't help at all on this front. Most people have no idea I'm FA unless I've told them. None of that bullshit generic advice would have helped me. The only consolation has been a couple people who know my situation telling me straight up I've just been extremely unlucky. That would've been fine coming out of high school, but now I'm done with college and moving to a small town for a job with a small company. What do I do now? I guess the inevitable is having to leave and move to a city. And then what? I'll be 25 or 26 with no dating experience. Thinking about that makes me cringe but I'm sure 18 year old me would've felt the same about having no experience at 22 or 23. Even then, so what? I was in a city for college and look how far that got me. I just rolled into town and popped open Tinder and there were a total of two girls near my age in a 30 mile radius. I just know the little bit of optimism I had coming out of high school is now completely gone.

Lastly, I don't care if this is cringy af but I want to thank this sub for helping me get through college. I spent many lonely, frustrating nights browsing here, chatting with others, reminding each other that there are others out there like us. Very few people in real life know about my FA status and it's an uncomfortable subject so I can't / don't really talk about it. Thank you all for being there when I needed it most. I just needed to get this off my mind and no one I know in real life would understand."

My mom has been battling depression and drug addiction my whole life. She and my dad got a divorce 6 years ago and she hasn’t handled it well at all. Holidays are always horrible and she usually relapses. This year has been exponentially worse.  

I graduated from college Saturday and she refused to attend the ceremony. We got into a huge argument about it. She blocked my phone number and my dad said not to worry, she’ll probably unblock it when she’s over this phase. 

This morning I got a phone call that she committed suicide. I was at my college town 3 hours away from home. I got a ride and made it back to be with my family. I don’t know how to handle this. It feels like a bad dream. I just want my mom back. I know there is nothing I could have done, but I feel so guilty. 

I also leave for an internship in Europe in 2 weeks. I am so scared. I was so prepared and excited. Now, I feel nothing but anger and sadness. I don’t even know how to cope. I miss her so much.

a7j26w,10,2018-12-18,"Journal 12/18 Today was uber long, but went well, had a VERY disturbing dream this morning though",PMOFreeForever,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/a7j26w/journal_1218_today_was_uber_long_but_went_well/,"So last night as I was going to bed I got super excited, it's a week to Christmas, so I decided to do a week no PMO, then this morning happened. I had a super disturbing dream that I won't go into, but it ended up triggering me so that I masturbated first thing this morning. So in less that 12 hours I had already messed up. I'm determined to keep trying though. My therapist liked the idea, but he says I'm probably biting off too much too quick, I mean he was encouraging too, but he just wanted me to not go too big too fast (I have a tendency of doing that then completely failing then beating myself up for it) But I want to keep going and try at least. My goal is still just porn, and that's going swimmingly, but the masturbating is more of a side goal right now. And I was able to let go of the dream really fast, which is nice, I used to just obsess and feel so guilty over things like that. 

Therapy went well. We didn't really discuss anything new, but we sort of worked on the basics of what we want to do and how we're going to achieve it, sort of setting us up for the future. He wants to work on connections and relationships to combat my abandonment issues because he is guessing it's going to be awful come June (his internship ends, I've already told him I worry about it weekly for 6 months now and still have 6 months before it happens. I'm not good with bonds ending) So we'll see how that progresses. We also discussed my focus on the addiction right now. He liked the idea of me focusing just on porn for now, he agrees it is a good small step. For some reason it did sort of undermine my confidence though. I almost felt like...like it was being diminished? Idk it was all in my head because he really was supportive of it, and I am all on board with it, I think it's been really fantastic and perfectly suits my journey! I'm just second guessing myself, and lately I've been putting a great deal of pressure on myself to stop masturbating, and that is exactly why I did this step, to stop the debilitating pressure and just focus on one achievable step. Maybe that's what's bugging me, because I know he's right and I shouldn't be pushing myself for 7 days, and just do 1 at a time, maybe it isn't uncomfortable because of therapy, but because of my challenge for myself. hmm Ok well I guess I'll just focus on the day, so for tomorrow I would like to not masturbate, that's the goal.

The diet is going alright, I'm still trying to make up for over eating a bit a week ago, so that is a great deal of stress, but I am making steps to resolve that.

The holidays have cleared up a bit, it was getting hectic, but we've consolidated things a bit so it's more manageable.

I got a new car today! It's as old as I am (27) so it's not really new, but new to me. It's much better than my last car, plus I love that it can go quick, my last car was a behemoth that revved up slow so this is nice. I'm super super grateful for it too, I'm really lucky.

Sort of strange news, I just recently quit my job as a crossing guard for the city schools, and a couple months ago one of the guards was hit and was in a coma for a while and still in really bad shape, and now today another guard was hit and killed. It's crazy, we haven't had any problems in over 20 years, and now we've had two really bad ones in 3 months. I'm sort of really grateful I'm not doing it anymore, I think I took for granted how dangerous it could be...scary and sad news for her and the others guards as well.

Anyway, just thinking about lots of stuff today. Have a good night/day all! :)"

I'm supposed to leave tomorrow for the interview the next day in a different city for an internship that I really want.

My NDad and possibly Emom are taking me there because I don't have a car and can't drive because they want control over me and won't help me out with anything in life, you know the deal. 

Today when my NDad realized my mom wanted to come with to drive down there, he threw a huge tantrum saying she is ruining his life because he wants to spend time alone with me (which I don't want) He's been yelling and swearing and won't stop. When he gets like this, he often will start driving erratically and I don't feel safe.

Plus, I'll be trapped in a hotel room in a city where I know very few people alone with my parents and that scares me too.

I'm debating whether or not to cancel this interview. I feel like I should be used to his crap by now but I'm a super sensitive person and I feel like I'm going to just be trying to avoid crying the whole interview and it's going to go super bad anyways so why waste my time you know.

Guess I'm just looking to vent and get some advice if anyone has any. Thanks for reading."

a7jj3u,3,2018-12-19,Been good for a while but the situation I’m in is making me feel like I’m gonna fall apart soon,Unorthodox-Juicebox,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/a7jj3u/been_good_for_a_while_but_the_situation_im_in_is/,"Hey all. Haven’t posted here in a while. Most of my posts here have to do with jobs and working and what do you know...this ones no different.

I finally got a job after about 3 years of not working/only having a summer internship the past two years (that I enjoyed immensely and didn’t even feel like work) 

It’s a seasonal job where my girlfriend works. I started in November, and I’ve been doing ok since. It’s really stressful, taxing physically and mentally, and made me break down once when I got off. But mostly I’ve been doing well, and I’m proud of myself for it. 

Me and my girlfriend of 3 years (4 in January) are ready to move in together after her lease with a roommate ends in January. I’m extremely excited for it, but it’s also one of the things causing me a lot of stress and anxiety right now. The apartment we really wanted and thought we were going to move into probably isn’t going to happen anymore. We really liked it and it had great reviews which is rare for apartments in that price range. We went looking around again today and the uncertainty of it just made me feel not too good. 

The job I got is seasonal, with the possibility they might keep you on after the term ends. Well, that’s not happening for me, my manager made clear to me the other day. My last day will be January 2nd. I have less than a month to find another job with decent pay and be ready to leave home for the first time ever, find an apartment, shop for it, and get my stuff together. And thinking about that is making me lose my mind. I’ve felt a knot in my stomach and chest ever since we got back from looking at apartments today. 

Another thing causing stress is another aspect of the job — the hours. I work the closing shift, getting off anywhere from 8-10pm, and going in at 11am or 1pm. It takes up all of my day and feels like I have no time to myself to either relax or just recoup. I’m off Christmas Eve and Christmas but then work that shift 3 days in a row, getting off at 9, and also working on New Year’s Even which really upsets me cause I’ll miss the beginning of my family gathering, but I’ll be off at 8pm. All while my uncle who I rarely get to see is in town for the next two weeks, and I’ll barely get to see him when here’s here because of these shifts.

Family is one of my most important things in my life and with these hours I’ve already missed a few events with them, including my little  brothers 10th birthday which made me really upset. Im still gonna miss more too, I won’t be able to pick up my uncle from the airport like usual or partake in the annual cookie baking with my family this Friday cause I’ll be working the graveyard shift, going in at 8pm and getting out at 4am. 

I was thinking about quitting before they let me go, saying my last day will be the 23rd. But I’m non confrontational, and even though I want to quit so I can be with my family and kinda regroup myself, a part of me inside also wants to stick it out to prove to myself that I can. At the same time, I feel like I could use that extra week to find another job as well.

It’s just starting to feel like everything is hitting me all at once and I’m scared that I will break like I have before. I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified of not being able to find a job. I don’t know if I should quit or stick it out, and not many people have given me advice on it so far and I just really need some.  I’m sorry this post was everywhere, usually I’m better at grouping the same topic together but my mind is all over the place right now and I just wanted to get this out.

Thank you to everyone who reads these and the one that comment. It really helps me and I feel like I’m not alone when I post here seeing everybody else with the same struggles and seeing how everybody tries their best to pickup their fellow human. I love you guys. "

I know this is pretty old by now but I never got to have a roleplay of this, and recently saw a picture that reignited my interest in this little art show. More or less, I'm looking for a scene involving one or more of the patrons, anyone of them is fair game besides the guys. There are two scenarios I'm currently tossing around in my head at the moment.

One Boy Party: The shop had been bought out for the day, a kid's birthday having filled up the slot as the doors closed to anyone not on the list. It started off rather normal, the parents dropping the little one off... But then they left, claiming they had business to attend to. The pizzeria going quiet for nearly half an hour as the boy waited for guest to arrive, no one did. With a frown on his face he'd let out an upset sigh. Why not give the kid a birthday to remember! Who knows, he might even be good for seconds~

The Intern: With the start of a new internship program the slots filled rather quickly. The list full in a manner of days yet none of them were really the target audience. Except one, a rather young guy set up to advertise the rather impressive new sasuage on display. And with his first day coming soon, a smile on his face, and a few thoughts in his head. He might just let the crew get a sample of what the customers ordered!

If you've got an idea, hit me with it. Till then. I'll just drop my kinks and leave it at that. You can message me on Kik and Wickr, just asks me whats what. Anywho, see ya.

Kinks: Ageplay (8-16) , big dick (1ft - 3ft+), excessive cum, body bulge,  pain, rough, dom/sub, cumflation, name calling, cursing, Powers, cum from mouth/ nose, cock shock and more.

Limits: Gore, Scat, Farting, Vore

*****
&gt; According to a former Microsoft intern working on the company&amp;#039;s Edge web browser, Google attempted to leverage code onto some of Microsoft&amp;#039;s most popular online platforms.

&gt; Software engineer Joshua Bakita explained why Microsoft chose to kill its EdgeHTML engine in favor of Chromium, and exactly how Google may have tried to trip up the Edge browser.

&gt; Microsoft recently announced that it would be switching the browser engine behind the Edge web browser from its custom EdgeHTML solution to Google&amp;#039;s Project Chromium.

&gt; According to Bakita, many of his coworkers at Microsoft were quite convinced that Google wasn&amp;#039;t playing fair.

&gt; When the Edge team reached out for comment from Google regarding the hidden YouTube code, Google turned down any requests to alter the code and refused to provide additional information.

&gt; The question is how the company came to the decision, and whether Google attempted to bring down Edge with truly malign effort.

I'm currently in college studying computer science and I expect I  should be graduating within another 2 years. 

I ask this because everytime I'm at family functions, my cousins and other family members always ask me if I'm working yet, and when I say no, I'm focusing on school instead, they ALWAYS chime in and say ""well when I was in college I worked a job at the same time, you should be working too"" etc etc. It's really disheartening and they make me feel like garbage and I honestly resent going to family functions now because it always feels like it  turns into a ""make him feel bad for not working"" event.

Sorry for the ranting but I just had to get that out because it's getting on my nerves. Anyways, the reason I don't work is because my parents said they are fine with me not working as long as I'm in college pursuing a degree. I spend a ton of time studying during the semester, and while I do have free time to pick up a part time job, I would much rather not spend every waking moment during the school semester either studying or working, I enjoy having some free time to wind down. On the other hand though, I do feel like I stand out a bit because most of my classmates all work and I don't and it does make me feel a bit weird. I do plan on applying for some sort of internship before I graduate, but besides that I don't plan to get a job until I graduate because I really value the break I get between semesters because I'm really stressed out during the school year.

Anyways, sorry for the ranting, but I just want to know if I really should just say fuck it and get a job even though I really dont want to."

We are based in Boise Idaho, so shouldn’t that mean the vast a majority of workers should be white? I don’t care if I work with trans people, gay, women, black, white, etc etc etc as long as we can work together and they’re competent!

I’ve heard so many people talk about how terrible this new policy is but everyone is afraid to bring it up. We work with a transgender engineer  (man dressed as a woman) and he’s been doing talks at the company. No one gave a shit about him or his problems before but now I’m just annoyed when I see him.

a7m3nn,1,2018-12-19,Looking for advices about to the relationship with my female friend,c29654,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a7m3nn/looking_for_advices_about_to_the_relationship/,"Hello everyone,

I am looking for advices about to the relationship with my female friend (her 22 yo, me 23 yo man, both at College).

Before started I would like to say I am not very good with women, usually I am very shy and she is the first woman to take a little interest in me.

We have been friends for 4 years, but we lost sight during the last two years because I had to move. But we still stayed in touch. During the first two years we were not very intimate, we met at College and we were in the same friend group. That's all. Last September she moved up in the same city as mine, she was new and alone and we started to meet after College at least once a week (in order to see movies, to drink alcohol at bar or to eat pizzas etc). Our relationship started to be more intimate and I decided to ask her for a date (end of November).

She confessed she was lesbian and was not interested by men... I was surprised but she is a good friend, I like to spend time and laugh with her. So I decided to pass and we stayed friend. Our relationship became more intimate, we talked about women, what she like, what I like etc...

She is a quite shy, she had one girlfriend in her life and she never does the first step etc... I have a complete confidence in her. But I think our relationship is unbalanced. It's always me who proposes to go out for a drink or a meal. She never proposes. It's always me who asks for her news and some times she answers long time after... And she never thanks me, I offered her one diner and she is looking for an internship so I sent her resume to a friend. I never had a ""Thank you"".

But on the contrary she asked for doing sport with me (muay thai, running) and she wants me to do badminton with her. She also proposed to go on mountain trip (with 2 others friends).

So I don't understand, am I doing it wrong ? Am I to ""needy"" ? Or is it her ?

Since the last weekend I decided to put distance between us in order to rebalanced the relationship. I don't send her text messages and I won't ask her to go outside anymore. Good or bad idea ?

This week is our ""exam week"", she send me some text messages to know if everything is doing it right with my exams and to talk about hers. Of course I answer her texts (with time), but I don't ask too much questions.

Thank you for reading.

a7nrn4,2,2018-12-19,[Futa 4 A Playing F] The Multiple prompt list. Something for everyone! I hope.. (Multiple prompts) (Open prompts) (Light or dark) (Very long!),Soapydopey69,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/a7nrn4/futa_4_a_playing_f_the_multiple_prompt_list/,"Hey people of FRP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

I enjoy playing Futa but only if your character is female. This is important! If you're curious, I tend to play a more 'realistic' character and by that I mean one that isn't HH cup breasts, an ass as big as the earth and a cock the size of the empire state!

My preference of character is one that looks like Jenna Mcdougall (I'm aware she's a celeb, but I'm only using her looks not her status). If you don't know what she looks like, I recommend you google her, she's a petite blonde that should be okay for our RP. If you have a suggestion yourself about a 'natural' looking girl, let me know!

And if you're after a 'Surprise I'm futa!' Scene aswell, this can be incorporated if necessary.

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Tight clothing, CFNM and outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**The threesome with the two sisters:** It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with Demi over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me.

a7nzm3,2,2018-12-19,[M4A Playing F] The Multiple prompt list. Something for everyone! I hope.. (Multiple prompts) (Open prompts) (Light or dark) (Very long!),Soapydopey69,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/a7nzm3/m4a_playing_f_the_multiple_prompt_list_something/,"Disclaimer: I am 18+ looking for someone 18+ for fictional roleplay!

Hey people of APP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

I have left the ages ambiguous on purpose, if you read this properly, you would have read this portion and you would know that I tend to play with our characters between the ages of 14-25, depending on the scenario.

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Tight clothing, CFNM and outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**The threesome with the two sisters:** It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister.

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D and C  [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with Demi over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes.

a7o2we,3,2018-12-19,I screwed up my only chance for an internship.,KaanFresh,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/a7o2we/i_screwed_up_my_only_chance_for_an_internship/,"I'm a computer science student from Turkey. Being someone from outside of EU/EEA or North America already puts me far behind any other candidate just because of visa sponsorship requirements. I could apply for thousand internships internationally and can rejected by all of them even if I am a potential candidate. However I did apply for hundreds of internship position. Only one returned with an e-mail saying they want me to solve coding problem on CodeSignal. I miss the deadline due to confusion of difference in time zones.

&amp;#x200B;

I flipping hate myself right now. It was not some big company that everyone wants to work someday. But at the end it was an internship in a country I'd like to move in near future. Most of 'internships' in Turkey is hard to get in. You need to know someone with an authority; a manager, a senior in HR etc if you want to do an 'internship' internship which you can do something relative to what you study in school and real work experience. I or anyone from my family don't know anyone like that. There are places that I can show as an internship on paper but in that option you just make copies of some documents which is totally unrelated to my field. I don't want that.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't be this sad if I failed in coding problem online or at an interview. There is one people to blame and that's unfortunately me."

&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden op vragen van het lid Popken &amp;#40;PVV&amp;#41; aan de staatssecretaris van  
Defensie over het bericht dat een fataal ongeluk met een Apache in Mali  
veroorzaakt werd door een verbogen onderdeel &amp;#40;ingezonden 12 december 2018  
met het kenmerk 2018Z23587&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1.       
Bent u bekend met het bericht dat een fataal ongeluk met een Apache  
veroorzaakt werd door een verbogen onderdeel? [1]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
Ja  
&amp;nbsp;    
2.       
Kunt u bevestigen dat er een intern rapport bestaat, waarin een andere  
oorzaak staat vermeld dan de versie die de Kamer heeft ontvangen? Zo ja,  
hoe kan dat? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
Nee, zowel in de brief &amp;#40;Kamerstuk, 29521-332&amp;#41; als het Commissie van  
Onderzoek &amp;#40;CvO&amp;#41;-rapport wordt het technisch falen van een component in het  
besturingssysteem als oorzaak van het ongeluk aangemerkt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het falende onderdeel betrof een gebroken probe van de Linear Variable  
Differential Transducer &amp;#40;LVDT&amp;#41; in de servo actuator. De CvO concludeerde  
dat de probe was verbogen en als gevolg van metaalmoeheid was gebroken. Het  
is niet vastgesteld waarom de probe was verbogen. Onderzoek heeft  
uitgewezen dat de initiële kromming waarschijnlijk niet door operationeel  
gebruik van de helikopter is ontstaan &amp;#40;door trillingen&amp;#41;. De CvO heeft niet  
kunnen uitsluiten dat het onderdeel tijdens onderhoud door een externe  
partij verbogen is geraakt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ten tijde van het ongeval werd gebruik gemaakt van twee typen LVDT-probes  
in de servo actuators van de Nederlandse Apachevloot. Bij tests is gebleken  
dat het type probe in de verongelukte Apache &amp;#40;de Q15&amp;#41; na verbuiging eerder  
breekt dan het andere type. Tijdens het CvO-onderzoek is daarom in  
samenspraak met de Amerikaanse overheid en de fabrikant besloten om dit  
type probe uit de Apachevloot te verbannen. Dit is gebeurd bij alle  
Nederlandse en Amerikaanse Apaches.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3.       
Deelt u de conclusie van het rapport dat een gebrek aan materieel, geld en  
trainingen hebben bijgedragen aan het ongeluk? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja,  
hoeveel van dergelijke ongelukken moeten er nog komen voordat Defensie  
leert van zijn fouten?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
In het CvO-rapport wordt geen verband gelegd tussen het Apache-ongeluk in  
Mali in maart 2015 en een gebrek aan materieel, geld en trainingen. Het  
ongeluk met de Q15 was het gevolg van een technisch falen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4.        
Kunt u aangeven waarom in uw ogen de Kamer over dit fatale ongeluk niet  
onjuist of onvolledig is geïnformeerd?        
6.  
Deelt u de mening dat hieruit wederom blijkt dat Defensie liever dergelijke  
incidenten geheim houdt, in plaats van eerlijk en open te communiceren met  
de Kamer? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4 en 6  
De Kamer is destijds op de gebruikelijke wijze over de uitkomst van het CvO-  
rapport geïnformeerd. De belangrijkste conclusies zijn met de Kamer  
gedeeld. Het rapport heeft een vertrouwelijk karakter, omdat het rapport  
onder andere technische gegevens bevat die vallen onder de International  
Traffic in Arms Regulations &amp;#40;ITAR&amp;#41; regelgeving voor exportcontrole.  
Daarnaast bevat het rapport persoonsvertrouwelijke gegevens, waaronder  
verklaringen die in vertrouwen zijn gegeven. Het uitgebreide CvO-rapport is  
binnen het Commando Luchtstrijdkrachten gedeeld met als doel er zelf lering  
uit te trekken. Sinds 11 juni 2018 wordt de samenvatting en de geleerde  
lessen van een door de CvO onderzocht ernstig ongeval &amp;#40;ernstcategorie 4&amp;#41;  
aan de Kamer gestuurd &amp;#40;11 juni 2018, Kamerstuk 34919-21&amp;#41;. Het CvO-rapport  
staat, uitgezonderd de vertrouwelijke passages, sinds 26 juni 2018 op de  
website van de Rijksoverheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5.        
Kunt u aangeven of de genoemde derde partij, dezelfde partij is als waar  
Defensie de Apache laat moderniseren, zoals genoemd in uw brief met  
Kamerstuknummer 27 830, nr. 234? Kunt u daarbij aangeven of een eventuele  
contractuele geheimhoudingsplicht onderdeel is van de huidige en nieuwe  
contracten met deze partij? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
De Apache remanufacture &amp;#40;modernisatie&amp;#41; wordt onder een Foreign Military  
Sales &amp;#40;FMS&amp;#41; contract uitgevoerd door de genoemde derde partij. De partij  
die het onderhoud van het onderdeel met de falende component in het  
besturingssysteem had uitgevoerd, is niet betrokken bij deze modernisatie.  
Een FMS overeenkomst tussen de Amerikaanse overheid en Defensie is  
commercieel vertrouwelijk. Voor vrijgave van een FMS is toestemming van de  
Amerikaanse overheid nodig.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7.        
Deelt u de mening dat de missiedruk te hoog is en was, en dat de  
Nederlandse regering de missie in Mali nooit had moeten aangaan? Zo nee,  
waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
Nee, het kabinet deelt deze mening niet. Er is ook geen verband met het  
Apache-ongeluk.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8.        
Bent u bereid op deze vragen te antwoorden voor het algemeen  
overleg Integrale aanpak veiligheid en integriteit van 19 december 2018?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
Ja)

a7p6mw,18,2018-12-19,"Some of my coworkers [+40] have given me [19M] a Christmas gift, as an new intern should I give one back?",paperplane745,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a7p6mw/some_of_my_coworkers_40_have_given_me_19m_a/,"I recently started working as an IT intern about a month ago, and since my school is on break, this is my first week doing full time, so I have been doing part time (20 hours/week) in the weeks prior. Since Christmas is next week, all my coworkers have started giving each other gifts. 

The reason why I've come to this subreddit for help is because I know that my views on holidays are different than others, and I'd definitely appreciate outside advice. Let me explain. 

Long story short, I come from a family where ""holiday spirit"" at holiday family gatherings is really just a hidden family time bomb that finally exploded recently, resulting in indifference for holidays other than having the day off. When I was a kid, we used to always celebrate Christmas, but the concept of gift giving and Santa was thrown in the dumpster one Christmas when my mom found out my dad cheated on her. While this was more than a decade ago, I feel like from this moment, Christmas has just been really stale for me personally, especially when my parents give empty promises for gifts that I won't ask them again for, out of respect (Asian culture). I personally dislike giving small gifts for the purpose of the holiday and would rather give meaningful gifts that people would actually use, as opposed to a box of chocolates. 

Truthfully, I now do not have a care for holiday fesitivities; not saying I am a grouch or a downer that wants to ruin the holiday spirit for others, but I still do feel bad for receiving all these gifts from my coworkers with nothing to return. I am ""chill"" with all of my coworkers, but by no means am I close with any of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, for my 1 month working here as an intern and my views on the holidays, is it rude that I didn't get gifts for my coworkers? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I've been given Christmas gifts from coworkers, but as a new intern with no Christmas spirit, is it rude if I don't give a gift back?"
a7p78u,4,2018-12-19,How many profitable trading account months (on average) before you would suggest someone start trading with real money? And what's a good amount of real money to trade with for my purposes?,Spark-001,Forex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/a7p78u/how_many_profitable_trading_account_months_on/,"I'm ending my first month of trading a Forex practice account up 1.5%.  I'm pretty pleased with this outcome since my goal is to one day turn this into a job and not to get a crazy high rate of return or expect to get rich quick.  My system and approach right now seems to be best described as ""trend trading"".  It's mostly based off of ""Naked Forex"" (the book) and ForexSignals TV (a YouTube channel) but I've used a variety of other sources' advice as well.  I also read the news quite a bit, usually for a few hours a day.

My long term goal is to get a stable rate of return with a practice account and then move on to a significant but not huge amount of money, perhaps try to get sponsored or otherwise take the appropriate series exams (I had an offer to get paid to study and take the Series 63 at one point in time but since I had no actual trading experience, I passed it up for other opportunities), then if my practice account months go well I would start trading with a significant amount of real money while ideally not risking my savings.  Finally, if I can turn a stable profit for X time on that I would start looking for a job or internships, perhaps go back to the guys who made me that offer some time ago by now.

Unfortunately my educational background has no economics study at all, even though it was good enough that I had that offer to get paid a modest salary to study for the Series 63 and try my hand at a brokerage job, although that specific job offer was more of a personal relations thing and not as a trader myself.

So to recap, here's my questions:

(1) How many months would you imagine is appropriate with a practice account before moving on to real money?

(2) If your goal was to get a job in a bank or a similar institution, what's the minimum amount of real money you would like to see in a real account before you would treat someone with no economics educational background as a serious candidate for such a job?

Thank you for your replies!"
a7pfwp,3,2018-12-19,Should I work for the competitor of the nice people who paid me to do my thesis?,problydroppingout,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/a7pfwp/should_i_work_for_the_competitor_of_the_nice/,"This is kind of messed up and I don't know what to do.

In 2013 I made a friend- an ambitious, sociable guy. We hung out occasionally but weren't real close or anything. Years later he got me a paid internship at the tiny biotech company (12 employees) which he basically cofounded. My boss and the others at the internship were all wonderful people. They basically paid me to use up their time and teach me stuff and I also got my thesis for my MS in statistics out of it.

The work they're doing is extremely niche, and they have just one competitor (a company of the same size). Unfortunately, I couldn't help but notice that their competitor seemed to have a more promising product. This made things a bit awkward sometimes, as they always think highly of their work while I was often sitting there thinking ""guys, this isn't gonna happen"".

Near end of the thesis, they asked via email: if we get more funding, would you be interested in a job? I said I was, but not with much enthusiasm since in a way I wasn't (I didn't really trust their product, and wanted to go somewhere new). A month later they said there was no funding for said job. I said no problem, so I got the job I have now instead, and haven't spoken to them or my friend since, that was ~1 year ago. Although I did message the internship boss for one last R question 6 months ago shortly before my thesis defense. He and I are friends on linkedin and we got along really well at work.

The other day a biostats job was posted at the competitor company. It would be a big salary jump compared to what I have now, I believe in their product, and it would be a big career advancement. I think they would absolutely hire me if they saw where I did my thesis and my work experience.

My friend's company would find out very quickly; these companies publish papers and criticize each other publicly. My name would be on those papers. I'm pretty certain they would regret taking me under their wing and payroll to give me a thesis project, and would assume I'm telling them all I know about their company. My career and salary would be boosted a lot, but I think I might feel shitty about it. Not to mention the awkwardness. Should I go for this job and remind myself that this is just the way the world works?

a7q9mq,19,2018-12-19,Building self-confidence,wompedywomp,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/a7q9mq/building_selfconfidence/,"For those residents who’ve struggled with self-confidence/self-esteem at any point in their lives, what strategies have helped you? I’ve unfortunately always had a tendency to doubt myself, and while I understand that some level of this is healthy as an intern (e.g. knowing what you don’t know and working on that), there are times when I feel it gets in my way. For example, I sometimes still struggle to sound sure of myself when conveying information to nurses or even to patients, which probably results in them taking me less seriously. I also find that while I’ve gotten to the point where I can think systematically through common cases (especially in my field), I struggle with thinking on my feet more than I feel some of my co-interns do. Moreover, being an introvert, I still find it intimidating to communicate with others....which I realize is ironic since medicine, no matter what field you’re in, is ALL about effective communication. It’s disappointing when things like being besties and joking around with the nurses, not sounding like an idiot in front of consultants, or avoiding compassion fatigue come way more easily to other than they do to me.

I’ve been seeing a therapist, and it’s been somewhat helpful, but I’d like to hear from others who’ve had similar experiences feeling like you don’t quite fit the personality mold of a doctor. What did you do to change?"
a7qbn2,8,2018-12-19,State Department Dress Code (Interns),LookAgainAtThatDot,foreignservice,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreignservice/comments/a7qbn2/state_department_dress_code_interns/,"Next week I'm starting a position as a Pathways Intern in Consular Affairs (Passports/Technical Support). I received onboarding paperwork, and I have also been reviewing the ""What Every Employee Should Know"" handbook. I'm most concerned about the dress code: 
 
""Employees who do not have special dress 
requirements should use common sense in 
determining what is appropriate for their 
particular situation at work. Employees should follow basic requirements for safety and comfort and be neat and businesslike in appearance. Dress should be suitable to the work setting (for example, casual wear, such as flip-flops and halter tops/bare midriffs, are not acceptable).""

I'm moving from working in a Central American NGO where dress code was nice jeans/slacks/sleeveless blouses, and before that I worked in Peace Corps and another NGO with similar dress codes. I reviewed one similar post here, spoke with previous interns and also googled ""businesslike"" and ""professional dress, D.C. interns"", but I thought I'd ask here: what is ""businesslike"" dress at the State Department? I own two second-hand women's suits and will be going shopping this weekend. I'm hoping to purchase appropriate clothing and would appreciate any advice. Once I start work I will observe what others are wearing in order to better build my wardrobe, but I'm hoping to get 1-2 pieces to help me start off right and fit in appropriately. 

Thanks in advance! 

**ETA: Thanks to everyone for your advice! I am very glad I waited until I arrived to the office before purchasing many clothing items. From my observations, this office is very casual (surprisingly so) as it relates to ""women's dress""; I have seen lots of Ugg boots and casual style pants/tops. I did show up in a full suit the first day, but relaxed my appearance after. 

Since I am naturally more formal than many of my peers (I showed up to Peace Corps staging in a full suit), I will continue to wear suit pants with a nice top; I think this is a good meeting point. I actually have my own private office, which I was not expecting, so I will leave a nice jacket and change of shoes there in case I have the opportunity to attend a higher level meeting at some point during this tour.

Thank you again for your tips and suggestions! :)"
a7qjsj,6,2018-12-19,Some Questions I have,Oblivious_Chili,campchamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/campchamp/comments/a7qjsj/some_questions_i_have/,"Soooo.... Wanted some peoples opinions on this.

Right now, I find myself stuck at a very difficult decision. As of the time of this post, I have been accepted into 2 of my top school choices. The first is Champlain College, the second is GMU (George Mason University). The obvious problem here is I really don't know which school I should go to. Both schools offer the major i'm interested in, Cyber Security. Both schools have different things going for them. GMU is much larger, and includes Greek life as well as being a 30 min train ride outside of DC. Obviously, this means summer internships could be pretty easy to get, not to mention interning in DC would be pretty bad ass in my opinion. GMU also offers like, 4 different dinning halls, as well as main brand chains like Dunkin Donuts and Panda Express. Problems with GMU are its a commuter school, which means the campus is dead on the weekends, because over half the college commutes (only like 20% live on campus). GMU also isn't rated as high a quality of education as the one at Champlain. Ive also read reports that because GMU is such a big school, it can be hard to get help from the professor if you need it. I'm from Boston, so plain tickets are also quite expensive. However, that said, as privileged as it makes me sound, money isn't an issue for me. My parents made some smart investing, and I should be able to afford college either way.

&amp;#x200B;

Champlain on the other hand, is a lot smaller. I know Champlain has a really good study abroad program, as well as a very strong internship network. I also enjoy the idea of Champlain's ""Upside down curriculum"" thing. I like how they start you on your major day 1. I guess I just have a few questions for you Champlain Students out there, 

1. How would you describe the night life at the college? Do people often go into Burlington (REALLY nice town btw) for entertainment? Do people hang out at bars and restaurants with their friends? Do people organize hangouts on campus? I'm not much of a party person, but hows the party seen? Do people hang out in the dorm building common areas to hang around and watch TV or a stream or something?
2. What do you think of the food? Having only one dinning hall seems like a bummer to me. Would you recommend just eating out? 
3. Hows the Campus on the weekends? I know, unlike GMU, Champlain isn't considered a commuter school, so does this mean the campus is less dead? Do people actually plan to do things together, like go into town? Basically, what do people do when they aren't working or studying?
4. Hows the social seen? Are people nice? Is it easy to find friends?
5. How would you describe the work? More specifically, is it difficult? How do the professors and classes work? Is every class like a large lecture hall? Or are there classes kinda like high school, where you could call the professor over if you needed help understanding something?
6. Are clubs a big thing?

And please, tell me which one you think I should go with, what would you do?

Thanks to those who took the time to read this long ass mess, and are taking the time to reply to me. It means more than you could imagine, and will help me shape my future!"
a7r60q,6,2018-12-19,What can I do to save more money?,avt2020,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/a7r60q/what_can_i_do_to_save_more_money/,"I feel as though since this is my senior year of college, I really need to hustle. I have an extra year after this spring semester due to persuing a different degree program.

I come from a small town and go to school near DC. I want to live around Northern VA/MD once I graduate. I have my eyes on an internship that leads to a full time job and I'm also doing an internship now (unpaid) that may lead to a job offer in NYC. 
I do side hustles for beer money and make about $30 or so every once in awhile.
I bought some groceries for my lunch for my retail job at my hometown ($9.26/hr @25 hours a week) during a school break with a discounted gift card.
I spend about $30 a week on gas just buy driving to work and back alone 5 days a week, which I can't help because not driving isn't an option here.

I do smore for gift cards for extra school supplies as well. I use coupons and Ibotta whenever I can.

I really want to save $700 this coming month. I have some shopping urges but I will control them because I have no room or need for anything that isn't supplies for my classes.

Any tips? 

I'm technically working 3 jobs this break, but my $250/month job will end in April.
I'll hopefully go to a higher paid job in the summer that is retail and make $12/hour. 
My goal is to save an extra $3K after this coming summer and have a total of $12K before I graduate from school.

What can I do to make that happen?"
a7ra4g,12,2018-12-19,Evaluation Mixed Bag,lilapense,TwoXADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/a7ra4g/evaluation_mixed_bag/,"Fair warning, this is a venting post, so it really doesn't have a neat conclusion or even a solid question at its core.

I got my evaluation results back today, and even though the psychologist is reasonable certain I have ADHD, he concluded that the primary issue is actual Bipolar Disorder which.... I know self diagnosis is a bad thing, but I am 100% certain that I am not Bipolar. I know there are lots of overlapping symptoms, and I know mood swings aren't the only basis for diagnosis, but my emotional range so narrow and generally unvarying, that I was genuinely concerned going into this evaluation that it was a sign I had some other previously unconsidered disorder that would obscure the ADHD.

Objectively, I can see what might have led to the diagnosis. Despite years of CBT, talk therapy and even seeing a psychiatrist for a while, I have no records from any of those providers (some I lost, others the provider moved before I thought to ask for records or contact information). All this psychologist had to work with was one evaluation interview and my scores from the CAT-A, MCMI-IV and PAI. Especially on the last two, I can see where red flags would come up, considering I have a long history of depression/anxiety and am generally an impulsive person. There are also issues with years of self esteem issues juxtaposed with all the CBT I've done forcing me to acknowledge that I'm actually a highly capable person. And yeah, especially when meds are possibly a consideration, I get that ruling out bipolar is important from a conservative diagnostic point of view. But what really gets to me is that when you take it off paper, I am at my most impulsive when my depression is at its absolute worst. I'm not overconfident, I'm just highly aware of the extent of my practical skills. But yeah, when you add that all up it could easily raise the bipolar red flags. 

The good news is that the ADHD evaluation is now there. It is nice to have that affirmation that, no, I'm not just imagining that it's harder for me to get basic life stuff done than it is for other people. But the psychologist was very explicit in his treatment recommendation that that is a provisional diagnosis, and that he recommends that the bipolar be treated first to see how that impact concentration and attention. Which, again, I understand on a rational level. And I was already planning to start going to a therapist again.

But it's just so incredibly frustrating because: 1) it took literally years of therapy to build my self confidence up enough that I could accept that I wasn't just lazy and ungrateful and that there might be something else going on 2) finding a place that could do an evaluation took months between moving and trying to find a place with openings that accepted my insurance 3) once I found a place, it took almost a month and a half for the authorization to come through, and then I was only barely able to get everything scheduled between juggling finals and my insurance changing in January. And now I've got probably months ahead of me of having a therapist or psychologist determine whether or not I actually have bipolar with that ADHD provisional diagnosis almost taunting me, all while hoping I can cling to dear life through my grad program and summer internships. 

As a final disclaimer, I know self-diagnosis/armchair psychology is bad. I'm going to try to go into this with as open a mind as possible. I've been down this road before with severe depression that was both masked by and causing an anxiety disorder, and that took almost 3 years to figure out. The reason it took me so long to go in for this evaluation is because those two sapping my will to live were masking concentration/attention issues. I do actually kind of worry that I answer too extremely on these evaluation/battery type tests because I've been in and out of therapy so much that I can be kind of brutally objective when evaluating my own behaviors, which probably makes things which in reality aren't really an issue in my life seem like a bigger issue than they are because I acknowledge that I struggle with them, versus the base population not even noticing that they might have issues. All that said, if I do actually have bipolar and treating it solves all my problems, I'll be thrilled. All I want is to be able to manage my day to day life without feeling like I'm trying to herd cats. Trying to look on the bright side, maybe once I start seeing a therapist or psychologist, they'll be able to pretty quickly determine that the Bipolar was a false positive due to some unconnected symptoms and redirect course to address the ADHD.

It's just so aggravating that I got almost all the way there just to get another roadblock in a diagnosis that's going on being 9 years in the making, and almost ruined my life during undergraduate, and to have this new roadblock sprung on me during finals/job app season.

Anyway, that's been my Wednesday. I know there are a lot of other people on here waiting on news of their own diagnoses. Try not to let my pessimism rub off on you, because none of this is a fast process. But I guess just a fair warning that your waiting game might not be over with a diagnosis."
a7raxo,2,2018-12-19,Interview help [1L],rogue__baboon,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/a7raxo/interview_help_1l/,"So I’ve been put in a real good spot and thanks to a referral from a friend who works for a prominent tech company in the bay I have an interview set up for their summer internship program with their in house counsel. As a guy what do I wear, my first thought is suit up and “look the part” of a lawyer, but the company is more millennial and relaxed (part of the mission statement is “fun”) and I don’t want to walk in and show that I don’t get the culture at all.

a7rxjn,36,2018-12-19,Career Advice- Is working for a startup after graduating a good idea for me?,zephyr134,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/a7rxjn/career_advice_is_working_for_a_startup_after/,"I am a senior set to graduate this May and I am currently weighing different job prospects. I recently received an offer from a very small (&lt;10 employees) West Coast (US) startup that is doing work I find very interesting and really believe in. I’m afraid doing so might be detrimental to my career however if things don’t go well and the company doesn’t exist in 5+ years. The position would primarily involve scale up of a novel process from bench scale to pilot scale to full production scale. 

My primary concern is that if I do go to work for this company and things don’t work out, as the company is still very young, I will have a hard time finding other jobs as attractive as the ones I could potentially land now. I am graduating from a top 10 chemE US school with a competitive GPA (&gt;3.9), an internship at a large pharmaceutical company, and extensive research experience (I had seriously considered pursuing a PhD). I could currently find a job (in oil and gas) making twice as much as I would make at the startup but I’m not sure I would enjoy the work as much. I’m afraid in the future once I have work experience with this startup it may be more difficult to land such a job.

Some other concerns I have include: 
-low salary in a high cost of living area
-not many experienced engineers to learn from (although the startup apparently has a lot of consultants they work closely with who are experts in their fields) 
-I’m not positive what I want to do long term but would like to potentially still be able to pursue an advanced degree (MBA or PhD) and I’m not sure this work experience would make me a competitive applicant 
-I’m more than willing to work 60 hour weeks at this point in my life but I’m not sure I’ll feel the same way in 10 years

Ultimately, I am strongly considering this position but I don’t want to make an emotional decision if it will hinder my career. I don’t really have any mentors/connections in industry so any advice would be extremely appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
a7rzbc,3,2018-12-19,19 m4F Where are all the MILFs?,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a7rzbc/19_m4f_where_are_all_the_milfs/,"Hello everyone! As my post's title suggests, I am crazy about MILFs and looking for any and all of them!

Maybe you’re a married woman, and have been for a while now. You no longer have that spark from the honeymoon phase, whether you’ve been married for ten years or twenty. You used to be very careful about keeping up appearances, going to the gym, shaving your body, and more. But now, things have quieted down on that front. 

Or maybe you have never been married. You like to enjoy yourself with as many men that you choose. Tying yourself down to one guy was never in your plan and that is perfectly fine with everyone ;)

Regardless of the type of life you lead, you have somehow found me. I’m young and handsome, and in many ways I am exactly the kind of young guy you've been looking for.  Not surprising, I'm instantly turned on by a sexy older woman like you. Maybe you see me at the gym and catch me sneaking glances at your ass. You think it sags a bit, and you know you have cellulite on your thighs, but I still keep on checking you out. Little do you know that I’m sneaking into your locker after you leave and smelling your used gym shorts, the smell of your sweat and natural odor combined with your hairy pussy giving me an instant hardon.

Or perhaps I’m an intern at your firm, and you realize that I keep on coming into your office to get different forms because you have to lean down to grab them from a drawer, giving me an eyeful of your cleavage. Your tits sag after three kids, but you realize that that turns me on.

Maybe your an average looking milf. That means cellulite, sagging tits, an ass that had dropped a little, a wildly hairy pussy, and more. Or maybe your a pornstar-type bimbo, hotter than anyone else in town!  I’m open to most kinks so I’ll just put my limits, which are death, scat, gore, and vomit. As to kinks, why don’t you include those in your message, and we can work out a story."
a7s19a,11,2018-12-19,[Article] Finding Purpose,conscioused,Purpose,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purpose/comments/a7s19a/article_finding_purpose/,"  

See original article at: [http://conscioused.org/wiki/purpose-what-should-i-do-with-my-life/](http://conscioused.org/wiki/purpose-what-should-i-do-with-my-life/) 

   
 

I went to one of those personal development ~~cults~~ seminars once, and I asked a barrage of questions: 

*What is the purpose of life? What should I do with my life?*  

“Shut the fuck up”, the seminar leader said

“You already know all the answers inside. You’re just asking me for permission to do what you already know is right. You’re looking for validation. Stop. You don’t need anyone’s permission. When you get an internal sense of what’s right, just go do it. Act, and then see what happens. Adjust your actions depending on the results that you get.

When you come across a problem, think for yourself how to solve it, trust in your own judgement. See the world with your own fresh pair of eyes and make your own conclusions from first hand experience. Don’t just listen to everything that other people tell you. Always question and think critically; other people are no smarter than you are. Listen to others, but think for yourself.”

   
 

**FOLLOW YOUR HEART**

The best advice I’ve ever gotten in my life is to follow my heart. I think of it like, there’s a guiding compass inside of me, that always knows which direction to go. An inner voice that knows what’s right. I just need to tune into it and trust it.

For example, right after university, I worked in investment banking and hated my life. I hated the lack of freedom, the repetitive tasks, the ass kissing. I knew I wanted to work on my own business. An online business that would let me travel and explore the world. But I didn’t trust myself. I’ve studied so hard to land this job. All my friends where in corporate. How could it possibly be the right move to leave when everyone else was happily working? Wasn’t I living the corporate dream? I kept looking to other people for career advice, when I already knew. It took me 6 months to find the courage. I decided to start my own business – it was the best decision of my life.

   
 

Elon Musk also follows his heart. He calls it: “thinking from first principles”. When asked how he came up with the ideas for Tesla, SpaceX and Paypal, Elon looked inside. He asked himself what are the biggest problems that humanity is currently facing? And thought about solutions to those problems. Meanwhile, most people are caught up with the crowd, trying to ride market trends. Let’s do cryptocurrency for dogs! 

   
 

**SOCIAL CONDITIONING**

There are all these people telling us how we should live our lives. Social conditioning is fucking with us everywhere. Work is telling us that climbing the corporate ladder means success in life. Fashion trends are defining what beautiful is. Our social group is making us conform and act in a socially acceptable way.

*Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who’ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables – slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised by  television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won’t. We’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.*  – *Fight Club*

Humans are tribal creatures; we’re wired to go with the crowd. But just because everyone else believes in something, it does not mean that it’s right. In the past, everyone believed that the earth was flat. We look back and think that’s ridiculous. Now imagine that you’re in the future looking back. Could it be that there are heaps of popular beliefs we hold today that our future selves would think are ridiculous?

   
 

We forget to listen to ourselves. Our default state is to listen to others. We spend our lives trying to live up to other people’s expectations. But most people have never sat down and really thought about what they want to do with their lives. And it’s important that we think about it because we only have one life. We only have a limited time on this planet. One day we will be dead.

   
 

*You’re time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.* *– Steve Jobs*

*The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are needed, that we have something better ahead to work for. Purpose is what creates true happiness.* *– Mark Zuckerberg*

**SOCIAL CONDITIONING VS FOLLOWING OUR HEARTS**

Do we listen to social conditioning? Or do we follow our hearts? The book “The Fountainhead” explores this question. The story goes like this:

Once upon a time there were two architects who went to university together – Peter and Howard. Peter was super social; he became the head of the architecture society. He networked his way into a really prestigious firm after he graduated. Worked incredibly hard, sucked up to all the right people and eventually became a director of the firm. Made tonnes of money and retired a rich man. Towards the end of his days, though, he looked back on all the buildings that he designed and thought to himself: “All these buildings are ugly, I don’t like a single one of them. Every building I designed was driven by what the client wanted, or what my firm wanted.” He felt like his vision of the perfect building was still trapped inside him, and that nothing he achieved in life meant anything.

   
 

Meanwhile the other architect, Howard, just didn’t give a fuck. He hated the Victorian design classes at university because it was unnecessarily ornate. Howard wanted to do minimalist post modern design. He ended up dropping out of university and going to intern with an architect who he had a lot of respect for. However, the architect wasn’t getting much business because his designs were so radical. Later on, Howard started his own firm. But he would only take on clients if the client gave him complete freedom to design the building however he wanted. His clients would have no say in the design at all. Howard didn’t have many clients and only built a few buildings in his career. However, he felt that every building that he built was a representation of his truest vision of art. The pylons of the building were like Howard’s bones, the windows and wooden finishings were his skin and flesh, each building was a temple to his soul.

   
 

Would you rather be Howard? Or would you rather be Peter?

How has social conditioning influenced how you live?

Write down 10 of your core beliefs.

Which of your beliefs did you consciously decide upon, and how many have been dictated by society?

Which of your beliefs are helping you and which beliefs are holding you?

Are you living the life you want to live, or the life society wants you to live?

How do YOU want to live your life?

   
 

**LOVE WHAT YOU DO**

*Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle*. *– Steve Jobs*

**WHY BIGGER GOALS ARE BETTER**

Most people set small goals in life. We don’t set ourselves big goals because we’ll fail. But big goals are actually **easier** to achieve than small goals. People are inspired by big goals and will go out of their way to help you. Investors will give you money. Big goals create movements and bring together teams. Small goals may be easier to accomplish, but not as many people will help you do it. Also there’s much less competition with big goals. How many of your friends are trying to cure cancer or solve cold fusion? How many friends work in accounting? Sure curing cancer is a million times harder than working in accounting, but there’s a million times more people that your competing against if you choose accounting.

   
 

When I started my coupon site 7 years ago, I just wanted to earn enough money to support myself and travel. This wasn’t going to become a big business, so I had trouble attracting investors. When I pitched at startup conferences, investors would be like, “cool story bro, needs more dragons.” I had no money, and my goal wasn’t very inspiring, so I had trouble hiring great people. I ended up spending 4 years figuring out marketing by myself and building the business to a level where it supports my lifestyle – yay, go me.

Meanwhile, Tim Kently-Klay managed to build Zoox into a 1.5 billion dollar business in the same time frame. Right… So wtf am I doing with my life? Here’s how Tim did it. One day Tim woke up and was like, “I want to build fully autonomous self driving cars”. No, not some half-arsed version like Tesla. Tim explains that by completely removing the steering wheel, driver’s seat and components needed for human driving, you can make a much more efficient self driving robot. A fully autonomous Uber – that was the dream. A slight problem was that Tim knew fuck all about self driving cars. But Tim was a hella smart guy who had started a successful graphics design company in the past, so he set about reading everything he could on self driving cars. After a year of intense study, he drew out some blueprints for his self driving car which he displayed at some conferences.

His plans were given the honorable title of “Vaporware Horseshit” by critics. However, Tim hustled on and met Niki the venture capitalist who gave him a million dollars.

   
 

Tim took that million dollars and went to the self driving car team at Apple. He said to them, “hey so you know… you guys are all screwed because Apple is shutting down their self driving car project.  So come join me and we shall conquer the world.” And the self-driving car team is like, sure, seems legit, why not? Then Tim went to Lord Draper, the greatest venture capitalist of them all, and was like, “Hey I am building a self driving car and have the best team in the world to do it, you should give me 30 million dollars.” Draper thought for a while and then he’s like, sure why not? Tim took that money and convinced more people to join his jihad. Then he goes and raises 250m at a $1.5bn valuation. Tim does all this in 4 years.

   
 

I set a small goal; build a coupon site. In 4 years I accomplished it. Tim set a big goal; make fully autonomous self driving cars. And in 4 years he has built a $1.5bn company.

What would you rather be doing?

If you could achieve anything, what would you be working on?

**WHAT ABOUT MONEY?**

When I was in college choosing my career, all I cared about was: how much money could I make? So I chose investment banking. And I quit after 6 months. But anyway. Most of my peer group chose their careers because of money. It wasn’t always like this. Back in the 60s, we had just landed on the moon. Einstein and Edison were the celebrities of the day. People wanted to be inventors, explorers and scientists – to work on things that would push forward the envelope of human progress. Nowadays people want money – financial security. What happened to changing the world? Most people are not working on meaningful problems. Millions are dying in Africa. Our best and brightest proceed to go work in finance or tech or whatever industry is the most cashed up.

   
 

*If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you’ll spend your life completely wasting your time. You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing thing you don’t like doing, which is stupid. – Alan Watts*

*Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to be at night saying we’ve done something wonderful that’s what matters to me. – Steve Jobs*

Here’s the thing: **solving the world’s biggest problems is the best way to make money.** This makes sense from an economics perspective. If you create the most value then the market will reward you with the most money. But wait, how the hell would working to solve poverty in Africa make more money than being an investment banker? Banking appears to be a steadier path to making more money – if we view things from a short term perspective. But what about in 10 years, 20 years and more?

*Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years* – *Bill Gates*

Let’s say you start a social enterprise in Africa. In your first year you make nothing and your banker friend makes $150k. In 10 years, your social enterprise does well enough for you to live comfortably. Meanwhile your friend is making $2m as a director. You wonder if you made the wrong choice. But in 20 years, Africa grows rapidly, income levels rise 20x to western levels. Business is booming because your customers can afford to pay you western prices. Everyone now wants to invest in Africa. Multinationals are in a bidding war to buy your company. The land that you brought for ten thousand dollars per hectare is now worth a one million dollars per hectare. You are now worth over $100m. Meanwhile the world realizes investment bankers are basically glorified real estate agents – annoying and unnecessary. Bankers and real estate agents get replaced by a super efficient AI marketplace and your friend is made redundant.

   
 

**BUT IT’S RISKY**

Sure, chasing big goals is risky. People say that 9 out of 10 new ventures fail. Well, what if you tried 30 times? It’ll take about 4 months to see if a venture will work out, so you can try 3 new ventures a year. If you work on it for 10 years, you’ve tried 30 different ventures and you’re basically guaranteed success.

   
 

How I got over risk of starting my own business was, I said to myself: even if I tried for the rest of my life and I died trying, would I be happy? Yes, because I enjoy the process of trying to change the world, building a business, and working on something I find meaningful. I can’t control if I will succeed or not. What matters is that I tried.

*It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.* – *Franklin D Roosevelt*

Imagine at the end of your life, you realized that you never gave your dream a try. You just let it slip past. How would you feel?

*When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, “If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me… and since then, for the past 33 years I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I’m about to do today.”*

*And whenever the answer has been, “no” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.*

*Because almost everything: all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure… these things just fall away in the face of death… leaving only what is truly important.*

*Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.* – *Steve Jobs*

**LIMITING BELIEFS**

People have all these limiting beliefs about why they can’t achieve their dreams. Like, I am not smart enough, I have a family to support, I am too old, I have a very needy cat.

   
 

*All these bullshit excuses. How do you know you can’t do something until you’ve tried? You don’t know. It’s much more useful to believe you can do anything, because then you’ll try. If you don’t try you fail by default.*

*Those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world usually do*

– *Steve Jobs*

People seriously underestimate how far willpower can take you. It doesn’t matter where you come from or what your circumstances are. Got a family to support? Keep your day job and work on your dreams at night. Not smart enough? Spend twice as long studying. Too old? KFC was built by a 70 year old. You are not a victim of your circumstances.

What are some things you want to achieve but feel like you can’t?

**YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU SET YOUR MIND TO MAN**

If there’s one story that demonstrates how far willpower will take you despite the hand you’ve been dealt, it’s that of Barrack Obama. No not the president, but his father Barrack Obama Sr.

   
 

Obama Sr grew up in one of the poorest families in the world in Sub-Saharan Africa, but his son went on to become the most powerful man in the world. How did this happen?

Obama Sr grew up in a Kenyan village. School was a little shanty hut where all the village children were packed into one class. Education sucked, but Obama Sr showed some spark. He had one thing going for him: he was able to learn English since grandfather Obama was a cook in a white household. One day, some aid workers came to visit their village. Teenage Obama Sr was like, “damn those aid workers looking fine, I think I’ll go chat them up.” The aid workers were impressed by Obama Sr’s drive and encouraged him to apply to the University of Hawaii’s African scholarship program. Barrack Sr studied intensely and with the tutorship of the aid workers managed to get the scholarship. At the University of Hawaii Obama Sr met Ann Dunham who would become Obama Jr’s mother. When he wasn’t chasing skirts, he managed to top his class and get a full scholarship into Harvard Law School. Willpower can get you from growing up in sub-Saharan Africa to going to Harvard Law School, to your son becoming the president of the United States.

   
 

Now you may be thinking Obama Sr is smarter and more driven than I’ll ever be. He has better genetics. Just because he has achieved greatness doesn’t mean that I can. But are successful people really smarter than us? So I was in Silicon Valley last year doing a program called 500startups where I got to meet tech billionaires and industry leaders. It was surprisingly underwhelming… The advice these billionaires gave was mostly self indulgent, generic and useless details. “so I cooked lunch for my team everyday, and everyone loved my cooking”. “Ohh marketing, we didn’t do any marketing, the product just grew by itself”. The best advice I got was actually from other startup founders who were still hustling to make it. Then it struck me. These billionaires are not better than the rest of us. They’ve just worked hard and on the right things. But they’re fallible humans. We are all cut from the same cloth. I can do whatever they can do.

   
 

Malcolm Gladwell writes about the 10,000 hour rule: how a master in any field has practiced for at least 10,000 hours. If we put in that amount of hours, we can master anything. Take Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian psychologist who, after studying hundreds of great intellectuals, identified a common theme – early and intensive practice. He hypothesized that with intense practice, he could turn his three daughters into prodigies. He chose chess as the perfect activity to train his children in, because it was creative and analytical and had objectively measurable results. Two of his daughters went on to become grand-masters. No women had ever achieved the title of grand-master before. All three daughters ranked in the top 6 in the world for chess.

   
 

Sure, we’re born with certain physical characteristics or elements of our personality that are hard to change. But the moment that we accept ourselves, take the wheel and start steering, that’s when things start happening. Take Lebron James vs Steph Curry. Lebron has the perfect genetic build for a basketball player. Steph doesn’t. He doesn’t have the height, he doesn’t have the bulk. But he doesn’t give a shit. He proceeds to practice the hell out of his shot. And with that, he has achieved a level of success to rival Lebron. You may not be able to change some part of yourself, but you can develop other parts and be just as effective.

   
 

Cool, so I believe I can do anything I set my mind to. But…

**HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE?**

*To discover your “why”, ask yourself these questions. Find the common denominators in the answers and you’ll have your first lead to explore in finding your why. The commonalities in your answers may point you towards your purpose, and give you some directions to explore.What do you think is biggest problem in the world right now?If money and time weren’t limiting factors, what would you allow yourself to dream of doing?What makes you feel angry, or rise up at the injustice you see?What gets your emotions going? what brings tears to your eyes?What makes you happy?*– *Daniel Flynn, founder Thankyou Water*

**READ**

Read. Do a shit tonne of reading, and then read some more. There are world leaders and billionaires who have spent years distilling the best of their life’s wisdom and principles of success into books. Books that we can access instantly for $10 on Amazon. It’s the digital age. We are the first generation to have the entire trove of human knowledge available on demand in our pockets.

Yet most of us don’t read. What the fuck? Instead we spend our time watching TV. What did Kim K name her kid? Did North Korea fire another rocket? What happens next on Game of Thrones? All this bullshit that we don’t need to know about. Our newest drug addiction is social media. It gives us a hit of validation, a new like, another viral video. But there’s no substance, no meaning. The short term hit leaves us shallow inside and longing for another, and another. Popular media is fucking up our brains. It’s the information age buffet. Because we’re fat fucks from the first world, we say, give me all the junk food, broccoli can fuck off. We need to treat the information we consume like food and watch we’re putting into our bodies. 

**LISTEN TO AUDIO-BOOKS**

The best life hack that anyone has ever told me is to listen to audio-books at 2x speed. You can listen to audio-books whilst you’re at the gym, or driving, or any other mindless task. This way, it’s easy to find 2-3 hours everyday, and if you do, you can finish 2 books every week, and 100 books a year. 100 books will put you miles ahead. Most people don’t even finish 100 books in their lifetime. I started audio-books 3 years ago, and I’ve learnt more in 3 years than I have in the rest of my life combined. School didn’t teach me useful skills, books did. Books written by people who have done it before. You can get most popular titles on Amazon’s Audible book store. Make sure you select the USA Audible store as this has the widest selection.

**FIND MENTORS**

After reading and researching what I wanted to do. I got in touch with people who’ve done it before. No matter what you’re trying to achieve, there are 7 billion people in the world and there are people out there who have done similar things to what you’re attempting to do. Find these people on Linkedin and ask for their mentorship. Ask people who are not your direct competitors, people in a different geography or who have moved onto something else. You’d be surprised at how many people respond. I got around a 30% response rate. Here’s an email that I sent.

Hi John,

I am Rob, an Australian tech entrepreneur [linkedin.com/in/robliu](http://linkedin.com/in/robliu). We’re building [contactout.com](http://contactout.com/) a recruitment tool similar to Connectifier but targeting the Australian and UK markets.

I would greatly appreciate your mentorship and advice on growth and how to do sales for recruitment tools, and any insights you’ve gained from your experience at Connectifier.

Would you be free for a brief chat on Skype? Happy to send you $500 for your time.

Kind Regards, Rob Liu

John was previously VP Marketing at Connectifier, a competitor whose business model I was trying to copy. John came on board as an adviser and helped me add over one million dollars in value to my business. It all started with an email.

When emailing, bribe people. Offer them $500 to talk to you. This makes it look like you’re serious about your request and respectful of their time. Most mentors are rich already and won’t accept your money. For people who do accept your money, don’t bother talking with them. Because if they need $500, then they’re probably not very successful, and would make a shitty mentor.

   
 

After reading, researching, finding mentors, you’ll still have to figure out a lot of the journey by yourself. You’re aiming to do something great and that involves blazing a path into the unknown. It’s like playing soccer. You can read all about soccer tactics, you can practice dribbling, practice kicking. But if you want to get good at soccer, you need to get out onto the field and play the game. Think for yourself, follow your heart, and take action.

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path; and that will make all the difference. – *Steve Jobs*

**YOU ARE ON THIS EARTH FOR A REASON.**

*We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?*

*– Steve Jobs*

   
 

*“Are you a born writer? Were you put on earth to be a painter, a scientist, an apostle of peace? In the end the question can only be answered by action.*

*Do it or don’t do it.*

*It may help to think of it this way. If you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don’t do it, you not only hurt yourself, even destroy yourself,. You hurt your children. You hurt me. You hurt the planet.*

*You shame the angels who watch over you and you spite the Almighty, who created you and only you with your unique gifts, for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter farther along its path back to God.*

*Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It’s a gift to the world and every being in it. Don’t cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you’ve got.”*

a7shik,10,2018-12-19,Listening to my best friend depresses me (long post),anotherthrowaway5858,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/a7shik/listening_to_my_best_friend_depresses_me_long_post/,"So I guess to get some context I should explain how we even became friends.

It started in our first year of college. Back then she was kinda just someone I knew from my circle of friends, we didn't really talk too much. I met her and then her bf from some other friends I made and we got along, but I guess I didn't really pay too much attention to her.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until our fourth year that we started a DnD group between our friends that I started talking more and more with her. It started off just about DnD, but then we branched off and talked about our hobbies and then ourselves and our friendship kept growing until she became one of my most trusted friends. I've told her things about myself that I haven't told anyone else and I knew at this point that she was my best friend and I could tell her anything.

&amp;#x200B;

We went to several DnD sessions together (with her bf and other friends) and we have some very casual, but very fun times. After a few nights though, I started to really admire how into the game, and how fun and energetic she was. I felt really awful, because I was falling for her really hard, but she was in a happy relationship with her bf of 4 years and I didn't want to make things awkward between us so I didn't say anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually though, things got a little weird because she kept telling me how she felt guilty talking to me and how she was having trouble with her bf because sometimes she preferred talking to me instead of spending time with him. She was still in a relationship though, so I tried to shrug off any thoughts that she might like me back until one day I just asked her straight-up. She responded ""no"" and didn't talk to me until later that night where she confessed that she did have feelings for me and it made her feel awful. It made me feel really bad too so we both agreed to just not talk about it and stay friends. Things got more complicated though.

&amp;#x200B;

To keep things short, she talked to her mom about her current relationship and how she was feeling, how she didn't want to move away with her bf to NY (where he was gonna work after graduating) and just forget about what she wanted to do. Her mom told her that she wouldn't want to tell her what to do, but if she was anyone other than her daughter, that she'd tell her to break up with him, and well, she did. 

In the back of my head, I knew it was shitty of me, but I was a little...happy, because maybe I had a chance with her now. We talked every single day for months now. Every day after she got out of her internship, she would call me and we'd talk until she drove back home. Still, she told me she wanted to try one more time with her ""ex"" before giving up on him for good. The summer ended, next semester started and me and her got really close. We'd hang out frequently together and get along really great. I thought about finally making a move on her, but she went out with her ""ex"" over a weekend and suddenly things got ""fixed"" and they were back together. It hurt. It seems like everything kinda just crashed, but I knew she still wanted to give him a chance, so I got over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We continued just being friends. Then the hurricanes happened (we live in PR) and now I couldn't communicate with her at all since she lives pretty far away from me. It was over a month of agony. I missed her every day and I wished constantly for things to get fixed. We finally got enough signal to text and I did every chance I got. She missed me a lot too, almost seemed like she forgot about her bf for a bit, didn't even bother mentioning him to me.

&amp;#x200B;

When things got reestablished and our classes started again, we did the same thing as before: we hung out a ton, spent every day talking to each other, etc.

Unfortunately her relationship with her bf wasn't doing so great. They ""officially"" broke up and now me and her were spending more and more time together. We'd flirt frequently and we even held hands on a movie night with our other friends (without them knowing). It looked like things were starting to look up for me. She didn't quite want to ""go out"" with me just yet or make anything public because she didn't want to hurt her bf who was a part of our circle of friends  and she was also still getting used to things without him. Thinking back it was a red flag, but I was too ""in love"" to worry about it, I had to take my chances. Fast forward a bit, one day we decided to hang out just us for once. It wasn't really a date, but us enjoying a movie together without other friends for once. 

That day I decided to try to kiss her after the movie ended, but she stopped me. I was pretty disappointed, but well, I can't force her into this. I left her place to go home. The next day she didn't even talk to me. She told me she had to think about things and sort herself out. The day after that, she told me she didn't know how to tell me, but that she just didn't have feelings for me anymore, that she still had feelings for her ""ex"" and we had to stop. I was pretty crushed. It was the first time I ever cried over a girl; I didn't do anything that day except just lie in my bed and stare at the ceiling. She felt awful and texted me every day to make sure I was okay, but I barely responded.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later I found out she was already going out with her bf again. Another week passed by and she asked me how I was and that she kinda still had a crush on me, but didn't know how she even really felt about things. At that time I had asked another girl out and already set-up a date, maybe to spite her. I was pretty happy because it was really stress-free. I just asked her out, set a date, and it was done. Unfortunately things didn't really ""spark"" with her. I think I just didn't give her enough of a chance since I was still getting over things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I found out that she had a bit of a bumpy road with her bf. They kept ""breaking up"" and getting back together several times. On the last occasion she called me, crying, at 1am. She asked me how to block a number on her phone and to just talk to her. She was sad because she found out her bf had slept with 2 different girls while they were ""broken up"" and it crushed her. 

I tried to make her feel better and help her, but I didn't see this as an opportunity. I knew she'd fall right back. She's told me that she's just really attached to him since he was her ""first time"". 

And she did end up falling back to him. She told me she was gonna give him one last shot and so far, months later, it's been working. They've had a happy relationship and she's going to move with him to NY soon enough. It took me a while, but I did end up forgiving her. It hurt a lot to lose my crush, but I didn't want to lose my best friend too. We still talk often and I do enjoy it. She's had some troubles with her career, but found a job recently and is saving up money to move and things keep getting better for her.

&amp;#x200B;

Me though? I've struggled a lot romantically. Nothing sticks. Dating apps always end with ghosting. Last girls I dated either nothing sparked or I got used for one night and that's it (she had a boyfriend waiting for her in the states, didn't tell me she had anything until after she made out with me and blew me, of course). My grades have dropped, I've felt incredibly unmotivated for the last few semesters and I don't know where my life is headed or how to fix things. My parents still think I'm graduating soon, but I got at least another year and I feel like I'm squandering opportunities that some one else with more drive could have had (the government has payed most of my tuition, I have my own car, not struggling financially; not rich, but not poor either). 

&amp;#x200B;

The point of the title though: I still talk to my best friend very frequently, and I'm happy for her, but every time she brings up how well her bf is doing, how she can't wait to move-in with him, how happy he makes her, how she wants to marry him, etc. I can't help, but feel so sad and lonely and feel like such a failure or how close I was to having a happy relationship, but everything just came crashing down on me. And now my friend, who became my best friend because I trusted her so much and could tell her anything, I always feel like I can't tell her how I truly feel, because I don't want to make her feel bad, but every time she cheerfully tells me how well things are going with ""him"" I just feel like trash and I don't know what to do anymore.

a7sxnq,10,2018-12-19,Assurance: Freedom From Guilt and Shame,HaMotMot,Reformed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/a7sxnq/assurance_freedom_from_guilt_and_shame/,"Guilt. Shame. It just won’t let go. It drives us away from God. 

I studied to be a minister. Got my MDiv from a reformed seminary. Did a pastoral internship. Got licensed.

Waited for a call. Tried to promote myself without promoting myself. Call never came. 

Has God rejected me? I must not be good enough. I’m too sinful for the pulpit. That must be it. 

All that time and money. Wife working to pay the bills. What a horrible man I am!

I ran from the God who rejected me. I couldn’t face him. He clearly had judged me unworthy for some reason. Weak faith?

Booze. A lot of booze. No prayer. No Bible reading. Couldn’t face it. Just couldn’t. Too painful. Does God even love me? How could my wife love me? My kids? I’m a LOSER. Not enough faith. Not enough piety. Not enough righteousness. 

Why do we so easily interpret the circumstances of our lives this way and run FROM God? We run to anything that offers a reprieve from our guilt. 

When we realize our situation, we think we need more faith. I gotta try harder to have more faith. You know, like the other people at church who love God. Do I love God? I’m afraid of his judgment - is that enough?

Am I really saved? Could a Christian have such weak faith? Could a Christian run from God?

Faith doesn’t require effort. You can’t believe something by an act of your will, no matter how hard you try. Could you will yourself to believe in unicorns? No. You know they don’t exist. Just as I knew God had rejected me. 

Faith requires evidence. If a unicorn stood before you, you’d believe in them. I need evidence to believe God hasn’t rejected me.

But I look at myself for fruit and see none. I look at myself and feel guilt and shame. Where’s the joy? Where’s the fruit of the Spirit? No wonder God has rejected me. I’m a loser. God, take my life! I don’t have the courage to do it myself. 

All of this is the wrong question. 

Here’s what I have learned through much pain and sorrow. 

Stop looking for evidence that you are a true Christian. Stop asking whether you’re worthy or good enough. 

Here’s the right question: Does God love me? Does God love you?

Yes. He does. Why did God send Jesus to die for us? Is he withholding our salvation and asking us to earn it? If so, what did Christ die for, exactly?

If we have to earn it, Christ died for nothing. Nothing. 

Christ crucified. There is the overwhelming, undeniable, and certain PROOF. Of what? Not that I am a good person, but that I am NOT, and yet God loves me anyway. 

We all, every single human being, every one of us has a right to claim this. For God so loved the good people that he gave his Son? No. For God so loved THE WORLD. You included. 

Every human being is entitled to lay claim to Christ. Every single human being has an inalienable RIGHT to look to the cross and conclude: “God loves me.”

You can too. Claim it. It is your birthright as a human being. God loves you unconditionally. You can’t earn it. You can’t make it untrue. Conditional love is not love. Maybe your parents didn’t love you, but God DOES and always will. No matter what you do. 

David got his buddy’s wife pregnant and then killed him. God still loved him. Unconditional love. It’s yours.

The evidence of your salvation is not in you. It is at the cross where the love of God was PROVEN beyond any doubt. Not for them, for you. Not the pious, for you. Not those who are faithful, but for YOU. 

And when things don’t seem to go your way, and it seems God is being unkind to you, consider whether you might have a limited perspective (you do).

I felt for years that God had rejected me from the ministry, like the church needed to be protected from me and the damage I would have caused. Am I so awful God?

But what if God was protecting me? What if the ministry would have ruined ME? All I could see was that I lost my career and had no way to provide for my family. Limited perspective. He was protecting me. Would have destroyed me. I see that now, many years later. 

God loves you. No matter what. No matter what. 

Say it. “God loves me.” I know, it’s silly. But it’s true, and saying it will mean something to you. Christ died for you. Just say it, “God loves me!” Claim your birthright! Claim the love of God! Own it!

GOD LOVES ME!

Therefore, he DID save you, no matter the cost. If he loves you, he saved you. There is your irrefutable, absolutely certain assurance of salvation. Stop looking down and look up to the cross. That’s where your answer is. 

And here’s a cheesy 80s Christian metal song to prove it’s true.

Cool, then you've pretty much got at least 90% of what this RP is centered around!

So basically, as you can probably garner from a lot of my post history, I'm a half-Asian girl who enjoys some light race-play here and there - basically just playing around with the stereotype of Asian girls as ditzy, shy, and submissive - and really likes guys with a bit of extra chunk to them! So, rather than writing out an actual prompt, I figured I'd just cast a line based exactly on what I'm looking for and see who bites! In this case, a super duper hot Asian college girl partnered with the sort of guy you wouldn't imagine fucking a super duper hot Asian college girl.

The ideas are pretty loose and could take place over any number of scenarios: maybe my character is a sort of ""ugly duckling"" who meets your character who never quite grew out of his schlubbier appearance but remembers him being super nice to her when they were younger, maybe she's part of a study group that quickly devolves in the study rooms of a library, maybe she's an office intern and some of the other workers or her older manager take a more physical interest in her, maybe she's part of a friend group and pretends not to notice when they all stare at her butt, hell, maybe she just thought the chubby guy in class was cute and said yes when he asked her to a date! Feel free to use any of these ideas or suggest your own.

Any number of possibilities abound, here, the only constant is that our young Asian protagonist is hot while her cohorts remain not so much. If you would be interested in including group play then I would love it, but I know it's not for everyone so it's not a requirement! For this prompt I'm not interested in playing more than one character, however. Also, things can be incredibly consensual or more coercive and dub-con-ish (mostly I'd like the idea of my character just being embarrassed more than unwilling), but I'd stay away from flat-out non-con, tonight!

As for kinks, if you would be willing to play a bit unrealistically and cum rather quickly and rather often in-character then I'd be very thankful! After all, what sort of Asian girl would I be if I wasn't willing to take a bukkake? No bathroom stuff or pregnancy/impregnation though, please.

Message me if you're interested!

a7uc9i,108,2018-12-19,[The Office] Micheal's Personality; Explained,MAX613,FanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/a7uc9i/the_office_micheals_personality_explained/,"On March 15th, 1964, Micheal Gary Scott was born. He always knew his mother, and may or may not have known his birthfather. If you have watched the office you will know Micheal has a wacky, unprofessional personality, and a constant need to be liked. He also is desperate for a girlfriend, wife, or kids. This is my theory about the reasons for his personality:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Micheal was Abused.

* The first evidence of this is in Season 3, Episode 15, ""Phyllis' Wedding"".  In this episode we see that Micheal was the ring-bearer at his Mother and Stepfather's (Jeff) wedding. This seems pretty normal at first, but then Micheal gets close to Jeff and screams ""I hate you!"" and pees his pants. Now what kind of situation does Micheal have to be in for him to pee his pants at the sight of his stepfather, and if Jeff and his Mother knew he hated Jeff, why would they make him ring-bearer? After seeing him in emotional distress his parents (one step) decide to ignore him and replace him with a dog.
* Another piece of evidence Micheal was abused comes to light is Season 7, Episode 1 ""Nepotism"". Micheal hires an Intern who turns out to be his nephew, Luke. It's safe to say Luke is a bad intern; he messes up coffee orders, buys the wrong ice cream, and even fails to send out shipping orders. When he points a laser pointer at everyone in the Office, Micheal is encouraged to discipline him. Instead of yelling, or threatening his job, Micheal decides to spank him. He immediately chooses physical discipline, where did he learn that?
* Throughout the show we see Micheals constant referral to the office as his family, even though they are mostly cold and rude to him. The only person he actually dislikes is Toby. As [u/Athena\_Nikephoros](https://www.reddit.com/user/Athena_Nikephoros) explains, ""Michael hates Toby because he reminds Michael of his own father"". If the Office is cold and even mean to Micheal, and he thinks of them as family, then his own family might be cold and mean to him. In Season 6, Episode 8, ""Double Date"" Micheal lets Pam hit him in the face to make up for him dating, and dumping her Mother (on her Birthday). Why would Micheal let someone hit him? Even if he dated their mother, is he not allowed to do that? It seems a bit like overcompensating. I think that Micheal realized he was Pam's ""Jeff"" and was a stepfather figure. I think that when he realized this, he associated Jeff with hitting and said, ""Do you want to hit me"". After Pam does hit Micheal, he says he had his life flash before his eyes (the future) and that, ""And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together"". After Pam hits Micheal he starts thinking about kids. It might be a stretch but there is a lot of stretches.

2.  Micheal has a Developmental Disorder

* My first reason is that he cannot function on his own. Throughout the show we see Micheal constantly call his mother. Now, maybe he has a strong connection to her, or he simply can't take care of himself. In Season 3, Episode 23, ""The Job"", he interviews for a corporate job in New York. Before even interviewing he sells his condo. Not only does he sell his condo while in debt, he sells it for 80% of what he paid for it. In Season 4, Episode 4, ""Money"", Micheal realizes his debt. He doesn't know what to do with himself so he hops on a train. If it wasn't for another person (Jan) counseling him, he would be a train hobo and probably die.
* My second reason is that Micheal has a need to be liked. In Season 4, Episode 1, ""Fun Run"", Micheal says, ""Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised"". I think that this stems from childhood neglect. Micheal doesn't know who is part of his family, or who is his friend, because his Mother and (step)Father neglected him. He doesn't know that people who are mean/ignore him are close friends/relatives.
* Micheal peed his pants at Jeff and his Mothers wedding. Most children don't pee their pants at a wedding. If Micheal was abused, and had a developmental disorder, then it would make sense for him to pee his pants at times of emotional distress.

I have read a lot that its hard to make friends and most people are superficial, spoiled kids or those who are annoying political or fake trendy. I am a politics nerd (which is why I wanted to go there) but honestly i'm pretty moderate and not really up for constant bipartisanship and i'm not really into being competitive for internships etc. I prefer to just have down-to-earth intellectual conversations but am also a kid that likes to casually drink and partake in parties. furthermore, I'm not really into the whole frat/sorotity scene. I'm worried that I am going to be miserable for the next few years because i'm gonna be surrounded by people who I don't mess with so much so I am considering trying to get out of my ed agreement because I think the social stress would be too much and going to one of the other schools I ea-ed to. could anyone who goes there tell me if this is true or not and console me lol? and if you go there can you tell me if Thurston is good for meeting new people who are chill or if you have any advice for transitioning?

a7ujch,8,2018-12-19,[Advice] Finding Purpose,conscioused,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/a7ujch/advice_finding_purpose/,"  

I went to one of those personal development ~~cults~~ seminars once, and I asked a barrage of questions: 

*What is the purpose of life? What should I do with my life?*  

“Shut the fuck up”, the seminar leader said

“You already know all the answers inside. You’re just asking me for permission to do what you already know is right. You’re looking for validation. Stop. You don’t need anyone’s permission. When you get an internal sense of what’s right, just go do it. Act, and then see what happens. Adjust your actions depending on the results that you get.

When you come across a problem, think for yourself how to solve it, trust in your own judgement. See the world with your own fresh pair of eyes and make your own conclusions from first hand experience. Don’t just listen to everything that other people tell you. Always question and think critically; other people are no smarter than you are. Listen to others, but think for yourself.”

   
 

**FOLLOW YOUR HEART**

The best advice I’ve ever gotten in my life is to follow my heart. I think of it like, there’s a guiding compass inside of me, that always knows which direction to go. An inner voice that knows what’s right. I just need to tune into it and trust it.

For example, right after university, I worked in investment banking and hated my life. I hated the lack of freedom, the repetitive tasks, the ass kissing. I knew I wanted to work on my own business. An online business that would let me travel and explore the world. But I didn’t trust myself. I’ve studied so hard to land this job. All my friends where in corporate. How could it possibly be the right move to leave when everyone else was happily working? Wasn’t I living the corporate dream? I kept looking to other people for career advice, when I already knew. It took me 6 months to find the courage. I decided to start my own business – it was the best decision of my life.

   
 

Elon Musk also follows his heart. He calls it: “thinking from first principles”. When asked how he came up with the ideas for Tesla, SpaceX and Paypal, Elon looked inside. He asked himself what are the biggest problems that humanity is currently facing? And thought about solutions to those problems. Meanwhile, most people are caught up with the crowd, trying to ride market trends. Let’s do cryptocurrency for dogs! 

   
 

**SOCIAL CONDITIONING**

There are all these people telling us how we should live our lives. Social conditioning is fucking with us everywhere. Work is telling us that climbing the corporate ladder means success in life. Fashion trends are defining what beautiful is. Our social group is making us conform and act in a socially acceptable way.

*Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who’ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables – slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised by  television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won’t. We’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.*  – *Fight Club*

Humans are tribal creatures; we’re wired to go with the crowd. But just because everyone else believes in something, it does not mean that it’s right. In the past, everyone believed that the earth was flat. We look back and think that’s ridiculous. Now imagine that you’re in the future looking back. Could it be that there are heaps of popular beliefs we hold today that our future selves would think are ridiculous?

   
 

We forget to listen to ourselves. Our default state is to listen to others. We spend our lives trying to live up to other people’s expectations. But most people have never sat down and really thought about what they want to do with their lives. And it’s important that we think about it because we only have one life. We only have a limited time on this planet. One day we will be dead.

   
 

*You’re time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.* *– Steve Jobs*

*The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are needed, that we have something better ahead to work for. Purpose is what creates true happiness.* *– Mark Zuckerberg*

**SOCIAL CONDITIONING VS FOLLOWING OUR HEARTS**

Do we listen to social conditioning? Or do we follow our hearts? The book “The Fountainhead” explores this question. The story goes like this:

Once upon a time there were two architects who went to university together – Peter and Howard. Peter was super social; he became the head of the architecture society. He networked his way into a really prestigious firm after he graduated. Worked incredibly hard, sucked up to all the right people and eventually became a director of the firm. Made tonnes of money and retired a rich man. Towards the end of his days, though, he looked back on all the buildings that he designed and thought to himself: “All these buildings are ugly, I don’t like a single one of them. Every building I designed was driven by what the client wanted, or what my firm wanted.” He felt like his vision of the perfect building was still trapped inside him, and that nothing he achieved in life meant anything.

   
 

Meanwhile the other architect, Howard, just didn’t give a fuck. He hated the Victorian design classes at university because it was unnecessarily ornate. Howard wanted to do minimalist post modern design. He ended up dropping out of university and going to intern with an architect who he had a lot of respect for. However, the architect wasn’t getting much business because his designs were so radical. Later on, Howard started his own firm. But he would only take on clients if the client gave him complete freedom to design the building however he wanted. His clients would have no say in the design at all. Howard didn’t have many clients and only built a few buildings in his career. However, he felt that every building that he built was a representation of his truest vision of art. The pylons of the building were like Howard’s bones, the windows and wooden finishings were his skin and flesh, each building was a temple to his soul.

   
 

Would you rather be Howard? Or would you rather be Peter?

How has social conditioning influenced how you live?

Write down 10 of your core beliefs.

Which of your beliefs did you consciously decide upon, and how many have been dictated by society?

Which of your beliefs are helping you and which beliefs are holding you?

Are you living the life you want to live, or the life society wants you to live?

How do YOU want to live your life?

   
 

**LOVE WHAT YOU DO**

*Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle*. *– Steve Jobs*

**WHY BIGGER GOALS ARE BETTER**

Most people set small goals in life. We don’t set ourselves big goals because we’ll fail. But big goals are actually **easier** to achieve than small goals. People are inspired by big goals and will go out of their way to help you. Investors will give you money. Big goals create movements and bring together teams. Small goals may be easier to accomplish, but not as many people will help you do it. Also there’s much less competition with big goals. How many of your friends are trying to cure cancer or solve cold fusion? How many friends work in accounting? Sure curing cancer is a million times harder than working in accounting, but there’s a million times more people that your competing against if you choose accounting.

   
 

When I started my coupon site 7 years ago, I just wanted to earn enough money to support myself and travel. This wasn’t going to become a big business, so I had trouble attracting investors. When I pitched at startup conferences, investors would be like, “cool story bro, needs more dragons.” I had no money, and my goal wasn’t very inspiring, so I had trouble hiring great people. I ended up spending 4 years figuring out marketing by myself and building the business to a level where it supports my lifestyle – yay, go me.

Meanwhile, Tim Kently-Klay managed to build Zoox into a 1.5 billion dollar business in the same time frame. Right… So wtf am I doing with my life? Here’s how Tim did it. One day Tim woke up and was like, “I want to build fully autonomous self driving cars”. No, not some half-arsed version like Tesla. Tim explains that by completely removing the steering wheel, driver’s seat and components needed for human driving, you can make a much more efficient self driving robot. A fully autonomous Uber – that was the dream. A slight problem was that Tim knew fuck all about self driving cars. But Tim was a hella smart guy who had started a successful graphics design company in the past, so he set about reading everything he could on self driving cars. After a year of intense study, he drew out some blueprints for his self driving car which he displayed at some conferences.

His plans were given the honorable title of “Vaporware Horseshit” by critics. However, Tim hustled on and met Niki the venture capitalist who gave him a million dollars.

   
 

Tim took that million dollars and went to the self driving car team at Apple. He said to them, “hey so you know… you guys are all screwed because Apple is shutting down their self driving car project.  So come join me and we shall conquer the world.” And the self-driving car team is like, sure, seems legit, why not? Then Tim went to Lord Draper, the greatest venture capitalist of them all, and was like, “Hey I am building a self driving car and have the best team in the world to do it, you should give me 30 million dollars.” Draper thought for a while and then he’s like, sure why not? Tim took that money and convinced more people to join his jihad. Then he goes and raises 250m at a $1.5bn valuation. Tim does all this in 4 years.

   
 

I set a small goal; build a coupon site. In 4 years I accomplished it. Tim set a big goal; make fully autonomous self driving cars. And in 4 years he has built a $1.5bn company.

What would you rather be doing?

If you could achieve anything, what would you be working on?

**WHAT ABOUT MONEY?**

When I was in college choosing my career, all I cared about was: how much money could I make? So I chose investment banking. And I quit after 6 months. But anyway. Most of my peer group chose their careers because of money. It wasn’t always like this. Back in the 60s, we had just landed on the moon. Einstein and Edison were the celebrities of the day. People wanted to be inventors, explorers and scientists – to work on things that would push forward the envelope of human progress. Nowadays people want money – financial security. What happened to changing the world? Most people are not working on meaningful problems. Millions are dying in Africa. Our best and brightest proceed to go work in finance or tech or whatever industry is the most cashed up.

   
 

*If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you’ll spend your life completely wasting your time. You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing thing you don’t like doing, which is stupid. – Alan Watts*

*Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to be at night saying we’ve done something wonderful that’s what matters to me. – Steve Jobs*

Here’s the thing: **solving the world’s biggest problems is the best way to make money.** This makes sense from an economics perspective. If you create the most value then the market will reward you with the most money. But wait, how the hell would working to solve poverty in Africa make more money than being an investment banker? Banking appears to be a steadier path to making more money – if we view things from a short term perspective. But what about in 10 years, 20 years and more?

*Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years* – *Bill Gates*

Let’s say you start a social enterprise in Africa. In your first year you make nothing and your banker friend makes $150k. In 10 years, your social enterprise does well enough for you to live comfortably. Meanwhile your friend is making $2m as a director. You wonder if you made the wrong choice. But in 20 years, Africa grows rapidly, income levels rise 20x to western levels. Business is booming because your customers can afford to pay you western prices. Everyone now wants to invest in Africa. Multinationals are in a bidding war to buy your company. The land that you brought for ten thousand dollars per hectare is now worth a one million dollars per hectare. You are now worth over $100m. Meanwhile the world realizes investment bankers are basically glorified real estate agents – annoying and unnecessary. Bankers and real estate agents get replaced by a super efficient AI marketplace and your friend is made redundant.

   
 

**BUT IT’S RISKY**

Sure, chasing big goals is risky. People say that 9 out of 10 new ventures fail. Well, what if you tried 30 times? It’ll take about 4 months to see if a venture will work out, so you can try 3 new ventures a year. If you work on it for 10 years, you’ve tried 30 different ventures and you’re basically guaranteed success.

   
 

How I got over risk of starting my own business was, I said to myself: even if I tried for the rest of my life and I died trying, would I be happy? Yes, because I enjoy the process of trying to change the world, building a business, and working on something I find meaningful. I can’t control if I will succeed or not. What matters is that I tried.

*It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.* – *Franklin D Roosevelt*

Imagine at the end of your life, you realized that you never gave your dream a try. You just let it slip past. How would you feel?

*When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, “If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me… and since then, for the past 33 years I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I’m about to do today.”*

*And whenever the answer has been, “no” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.*

*Because almost everything: all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure… these things just fall away in the face of death… leaving only what is truly important.*

*Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.* – *Steve Jobs*

**LIMITING BELIEFS**

People have all these limiting beliefs about why they can’t achieve their dreams. Like, I am not smart enough, I have a family to support, I am too old, I have a very needy cat.

   
 

*All these bullshit excuses. How do you know you can’t do something until you’ve tried? You don’t know. It’s much more useful to believe you can do anything, because then you’ll try. If you don’t try you fail by default.*

*Those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world usually do*

– *Steve Jobs*

People seriously underestimate how far willpower can take you. It doesn’t matter where you come from or what your circumstances are. Got a family to support? Keep your day job and work on your dreams at night. Not smart enough? Spend twice as long studying. Too old? KFC was built by a 70 year old. You are not a victim of your circumstances.

What are some things you want to achieve but feel like you can’t?

**YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU SET YOUR MIND TO MAN**

If there’s one story that demonstrates how far willpower will take you despite the hand you’ve been dealt, it’s that of Barrack Obama. No not the president, but his father Barrack Obama Sr.

   
 

Obama Sr grew up in one of the poorest families in the world in Sub-Saharan Africa, but his son went on to become the most powerful man in the world. How did this happen?

Obama Sr grew up in a Kenyan village. School was a little shanty hut where all the village children were packed into one class. Education sucked, but Obama Sr showed some spark. He had one thing going for him: he was able to learn English since grandfather Obama was a cook in a white household. One day, some aid workers came to visit their village. Teenage Obama Sr was like, “damn those aid workers looking fine, I think I’ll go chat them up.” The aid workers were impressed by Obama Sr’s drive and encouraged him to apply to the University of Hawaii’s African scholarship program. Barrack Sr studied intensely and with the tutorship of the aid workers managed to get the scholarship. At the University of Hawaii Obama Sr met Ann Dunham who would become Obama Jr’s mother. When he wasn’t chasing skirts, he managed to top his class and get a full scholarship into Harvard Law School. Willpower can get you from growing up in sub-Saharan Africa to going to Harvard Law School, to your son becoming the president of the United States.

   
 

Now you may be thinking Obama Sr is smarter and more driven than I’ll ever be. He has better genetics. Just because he has achieved greatness doesn’t mean that I can. But are successful people really smarter than us? So I was in Silicon Valley last year doing a program called 500startups where I got to meet tech billionaires and industry leaders. It was surprisingly underwhelming… The advice these billionaires gave was mostly self indulgent, generic and useless details. “so I cooked lunch for my team everyday, and everyone loved my cooking”. “Ohh marketing, we didn’t do any marketing, the product just grew by itself”. The best advice I got was actually from other startup founders who were still hustling to make it. Then it struck me. These billionaires are not better than the rest of us. They’ve just worked hard and on the right things. But they’re fallible humans. We are all cut from the same cloth. I can do whatever they can do.

   
 

Malcolm Gladwell writes about the 10,000 hour rule: how a master in any field has practiced for at least 10,000 hours. If we put in that amount of hours, we can master anything. Take Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian psychologist who, after studying hundreds of great intellectuals, identified a common theme – early and intensive practice. He hypothesized that with intense practice, he could turn his three daughters into prodigies. He chose chess as the perfect activity to train his children in, because it was creative and analytical and had objectively measurable results. Two of his daughters went on to become grand-masters. No women had ever achieved the title of grand-master before. All three daughters ranked in the top 6 in the world for chess.

   
 

Sure, we’re born with certain physical characteristics or elements of our personality that are hard to change. But the moment that we accept ourselves, take the wheel and start steering, that’s when things start happening. Take Lebron James vs Steph Curry. Lebron has the perfect genetic build for a basketball player. Steph doesn’t. He doesn’t have the height, he doesn’t have the bulk. But he doesn’t give a shit. He proceeds to practice the hell out of his shot. And with that, he has achieved a level of success to rival Lebron. You may not be able to change some part of yourself, but you can develop other parts and be just as effective.

   
 

Cool, so I believe I can do anything I set my mind to. But…

**HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE?**

*To discover your “why”, ask yourself these questions. Find the common denominators in the answers and you’ll have your first lead to explore in finding your why. The commonalities in your answers may point you towards your purpose, and give you some directions to explore.What do you think is biggest problem in the world right now?If money and time weren’t limiting factors, what would you allow yourself to dream of doing?What makes you feel angry, or rise up at the injustice you see?What gets your emotions going? what brings tears to your eyes?What makes you happy?*– *Daniel Flynn, founder Thankyou Water*

**READ**

Read. Do a shit tonne of reading, and then read some more. There are world leaders and billionaires who have spent years distilling the best of their life’s wisdom and principles of success into books. Books that we can access instantly for $10 on Amazon. It’s the digital age. We are the first generation to have the entire trove of human knowledge available on demand in our pockets.

Yet most of us don’t read. What the fuck? Instead we spend our time watching TV. What did Kim K name her kid? Did North Korea fire another rocket? What happens next on Game of Thrones? All this bullshit that we don’t need to know about. Our newest drug addiction is social media. It gives us a hit of validation, a new like, another viral video. But there’s no substance, no meaning. The short term hit leaves us shallow inside and longing for another, and another. Popular media is fucking up our brains. It’s the information age buffet. Because we’re fat fucks from the first world, we say, give me all the junk food, broccoli can fuck off. We need to treat the information we consume like food and watch we’re putting into our bodies. 

**LISTEN TO AUDIO-BOOKS**

The best life hack that anyone has ever told me is to listen to audio-books at 2x speed. You can listen to audio-books whilst you’re at the gym, or driving, or any other mindless task. This way, it’s easy to find 2-3 hours everyday, and if you do, you can finish 2 books every week, and 100 books a year. 100 books will put you miles ahead. Most people don’t even finish 100 books in their lifetime. I started audio-books 3 years ago, and I’ve learnt more in 3 years than I have in the rest of my life combined. School didn’t teach me useful skills, books did. Books written by people who have done it before. You can get most popular titles on Amazon’s Audible book store. Make sure you select the USA Audible store as this has the widest selection.

**FIND MENTORS**

After reading and researching what I wanted to do. I got in touch with people who’ve done it before. No matter what you’re trying to achieve, there are 7 billion people in the world and there are people out there who have done similar things to what you’re attempting to do. Find these people on Linkedin and ask for their mentorship. Ask people who are not your direct competitors, people in a different geography or who have moved onto something else. You’d be surprised at how many people respond. I got around a 30% response rate. Here’s an email that I sent.

Hi John,

I am Rob, an Australian tech entrepreneur [linkedin.com/in/robliu](http://linkedin.com/in/robliu). We’re building [contactout.com](http://contactout.com/) a recruitment tool similar to Connectifier but targeting the Australian and UK markets.

I would greatly appreciate your mentorship and advice on growth and how to do sales for recruitment tools, and any insights you’ve gained from your experience at Connectifier.

Would you be free for a brief chat on Skype? Happy to send you $500 for your time.

Kind Regards, Rob Liu

John was previously VP Marketing at Connectifier, a competitor whose business model I was trying to copy. John came on board as an adviser and helped me add over one million dollars in value to my business. It all started with an email.

When emailing, bribe people. Offer them $500 to talk to you. This makes it look like you’re serious about your request and respectful of their time. Most mentors are rich already and won’t accept your money. For people who do accept your money, don’t bother talking with them. Because if they need $500, then they’re probably not very successful, and would make a shitty mentor.

   
 

After reading, researching, finding mentors, you’ll still have to figure out a lot of the journey by yourself. You’re aiming to do something great and that involves blazing a path into the unknown. It’s like playing soccer. You can read all about soccer tactics, you can practice dribbling, practice kicking. But if you want to get good at soccer, you need to get out onto the field and play the game. Think for yourself, follow your heart, and take action.

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path; and that will make all the difference. – *Steve Jobs*

**YOU ARE ON THIS EARTH FOR A REASON.**

*We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?*

*– Steve Jobs*

   
 

*“Are you a born writer? Were you put on earth to be a painter, a scientist, an apostle of peace? In the end the question can only be answered by action.*

*Do it or don’t do it.*

*It may help to think of it this way. If you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don’t do it, you not only hurt yourself, even destroy yourself,. You hurt your children. You hurt me. You hurt the planet.*

*You shame the angels who watch over you and you spite the Almighty, who created you and only you with your unique gifts, for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter farther along its path back to God.*

*Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It’s a gift to the world and every being in it. Don’t cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you’ve got.”*

– *Steven Pressfield*

a7v58n,1,2018-12-20,dreadful and ashamed,revolutionarytribe,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a7v58n/dreadful_and_ashamed/,"First reddit post--very unfamiliar with how this site works but found this offmychest thread and hoping for some help. I graduated college in 2017. Worked my butt off to get a full-ride and graduate with a 3.9 from a top school, so I've been used to this cycle of working hard and seeing the fruits of my labor. After graduation and a summer internship abroad, I decided to study for a few months full-time to take the LSAT for law school, which I've been thinking about seriously since my freshman year of college. My plan was to kick December out of the park and move to NYC, live with friends from college and work in a professional job. I did HORRIBLY on my diagnostic test--nowhere near the 170 score I'm reaching for. Once my December date came, I realized I was no where near my target score and I decided to push back to February and ultimately to June. All the while my anxiety was sky high. I was totally not in a healthy state of mind--utterly obsessed with the test and doing well. I was so anxious about needing all the time I could to get to the 170 score that I didn't think I could handle a job at the same time, which was extra anxiety-inducing for me as I was thinking about my employment gap. I didn't even allow myself to go to therapy or get medication. My family was supportive but scared.

&amp;#x200B;

Took the test in June when I was finally scoring in my target range. Score came back very low--13 points higher than my diagnostic but far from what I had been practice testing. I was gutted, but chalked it up to my anxiety. Studied again for September while picking up a part-time writing instructor job, working on job applications, and meeting with a therapist weekly--focused on mitigating anxiety and test taking procedures. Felt more secure despite having only gotten two hours of sleep the night before. Went up only 4 points. Gutted again. Maybe somewhat stupidly took it again in November after talking to some LSAT professionals who said there's no reason I should be scoring ten points below my practice test/target score when I was taking the practice tests in legit conditions. This time I was even less focused on knowledge in studying and even more on anxiety mitigation--canceled my therapy because I felt in control/my therapist was unprofessional and even went abroad for my sister's wedding for two weeks and felt fine about it and picked up some more tutoring hours and finished all my applications. Got my score back a week and a half ago that I only went up a point from my September score. Been feeling numb and at a loss ever since. Needless to say, I'm not applying this cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a freaking loser and idiot. Idiot because I failed to reach my target score after 1.25 years of studying (though I should be proud I went up \~20 points from my diagnostic score). Loser because I fucking centered my life on this test. Loser because I've had no social life--went to school in midwest, college friends spread out all over the country, no friends from home (this is a major insecurity of mine). I kept telling myself I would visit my friends ""once this test was over"" but that didn't ever happen bc this test has never been over. Been avoiding social media since I graduated bc I'm ashamed w the state of my life compared to all my high achieving friends and feel I have nothing to show for the life I once had in college and the achievements I once had. Loser because I've had no romantic life since I graduated.  Loser because I've somewhat had a job for a short amount of time, a job that I enjoy bc I enjoy helping kids but a job that I'm embarrassed by because it doesn't match my capabilities and my resume and it's barely enough hours to even be part time.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm going to take the exam again because I really want to go to law school and a highly ranked one too. I'm sorry if I sound like a brat--a type-A brat who isn't grateful for what she has. If anyone is reading this I don't know how to assure you that I'm not. I just really want to fucking do well; I don't come from money so I need to go to a great law school with great employment prospects. I know I deserve this and I know I will get it and I'm realizing not everything happens the way we want.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just the prospect of nearly killing myself over this test again and not knowing what's going wrong between my official scores and my practice tests and being stuck in this town for 1.5 years without friends or a romantic interest or a job that excites me.... this all really really fills me with dread. I've felt emotionally comatose since the score came out. I have no desire to do my workouts, I wake up later than I want bc I feel like I have no reason to get out of bed, I wake up with my heart racing from anxiety again. Things feel really shitty and I'm trying to find the hope. I don't want to make the same mistakes again. I want to be positive. I want to find the light in this situation. I know things will work out for me but my path and my past saddens me. I'm in the fourth round for a job that seems somewhat more exciting to me and I'm planning a trip potentially for president's day to see a friend, that is if I get this job and I get president's day off. Also signed up for a therapist and psychiatrist appt for January.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate anyone's help or words of any nature--ideally encouraging. I want to change my perspective and be more healthy about this"

a7wtl2,20,2018-12-20,In defence of Eliza Minnick,aceofbows,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/a7wtl2/in_defence_of_eliza_minnick/,"Disclaimer: Apologies for my crappy English, it is not my first language. Spoilers for season 13.

There are a few characters who everyone is glad to burn at the stake. Alana Cahill, Erica Hawn, Maggie Pierce and Eliza Minnick. I am not going to argue anything regarding the other three, but just going to focus on the fourth.

I really, really liked Eliza when she was introduced, and her context for it. Let's be honest, the interns we've had in Grey's, especially MAGIC, have done some questionable stuff, a small part of it due to the people they've had teaching them.

When we saw MAC starting to teach, Meredith has always been a horrible, horrible teacher. She had interns taking care of Zola, treated them like crap (Cristina did as well, but for comic relief, and she taught them much better than Mer), and a recurring theme starting from post-plane crash was that anyone wearing light blue holding a scalpel is the end of the world, unlike the first few seasons. Catherine seemed to recognize that, and thus came in Eliza.

Eliza was introduced as a breath of fresh air for the teaching program, and the message I got from it is that you need to incorporate a younger generation's POV into 'the system', which is the biggest problem with a lot of systems nowadays, whether it is corporate, government, etc. Webber's reluctance was the reflection of the older society not being able to accept that, wanting things to be the way it is, but then he realized he could benefit from Eliza's input.

This is when things screw up.

The writing had Bailey give Eliza Webber's position behind his back, at Catherine's (WEBBER'S FREAKING WIFE) insistence. This is just another on a list of sins that just weaken Bailey and would have had nazi Bailey kick her ass, but this is another topic.

From then on, we had the attendings acting like children, especially Meredith, and start an unnecessary war in the hospital, all while making Eliza become more arrogant and condescending with them. This culminates in Eliza plain abandoning Edwards once things finally go wrong, for a legit reason (she had never lost a child), and Richard coming in to save the day.

**In any normal situation, Eliza would have never had Stephanie operating on a child, considering she had never lost one. She would have had Arizona taking over it nonetheless.**

By the time we reach the fire, Eliza has become the villain. She acts like a machine that only follows rules and protocol, and even tries to blame Stephanie for her own predicament.

The problem here is that Eliza at the end looks nothing like the Eliza at the beginning. Half of it to me is Marika Domińczyk's acting (I'm sorry, she's pretty but she can't act for crap) and half of it is the writers realizing they screwed up with Eliza. 

She had the potential to become a great recurring character, push the doctors forward and allow the residents to improve as doctors, but instead she just becomes the catalyst for a childish war in the hospital.

Then her relationship with Arizona.

From the start, I thought they were massively cute, especially when Eliza told Arizona she didn't have to write down her name to memorize it. It was the first time I liked Arizona with a woman (besides Callie obviously) and we could have had her moving forward.

The way they ended it was awful and it only highlighted how desperate they were to brand Eliza as a massive bitch. Ghosting Arizona was a very low move, and they could have had them breaking down amicably.

Also, don't even get me started on the villification of April during the interim chief episode. Considering *who* she shared the most scenes with, I shouldn't even be surprised, but that was just low.

TL;DR: Eliza Minnick was a great concept of a character at first for a one-season arc, but they blew it all away in a few episodes."
a7x7c8,1,2018-12-20,I [23M] need advices with my friend [22F],c29654,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a7x7c8/i_23m_need_advices_with_my_friend_22f/,"Hello,

I require some help concerning the friendship I have with a woman.

---

**TL;DR :**
I know a woman since 4 years. At the beginning, we were not very intimate (she is quite shy), we lost sight during the last two years because I had to move. But she moved up in the same city as mine recently. She is new and alone in this city, she only knows me, and we started to meet after College lectures.

I decided to ask her for a date (mid-November) and she confessed she was a lesbian, we stayed friends anyway.

The problem is that, it's always me who proposes to go out for a drink/meal, to ask for her news and she answers long time after etc...

But on the contrary, she wants us to do sport together (Muay Thaï, running, badminton, mountain trips)

**I hope I am wrong, but I think she spends so much time with me because she is alone and she has not any other friend in the city I live.**

I decided to put distance between us in order to rebalance the relationship and see how it goes, how she reacts... Is it a good or a bad idea ?

---

**More detailed story :**

**Little bit of context :**
- We met a College 4 years ago but we lost sight during the last two years because I had to move. We were not very intimate at the beginning, she is a quite shy.
- Last September she moved up in the same city as mine, she was new and alone and we started to meet after College at least once a week. Our relationship started to be more intimate and I decided to ask her for a date (mid-November). Despite my age, I have no experience with women but I asked her anyway... However, she is the first woman to take a little interest in me.
- She confessed she was a lesbian. I was surprised but she is a good friend, I like to spend time and laugh with her. So I decided to pass and we stayed friend. Our relationship became more intimate, we talked about women, what she likes, what I like etc...

**The problem :**
I have a complete confidence in her but I think our relationship is unbalanced :
- It's always me who proposes to go out for a drink or a meal, she never proposes.
- It's always me who asks for her news and she answers long time after...
- I offered her one diner and she is looking for an internship so I sent her resume to a friend. I never had a ""Thank you"".
- She knows I have nothing planned for the 31st December evening, whereas she will go to another city to meet some friends (who are also my friends). Why did she not invite me ?

**But on the contrary :**
- She asked for doing sport with me (Muay Thai, running)
- She wants me to do badminton with her
- She also proposed to go on mountain trips (with 2 other friends).

So, I don't understand her, am I doing it wrong or is it her ?

**I hope I am wrong, but I think she spends so much time with me because she is alone and she has not any other friend in the city I live.**

I decided to put distance between us in order to rebalance the relationship and see how it goes, how she reacts... Is it a good or a bad idea ?

Thank you for reading :)

a7xw6g,11,2018-12-20,I am actually going to celebrate when I finally manage to get a job,wag1cuz,Stutter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stutter/comments/a7xw6g/i_am_actually_going_to_celebrate_when_i_finally/,"So, I graduated with a pretty good STEM degree in the summer but I’ve found it very difficult to get a job.
To be honest… I’ve never really had a proper job before either. If I had done internships throughout university, I’d be in a better position right now but the reason I avoided all if this was because I was terrified of the thought of doing interviews/assessment centres etc because of my stutter. I’ve always been dreading this moment and have really considered doing a masters just for the sake of avoiding the ‘real world’ for a bit longer, but I decided to go straight into it. 
I’ve had a handful of interviews and many phone/video interviews since graduating but no jobs. Interviews for me can be very hit and miss, some have been reallyy bad and some have been okay.  Having a stutter really does make this process so hard for me along with anxiety which sometimes makes it hard to think on the spot. 
This week, I’ve had 2 interviews though (the most I’ve ever had) where the first went well (my best ever interview) but the other one didn’t go as well. So hopefully, more positive news. 

To be honest though, I knew how hard it would be (although I thought I’d have found something by now) and it’s probably why I didn’t really celebrate graduating from university. But securing a grad job would be such a HUGE achievement for me, as basic as that may sound. I will most definitely celebrate this time. "

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

[Day 1 Evening](https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotica/comments/a7nt69/chasing_anna_day_1_evening_mf_noncon_slow_start/)

*Six months ago...*

Inprocessing was embarrassing. They began with a full physical. The girls stripped down and put on hospital johnnys that seemed determined to come untied. Luckily, all the staff, from admin to doctors, were female and Anna was rather used to having to change in front of other girls thanks to years of sports. The exam was thorough. Everything was checked, vision, hearing, a complete review of every injury since she was 5, no matter how minor. Range of motion, flexibility, sexual history, strength, cardio, recent illness, family medical history, everything. Anna swung her feet down from a pair of stirrups. The gyno exam was apparently the last one as they were shuffled into a large auditorium.

""Hello everyone, and thank you for your prompt reporting for selection. My name is Dr. Laura Winston, but most people here call me the Ma’am. Please look around; the women you see around you will be your friends and family for the next several months. I’m sure you have many questions, and I will try to make sure all of them are answered. You may have noticed certain changes in yourself and the boys around you. You may find yourself starting to notice the boys, and no doubt some of them have started to notice you as well.” Anna settled in for what was sure to be a long, boring birds and the bees talk which she, and everyone else in the room, seemed far too old for.

“This all started with the Maldine virus"" Anna perked up. Everyone knew about the Maldine virus, it needed no explanation. Generations ago, a mysterious disease swept through the globe and nearly destroyed civilization. It ramped up the sex drive, pheromone production, fertility, everything. Males became especially sexually aggressive. At its peak, most of the male population ended up in bands of roaming around the country, fucking every infected female they found, and raping the uninfected. It took 6 months to develop a cure, but the virus left permanent scars. Survivors regained their faculties after the vaccine was administered, but some changes were permanent. The sex drive remained elevated and pheromone production would occasionally spike, requiring survivors to be quarantined on designated islands off the coast for much of their life. Children from these colonies were removed and placed with foster families for their own protection. There were a few flare-ups even after the vaccine, pockets of virus that had escaped the the mandatory vaccination schedule some how, but with strictly enforced vaccinations, those were eventually stamped out. Eventually the populations for these colonies died off. There hadn't been a case of Maldine in generations though. Anna wasn't sure how a virus from over 100 years ago had any impact on them.

""Wasn't that cured?""

""Yes, but please hold your questions until the end. The virus itself was eliminated, but the residual changes post infection were permanent. Furthermore, the virus was able to infect not just somatic cells, but also germ line. The children of the infected carried certain traits from the effects of the virus, increased fertility among them. As such, over 60% of the population now carries the genetic changes associated with Maldine survivors even if they were never infected with the virus itself. We call this new genetic disorder Maldine Residual Disorder, or Marred, spelled MRD. You are all in that 60%. You've lived normally for most of your life because the genes responsible for these changes only kick in at puberty."" Several hands went up, ""There is additionally a lag phase before symptoms begin to appear"" the hands went down ""You are now entering the symptomatic phase. Rest assured thought that this is NOT Maldine. The effects are similar, but much less severe. While the psychological effects will still be present, you will remain yourself, just impaired by the virus. Part of the training you will receive will be how to remain rational and in control when you are subject to the heightened arousal from the disease. We apologize for keeping this information from you for so long, but it was necessary for your own protection. even though you are incapable of spreading the disease, history has shown us that any association with the virus leads to substantial discrimination against those afflicted. We thus encourage each of you not to discuss the disease, the Selection process, or anything else you will learn here after you are released.""

""But what IS Selection?""

""Selection is the only effective treatment we have found for the symptoms. After that, you will be able to live a largely normal life.""

""But what is it?""

""You will pair up with MRD males. After exposure to the male variant, the psychological effects will fade, as will the excess pheromone production. However, it will also reproductively bind you to that person. Any further relapses will effect only the two of you. The general population will be safe from you and you from them.""

""We can only have sex with them?""

""You will only be able to *reproduce* with them. You will be infertile with any other partners."" The reaction to this news was mixed, a few girls seemed flushed with excitement at the idea of finally losing their virginity, others seemed dejected that their first experience would probably be some clinical treatment rather than the romantic scene they imagined. A chubby girl two rows over was quietly crying, clutching a small silver cross hanging from her neck.

""Please bear in mind that the emotions and compulsions you will experience during selection are part of the disorder. They are not your fault. The males will likewise be altered, and you should do your best not to hold grudges against them after selection. We've been working for generations to reduce the psychological effects of the disease and we've met with a fair bit of success. Your selection will be much less traumatic than that of your grandparents. In addition, substantial consideration has been provided to make up for the months of lost education and work experience. You will be awarded with scholarships, internships, and job opportunities to help get you on your feet once you are done with selection. You will all be given the tools you need to make it through Selection. How much you take advantage of those tools with be up to your own motivation and discipline.

Selection itself is one week long. You will be released into an outdoor reserve where the pheromones of the males will build, intensifying the effects of MRD, further building your arousal and fertility.”

“We’re going to get pregnant?”

“There are no guarantees. The first day, since the exposure will still be minimal, you will have no more chance than any other sexual encounter. However, as the effects build, you will become increasingly fertile. By the 4th day, conception will be all but certain. Several of the girls were crying at this point. The weight of what they had just been told was sinking in.

\---

Phase 1 of the training consisted of teaching them all about the Selection process. A cohort of females and males went through at the same time, though in separate facilities. Everything was aimed at preparing them for Selection, a competition of sorts testing how well they could function while under the effects of the MRD. Females would be trained to evade and escape the pursuing males while dealing with their own steadily increasing libido. The longer they kept from getting captured, the higher status they were rewarded with after Selection. Should you evade the males for an entire week, you had your pick of jobs and trainings. They were told males would be competing primarily trying to get these higher status females, thus rewarding those males best able to suppress their urges and work towards a longer term goal in the throes of the disease. In this way, the most resilient to the effects of the condition would effectively be bred to make the next generation even more resistant to the effects. Eventually, after enough generations had passed, the condition would be of little enough effect that they would be able to fully integrate back into society with no need for Selection. They also learned about the biology of MRD, how it impacted the hormone levels and even brain function to spike libido. How it impacted pheromone production to further boost libido when males and females were in proximity to one another. (the facility was set up with separate ventilation systems to prevent cross contamination during training). While the original virus affected anyone, MRD would only affect the person you were paired with. They were given introductory training on all manner of survival and evasion skills, how to cover their tracks, how to construct a hiding spot, how to tell if you were being followed, how to forage for food, the list seemed endless and it was apparent there would be no way to master all these skills before Selection, but Anna tried her best to pick up the skills. Physical training began as well. The girls were all different levels of fitness and by aggressively training them for the next 6 months, the less fit could have the opportunity to make up some of the gap. Anna didn't really need the help, she was quite used to running and had been spending an hour on the track almost every day for years. However, it was the one time of day Anna felt truly normal, so she went religiously. Her usual hour stretched steadily longer until she was running upwards of 5 miles a day.

Phase 2 was the start of planning. They were encouraged to think of plans and strategies for how to evade the males. They were advised against relying to heavily on just one strategy though. If they just hid, a skilled tracker among the males would certainly be able to follow their trail to their hiding place. If you just tried to outrun them, there would likely be a faster male who could follow your trail. If you took too much time covering your tracks to avoid being followed, there were enough males that you would likely get stumbled upon by accident. Fighting off the males was allowed, but would again slow you down until you ended up outnumbered. There were no weapons allowed, either brought in or made though and intentionally causing serious injury was strictly banned as well. They were periodically taken out to the reserve to become familiar with the terrain. and to practice the skills they continued to learn. Classes were much less formal now. You could request training on anything you could think of and they would get an expert out there to train you on it. Anna had signed up for Advanced Camouflage Techniques with the plan of waiting out the last few days after most of the field can been cleared. She was waiting for their trainer in a small clearing in the woods with 4 other girls. It was the first lesson and they weren't even sure who the instructor would be. They had all just completed the intermediate level, but Mrs. Watson said she wasn't the instructor for the next level. She got two surprises in rapid succession. First, the trainer suddenly burst out of a concealed position not 5 feet from where they were gathered, causing all of them to jump and one girl to scream. The second shock caused one of the girls to bolt. The instructor was a man. Anna was frozen to the spot, anticipating that at any moment he would be driven mad by the pheromones the girls knew they were given off and begin raping them. Instead he smiled and greeted them amicably.

""Hello ladies! I'm Mr. John Fallow, you can call me John though"" he looked after the girl running away through the trees, ""I suppose I've over done it a bit. Please try and pass along what we cover to her before next class.""

""Um... Sir? is it really safe for you to be here?"" Anna asked.

""Of course. I went through Selection 7 years ago. I'm immune to the effects now, well, except when my wife has a flare up!"" Anna blushed, taking his meaning. Over the next hour, he had each of them attempt to construct a place to hide. He walked around examining the work rattling off what seemed to be an endless stream of tips and tricks which Anna couldn't even begin to absorb. She pulled out her tablet and hastily tried to scribble down what he was saying about silhouette breaking, but he quickly chastised her, ""Miss, don't write, just try and do it! You need to feel and see what a good camo looks like"" She flushed deeply at the correction. He looked closer at her own blind ""Great job hiding the entrance though"" She flushed even deeper at the praise. By the end of class they were all quite hot from the work of constructing their hiding spots. Anna wasn't sure about the other girls, but she was quite a bit hotter from spending an hour so close to a man for the first time since she arrived. Perhaps if there were a couple more guys like Mr. Fallow in the selection it wouldn't be so bad she thought to herself. On the walk back to base, the three girls discussed the unusual class and Anna was reassured that she wasn't alone in her reaction to the unexpected male teacher.

\-----

They were awake before dawn. They quickly broke camp, did their best to hide that they had been there, and began walking as the first rays of the sun began peeking over the horizon. Anna's whole body was stiff from the hours of running the previous day and she was nearly limping until her muscles warmed up. The first day had been all about gaining distance from the pack, now they needed to navigate and be sure they weren't being followed. The entrance to the wooded area they were aiming for was small. 200 meters off to either side and they'd hit swamp. They still wanted to move fast, but had to check their azimuth often, so rather than a run, they hiked. It was slower than the day before, but the terrain was getting rougher and the pace they set was every bit as painful as the run the day before. Nickie, however, seemed as spry and cheerful as ever and as they walked, she began to quietly talk to Anna about her past. She grew up on a farm in a small town just outside the city. Her parents had taken time to make sure she was out in the woods often, getting used to moving through the brush. They encouraged her to run as well, putting her on the Track and cross country teams. This was something Anna found quite familiar. Her own parents encouraged her to run as well. It retrospect, they were surely trying to prepare her for Selection all these years. Anna wasn't quite so comfortable sharing her own story, but Nickie didn't seem to mind. She just happy continued babbling quietly away about her life. They had their first scare that afternoon. Nickie was telling Anna an embarrassing story about a friend from school named Vicky who ended up topless at school after a thread from her sweater caught on something unraveled as she walked down the hall. Anna was very skeptical about this story, but said nothing. Suddenly Nickie grabbed her shoulder and froze. Anna strained her ears and slowly looked around. They heard rustling approaching. they quickly dropped down behind a bush. A boy with rope slung around his chest came bounding out of the trees about 100 meters away. He luckily wasn't headed quite for them, instead passing by and running ahead. As the footsteps faded, they slowly got up.

""How did he get this far out so quick?"" Anna whispered. Her heart was pounding out of her chest.

""I told you there were some fast runners. I recognize the rope. We'll try to get some more info on him tonight""

""Let's cross the stream make sure he doesn't accidentally bump into us.""

They made their way back to the water, moving much slower to make sure they didn't leave a trail. When they got the the shore, Anna hesitated.

""What if someone sees us cross?""

""It's a risk we have to take. We can watch after we cross to make sure no one follows us over"" Nickie didn't wait for a response, she was in the water and swimming for the other side. Anna stood watching her for a moment, then looked up the river for any indication they had been spotted. After Nickie pulled herself out on the other side, Anna knew there was no more sense in delaying. She dove in. The stream was not terribly wide, it probably took no more than 30 seconds to cross, but Anna felt terribly exposed after the near miss and it felt like an eternity. When she made it to the tree line by Nickie, they looked again up and down the river, but saw nothing but some ducks and driftwood.

""I think we're safe"" Nickie whispered.

Anna didn't feel safe, but nodded. They walked slower now, and Nickie's fantastical stories were at least at the moment silenced. Twice they stopped after hearing leaves rustling, but both times they saw nothing more than animals. Anna's skin crawled, after the scare, she felt as though there were eyes all around, watching her, waiting to pounce. Despite her misgivings, the rest of the day was uneventful. They picked some blueberries as the sun set, they weren't about to risk fishing if there might by guys around. They took turns keeping watch until it was good and dark, then crawled into their shelter to review the day's report. Several of the captures were from the night before that must have come in too late to be included in the report, then continued through the day.

A boy was walking around a clearing as if looking for something, just as the sun set, a girl stepped out from behind a tree and spotted him. Instead of bolting though, she called out to get his attention. He quickly followed her to where she had been hiding. She kissed him passionately as she ripped his shirt open. his hands wandered over her body, grabbing and groping. If she was bothered by his inartful foreplay, she didn't show it though. Their clothes fell to the ground piece by piece until finally the girl lay back with her legs open. He fumbled briefly between her legs until she reached down and guided him to the proper place. She winced slightly as he took her virginity, but wrapped her legs round him to pull him deeper.

A girl spotted a boy through the tree and made a run for it. The boy saw her, and took off after her. She seemed to be a natural sprinter and quickly pulled far ahead. They watched through multiple camera changes as he followed the trail at a solid jog. After 5 minutes, The girl stopped, panting, out of sight. She obviously thought she had lost him, a minute later she say him jogging along behind her and took off again. after a few minutes, she slowed, not stopping, but slowing as her energy levels dropped. Her face looked pained, obviously not used to distance running. The boy remained calm and relaxed. ""She ran herself out too quick, that's how he's gonna get her"" Nickie whispered. Sure enough, the boy slowly closed the distance. Anna expected a replay of the rough treatment they watched yesterday, but the boy didn't grab her or tackle her, but rather pulled up next to her and jogged along side her, She turned, running away again, but he followed, sticking right next to her. He knew he had her and was waiting for her to accept it. Eventually, she stopped, panting, sitting with her back to a tree and staring at her soon to be mate. She looked miserable, both from pain from the run  and shame at her capture. Surprisingly, the boy still did not claim his prize. Instead, he offered his canteen. She glared warily at it, but eventually took it and drank deeply. The boy smiled as he took his canteen back. He said something to her. There was no audio in the recordings, so they couldn't tell what, but the girl seemed more at ease. With a sigh, she dropped her shorts and bend over on all fours, offering herself to him. She still didn't look happy, but seemed resigned to her fate. He pushed his cock into her; she winced at the pain of her defloration. He stopped, buried inside her, placed a hand on her back and said something. She turned her head to look back and gave a slight nod for him to continue. The boy fucked like he ran, steady and relaxed. Before long, the pained look on the girls face had faded into moans of pleasure. By the time the boy finished, she was thrashing under him and pushing back into his thrusts. The two lovers collapsed on the forest floor, holding tightly to each other.

""It seems gentler than yesterday"" Anna said.

""It's the pheromones. you feel it too, don't you? She was running, but she was also horny as hell. Part of her wanted to get caught. That's why she agreed so quickly after they stopped.""

""They guys seem nicer too. I think the worst of the bunch took the easy catches at the start.""

""Could be, These are mostly the guys that ran past looking for girls that would be harder to catch. They've at least got enough self control to want someone higher status.""

They watched the rest of the captures. There were still some rough, forceful captures, but many of them did seem somehow polite, almost apologetic about forcing themselves on the girls. The girls, for their part, did seem to be more willing. Most of them, even if they were crying at the start, seemed to enjoy it by the end.

""You know it's only going to get worse as the pheromones build"" Anna said, ""We're going to be fighting not to throw ourselves at them by the end of the week""

""When you say it like that, it sounds like it's getting better!"" Nickie replied, a twinkle in her eye.

""Well, I don't intend my first time to be with just whoever can catch me.""

""Well, better than a drunken night at a party at least. How much distance did we cover today?""

""Barely 8 miles. We're really going to have to push if we're going to reach the lake by tomorrow. We might have added another day already.""

""Well, let's get some sleep and try and start before dawn tomorrow.

Anna couldn't fall asleep right away though. She was thinking back to the training. She knew the feelings would only intensify and hated not being in control of herself. There was a deep ache in her, an arousal she knew would get stronger. She reached down and began touching herself, her mind turning to the boy that had almost caught them. She wondered what he looked like underneath the uniform. She came quickly, holding her breath to avoid waking the sleeping girl next to her.

\---

*Two months ago…*

""The third and final phase of the training will be preparing you for the psychological effects of MRD. You will be fighting not just to evade the males, but also fighting to maintain control over your own urges."" No training was scheduled for the weekend. instead, all the girls had been summoned to a large room for a rare mandatory event. Ma'am was addressing them to kick off the final phase before Selection. ""The males will likewise be effected by you and will be struggling to think clearly during the Selection as well. We want you to remember they are your peers, not your enemies. They are going through the same thing you are. That's why we brought you here today. Enjoy. The back wall began to slide open. There was a half wall remaining up to stomach height. Anna gasped and cowered into the corner. There on the other side of the room were over a hundred men. The only thing separating them was a 4 foot high barrier. Anna looked around. The rest of the girls were pressing back into the wall as well, trying to get as far away from the young men as possible. Amazingly, some of the boys seemed to be backing away from them as well.

""Let's set some ground rules. No one is to cross the barrier and all clothing is to stay on. Aside from that, please feel free to socialize with each other. Get to know each other. Staff will be watching to make sure nothing gets out of hand. Rest assured you are all perfectly safe.""

With that, Ma'am swept out of the room and left the two hundred plus boys and girls in the still completely silent room. Seconds ticked by slowly. Eventually, one brave girl stepped cautiously towards the barrier. A few boys approached just as slowly. As they began quietly, haltingly talking, others crept towards the low wall. Soon the room was humming with a low babble as boys and girls talked with each other for the first time in months. Anna remained in the corner, cautiously watching over the scene. What game were they playing here? She thought back to her mother's words in the car, ""Dear, it's really not his fault. It's no one's fault. I know you're angry, but you'll understand soon."" They were trying to make excuses for what was going to happen. They were going to turn all the boys loose to violate the girls and wanted to keep the girls from talking afterward. She crept closer to listen in on the conversations and try and get some insight. She overheard people talking about their families, the schools they went to or jobs they worked. They talked about the surprise of getting the letters and the training  they got, what they wanted to do after.

""Hi, I'm Tim"" a boy said, startling her. She glowered at him for a moment

""Just saying hi. I haven't talked to anyone but instructors and roommates for months"" Tim went on

This could be an opportunity she thought. Maybe I can get some ideas about what to watch out for. She forced a smile.

""yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. I'm Anna.""

""So how are things going on your side? Have you heard anything from the outside world?""

""No, my parents have visited a few times, but they won't give me any news. They said I should just focus on what I'm doing here.""

""My parents are from out of town. They haven't been able to visit. How's training going""

Alarm bells went off in Anna's mind. Don't say anything he can use to catch you she reminded herself.

""Oh, pretty good. Just trying to learn everything. How about you? What's your favorite stuff to study here"" She had adopted a flirty tone she hoped would be disarming, but underneath she was on edge, heart pounding at having a threat so near.

They talked for several minutes about tracking and survival as Anna made mental notes about anything that seemed useful. She suddenly noticed the boy wasn't really smiling anymore. She realized she had let her prying get too obvious, her smile too strained. The boy was onto her. She was worried he's call her on it, but instead he just made his excuses and wandered off to talk to someone else. She heard a girl giggling at some joke next to her as she batted her eyes at a boy who seemed quite smitten. She saw a  shy looking boy a few meters away. \*Let's try again\* she put on her best smile and approached him. It took a bit, but once she got him talking he opened right up. It didn't do much good though, he was perfectly willing to talk about the training, but dejectedly admitted he had no plan.

""I don't know what I'm going to do. All the other guys are faster, stronger, and better than me. I'm probably going to get stuck here forever. And I'm sure not going to force myself on anyone.""

""Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find someone. We all get paired up eventually, right? Otherwise there'd probably be some 60 year old kicking around here still. I'll tell you a secret"" she whispered, taking pity on the poor boy, ""a few of the girls don't even want to run, they said they'll just stick by the gate and get it over with""

The boy made a bit of a face.

""That's the other problem. The idea of just being with someone to get it over with seems horrible. I want to have kids someday and I don't want to get stuck with some girl who doesn't even care about her future enough to go for a scholarship. I suppose if I have to stay an extra cycle or two I might have to though.""

She chatted with him a while longer. He seemed earnest and as unhappy about the situation as she was. It was reassuring that at least one of the boys wasn't threatening. He was smart, funny (once he got over the shyness) even a bit cute, though he was a bit on the small and scrawny side. Had they met back in high school she thought they could have been good friends.

Over the next hour, she chatted up several boys, getting better and better at drawing out info without arousing their suspicions and dodging any question that might reveal her skills or plans. She began to type the boys into types. There were the runners, those who were athletic and intended to use that athleticism to chase someone down. Then there were the trackers, who intended to follow a trail until they found someone. Next came the brutes, who would probably just tag along with another guy and try and take his prize. There were the hopeless ones, like the shy boy, who didn't seem to have any way of catching a girl. Lastly there were the mysteries. Boys who, like herself, were tight lipped about their plan and as suspicious of her as she was of them. She still viewed the boys as threats, but she understood her parents a bit better now. It wasn't they boys' fault they were here. They were trapped just as much as she was.

a7z8dq,25,2018-12-20,SECT WATCHDOG (in Belgium) ASKS RESEARCH INTO CHILD ABUSE AT JEHOVAH's WITNESSES,NRKoppe,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/a7z8dq/sect_watchdog_in_belgium_asks_research_into_child/," English (google) translation  
(orgineel Nederlands artikel hieronder)  
SECT WATCHDOG (in Belgium) ASKS RESEARCH INTO CHILD ABUSE AT JEHOVAH's WITNESSES  
The official advice center for sects in our country asks the House for an investigation into the sexual abuse of minors at the witnesses of Jehovah. A number of testimonies have also been reported to the public prosecutor's office. ""The victims are worried about sexual offenders who are still active within Jehovah's Witnesses.""  
The IACSSO sectobservatory, an independent center of the Justice Department, received ""various direct and indirect testimonies"" last year. They declared that they had undergone sexual violence as a child within the witnesses of Jehovah. IACSSO can not tell you about the number of testimonies, but they seem to confirm that Jehova's witnesses also cover child abuse in Belgium.  
The ball came rolling a year ago, after reports to the Dutch foundation Reclaimed Voices. In less than a year, 286 testimonies of sexual abuse were received from Jehovah's Witnesses. Last month the court in the Netherlands did several raids in churches, so-called kingdom halls, and homes of Jehovah's Witnesses.  
Underlying pattern  
""When it turned out last year that Belgian victims were present, we started investigating the case,"" says Kerstine Vanderput, director of IACSSO. The center has now made recommendations to Chamber chairman Siegfried Bracke (N-VA) and various members of the government. The timing is not ideal given the fall of the government, but IACSSO directs on a parliamentary inquiry committee to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The goal: ""To gain insight into the underlying pattern of the internal rules, practices and structures and their possible influence on the willingness to report.""  
Jehovah's Witnesses have been condemning pedophilia as a despicable act for many years in numerous publications, but at the same time it does not systematically inform the competent authorities. She arranges child abuse cases all over the world internally through judicial committees set up by the college of elders, who provide pastoral guidance.  
The Belgian Jehovah's Witnesses have received the findings of the IACSSO, but they refute it. ""A judicial committee only serves to determine whether such a perpetrator can still be part of the community, but it is not a court of law,"" says spokesman Louis De Wit. He calls child abuse ""detestable"". ""Victims need to go to justice with their complaint.""  
This contradicts international reports, as well as testimonials from ex-members in the media. ""Going to the police, you do not, unless the perpetrator is an infidel,"" said a woman, who last year in De Morgen testified about the abuse she had undergone as a child. The world of Jehovah's Witnesses is strongly inward: to avoid contact with people from outside the Church.  
Sexual offenders  
Nevertheless, the past year came from the community, which in Belgium says 25,480 members in Belgium, some of them testify at IACSSO. ""People came here to testify who were no longer able to drive home because of the emotion"", says Vanderput. ""They are worried about sexual offenders who are still active within Jehovah's Witnesses.""

  
IACSSO informed the federal prosecutor's office in September, but no complaint has been submitted. As a result, there is no official investigation. According to a judicial source, the public prosecutor is working on it, but it would be a confidential file.

  
""It is expected that just as with the sexual abuse in the church, other people will now find the courage to formulate a complaint,"" says Olivier Faelens of the Study and Advisory Group of Sects, who assists sectarian victims.  
\- Nederlands--   
Sektewaakhond vraagt onderzoek naar kindermisbruik bij Jehova’s getuigen 

  
Het officiële adviescentrum voor sektes in ons land vraagt aan de Kamer om een onderzoek naar seksueel misbruik van minderjarigen bij de getuigen van Jehova. Een aantal getuigenissen zijn ook gesignaleerd bij het parket. “De slachtoffers zijn ongerust over seksuele delinquenten die nog actief zijn binnen Jehova’s getuigen.”

  
Het sekteobservatorium IACSSO, een onafhankelijk centrum van de overheidsdienst Justitie, heeft het afgelopen jaar “verschillende directe en indirecte getuigenissen ontvangen”. Ze verklaarden als kind seksueel geweld te hebben ondergaan binnen de getuigen van Jehova. Over hoeveel getuigenissen het gaat, kan IACSSO niet meedelen, maar ze lijken te bevestigen dat Jehova’s getuigen ook in België kindermisbruik toedekt.

  
De bal kwam een jaar geleden aan het rollen, na meldingen bij de Nederlandse stichting Reclaimed Voices. In minder dan een jaar tijd kwamen daar 286 getuigenissen binnen van seksueel misbruik bij de getuigen van Jehova. Vorige maand deed het gerecht in Nederland meerdere invallen in kerken, zogenaamde koninkrijkszalen, en woningen van Jehova’s getuigen.

  
Onderliggende patroon  
“Toen vorig jaar bleek dat er ook Belgische slachtoffers bij waren, zijn we de zaak beginnen onderzoeken”, zegt Kerstine Vanderput, directeur van IACSSO. Het centrum heeft nu aanbevelingen overgemaakt aan Kamervoorzitter Siegfried Bracke (N-VA) en verschillende leden van de regering. De timing is niet ideaal gezien de val van de regering, maar IACSSO stuurt aan op een parlementaire onderzoekscommissie naar de Jehova’s getuigen. Het doel: “Inzicht krijgen in het onderliggende patroon van de interne regels, gebruiken en structuren en de mogelijke invloed ervan op de aangiftebereidheid.”

  
Jehova’s getuigen veroordeelt al jaren in tal van publicaties pedofilie als een verachtelijke handeling, maar tegelijkertijd brengt ze de bevoegde overheden niet stelselmatig op de hoogte. Overal ter wereld regelt ze zaken van kindermisbruik intern via gerechtelijke comités, opgericht door het college van ouderlingen, die pastoraal leiding geven.  
De Belgische Jehova’s getuigen hebben de bevindingen van het IACSSO ontvangen, maar weerleggen die. “Een gerechtelijk comité dient enkel om te bepalen of zo’n dader nog deel kan zijn van de gemeenschap, maar het is geen rechtbank”, zegt woordvoerder Louis De Wit. Hij noemt kindermisbruik “verfoeilijk”. “Slachtoffers moeten met hun klacht wel degelijk naar justitie stappen.”

  
Dat spreekt internationale rapporten tegen, maar ook getuigenissen van ex-leden in de media. “Naar de politie gaan, dat doe je niet, tenzij de dader een ongelovige is”, zei een vrouw, die vorig jaar in De Morgen getuigde over het misbruik dat ze als kind had ondergaan. De wereld van Jehova’s getuigen is sterk naar binnen gericht: omgang met mensen van buiten de kerk is te mijden.

   
Seksuele delinquenten  
Toch kwamen het afgelopen jaar uit de gemeenschap, die in België naar eigen zeggen 25.480 leden telt, enkelingen een getuigenis afleggen bij IACSSO. “Hier zijn mensen komen getuigen, die door de emotie niet meer in staat waren om nog naar huis te rijden”, zegt Vanderput. “Ze zijn ongerust over seksuele delinquenten die nog actief zijn binnen Jehova’s getuigen.”

   
IACSSO heeft het federaal parket in september daarover ingelicht, maar een klacht is er niet ingediend. Daardoor loopt er officieel geen onderzoek. Volgens een gerechtelijke bron is het parket er wel mee bezig, maar zou het gaan om een vertrouwelijk dossier.

  
“Het is de verwachting dat net als bij het seksueel misbruik in de kerk, andere mensen nu de moed zullen vinden om een klacht te formuleren”, zegt Olivier Faelens van de vzw Studie- en Adviesgroep Sekten, die sekteslachtoffers bijstaat.

a7z9hu,4,2018-12-20,A Bob Murray Christmas,apewithcrayon,comedywriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/comedywriting/comments/a7z9hu/a_bob_murray_christmas/,"[Scene: Holiday Party at Murray Energy Corporation, the largest coal mining company in the United States. The curmudgeon Bob Murray, company CEO, stands awkwardly and crookedly in the middle of a large banquet hall, doing his best to deflect conversation with lowly employees.]



EMPLOYEE: Merry Christmas, Mr. Murray!

BOB MURRAY: Bahhh Humbug. The only thing merry about this time of year is all of these idiots sapping up more energy from the grid with their twinkle lights.  Means more coal being burnt!

EMPLOYEE: I'll drink to that! Surely you enjoy a little R&amp;R with the family just like the rest of us, no?

BOB MURRAY: Bah. As a Coal man, Christmas frustrates me. You hear all of these tales that glorify kids receiving coal for Christmas... but you just don't see it anymore.

EMPLOYEE: Uh huhhhh. You do know... nevermind.

BOB MURRAY: What? Out with it!

EMPLOYEE: Well, it's just that... those aren't tales of glory. The legend goes that Santa only brings coal to the naughty kids - to slight them and motivate them to be good the following year.

BOB MURRAY: Nonsense! I got nothing but coal every Christmas growing up, and I loved it!  I'd spend weeks stacking it, counting it, unstacking it, recounting it... the possibilities were endless.  I used to rub it across my top teeth and cry to my mom that I'd lost them all. When my imagination really got stirring, I'd cover my entire face in coal and pretend I was a superhero: Coal Man! 

EMPLOYEE: So, you'd run around in black face?  No wonder you got coal...

BOB MURRAY: I got it because I asked for it!  Maybe that's the problem then... kids just aren't asking Santa for coal like they used to.

EMPLOYEE: Huh? Didn't we just talk about the naughty list? You think Santa brought coal to kids because they asked for it?

BOB MURRAY: Of course! Do you really think Santa is going to give lucrative fossil fuels to unruly kids?  Don't be ridiculous! I remember Santa used to play tricks on the bad ones... like how he'd give a toy train set to my brother, but he'd give all the coal to me. What good is a steam engine if you don't have coal to power it! HAH! Worthless!

EMPLOYEE: [feigns laughter] Yea, that's pretty clever of Santa. But seriously, the bad kids get the coal.

BOB MURRAY: Look, my boy has been a little shit since he was born and he got a Corvette for Christmas last year. Good fuel-burning car.

EMPLOYEE: Yeaaaa, but that's because you're rich. Dave in accounting bought him that on your behalf.

BOB MURRAY: Ok, let's suppose you're right - Santa gives coal to naughty kids.  Then what you're saying is that Santa has just relaxed his standards?  Nobody is ""naughty"" anymore, so nobody is getting coal?

EMPLOYEE: Uhhh... Maybe?

BOB MURRAY: Well, what the hell?! The kids are worse than ever these days, it's no time to relax the rubric. He needs to raise the standards, so that all but the very best kids - like the ones in my mines - are getting coal. This Santa guy is single-handedly putting hardworking parents - and kids - out of their mining jobs!

EMPLOYEE: [dumbfounded, but playing along] You're absolutely right. That has to be why we are losing marketshare, and not because 40% of energy production has moved to nuclear and renewables.

BOB MURRAY: Damn this Santa guy! I hate him more than I thought I did. Get him on the phone!  We need to reach an accord.

EMPLOYEE: Sir, I'm not so sure that's possible...

BOB MURRAY: To hell it isn't!  I've got Trump in my back pocket and I'll stuff Santa back there with him... right up against my hairy left asscheek.

EMPLOYEE: [shudders] Sir, truly you have just ruined the last shred of Christmas magic left in me.  And that includes when I was five and my uncle vomitted bad Clamato juice through his loose, drawstringed Santa beard, all over our Christmas tree.

BOB MURRAY: [eyeing a young intern walking by] Sorry, what are you blathering about now? Oh right, you were going to talk to Santa. Did you call him?

EMPLOYEE: Yes, I did. He said he is done with the coal because he's worried about greenhouse gasses, and his workshop at the North Pole sliding into the Arctic Ocean.

BOB MURRAY: Huh? What's that got to do with coal?!

EMPLOYEE: [aghast] I know... that's what I said.

BOB MURRAY: Well, tell him that we'll build him a new workshop down here in West Virginia. A sturdy one made of coal-produced steel. None of this gingerbread bullshit that he's been working out of.

EMPLOYEE: Yes, Sir. I'll call him back, Sir. [downs his eggnog as he walks away, and grabs two more from a tray floating by]"

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.


THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+"

I applied last year but got waitlisted, likely a combination of weak hs GPA, didn’t share my midterm grades, didn’t share a lot of my extracurriculars, and possibly a weak essay.
My grades definitely dipped this semester since I pledged a fraternity. I’m wondering it I destroyed my chances for transferring. This is basically my transcript:

A Calc 
A- Macroeconomics 
A- communications
A Microeconomics 
A non-western humanities
3.88 

A writing 
A history
A- business analytics
A- CIS
B+ business law
3.74(?)

A- English
A- music(might changed to an A)
A- Polsci (4credit)
B+ Accounting (ie one of my majors...)
B “interpersonal skills”(incredibly stupid business class, think Myers Briggs if it was an exam)
3.493 or 3.52 if the As changed

Cum:3.7

So yeah, those are my three semesters consecutively.
I’m an Accounting and Finance Major atm but I wanna add a bus. analytics minor and that would lead me to drop one of my majors (Ik uva concentrations are different this is just to give you an idea).

This summer I had an “accounting internship” at a small medical company where I basically did data entry and corrected job costing reports.
Total resume is:

^that internship
Philanthropy chair of my fraternity
Financial Management Association
Founder of a business club in HS
Service club social media manager in HS (largest school fundraiser)
Eagle Scout

PWC challenge my freshmen year (didn’t place)
Bloomberg terminal cert and some experience( I can get around fairly comfortable but need specific instructions to get anything done)
BB&amp;T leadership cert (horseshit)
Experience with Quickbooks and a couple CRM systems

I’m also nominally in the Honors College but have taken 0 honors classes and I don’t plan on taking any.

What are my chances? I don’t have any language credits and my hope is to be in McIntire some day but not necessarily my first semester as a third year. 
Any advice that is not bad is good and appreciated.

Thank you

a802rd,30,2018-12-20,Job searching - Giving up,Psychysound,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/a802rd/job_searching_giving_up/,"Hi everyone,

First of all i will introduce myself, Master's degree in geosciences (specialized in petroleum geology and sedimentary basins). I worked as an intern a few month at Total, a year as an intern too in 2 companies specialized in geothermal energy. 

After graduating I failed to find a job in geosciences and later accepted an offer to be an GIS engineer in the field of telecommunications. I left this position 1 year ago and since then it is impossible to find anything remotely related to geosciences. I am located in Paris and applied in France obviously but also in other countries even though I dont have any connections unfortunately...

The thing is as much as i love geosciences, i think that i will never work as a geologist, it is just not happening and i am wasting my time and energy. I have tried a lot of things to reach company, to work on my cover letters/CV etc.

I dont really know what to do now, i think i will maybe do another degree with more opportunities.

If you have ideas on what to do next i will be glad to hear it.

Thanks"
a802tc,1,2018-12-20,Type me,SeriesP,mbti,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/a802tc/type_me/,"Ripping these questions from previous posts on this sub:

**1.**  **What makes you respect individuals, groups, or organizations? List whatever you can think of.**

I respect individuals/groups that don't pander to other people's expectations of them, in the sense that such individuals/groups will not hesitate to speak the truth despite how others might react. I'm particularly fond of people that excel in the fields that I'm interested in, and who consistently challenge their peers/juniors to rise to their level of expertise.

**2. What kind of things turn you off about a person, a brand/company, or a particular environment? What gets under your skin (in a bad way)?** Idiots. Idiots that open their mouths. Idiots that open their mouths and cannot shut up. People/companies that pander to what society expects of them (especially those that are willing to play along with social justice warriors and spout lunacy for the sake of being ""politically correct""). People that you have to actively avoid for fear that they will start a conversation with you that you have no interest in joining. Those same people that get offended when you tell them, ""I don't want to talk.""

**3. How good is your memory for detail? Specific conversations you've had in the past, little tasks that need to get done, what you were doing the first time you heard a song or tried a food, etc.**

I have a pretty good memory since I was young. I missed the bus to my school when I was about 3-4 years old, and my uncle (who lived nearby) had to take me there on his motorcycle, but he didn't know the way. I'd gone on the bus rides enough times by then that I was able to tell him the path to my school at that age. (When I was younger that seemed normal to me, but now thinking about it, that's pretty fuckin beast LOL excuse the self-fellatio.) I was able to recite Hamlet's Act 2 Scene 2 soliloquy in my 12th grade English class without error, and I'm pretty sure that I could still recite it now (Senior in uni). I remember a lot of conversations that my friends and I have had, including those from 10 or so years ago, though such conversations tend to usually be outrageous and I doubt I remember many of the tamer ones. One of my friends was freaked out that I remembered the girl that he liked when we were in first grade 7 years later. Other details that I remember would be only if the memory had some sort of impact on me (throwing up eating panda express for the first time at a mall when I was young (first time I recall throwing up, though I must have as a baby), dressing up as George W Bush on president's day in 2nd grade (first time wearing a ""tie"" though it was a clip on).

**4.** **What do you spend the most time thinking about - the past, the present, the future? Practical topics, logistical issues, relationships with people, theoretical concepts, issues of morality/ethics? Do you find yourself fixating on one thing, coming back to it, and trying to figure it out, or are you more prone to meandering through multiple tangentially related topics? Do you often daydream/space out? When you do daydream or fantasize, what kind of things do you imagine and think about?**

I spend most of my thinking time concentrated on the future. I have some goals that I've set for myself, and I've been thinking about how I can actualize them. Though I do tend to meander often, and I daydream quite more than I should. In these daydreams, I'm usually getting into a fight with a criminal or am carrying out responsibilities of running a successful business. These daydreams almost always involve me getting into an argument/confrontation with someone (seems to be a common topic in my ""nightdreams"" as well.)

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Think about a topic or two you're really interested in and like having conversations about. Do you think you would generally have more fun talking about that topic with an enthusiastic, curious listener who asks you lots of great questions, or do you think you would generally have more fun listening to an interesting, entertaining person talk at length about it and answer your questions enthusiastically?**

I would rather be the listener -- no contest. I've been the ""teacher"" before and while it's nice when you can see that ""lightbulb moment"" happen with your student, having your own ""lightbulb"" go off is just so much more rewarding.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. In the last question, what topic(s) were you thinking about?**

Math and Electrical Engineering. (\^Funny, if I consider other topics, such as psychology, I would rather do the talking.)

**7. If someone is doing something that you strongly disagree with, how likely are you to confront them about it? If you do confront them, how do you usually tend to do it? How does your answer change depending on your relationship with the person, and whether their actions directly affect you?**

Fairly likely, especially so if it's someone that I know. I usually just speak pretty bluntly about the problem that I have with the individual's action. If their actions directly affect me, I am definitely going to be extra-confrontational about it, and I'd probably come off as the dick in that scenario. When pushed too far, I've been told I've reached extraordinary sound pressure levels, though this kind of behavior has tapered off since I was 15. My friends say I still get ""scary"" even when I'm not necessarily raising my voice.

**8. How interested are you in trying new things - traveling, trying strange and exotic foods, going on roller coasters, jumping out of airplanes, things like that? Regardless of how interested you are, how willing would you be to do those things if someone asked you to? How often do you actually do things like that? Give examples.**

I don't really care about traveling but I love the idea of trying new food. My friends and I went to Iceland this past summer, and much of the time I didn't leave the car while they went to go take pictures (seriously, Google Maps has better pictures.) I was at work while we planned the trip, and didn't realize that food in Iceland was expensive out the ass, so it was very disappointing for me. I'd love to jump out of an airplane, try a crazy roller-coaster. I'd definitely scream my head off but it'd be a LOT of fun. When I was 8, my extended family and I went to SeaWorld and I wasn't tall enough to ride any of the fun rides, and I remember demanding that the rest of the family not get to ride the fun rides either and throwing a hissyfit when my cousin-in-law went on ""The Electric Eel."" (I was a brat.) If someone were to offer me to, I would have to see if my schedule was open, and if so I'd probably be down.

**9. How would other people describe your demeanor? It may help to ask people you know. How emotional do you seem to people? How rational? Do you tend to be quiet and reserved, or more loud and talkative? Do you seem to choose your words carefully, or talk stream of consciousness, or do you sometimes think so fast you stumble trying to get all the words out. Do you tend to finish your sentences, or skip to the next sentence in the middle of the one you're saying, or skip to new topics entirely? Do you interrupt - if so, when and how often? How do you feel if someone interrupts you? How often do you feel like you have so much energy you can't sit still and need to be up and moving? How hard is it for you to get out of bed in the morning, or get up after relaxing for a long time?**

""Aloof and uninterested at times, overconfident and slightly demeaning at times, and hyper focused pretty much whenever else."" - From one of my best friends. Dude's a super nice guy treading lightly, so ""overconfident and slightly demeaning at times"" probably means ""downright arrogant and condescending often."" I usually am quiet/reserved (aloof and uninterested) but when I'm hyperfocused or ""feeling myself"" lmao, I become one of those idiots that open their mouths and can't shut up. I often either choose words carefully, particularly when explaining a topic to someone, or I stumble trying to get all the words out (when I get really excited.) I often skip topics, and I interrupt a LOT, but I hate it when other people interrupt me -- which I understand is quite hypocritical. I've got a lot of energy, and I feel extremely restless if I don't go work out or shadow box or something. I take a long time to get out of bed though, unless there is a clear goal that I have to accomplish that day.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Are you involved in any creative activities or projects? What are they and why do you like them? What are your goals in these areas? What have you felt most proud of or satisfied with? How likely are you to finish a particular project you start?**

I'm not involved in any creative activities or projects except for my senior design research project, which involves working with a team to build a web tool. I would like to develop our web tool to meet the minimum requirements set forth by our faculty advisor as well as a few of the ""reach"" goals that he's set for us. (Logistically, there is no way in hell we will be able to meet every single ""reach"" goal.) I would also like for our senior design team to place in the showcase competition at the end of the spring semester. I don't feel that proud of any of the activities that I've done in my life, because I wasn't excellent at any of them. The likelihood of me finishing a project depends. If it's just a little sideshow thing that I couldn't care all that much about and just wanted to play with to pass the time, it's whatever. But during the internship after my sophomore year, I essentially worked on a personal self-directed project for the company that involved me programming over the entire summer. I wasn't able to finish the application over the summer, so the company allowed me to work on it during my fall semester, as well as to return during winter break to complete and expand it. During winter, I ""expanded"" it, but didn't ""complete"" it, so I returned the following summer, ignoring other internship opportunities, out of a sense of obligation, after which I completed the project in the first week.

**11. What is your age, sex, and race?**

a80n6k,10,2018-12-20,I-Pace vs Model S vs Model X,triglavus,RealTesla,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/a80n6k/ipace_vs_model_s_vs_model_x/,"Hey guys, fan of Tesla and fan of facts.

Since I-Pace started selling,everyone was making comments on how it is detroying sales of Tesla and Model X (despite it being nowhere near the X specs size wise). There were few people pointing to end of quarter ships and pushes but people kept on posting registration numbers as if it was gospel.

https://imgur.com/VyDjr91

So looking at numbers from this month (so far) we can see that Tesla is overselling, more than 5x more Model X than I-Pace. We can also see that there seems to be continued drop in interest as well however with few more days we may see same level as November.

Overall I am a bit disappointed to come here from time to time. People jump on bandwagons to get as much negative shit on Tesla as possible. Stay with facts and promote relevant information to not end up in echo chamber. 

P.s.: What revelance has Boring Co. with Tesla? Why so many things are posted because of their reveal? Focus on Tesla, not on a startup full of interns."
a80son,45,2018-12-20,[Spoilers] In regards to The Green Lantern and continuity,GrayGhostt,DCcomics,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/a80son/spoilers_in_regards_to_the_green_lantern_and/,"The new Green Lantern run is really good with a lot to dig into, but there's been one recurring comment that pops up, which I wanted to discuss. The notion of Morrison 'ignoring continuity' for his run, which, considering his great body of work, seems quite an odd criticism to me. The bulk of it emerges from Morrison not following up the 2-page epilogue to Hal n Pals which feature Carol and Hal embracing, but there's an issue there. Morrison wrote his scripts way ahead of time and is currently working on #11 (the issue meant to come out September of 2019, which is crazy ahead of time for a monthly book), so what he wrote came in way ahead of time and was all done and set in stone before Hal n Pals' epilogue was ever even done.

Beyond that, Venditti himself is the writer that tore down the Carol/Hal relationship more than anyone else. Johns spent a great deal of time and effort bringing them together again and writing their dynamics and relationship wherever he could over the course of his 9-year tenure. Then Venditti tore it all down in his very first issue, after the beautiful Green Lantern #20 conclusion, with not even a second's hesitation. The justification given at the time for this was also, quite frankly, ridiculous. I'll quote it here for the sake of context.

&gt;N: So what are your feelings about Carol Ferris? In your first issue, you had Hal and Carol break up again. Is her relationship with Hal something you just see as being played out, or do you have plans for her?

&gt;RV: I think Carol is an amazing character, I love her, and I feel like what happened between her and Hal (Carol dumps him) in issue #21, **is just something that I feel like a woman who is as strong and commanding as her would do**. And just because her and Hal are on the outs at the present moment doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have a key role to play in all of the Green Lantern titles, and not just to Hal and the main Green Lantern book specifically.

Now having done this, his tenure also saw the fairly awful issue where Carol, who's still with Kyle, tells Hal that maybe they'll be together again, which is pretty not great, to say the least. Venditti not only ripped apart the work Johns did and tore down the relationship, but over the 85+ issues of GL he wrote, majority of, if not all, Carol moments revolve around or are tied to how Carol no longer loves Hal and does not wish to be with him. You can't break something that was earned over the course of years of storytelling like that, ignore it and then pretend it's all fine again in a 2-page epilogue. What about Carol? Where is she right now, emotionally? How does she feel? We're not given any of this as Carol's thrown aside and never really used, especially during the course of the Hal n Pals era. We get Soranik's poor turn, random new OC characters like Sarko get full arcs, but Carol gets nothing. What happened can't be 'fixed' via a 'I broke the toys, here they're kinda how I found them' 2 pager. You have to work for it, you have to build what was broken again. You have to put in the work. You have to earn it. It's why the criticism baffles me, since Venditti never did that work, he just utilized a fan service moment to mark the end of his era. They're not even together again, they see each other, embrace, kiss and that's it. That's not a relationship or them dating again. (This is all putting aside all the other various instances of throwing out continuity in his tenure, from blowing up everything in the Sinestro run, the true successor to Johns' GL, both figuratively and literally to regressing of Sinestro and more.)

Morrison read Venditti's stuff early on (which is how he came up with The Blackstars), as he re-read every issue of Green Lantern and all of Hal's stories, alongside every sci-fi DC collection he could get his hands on, to build his GL run. His run has had interns going through tons of old comics to get information on old, long lost characters and concepts. The guy is the champion of 'everything is canon' and is the guy that wrote Batman and Multiversity, the guy who used *Electric Blue Superman* in Rock of Ages, he's not the one to ignore continuity. His run picks up on a facet of Hal that even Johns' run stated quite [blatantly](https://i.imgur.com/D7v60ZJ.png) and having spoken to Sharp about the book, it's about a man that's very specifically been through the end of days in Johns' run and having seen all that the universe has to offer and exploring where this guy who's been good, bad, dead, everything you can ever be is right now and how he feels. It brought back Eve Doremus, the silver age love interest who loved Hal for Hal Jordan and not Green Lantern (in contrast to Carol), which is what Hal always deeply longed for. It's set to bring back all of his love interests and plans to examine Hal through his relationships. This is a run that cares deeply for continuity and history. It's evident when you see Morrison speak on it and Carol herself-

&gt;“He has a lot of women, Hal’s had a lot of girlfriends and female characters he’s connected with over the years, and we’re bringing them all back. **Carol Ferris is his one true love with sparks and fire**, but we wanted to bring back all these different women from his past. They all have different relationships with him, and they’re not all sexual relationships. Some have a problem with him, some really like him and their husbands hate him; we’re playing a lot more with this guy who appears in your life suddenly and now Green Lantern’s sleeping on your couch for the next week. What are you going to do with him?”

&gt;""We want to explore all of those relationships, and also all of Hal Jordan’s previous relationships in the book. So Tom Kalmaku’s in issue #3. We do see a little bit of the Justice League, but they’ve been beaten. They’ve only just been beaten and Hal’s come to save the day. And all of the female characters that have been in the book, we’re bringing all of them back, and they all have very different relationships with Hal, completely different approaches to him.

&gt;So, he’s surrounded by this constellation of people that, I think they love him more than he even knows, and he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t quite get it. But I want to build another picture of him from their point of view. We’re looking at all of his friends, all of his lovers, and bringing them all back, and using them as mirrors.""

Hal clearly has a journey here, as he starts off where he does. Carol is his true love but he also has this vast history with a myriad of characters with whom he has vastly different relationships and dynamics. We're not only getting to see Hal but the book is set to be about what Hal means to everybody else, from Oliver Queen, Tom Kalmaku to even Barry Allen (Barry's in Season 2). If Hal has to be with Carol again, it has to be earned, it can't just be a cheap 2 pager, it can't just not address Carol and how she's feeling and where she's at, we need all of that. A Hal that goes through a great journey while dealing with all his history and then has a heart to heart with his true love, where we learn his perspective, feels a lot more compelling to me and that's really what we, the fans, I feel, should get rather than a random epilogue. This is a run that loves and adores Hal's great and rich history, the team isn't actively ignoring it, it's adding to it and building on it. It's why we get Controller Mu and the Blackstars, a separatist sect that permits us to have 'Evil Darkstars' without having to make the Darkstars full on bad guys, as that's not what that concept is meant for and in the long run, it's not sustainable. It's why we get Evil Star, or Belzebeth, who is a mix of Legion of Super-Heroes mythology with GL mythology. It's how we get Volk!

P.S- Absolutely adore Venditti's X-O run and current Hawkman, love the dude and happy to see he's back at his best, especially with the latter."

Hal clearly has a journey here, as he starts off where he does. Carol is his true love but he also has this vast history with a myriad of characters with whom he has vastly different relationships and dynamics. We're not only getting to see Hal but the book is set to be about what Hal means to everybody else, from Oliver Queen, Tom Kalmaku to even Barry Allen (Barry's in Season 2). If Hal has to be with Carol again, it has to be earned, it can't just be a cheap 2 pager, it can't just not address Carol and how she's feeling and where she's at, we need all of that. A Hal that goes through a great journey while dealing with all his history and then has a heart to heart with his true love, where we learn his perspective, feels a lot more compelling to me and that's really what we, the fans, I feel, should get rather than a random epilogue. This is a run that loves and adores Hal's great and rich history, the team isn't actively ignoring it, it's adding to it and building on it. It's why we get Controller Mu and the Blackstars, a separatist sect that permits us to have 'Evil Darkstars' without having to make the Darkstars full on bad guys, as that's not what that concept is meant for and in the long run, it's not sustainable. It's why we get Evil Star, or Belzebeth, who is a mix of Legion of Super-Heroes mythology with GL mythology. It's how we get Volk!

P.S- Absolutely adore Venditti's X-O run and current Hawkman, love the dude and happy to see he's back at his best, especially with the latter."

So I recently checked my credit report as I'm in the process of an onboarding for an internship, and found a few things of worry. 

1) I'm in collections. I never received (or saw) a collections notice. Now I'm two months behind, and although I missed a couple of payments on my card, I'm now paying my bank monthly. This means I not only have the remaining amount on my card, but also the amount (with interest) from the debt collectors. How do I resolve this? 

2) There's an address on my report the doesn't match anywhere I've lived. 

3) I'm on two accounts with family members. These accounts have never been late, but hold balances of ~$1000 and ~$5000. Neither account is one that I use or buy anything (barring one $400 expense) with. I understand, looking at the balance that I need to speak with the other member on my account, but are these helping or hurting me at this time?



Finally, although I would prefer to pay off my card slowly, I am capable of doing so immediately. Will this greatly help me/my credit score/chances of getting hired? "

a823h7,2,2018-12-20,It seems that I may be depressed. Where do I start?,Sevek8,JordanPeterson,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/a823h7/it_seems_that_i_may_be_depressed_where_do_i_start/,"Hello Everyone, 

Some virgin bottom dweller lobster from Poland here. Having listened to a great number of podcast episodes and some lectures on Youtube, having read a few articles etc. It struck me that I may be depressed and that this depression could have started like 4 years ago after graduating from secondary school. Let me give some background information about me and the last 4 years from my chaotic life. I am right now 19. 

I had started college this academic year (October in Poland) and after a few weeks I resigned from attending and dropped out of it. This period of attending college was probably the darkest and the worst period of my entire life. 

First of all, I moved out of my family home which is located in the countryside, for the first time and started living on my own. I happened to live totally alone in a huge city (Top 5 Poland when it comes to residents) in a studio flat. The first 3 weeks were awesome living on my own. Nobody told me what to do etc. I attended every lecture, hit the gym after the lectures, kept the house clean etc. However, the first thing which was something that I couldn't understand and which caused some odd feeling (don't know how to describe it exactly) My family is let's say low middle-class, although my dad without even asking me or my mother rented the studio flat for me which was really expensive in comparison to my family's income. That was something that blows my mind a little bit. The relationship between my parents is also quite difficult and weird. My dad is that kind of person which seriously like being on his own, he is not very talkative. My mum conversely, she is chatty and she loves being around other people (our family mostly). My parents have been rarely having some long conversation with each other. I would say that me, their only child is something that could have prevented them from divorce or that has kept their marriage together for years. I would assume that my dad saw himself in me and decided to rent a studio flat for me because he would really enjoy living on his own. However, I am not like him. To be frank, I hate my dad's behaviour the vast majority of the time. He seems to not care about my mother and more focus on his own parents. They are our neighbours, he spends a great amount of his time in their home. Each day after his work the first thing he does is going for dinner to his mother and then for lunch. It seems that my father prefers to spend time with his own parents rather than with my mum and me. 

The next big thing that I wholeheartedly would like to avoid seeing my dad in my self. When it comes to it, for instance, family meetings or events my dad stays quiet not engaging in conversations and often ends being the target of the jokes. My dad is regarded by the family as someone who has wasted his potential let's assume. He used to be really good at maths and to be a great student in general, however, he ended his education very early - trade school. The family attributes it to my father's lack of social skills partly and to my father's parents not making him ambitious enough. I also have resigned from the college, so my family may have a similar opinion about me - not ambitious or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to the darkest 2 weeks on my life, to cut a long story short, I had a few typical symptoms for depression as far as I am concerned: 

\- I had like anxiety attacks. I was sitting, reading or writing something and then after a few seconds I was like: Why am I doing it? It doesn't make sense. This degree course sucks I won't finish it. F\*ck, my life is wasted. I will end having some dead-end job and being regarded like my father. I couldn't focus afterwards and the entire day was spoiled. 

\- I used to sleep 12-15hrs to minimize the amount of time during which I could think or suffer. 

\- I couldn't sleep at night, used to lay in the bed for 4-6hrs, “praying” to fall asleep. - I was that lazy that doing the laundry seemed to me as though it was the hardest thing in the world to do. 

\- ""Open doors"" as Jordan once said during his lecture. For example, I missed the train and it was like let me just kill myself. - Calls from my mother were something unbearable, ""What the hell they want from me? leave me alone, I don't want to speak with anybody.""

\- I gave up my hobby during that period of time - Working out at a gym. From the past, I know that when I had to quit the gym for a while (Surgery) I felt also terrible. 

\- I didn't leave my home during that 2 weeks apart from groceries. 

\- Binge Eating Disorder - that's my way of ""dealing with stress"". Eating a great number of carbs from cookies etc, hitting like 10k calories a day, what results in feeling like a crap physically and mentally (It hurt my physique)

What struck me most was the fact that the idea of killing my self occurred to me once. Then I watched Jocko Willink Podcast with Tim Ferriss, where Tim talked to Jocko about his attempt on suicide and give background information what provoked him to such a decision about killing himself. To cut a long story short, what made Tim considering killing himself was an unfortunate situation in college - writing a thesis. He decided to take a one year break from college and ""repair"" his mind. This podcast episode had a great impact on me. I started considering everything and I made my mind about quitting college. I would rather kill myself than finish my degree course, it wasn't interesting to me. (Engineering Management degree course with English as an instructional language). Taking into consideration that I was left alone on my own, all my friends and parents were far away from me and I had always struggled with making new friends. It wouldn't end well. 

I had a frank conversation with my parents, they agreed about me quitting from college. I have returned to my homeland. It's much better now, I am calmer and less chaotic. I really want to get some further education, not end with some dead-end job in my local area. In order to do that I have to fix my mind and become stable during this one year off. 

&amp;#x200B;

It worth mentioning here that I am an only child and I know that I am spoiled. I have always struggled with taking responsibility too. I have just read the first chapter from ""12 rules for life"" and I would call my self-sacrificing and exploitable. It seems that I have been raised poorly by my parents or maybe it's just me blaming others for my shitty character. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of two things that have been destroying me for 4 years is a simple question: ""What to do with my life?"". I have followed my peers from class when it came to choosing a high school. It turned out to be a quite good choice. When it came to choosing college and degree course I've missed my shot this year but I have a choice next year. However, I am frightened and anxious that I will miss one more time. I can't find one thing that really interests me. I am certain that I would love to study in English, not in my native Polish language. Listening to someone in polish language has stopped being interesting to me. And another problem occurs here: Degree Courses in Poland with English as an instructional language are either too expensive or when it comes to tuition-free courses the choice is very limited. I hope that I will figure something out during that year. 

The second thing is the overwhelming feeling of isolation and not being able to find a true buddy, let alone become in a relationship with a girlfriend. I have a lot of friends and I have also close relationships with some of them, but something seems to be wrong to me though. Don't know what, maybe it's just my unrealistic expectations about friendship, dunno. I am probably an introvert. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to plans for upcoming months: 

\- I secure the paid internship as an office worker. January - March 

\- I' ve started preparing for CPE examination. It's my dream to got C2 in English. Learning English seriously gives me a lot of satisfaction and joy. -

 I am starting therapy with a psychologist. 27th of December is my first visit. I have doubts whether it would not be better to go to some psychiatrist and try SSRI's therapy.

\- I have started visiting an orthopedist. I have my ligament torn. It also destroys me inside. I am a sports guy and this injury prevents me from playing basketball, which I loved before the injury. I would also like to try martial arts, but the injury makes it impossible. I had 2 surgeries on my knee, however, they turned out to be worthless, since the reconstructed ligament has broken unluckily. I need to have another 2 surgeries on my knee and rehabilitation of course then, but I hope to have both of them during that break. 

\- Figure out what to study next academic year I would like to achieve something, do something good in my life for other people and avoid seeing my dad in me. However, without ""cleaning my mind"" I know that's impossible. Where do I start? 

From my latest experience 20% of the time I can stay focused, productive, talky, funny. Make other people laugh. I love myself functioning like that. On the surface, the majority of the time, I wake up without any motivation, feeling like sh\*t, like I can't achieve anything. If I could function the vast majority like during that 20% of the time, oh man That would be awesome! I've not watched Jordan's lectures on YT and only started reading 12 rules for life. I hope to start watching it and drinking in knowledge and wisdom. Having read a few posts on Reddit, I've started considering trying SSRI's treatment. Nevertheless, I would prefer not to be depended on some drugs to function in my life, though if it is necessary for me. I would be thankful for any advice: What to read? What to do? What with SSRI's treatment? "
a827e1,32,2018-12-20,"Can't pay Navient even on Rate Reduction Program...they flat out told me ""they can't do anything about it."" How to prepare for battle?",nerfaccount4reddit,studentloandefaulters,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentloandefaulters/comments/a827e1/cant_pay_navient_even_on_rate_reduction/,"So some quick backstory (skip below  for my questions):

These are all private Signature loans from like 2002-2008. I went back to school after a year off and went through a masters and doctorate and currently working on getting supervisory hours/requirements meant to be licensed in my state for my profession.

About 1 year left into my doctoral program they decided to put these loans into repayment stating I used up the max in school deferment (no where on my promissory notes is this ""amount of months"" listed). It's listed on other ones for newer loans I don't have any of but not mine. They fought me endlessly on it and finally agreed to an internship 1 year defer as I was going on internship.

Went on internship, year passed, they asked for money again. I said I'm still in school and will graduate in like 6 months.  I pointed out my federal loans are eligible for longer deferment as I am a health care related professional and field of study and they said they don't agree my field is healthcare.

They gave me one month forbearance and refused any more. They eventually agreed to a Rate Reduction Program which sounds great, 1% interest and third of the payment for a few months. I had already filed complaints with state attorney general who is involved in a lawsuit against Navient currently anyways.

I pay a few months on this plan but realize it's not sustainable and with fed loans coming due soon as well as other bills I can't afford the payment.  I call them up and they outright refuse to go any lower or to work with me. 

They actually had the balls to tell me to ""maybe find a better job or ask friends and family for money."" I asked them on the record if they were aware of the current lawsuit in my state against them, they changed the subject. I asked them if they just refuse to work with people when other lenders will, they stated they ""don't have to."" I told them again this whole issue arose because they insisted, incorrectly , the loans needed to go into full repayment when I was in school, they simply replied ""we can file a complaint on your behalf  but we can't change the amount, either cancel the payment plan and pay the normal rate (which changed about 3 times during the call), ""pay what you can and hope for the best,"" or keep paying the current rate. There are also no co-signers on any debts or loans I hold including these. 

I pointed out that the very state lawsuits are about this very issue (misleading borrowers, giving incorrect information, changing terms without express notice, guiding borrowers into worse plans, etc) and they just said ""well we understand your anger and frustration but we can not offer any options to you.""

So here we are, the next payment is due in like 2 weeks and it's on auto debit. I didn't cancel it yet but know I can't afford it after another payment or so, in 3 months I'm eligible to ""pay more but still reduced on another plan"" but I doubt I can afford that long term either. Maybe in a year or two, but not now. The damn loans shouldn't even be in repayment but they insisted and lied and here we are. They are six figure debts (amazing how like 50K in private loans can magically become over $170K in under a decade).

SO MY QUESTIONS:

Do I just stop paying them if they refuse to work with me at all?

Or Do I just pay them like $100 a month or whatever to keep some money flowing to them?

If I stop paying how do I:

\- stop them from attempting to call/harass my work and family?

\- stop them from pulling money from my account?

\- do I need to demand verification of debt (i see my loan was sold at least 3 times over the past decade which is odd since it was and still is their loan)?

\- I intend to keep paying all my other debts (ironically credit card companies have worked with me no problem over the years), so how bad will this private loan not being paid fuck me over? I intend to work out IBR with federal loans and I intend to work with credit cards as I've been doing to continue paying those debts. I also intend to start funding my retirement and savings.

\- What are the chances I get sued before SOL ends especially being in a state that is actively suing them over these very issues?

\- Should I just stop paying and revisit it later when I can pay?

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps I'm in a VERY debtor friendly state: The SOL are 4 years from date of last payment. They can not garnish wages or taxes without a judgement and even with a judgement it's capped to 15% of disposable income.  They also forbid license suspension for non payment of loans.

The state attorney general is currently in a lawsuit with them and suing them over these issues AND I was already previously in contact with the state AG AND Navient knows this and had already been ordered to submit documents to them. So would they even bother trying to chase down these six figure losses or just wait it out and see if I can settle later? They know I've complained about them and they know I know about the lawsuit.

I appreciate any tips and input. As much as I want to say fuck them, I also want to make sure I'm minimizing the impact on my daily life from them. I mean I literally called to say ""I can't pay let's work something out until I can and they just outright refuse."" I feel like I""m getting fucked for trying to do the right thing her; it's an amount that down the line I could manage and fiscally it's a good deal but I can't now or not for a while so what would you do?"

a82xtc,14,2018-12-20,Interesting details and theories regarding the MCU,Ikeblueflames,MCUTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/a82xtc/interesting_details_and_theories_regarding_the_mcu/,"Interesting details I've noticed in the MCU. (TV shows and One Shots/Web series included)

I've been a big fan of the MCU since the beginning (well, almost the beginning, my first MCU movie was The Incredible Hulk) and I've watched every Movie, TV show, One Shot and Web/Digital series (even read the prelude comics) and I've noticed some details that I find quite interesting. I'm sure some of these have probably been pointed out before, but I figured I'd list things that I don't see too many people talk about.

This list is quite long, with almost 20 different topics, and I've tried to keep each topic as separate from one another as I can. So if you didn't have time to read the whole thing, you could just skim through and pick a topic that you find interesting.

Just note, I will be taking from a deleted scene that may or may not be 100% canon and from things that aren't explicitly stated, and I will be doing a fair amount of theorizing.
Also, I'm not saying the things I list are canon and some will probably fall into the realm of head-canon. Nevertheless, I wanted to share these things with fellow MCU fans and if anybody has anything they wish to point out or add something of their own to the list, feel free to do so.

Spoiler Alert: 
I will put the movies, TV shows and One Shots pertaining to each topic, above said topic, in parentheses; in case someone isn't caught up and doesn't want to read in fear of getting spoiled. (Most things listed aren't major spoilers, but rather, minor details or interesting connections.)

(Captain America: The First Avenger, The Incredible Hulk, The Avengers)

1. The Red Skull ""saves"" Captain America from the ice.

Dr. Erskine created the Super Soldier Serum which wasn't perfected when the Red Skull was injected with it. After Erskine perfected the serum and was going to use it on Steve Rodgers, the Red Skull sent a Hydra spy to kill Dr. Erskine. With Erskine dead, there would be no one capable of replicating the serum. Cap defeated the Red Skull and crashed the Hydra plane somewhere near the Arctic, getting frozen in the ice for 70 years. During this time, the military had tried to replicate the serum and failed. Bruce Banner was tasked with recreating it, but something went wrong and the Hulk was born as a result. There is a deleted scene for The Incredible Hulk that was initially supposed to be the opening for the movie where Bruce hitches a ride out to the Arctic somewhere. He tried shooting himself, but he Hulked out instead, which caused the ice to break apart. In the scene you can see a vague image as the ice is breaking apart, that was meant to be Captain America. In the opening to the first Captain America movie, the ""guys from Washington"" (S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents) asked one of the guys that found the Hydra plane, ""How come noboby spotted it before?"" to which he responded, ""Really not that surprising, this landscape's changing all the time"". I believe that Bruce Hulking out is what caused the ice to break away and uncover the Hydra plane. I know it's a deleted scene and I know the scene ""shows"" Cap's body in the ice, rather than the plane. But I look at it like this, the image of Cap's body is more so a placeholder for where the plane was, rather than it literally being Cap's body. Just a nice visual easter egg. If they showed a piece of the plane there instead, it might would be harder to make out what it was. Also, in regards to if this deleted scene is canon or not, in The Avengers, Bruce mentioned a scene very similar to this one when he said, ""In case you needed to kill me? But you can't, I know, I tried... I got low, I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out."" 

So in short, the Red Skull had Erskine killed, no one else could replicate the serum, which lead to Bruce becoming the Hulk and trying to kill himself, which ultimately, lead to Cap being found.

(Daredevil seaons 1-3, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. seasons 1-4, The Punisher season 1)

2. Matt Murdock and Daisy Johnson connections.

Matt and Daisy both grow up in the same orphanage. In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D it's revealed that Daisy grew up in Saint Agnes Orphanage and in one episode she mentions she had a few nuns around her growing up and mentioned a ""Sister McKenna"". In Daredevil Saint Agnes Orphanage is featured quite a bit. (especially in season 3) And Saint Agnes is neither a real world orphanage or from the comics, (at least not that I could find) which means this was done purposefully. Another thing Matt and Daisy have in common is their connection to The Punisher. Obviously, Matt has a direct connection since he not only knows The Punisher, but has fought him multiple times. Daisy on the other hand, has a more subtle connection. In S2:E7 of S.H.I.E.L.D, Daisy mentions one of her sources is a guy named Micro, and he's a ""crime-scene junkie"". This was back in 2014 so it was before The Punisher season 1 (2017, which was the first time we actually get to meet David Lieberman A.K.A. Micro) and even before Daredevil season 2, (2016, which had a reference to Micro) but it's a nice connection. And I find it interesting that the first reference we get to Micro in Daredevil was when Frank went home and got the CD with ""Mirco"" written on it and then in The Punisher, we find out that the CD had video evidence of the torturing/killing that Agent Orange had done/ordered. A.K.A., a ""crime-scene"", so it falls in line with what S.H.I.E.L.D. had set up. Another interesting detail is that both Matt and Daisy have encountered the biker gang called ""The Dogs of Hell"". Albeit, for Daisy this was an indirect encounter, since it was her teammates that encountered them out in the field rather than her physically encountering them. Still, she was part of the team and part of the mission, just not on the field (at this point she wasn't a trained field agent). While Matt on the other hand, had a lengthy fight with multiple members of the Dogs of Hell. This is a fictional biker gang that's not from the comics, so again, this was done purposefully. (Side note: I find it kind of funny that both Lady Sif and The Punisher have fought, or killed, members of the same biker gang.) A few more similarities between Matt and Daisy that I noticed:
Matt had the ""you don't get to decide who lives and dies"" speech with The Punisher and Daisy had a very similar speech with Ghost Rider. 
Both Matt and Daisy had a point where they felt they need to be ""punished"" and both of them pushed their friends away in order to not ""lose"" them. 
And both of them had a prison riot they had to fight their way out of. 
(They also have had one take, long shot, fight scenes.)

Maybe them both being raised in the same orphanage is the cause of some of their similarities? Both Matt and Daisy are around the age of 30, is it possible they met as kids? Matt went in the orphanage around age 9 and Daisy was taken there as a baby. Daisy mentioned going from foster home to foster home, but I don't believe an age was given or how old she was when she left the orphanage. Maybe Daisy knows Matt's mom?

3. Hammer Tech in Luke Cage

Both seasons of Luke Cage have featured Hammer Tech, and the most prominent piece of tech was the Judas bullet. Shades introduced this bullet to Cottonmouth saying it was Hammer tech made from Chitauri metal.
At the end of Iron Man 2, Justin Hammer is taken into custody and in the One Shot, All Hail The King, we see Hammer make a cameo appearance in prison. All Hail The King takes place in 2013 and is set in Seagate Prison. Luke Cage was sent to Seagate Prison in 2013 where he met Shades. What if Shades made connections with Hammer while he was at Seagate and that's why he has access to high-end Hammer tech.
Also, in Iron Man 2, Hammer was trying to compete with Stark with his suits. What if Diamondback's Hammer suit was one of the results of Hammer trying to compete with Stark.


(All Hail The King, Daredevil seasons 1-3)

4. Melvin Potter at Seagate?

This one is a bit of a stretch, but I just find it funny, so I'll share it anyway.

 The actor who plays Melvin Potter in Daredevil also has a small part in the One Shot, All Hail The King as ""White Power Dave"". Melvin used to be a criminal and has anger issues, and White Power Dave also has anger issues. What if when Melvin was in prison he got the name ""White Power Dave"", but after he met Betsy he changed his ways and changed his name.... Maybe?
Again, I'm not being too serious, I just find it funny and would mean Matt has two friends from Seagate. (Luke and Melvin)

5. Everyone speaks English in space?

I know this has been a topic and something people have questioned, ""How does everyone in the MCU know English?"" And the easy answer is ""audience convenience"", but I think there is in-universe explanations.

 In Guardians of the Galaxy on Peter Quill's rap sheet, it says he has a translator implant in his neck and James Gunn has confirmed that the translators work both ways. Meaning it translates language that Peter hears and it translates his language when he speaks. So how many people in the universe have translators? I would imagine people like the Ravagers would since there's more than one species among them (Quill was a Ravager himself). I would also imagine most Xandarians would, since their homeworld has a lot of different races and species.
 Another explanation would be the Asgardians spreading the English language throughout the universe (kind of like how in the real world, English is one of the most dominant languages). In the comics Asgardians have ""Allspeak"" which allows them to understand and speak any language. However, I don't believe this to be the case in the MCU, as in Infinity War, when Groot is speaking and Thor understands him, Rocket asks Thor about him speaking Groot and Thor says they taught it on Asgard.
I believe the English language was passed down to Earth from Asgardians. In the first Thor movie, the opening shows Tonsberg, Norway in 965 A.D. when it was attacked by Frost Giants, then Odin and his forces stepped in to save the people. We later see in the first Captain America movie, the Red Skull went to Tonsberg, Norway in 1945 to find the Tesseract and he says it was the jewel of Odin's treasure room. I believe after the battle in 965 A.D., Odin may have helped the Norwegian people rebuild and taught them English (or what we now know as English), and may have also provided them with the Tesseract in order to help defend themselves against future attacks. This would have been after Odin and Hela conquered the Nine Realms and Odin was trying to right his wrongs.

I know this doesn't line up with real world history, but the MCU has it's own history and explainations that often don't match the real world.

(Thor, Thor Ragnarok, Avengers Infinity War)

6. Odin's Infinity Gauntlet

In the first Thor movie you can briefly see an Infinity Gauntlet in Odin's treasure room and then later in Ragnarok, they point it out again by having Hela calm it to be fake and push it over. In Infinity War we see that Eitri made the Gauntlet for Thanos. But why would Odin have a fake if the Gauntlet didn't exist until then? Well, Kevin Feige explained why Odin had a fake Gauntlet by stating, it was so the Asgardians wouldn't question Odin's ability to protect them, knowing there was a power out there that could wipe them out. Basically, Odin was saying ""Don't worry guys, I have this powerful weapon safe in my vault"". I also wonder if Odin used it as a scare tactic when conquering the Nine Realms with Hela? 
The other question would be, if Odin had a fake, doesn't that mean a real Gauntlet existed beforehand? I believe there was a real Gauntlet and the threat of such a weapon is the reason the Infinity Stones were scattered and hidden. Odin knew of this and decided to make a fake to keep his people at ease, and then later, Thanos decided to gather all of the Infinity Stones and forced Eitri to reforge a new Gauntlet.

Side note for those who don't know. The Gauntlet in Odin's vault is right handed and Thanos' is left handed. 

(Dr. Strange, Thor)

7. Odin's trade with Agamotto

In Dr. Strange, we are introduced to The Eye of Agamotto, and within it houses the Time Stone. We are told that Agamotto is the father of the Mystic Arts and that the Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerer Supremes going back thousands years. We don't know exactly how many thousands of years they go back, so we don't know when Agamotto would have been alive or how long he lived. But we know Asgardians live roughly 5000 years and in Odin's treasure vault you can see (what appears to be) The Orb of Agamotto. Wong states that Agamotto created the Eye, but where did he get the Infinity Stone inside of it? What if Odin knew of Agamotto and knew he would be capable of safeguarding the Time Stone? Maybe Odin traded the Time Stone for The Orb of Agamotto so that Agamotto could better protect the Earth from mystical threats. In return, Odin got to keep the Orb to insure a power balance and it was another way to help right his wrongs.

8. How many Infinity Stones were on Earth?

I've seen a good number of people say that a lot of the Infinity Stones were hidden on Earth (the Space Stone, the Time Stone, the Mind Stone and even the Reality Stone. Which would mean 4 of the 6 stones were hidden on Earth.) and that it wouldn't make much sense to do that. Where these stones were initially hidden and where they ended up by the time of Infinity War varies quite a bit. 

The Space Stone (Tesseract) was hidden on Earth in Norway, presumably by Odin, but it's unknown where Odin got it from, and it ended up on Asgard where Loki then took it. 

The Power Stone (Orb) was hidden in a submerged temple on Morag, later it was taken to the Nova Corp. on Xandar. 

The Time Stone (Eye of Agamotto) was kept safe initially by Agamotto on Earth, it's also unknown where Agamotto got the stone from, but it was then passed down to Dr. Strange. 

The Reality Stone (Aether) was in Malekith's possession and it is unknown where he obtained the stone, Bor then took the Stone and hid it in an unknown location, later it ended up being given to The Collector on Knowhere. 

The Mind Stone (Loki's Scepter) was given to Loki by Thanos, it's unknown where Thanos obtained the Scepter, but the Stone ended up helping to create Vision and is in his forehead on Earth. 

And finally, the Soul Stone was hidden on Vormir. 

So, from what we know, only 2 stones started off on Earth (The Space Stone and the Time Stone) and by the time of Infinity War, only 2 were left on Earth. (The Mind Stone and the Time Stone) Some people make the mistake of thinking the Aether was on Earth because Jane found it while she was on Earth, but Jane wasn't on Earth when she found it, she was pulled into a portal which lead to another realm.

(Iron Man 3, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 1, Thor Ragnarok)

9. Man-Thing

In the comics Man-Thing was a biochemistry professor by the name of Theodore ""Ted"" Sallis who was married to Ellen Brandt. 
Ellen Brandt was the red head woman with the face scar in Iron Man 3 who was an A.I.M. Extremis soldier. In the comics, Man-Thing gives her that scar after she betrayed him to A.I.M. 
In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. after Hydra had begun to dismantle S.H.I.E.L.D. and their facilities, Maria Hill is on the phone with Pepper saying she spoke to Congress about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ""implosion"" and they asked her ""Who or what is a Man-Thing?"". Meaning that S.H.I.E.L.D. was keeping Man-Thing in one of their facilities and when Hydra attacked, he got free. 
Then in Thor Ragnarok, we see Man-Thing's face sculpted on the Grandmaster's Contest of Champians palace. 

All of this could just be nice little easter eggs for Man-Thing, but I like to think they're more than that. Maybe sometime before Iron Man 3 Ted becomes Man-Thing, scars Ellen Brandt, gets taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D., then escapes when Hydra attacks, somehow gets stranded on Sakaar and becomes one of the champions. (Maybe he finds one of Loki's secret portals that he uses to get from realm to realm in order to make his way to Sakaar?)

(Iron Man 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier)

10. Why S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't help in Iron Man 3

In Iron Man 3 a lot of people have wondered why S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't help Stark at the end of the movie, when Aldrich Killian had abducted President Ellis and planned to kill him. 
In the movie, Killian does this so he can put the Vice President in charge because he works for him. So Iron Man 3 gives one reason why S.H.I.E.L.D. couldn't get involved, (Killian has the Vice President in his pocket) but there's a better reason why S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't get involved given in The Winter Soldier.
In The Winter Soldier it's revealed that Hydra has been inside S.H.I.E.L.D. the whole time, and at the end of the movie when the Helicarriers are setting their sights on Project Insights' targets, we see that both Stark and President Ellis are among their targets. So during Iron Man 3, it would have been a perfect opportunity to cross two of their highest targets off their list if Killian succeeded. I'm sure Alexander Pierce could come up with some ""logistical"" reason why they couldn't help.

(Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 1, Thor Ragnarok)

11. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ""Ghost"" in Thor Ragnarok?

Now this one is not meant to be taken seriously, it's more of a ""Haha that'd be funny"" kind of thing. 

In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. S1:E9 there's a guy named Tobias Ford, and due to a Particle Accelerator explosion, he got stuck in-between 2 worlds, our dimension and one he describes as ""hell"". Being trapped between these 2 worlds gives him ""ghost-like"" powers, teleporting between both worlds. By the end of the episode Agent May convinces Tobias to let go of Hannah (the woman he had a crush on and was trying to protect throughout the episode) and he let go of his connection to this world, leaving him trapped in ""hell"". What if ""hell"" was actually Muspelheim? (Surtur's realm in Thor Ragnarok) In the episode Jemma pulls up a hologram of the world Tobias was tied to and it has a resemblance to Muspelheim.
In the beginning of Thor Ragnarok, Thor is in a cage with what looks like a human skeleton... After Tobias got trapped in ""hell"" did it turn out to be Muspelheim, and Surtur found him and locked him in a cage until he died?

12. Roxxon and Darkforce/Zero Matter 

Roxxon has been (mostly) in the background in a lot of the MCU, but it's been featured in some capacity quite regularly and in a lot of different Marvel properties. (Iron Man 1, 2 and 3, Agent Carter, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, Daredevil, Iron Fist (mentioned), Cloak and Dagger, and the One Shot, A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to Thor's Hammer)  Darkforce (originally known as Zero Matter) hasn't been featured as heavily, but has made appearances from time to time, especially in Agent Carter season 2 and Cloak and Dagger season 1. 

Chronologically speaking, we first see Roxxon in Agent Carter, and we met Hugh Jones, who is the head of the Roxxon Corporation. In Agent Carter season 2 we learn that sometime after WWII (1945), Isodyne Energy had done an Atomic Bomb test that lead to them discovering Darkforce. This discovery was brought to the attention of The Council of Nine (a secret group of business men and politicians trying to shape history in their favor).
Calvin Chadwick, head of Isodyne Energy, was a member of the Council, along with Hugh Jones (Head of Roxxon).
In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. we learn that in 1956 Roxxon had taken over ownership of Isodyne and all of it's assets.
In Cloak and Dagger a Roxxon oil rig, in New Orleans, exploded in 2007 and we learn that they were drilling for a substance that burns 10 times faster than oil (Darkforce/Lightforce). Later in Cloak and Dagger we find out that exposure to this substance causes humans to go crazy because their adrenaline has been turned to 11 (they're referred to as Terrors).
In Daredevil, Matt and Foggy were interns for Landman and Zack (it's a flashback set sometime around 2010) and were doing a case for Roxxon against a former employee who claimed to have gotten sick from working at their plant in Londonderry, New Hampshire.
And finally, In Iron Man 3, the Roxxon oil tanker Norco, spilled a million gallons of oil off the coast of Pensacola in 2010.

Is all of this connected? I believe it all lines up: Isodyne discoveres Darkforce in 1945, Roxxon takes control of Isodyne and their assets in 1956, Roxxon uses their business in oil as a cover up for mining Darkforce, which leads to one of their rigs exploding in 2007, it causes their workers to get sick in 2010, leads to the Norco spilling millions of gallons of oil in 2010, and finally, causes an outbreak of Terrors in New Orleans, in 2015 (Cloak and Dagger is set sometime in 2015).

Also, the MCU TV shows have had a hand full of characters that use Darkforce, in some way, as part of their power set.

(Daredevil season 1 and 3, Spider-man: Homecoming)

12.5. Morales in Daredevil

Since I mentioned the Landman and Zack flashback scene in Daredevil, I thought I'd include this extra detail. 

During the flashback, Matt and Foggy have a conversation about whether they should work for Landman and Zack or not, and Foggy starts the conversation by telling Matt ""I just bumped into Morales. Guess what he heard? They're gonna offer us the job."". 
In Homecoming, we are introduced to Aaron Davis (played by Donald Glover), who tells Spider-Man that he has a nephew who lives in Queens, and in the comics, Aaron Davis is Miles Morales' uncle.
Could the Morales in Daredevil be a relative to Miles? Daredevil and Spider-Man are both set in New York and both have mentioned or had ties to a Morales.
Also, in Daredevil season 3 there is a poster in Fogwell's Gym that shows two boxers named ""Parker"" and ""Morales"" (""Parker"" is Caucasian and ""Morales"" is African American). This is likely nothing more than a reference to both Peter Parker and Miles Morales, but it's still interesting that Daredevil has mentioned a ""Morales"" more than once.

(Agent Carter One Shot, Agent Carter seasons 1-2)

13. When is the Agent Carter One Shot set?

Some have wondered when the One Shot takes place. Does it take place before or after the show? Does the series retcon it? I believe it takes place in-between seasons 1 and 2.
It starts by saying ""One year later"" after giving a brief flashback of the end of Captain America: The First Avenger. Captain America ended in 1945 (not counting the present day stuff at the end) meaning the One Shot takes place in 1946. But the first season of Agent Carter also takes place in 1946, so when does this fit in? At the end of the first season, the S.S.R. office building gets damaged during an explosion, and in the One Shot, Peggy is working from a similar, but different, S.S.R. office. No one from season 1 (or 2) aside from Peggy, that worked in the S.S.R. office from the show, is in the One Shot.
I believe, after their office building was damaged, Agents were sent to other S.S.R. buildings until theirs got repaired. In season 2 (which takes place in 1947), Daniel Sousa has been stationed at an L.A. office and said he's been there for 6 months, meaning it's at least been 6 months from season 1 to 2. In the One Shot, Peggy says ""it's been three months now and I've yet to be sent on my first assignment"" and she said her expertise was in the field, also that code breaking came easy to her (they had her code breaking instead of giving her field assignments).
In season 1, they needed to break a code and Peggy was the only one capable of doing it, so that was when the S.S.R. first realized her potential as a code breaker.
Also, by the end of the season, Jack Thompson took credit for everything that Peggy had done, and that's probably why in the One Shot, they had her as a code breaker, rather than a field agent.

Two more details that would place the One Shot in-between seasons: 
1. At the end of Captain America: The First Avenger, Peggy was given Steve's file and in the file was a picture of him. That file is seen in season 1 and the picture is still in it.
In the One Shot, Peggy has that picture framed. Meaning, unless she took the picture out of the frame and placed it back in the file, the One Shot takes place after the first season.
2. At the end of the One Shot, Howard Stark and Dum Dum Dugan are sitting at a pool and two women are talking. Howard notices Dugan starring at them and he informs Dugan that the women are wearing a bikini. Which then Dugan askes, if Howard invented it, and Howard says the French did. In real life, a French man by the name Louis Réard, invented the bikini in 1946.
In season 2 of Agent Carter, which takes place in 1947, we see women wearing bikinis. Meaning season 2 takes place after the One Shot.

(The Avengers, Agent Carter seasons 1-2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Spider-Man: Homecoming)

14. Peggy and/or Sousa's grandson in The Avengers?

It's unknown who Peggy's husband was, but Agent Carter ended with Daniel Sousa being a strong possibility. The show itself developed the two of them where you could see it likely they would settle down together. But information outside the show also increases that likelihood.

In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Steve watches an old video of Peggy during 1953 (6 years after the events in Agent Carter season 2) and Peggy mentions that Captain America saved the man, that would one day, become her husband (not directly saved him, but his actions saved the lives of thousands that had been trapped behind enemy lines for months, and her husband was one of them).
Sousa fought in WWII and injured his leg, and because of this, he has to use a crutch.
When Steve goes to visit Peggy in present day, we can see two pictures on her table, one of her and two young children, one girl and one boy (presumably her kids), the other is Peggy with, what looks to be, an even younger child (a girl, I think?). Peggy looks to be roughly the same age in both of those pictures and the 1953 video Steve watched, so I'm assuming it's around the same time frame (But who knows? Some people can look the same within a ten year time frame).
What I'm getting at, is that Peggy may would have had kids around the time of the 1953 video, meaning that doesn't leave much time after Agent Carter ended for her to met someone, and that someone had to have fought in WWII, fall in love, get married, and (presumably) have kids. So I'm thinking Daniel Sousa is the safe bet.

Anyway, with all that out of the way, this theory actually doesn't NEED Peggy and Sousa to have ended up together, I just think it works better.
In The Avengers, the actor that plays Sousa also plays a New York cop, one of the ones Cap gives orders to. His badge says his name is Saunders, and obviously, this was before the actor was cast as Daniel Sousa in Agent Carter, but I believe this could be Peggy and Sousa's grandchild.
When Cap jumps in and starts giving orders, Saunders looks amazed, while the other cop (whose name is Silva) just looks confused and even asks ""why the hell should I take orders from you?"".
This takes place in New York, and both Peggy and Sousa live in New York, (they only went to L.A. in season 2 because they were assigned) even in the 1953 video, it says it was filmed in New York.
What if Saunders grew up with stories of Captain America and that's why he looked amazed and didn't question him.
Also, what if he wanted to be a cop, either because of Cap, or because his grandparents were agents. This likely wasn't the intention behind this, they probably just wanted two cops to have different reactions to seeing Cap (one being amazed/stunned and the other being confused/annoyed), but since then, they did something similar to this theory.
In Spider-Man: Homecoming, they had the same actor that played Jim Morita (a Howling Commando in the first Captain America), come back to play Peter's principal. You can see behind the principal a picture of his grandfather, Jim Morita, so maybe the same thing applies with Saunders?

(Spider-Man: Homecoming, The Incredible Hulk, Avengers: Age of Ultron)

15. Mr. Harrington in The Incredible Hulk?

In Spider-Man: Homecoming, Peter's science teacher is Mr. Harrington, played by Martin Starr, and in The Incredible Hulk, Martin Starr has a small appearance as a character simply credited as ""Computer Nerd"".
In the book adaptation of The Incredible Hulk, this character is referred to as ""Amadues Cho"". But considering the book is not considered canon and Amadeus Cho's mom is in Age of Ultron (Dr. Helen Cho, played by Claudia Kim), I believe this was just the book's way of including another comic book easter egg.
(Also, the fact that Claudia Kim was born in 1985 and Martin Starr was born in 1982, leaving just a 3 year age difference.. I don't think they're mother and son.)

I believe, since The Incredible Hulk takes place in 2009 (no later than 2010) and Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place in 2016, that gives a good 6 year gap in-between movies. Where I believe, Mr. Harrington was the ""Computer Nerd"", then later went on to become Peter's science teacher. 

(Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 5, The Incredible Hulk, Daredevil season 2, Stan Lee cameos)

16. Qovas was in The Incredible Hulk?

If you've read some of the other points on this list, you'll have noticed I've brought up the ""this actor plays 2 characters in the MCU, therefore, it must mean a connection!"" thing.
But I want to clarify, I only try to make these connections when I believe there is enough evidence to make a case for it (or if I just find it funny).
There are a good amount of actors that have had multiple roles in the MCU, whose characters clearly have no relation, such as; 

Alfre Woodard: Mariah from Luke Cage, Miriam from Civil war.

Tony Curran: Bor from Thor: The Dark World, Finn from Daredevil.

Clancy Brown: The Blacksmith from Daredevil, Surtur from Ragnarok.

Miles Mussenden: Park Ranger from Homecoming, Otis Johnson from Cloak and Dagger.

Anyway, on to the topic at hand. In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. we are introduced to the Confederacy and one of their members, Qovas, played by Peter Mensah.
In The Incredible Hulk, Peter Mensah also has a small role as General Joseph ""Joe"" Greller. General Greller is the one who assembled General Ross' strike team in order to capture Bruce Banner, and he was also the one who placed Emil Blonsky under Ross' command.
After the Battle of New York (The Avengers), Hydra used a transceiver from a Chitauri aircraft to make contact with the Confederacy. The Confederacy promised protection in exchange for Gravitonium and Inhumans, General Hale was tasked with this goal by Qovas himself.
What if Qovas had come to Earth previously under the disguise of General Greller? Kind of like Stan Lee as the Watcher Informant, he goes to Earth many times, under a new disguise every time, and reports back to the Watchers (I know it's just a nice way to make all of his cameos tied to one character). Maybe he assisted Ross in capturing Banner because he wanted the Hulk for the Confederacy.
Qovas was using another General (General Hale) in trying to obtain powerful tools for the Confederacy (Gravitonium and Inhumans), maybe when Ross failed to capture the Hulk, Qovas sought other means of obtaining power. 

Another interesting detail, is that in the comics, General Ross and General Talbot have a close connection to one another (they work together and Ross was even Talbot's Father-in-law at one point), and Qovas (General Greller) worked with Ross and later, Qovas worked under Talbot (after Talbot became Graviton).

I'm not saying things like this are canon, I just find the connections interesting to think about.

(The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Avengers: Infinity War)

17. Tony doesn't plan

I'm not saying Tony never plans, it just doesn't seem like planning out strategies is his go to option.

In The Avengers, when Thor comes and takes Loki from the Quinn Jet, Tony's first instinct is to go after him. Cap tells him to wait and that they need a ""plan of attack"", to which Tony replies ""I have a plan. Attack."".
Later in the movie, when the Battle of New York is happening, Tony says to Steve ""Call it, Captain."", to which Steve then comes up with the plan that the other Avengers follow.

In the beginning if Iron Man 3, Tony challenges the Mandarin and provides him with his home address, which obviously, ends up being not a very good strategic plan.
Sometime after that, Tony is having one of his panic attacks and Harley (the kid in the movie) tells Tony that he's a mechanic and to build something to take his mind off of whatever is causing his panic attacks. Tony then takes Harley's advice and is able to overcome his panic attacks.
Later in the movie, Tony and Rhodey are on the Norco (oil tanker) to save the President and Pepper. Tony has his gun lowered and Rhodey has to remind him to raise it up. After Tony raises his gun, he asks Rhodey ""What do I do?"" which Rhodey responds ""Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back."" 

In Age of Ultron, when Maria Hill calls Tony the boss, Tony responds by saying that Captain America is the boss, and that he just pays for everything and makes everyone look cooler. This just reiterates the idea that Tony's best quality is not a strategic leader. Not that he can't lead, but if there's someone more capable than him, he's willing to step aside.

In Infinity War, when Dr. Strange is captured by Ebony Maw, Tony says to Peter ""We got a situation. See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan?"" Peter is the one who comes up with the plan to jettison Ebony Maw out into space.
Later on Titan, they're trying to decide how to fight Thanos, Tony says ""All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one."" And after hearing Tony's ""plan"" Quill says that it sucks and he'll come up with the plan instead. After they catch Thanos, Quill points out that it was him that came up with the plan. 

All of this is not to say Tony is incapable of planning things out, he clearly has shown himself capable when it comes to using his smarts in tight situations. It just seems like his style is more ""act first and improvise"" rather than ""here's the plan and stick to it"".

(Iron Man 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming)

18. Peter Parker in Iron Man 2

This has been made official and most people already know about it, but I wanted to go into how well it fits into canon.

Peter Parker being the kid in the Iron Man mask, from Iron Man 2 that Tony saves, was a fan theory even before Spider-Man was included in the MCU. But the theory (which is now canon) has more going for it than just ""you never see the kid's face, so maybe that's Peter"". 

The Stark Expo takes place in Queens, New York, Peter grew up and lives in Queens.

The Stark Expo is a science expo, something that Peter would take interest in. 

Peter looks up to Stark, in Homecoming he even tells Stark ""I wanted to be like you"".

The kid in the mask acts heroic, standing up to the Hammer Drone. This is something Peter would do.

Iron Man 2 takes place sometime in 2009 (no later than 2010), and Homecoming takes place in 2016. Peter is 15 in Homecoming, meaning he would be around 8 or 9 in Iron Man 2, which lines up with the age of the kid in the mask.

Buckle up, it's gonna be a long and autistic wall of text, so brace yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

There's this girl who was my classmates for 2 years, 2 years ago. She's a few months older, but looks and acts younger, may I add she's one of the most gorgeous females I've ever seen walk this Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, for a bit of context, she's dated 3 different people in the span of like 4 years (I get it's not much for extroverts, but she kept posting stuff on social about about loving them to hell and back, etc and then just breaks up with them like it was nothing), so i recon she's not the most mentally stable person, not to mention her uncle's suicide, while on the other hand, I never dated someone, mostly due to the lack of not even trying.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've had a crush on her the second I met her, but she started dating the class's chad, who left her in tears not even a year later.

&amp;#x200B;

FFW to this summer, we had a very small group of people who we'd go to the cinema or to McDonald's with, keep that in mind for now.

&amp;#x200B;

She really loves animals and every other post she shares on Facebook is usually fake or misguided information about lost or abused pets, just to get likes and shares. I usually comment her stuff pointing out the comment section on the post, letting her know that she just shared a fake article.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, she just... drops the Laugh react on one of my comments. So, in order not to cause a fuss on her profile for all to see, I message her.

&amp;#x200B;

""What's so funny?"" I ask. 

She saw the message and a month went by without her replying.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you have to understand, it's not the first time someone leaves me on Seen, she is not the first nor will be the last person to ignore me, and I'm ok with that. The problem is I really like her, and I thought she was just busy with uni or something, so I didn't pay much mind to it, and believed that she would reply when she could.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after that month went by, she added me to a group to arrange a hangout.

&amp;#x200B;

At the start, while the others were talking, I didn't reply and just ghosted the conversation, it was when she said ""Anon, can you reply? \*laughing emoji\* "" that I lost my cool.

&amp;#x200B;

I took a screenshot of the message she left on read and sent it with the line ""I dunno, can you?""  


""I can, uni's over \*another laughing in tears emoji\* ""

&amp;#x200B;

So I straight up said very politely that I sent her a message and that she had ignored me, and guess what happens... She doesn't reply to that one either. After that, I just keep bickering back and forth with the other guy, who's trying to calm me down, I'll give him credit for that, until I decide to shut up. She has yet to talk again. Then he mentions cinema and she immediately types in all caps ""YES I WANNA SEE THE INCREDIBLES ASAP, OMG I LOVE IT, I WANNA SEE IT, etc"".

&amp;#x200B;

With this, I understood she didn't care for me, so I decided to leave the group chat, to which they replied by adding me again, trying to convince me to stay. This happens a couple of times until she FINALLY messages me, telling me she didn't want to argue about that in a chat made for the hangout. Fair enough.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, they immediately proceed to talk about soccer... Like... what? How do I even cope with such hypocrisy? Am I being paranoid or DID SHE JUST DO WHAT SHE ASKED ME NOT TO DO? Again, I send a screenshot of the exact sentence she told me that I just mentioned in the previous paragraph.

&amp;#x200B;

They just tell me to stop acting like that and then proceed to send a fuckton of movie trailers nobody's going to watch anyway. And that was it. For 2 days, nobody said anything until the guy asked how it was, and they all magically agreed on one movie. I tell them I couldn't go because I was doing an internship at the time, and the others had limitations on their schedules too.

&amp;#x200B;

They finally settle on a date where they can all go but me, and I don't reply any further to this conversation, but they tell me that since we can't all go together, they'll go this one time and another when I'm free.

&amp;#x200B;

I never heard from that group again.

&amp;#x200B;

So, back to the girl, she told me she left alot of people on Read and that she really was busy with Uni, EVEN THOUGH she posts like 5 instastories daily, and trust me, she even does volunteer work, like.. really? You can spend entire afternoons helping the poor but don't have 10 seconds to spare to answer a text?

&amp;#x200B;

So, I left her on Read for 3 months until she sent me a message like nothing had happened about how she had finished watching an anime I had reccomended her like a year ago, so I kindly tell ""I'm still mad at you, so I don't care"", to which she replied ""I won't bother you anymore. Peace"" and we haven't spoken since, and that was in September.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is very stupid and that there's a 99% chance I am the one who's in the wrong, but I just had to type this somewhere, I keep thinking about what I could've said different and how to apologize to her, because we were really great friends, and I don't have many of those, but my stubborn ass refuses to accept defeat and apologize to her head on, because in my heart, I KNOW I did the thing I believed was right.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And to this day, I still don't know what that Laugh react meant.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I want your opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Is she a hypocrite for ignoring me and doing exactly what she didn't want me to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Or am just being childish and nonsensical for escalating every single one of our interactions?

&amp;#x200B;

Season 6 Best Season 

Season 6 shaked things up, George leaves the show which forces it to break it's boandries.New characters enter (Jackson, April,Read,Charlie) which causes more drama. The whole Merger storyline was great the new characters had awesome chemistry with the new cast.

        Cristina and Owen""s realashonship continues to develop while Owen recovers from the war. Merdith and Derek get engaged and are finally happy after everything they went through. Callie and Aroizona hook up and start their relationship.  

        Richard""s character is developed as he suffers through alcoholism. Richard was always a great character he was the glue to the show and was everyone's boss he was just underdeveloped until Season 6. 
         The episode where Alex and Derek get shot is the best season finale the show has ever had. I never was a big Derek fan but I could not barely the idea of him dieing and poor Alex bleeding out in an elevator! 
Standout episodes 
1. Death and All his Friends 6.24
2. I saw what I saw 6.6 
3. Good Mourning 6.1

Worst Season 4
Typically the earlier seasons are better than the new ones but this one fell short honestly. George""s Drama was  enough to make this the worst season on Grey's anatomy. Watching him repeat his intern year is so frustrating,his realashonship with Callie was cringeworthy. Instead of giving fans what they really wanted which was putting Izzie and Alex back together they stuck Izzie with George.
 
       Speaking of Alex he was with Ava/Rebecca who was a freaking crazy person she was so annoying! Why could Alex and Izzie not just get back together the Ava and George drama was so unnecessary.

    Cristina was recovering from Burke leaving her at the alter so she was a complete mess which I hated watching.  Cristina is such a strong person with a great personality. I hated watching her so upset. 

     And to top it all off Merdith was basically unbearable the entire time. The only good thing that happened was Lexie's grand appearance however Merdith was a complete bitch to her so that only annoyed me more. We did get the house of candles though.

and here we are in their misdeeds. Amongst the fallen land.

The wind is changing, a voice is calling with instruction to us all.

and here is where we lay our bodies, ready for the coming...'

The City of Dawn has fallen.

Those that are left have to rebuild or die trying.

The Hallowed have been decimated.

The Gods are still nowhere to be seen.

There is something on the horizon.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE GAME:**

Hi there, so I’m looking to run a long term Dungeon World campaign set in the world of Telaryn with people who are committed to a long term project. In the first session we will be playing a game called The Quiet Year, where we will rebuild the main city in the world. This should then inform other aspects of the world. I want this to be a collaborative project where we create the world together and can explore it and enjoy it together. I want us to develop a world together that we can all enjoy and be proud of by the end of the game.

Regarding the game of The Quiet Year, It will be the 4 players taking turns whilst I will be asking questions and helping to develop the world. Along with maybe throwing a few additional things in there to further the story.

I will be looking to start the game around 5/6pm GMT every other Sunday and each session will last anywhere between 3-5 hours so you will need to be able to commit to that. We will be using Discord to communicate and roll20 to play so you’ll need to be able to access both. The first session is on the 23rd of December.

I will be looking for 4 players to start but if it feels right then I might get up to two more for a party of 6.

There may be some themes in the game that might make some people feel uncomfortable, if you know of anything you are strictly against, please let me know :)

&amp;#x200B;

**THE WORLD:**

[https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvBHYP59zCnyg-ELfXc78NdsXMzdAw](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvBHYP59zCnyg-ELfXc78NdsXMzdAw)

I have included a link to the OneNote file with the main creation story and important historical points on it along with the deities of the realm. I have also included the calendar for Telaryn and the map of Telaryn for you to have a look at. As you can see it is pretty bare and I have done that intentionally so that it can be a collaborative effort. Don’t be fooled I have A LOT of ideas for the world but I want to make sure as much as possible is done together and I can fill in the gaps afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

**ME:**

Hi, my name is Luke. I’m 23 and hail from the UK. I have GM/DM’d a couple of campaigns along with playing in several D&amp;D/Pathfinder/Dungeon World campaigns and playing a fair few one shots as well. I love roleplaying games where the players are incredibly invested in the characters and the story. I also love when the character’s action effect the world around them and intern the world effects the characters. I usually focus towards the roleplay aspect of the game so the game may be more roleplay heavy but there will be combat and exploration as well but it will all feed from the roleplaying. I also have 1 golden rule when DMing - never say no. If a player wants try something then why not, they are the heroes after all and sometimes heroes do incredible things, as long as the dice let them.

I think the most important thing though is for everyone to have fun and enjoy the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**APPLICATIONS:**

Please answer as many of the questions below as you can. (I am aware there are a lot of questions, just answer as much as you can. I have only asked a lot so I can get a good sense of you as a player as we wont be making characters yet)

For Dungeon World we will be using the official classes. I will also accept any classes by Peter Johansen - [https://plus.google.com/113692337653837882568/posts/PiujJA82jfe](https://plus.google.com/113692337653837882568/posts/PiujJA82jfe) but will need to discuss beforehand about how they’ll fit in the world.

When we start to put characters together you will need to come up with a backstory of at least a paragraph and a picture for your character, but I will be chatting with you to develop that.

Please also make sure to read the OneNote file before applying (it's short, I promise).

a84czo,5,2018-12-20,Is my statistical approach correct?,Entoren,AskStatistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/a84czo/is_my_statistical_approach_correct/,"Hello,

I am doing an internship in a research laboratory and would like some help to check if my statistical approach is the right one since my knowledge in statistic is not very high.

I have two group, let's call them A and B.  
Each group has 18 participant.  
Both group did a pretest and posttest.  
For each participant and for each test, i have a global score ( /15), and three score for 3 different part of the test (part1:/5, part2 :/5, part 3:/4).  

my group are further split by : pretest/posttest and global/part1/part2/part3.  

I am trying to prove that either:  
H0: There is no difference in the gain between both group.  
H1: There is a difference in the gain between the group in at least one part of the test(or global).  


* for each group, check if for Gaussian or non-Gaussian population using a Shapiro-Wilk test.
* Using an unpaired t test(or a Mann-Whitney test if at least one group is non-Gaussian) , check if the population of group A and the population of group B have similar result for the pretest.
* Using a paired t test (or a Wilcoxon test if at least one group is non-Gaussian), check if the difference between the result of the pretest and posttest are significant.
* Compute the value of the gain, using : Gain = posttest - pretest.
* Using an unpaired t-test(or a Mann-Whitney test if the group are non-Gaussian), check if the difference between the gain of the two population is significant.

I also have three other question:

* Do i have to repeat these step for each category?
* Should my gain be ""posttest-pretest"" or ""0.707107 * posttest - 0.707107 * pretest"" ? I heard SPSS was using the second formula
* When using my data, the grade of the test is normalized to 0-1. But when i look at the density, it goes outside this range, can this be a problem and should i limit it to 0-1?

If i am using a wrong approach or wrong statistical test , please let me know !

Edit: forgot to ask a question"

a84mgi,6,2018-12-20,Career Trajectory for Engineers in TPS,BurntGrass98,epicsystems,https://www.reddit.com/r/epicsystems/comments/a84mgi/career_trajectory_for_engineers_in_tps/,"Epic's recruiting team reached out to me about the Technical Problem Solver role. At first this caused me to scratch my head, as I'm currently a Materials Science &amp; Engineering student. Basically I was surprised a software company would consider me for a role as a TPS, given that I'm not from a CS background. However, the HR reps and phone interviewer assured me that people from all sorts of different backgrounds have been successful in this position. I thought the phone interview and technical/personality quiz went pretty well, though it's impossible to be totally sure with these things.


It's my senior year, and that means it's high time to start thinking long and hard about what it is I want to do for the next 45 or so years and how I can accomplish it. I certainly don't have any job offers lined up and am looking for advice on what the TPS role would mean for me and for my career.


Positives: I've always been pretty interested in computers and technology, and I've always enjoyed understanding how something (usually tehnology-related) works and teaching it to others. I asked a friend who interviewed on-site (but ultimately declined her offer because of the location) about a year ago, and she told me what to expect in terms of salary, benefits, etc. Everything on those fronts seems good. Ditto for what I read about the company culture (casual dress, young vibe, etc.) here and on Glassdoor. Furthermore, I worked a summer internship in a more ""traditional"" Engineering role and didn't love it for a number of reasons, so I'm open at this point to a different career path. I've done well in school and get the sense (from the questions online, mostly) that Epic primarily values aptitude/intelligence over social sills, training, and experience, an attitude that's refreshing and could work to my benefit.


Negatives: One vibe I got early on (i.e., when reading the description) and can't quite shake is that the TPS job is something of a dead end and essentially entails working as a tech-support agent (albeit for customers who demand a much higher level of service than your typical offshore operation could provide). While I wouldn't take a job with the explicit intention of leaving in x years, I realize that churn is the norm in Engineering and at Epic too. This means I necessarily have to be thinking about what I could do if it doesn't work out long-term for some reason. I have gleaned that Epic's emphasis on aptitude over experience is far from common for Engineering jobs, so this means transferrable skills are important.


Questions:

1. Is my overall impression above accurate?

2. What, precisely, does a TPS do, and how much of the work is technical (i.e., code, databases, etc.) versus people-related (i.e., user training)?

3. What options to TPS folks have for advancement within Epic? How often are they taken, and what must one do to accomplish them?

4. When a TPS leaves Epic for whatever reason, where does he/she usually go? 

5. If I were offered this position and accepted it, would this basically null-out my chances of working as an MSE in the future? 

6. On the flip side, should I decide I want to pursue a career as a programmer or computer scientist, could/would Epic help me in that regard? Would they support a TPS going to graduate school? Would the position be a resume-builder for such a path?


tl;dr,  What is the trajectory (both internal and external) for a TPS at Epic? Specifically, what about people who come from Engineering (but non-CSE) backgrounds?"

a85n61,4,2018-12-20,[18 F4M] Quiet Jewish Girls Always Have The Best Tits,Loungette,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a85n61/18_f4m_quiet_jewish_girls_always_have_the_best/,"Now some of you may be wondering: just where the hell did that stereotype come from? Isn't that sorta weird and out of left field? Since when were Jewish girls stereotyped for anything other than big noses and obsessive grandmothers?

Well when you have a sample size of precisely one subject, outcomes are much easier to reach.

For this particular hypothesis, the subject in question was Kate Kleinberg, the nose of whom was actually quite diminutive and wonderfully complicated the remainder of her adorably girlish, mousy face that ensured she'd get carded for alcohol until she was at least forty. Her hair set a similar tone, falling across her shoulders and forehead in bouncy brown strands that would tickle at the tips of her eyelashes just above that set of bright blue eyes whenever she tilted her head down.

She did that a lot, by the way - tipping her head down. If there was one thing Kate had become intimately familiar with over the years then it would certainly be the view of her shoes. More famed for their loud and boisterous New Yorkian relatives on the 'State side of things, Kate herself was more of the silent sort - oh, sure, she was friendly enough once you got to know her, but that in itself was the hardest part. Coincidentally, considering the adjective used to describe her face shape, she was well-known amongst her peers back in high school for squeaking whenever she got embarrassed, which was pretty often. Less often now, in her late teens, but it was still easy enough to spook her if you tried.

Adorable.

Yes, ""cute"" would probably be the first adjective that would enter the brains of most people she met with the shuffling and the squeaking and the overall aesthetic of such a meek young girl, but it would be lying to say that a number of other choice descriptors hadn't been tossed her way following her post-pubescent years.

For all her shyness, Kate was the farthest thing from an idiot one might imagine - naive and hilariously impressionable, sure, but not an idiot. Aside from the whole ""squeaking"" thing, her most famed moment in high school might've been her uncharacteristically emphatic reaction to receiving a B+ on her Chemistry midterm and, for as much difficulty as she had with looking other people in the face, strangely she seemed to infect many she spoke to with that exact same problem. Every shirt has cleavage when you've got a chest her size, and all those tight-fitting turtlenecks ever did was just showcase it even better! She distinctly remembered going red in the face for the better portion of an hour upon hearing one of her classmates use the phrase ""painted on"" in reference to such a sweater hugging at her bosoms, and had taken to only visiting the gym later at night after realizing just how much attention she was drawing whenever she used the treadmill.

---

Woo, a slight adjustment to this prompt to make Kate 18 and barely legal - y'know, for the added cute factor! As with before, it's a pretty open-ended prompt.

Obviously I'm looking for something factoring in her shy nature, but past that I'm fully open to ideas! I'll list out a couple of possible scenarios below, but keep in mind that they're hardly restrictive!

- Kate's been dragged along for some sort of road trip for either a class, work, or some other reason we come up with and ends up bonding with her trip-mate. Road-head is the ultimate form of bonding.
- Kate ends up getting dragged to her worst nightmare - a party - by one of her more extroverted friends. Since she's not much of a party animal she ends up awake after it starts puttering out and is surprised to have unintentionally drawn some attention. Maybe she gets pushed into joining a couple others in the hot tub, maybe she gets pulled into a game that turns out to have stripping involved, maybe she just gets chatted up by a cute guy that's hanging around.
- Kate's older co-workers at her internship takes an interest in her.
- Being shy and geeky, Kate is inevitably drawn to gaming groups, whether computer-based or classical pen and paper. Of course, a bunch of similarly introverted nerdy guys might not know how to behave themselves around such a good-looking girl.
-Kate is brought to an amateur photoshoot where she is continually talked out of more and more clothes.
- The classic study buddies sort of setup.
- Something of a more traditional setup, like a date - or a double-date, perhaps.
- A long-time friend (or friends) stumbles into admitting how attractive he finds her, maybe even going a bit too far and fessing up to cranking one out a couple of times to the thought of her.
- Something more taboo, like an older partner or a family relative like a cousin.
- Something seasonally-appropriate! Maybe Kate gets invited to a Christmas dinner or office holiday party! A girl from a conservative Jewish household may not quite know the rules of a mistletoe.

And so on! You get the idea, I hope. A lot of the above scenarios are written to be very purposefully flexible on how many male characters are involved and I would *love* if any of my potential partners would be willing to play multiple male characters, but that's completely an optional thing! I'll similarly offer to add in another girl just to slightly even things out, but no more than that and only if there are at least two guys! What can I say? I'm picky and a shy girl getting spitroasted is, like, *super* hot.

Some other kinks and general stuff that I'd like included:

 - Cumplay, the only thing that's pretty much a requirement. Spunk on me. Cum quick, cum a lot, cum on my clothes, cum in my food, just get a lot of splooge in a lot of places, y'know?
- Semi-public, which is basically just as close to public as you can get without getting arrested. Sure, she's shy, but I also mentioned she's *super* impressionable, right?
- Stupidly risky stuff, which sort of ties in with the above kink and how she's super easy to persuade despite being so shy. Y'know, fucking her under the water in a hot tub or something. Or hell, maybe she's your cousin and she's blowing you under a blanket at family movie night. That sorta thing! Basically I just like having to narrowly avoid being seen.
- Casual stuff. Grabbing her butt or stuffing your dick in her face un-announced, having her blow you while she studies for an upcoming exam, that sort of thing. Could happen before or after the proverbial ice is broken depending on how ""coercive"" you want these scenes to be.
- Casual group, which is basically just, you know, casual stuff but in a group setting! This can apply to people playing multiple characters or only one. For multiple characters obviously double+ teaming, blowbangs, and stuff like that would be loved along with Kate getting passed around a small group of friends or coworkers. In a scenario where you're only playing one, though, they can look but they don't have to touch. Maybe you like showing off to your buddies by having your new girlfriend blow you on the couch while you're all hanging out and chatting.
- Being masturbated to, in-scene. Essentially getting yourself off directly to her without doing more than occasionally rubbing your dick on her face or some such. Bonus points if it's to completion!
- Chubby guys! I love chubby guys. And any other sort of generally conventionally unattractive sort of dudes - something about the contrast makes me go crazy.

Again, none of those are required, just some stuff I like including! I don't do impreg, hard gore, bathroom stuff, or bestiality, but *most* other things are on the table, so be sure to ask if you want a kink included! Want to cum on the shy Jewish girl's feet? Then gosh golly, cum all over 'em!

Send me a message if you're interested! I only write in third person, but if you're only playing a single character and want to write in first person, we can work something out."

I started playing yugioh when pendulum was new thing and nekroz shaddoll qli b.a., I was testing a lot of the current decks and older stuff, learned the game and how it works. I’m not a meta player but nekroz and shaddoll were cool decks. After rummage to new decks to try out I found madolces. A deck with cute artworks, a little engine to circle trough ur deck and summoning the queen, a monster who shuffles 2 cards back without targeting ( this effect is still broken in my opinion ). This was I want to work for. It’s so much fun if ur opponent summon a big monster who is indistructable and u shuffle it just back. I fall in love with this deck and bought it irl, had a good time to try to combine with other stuff, but sometime u learn the weaknesses of this deck. It lacks at defense. 

Now the part that is a bit depressing.

With the release of link I stopped playing yugioh. I wasn’t a huge fan of this mechanic and my decks feels more worse than before. I tried to made it playable, but it was just horrible. I lost the fun playing yugioh. With the announcement of sistart i got hope to play it again. BUT sistart is such a joke of a support card for this deck in the current yugioh state. It doesn’t even harmonized with the stratagie of madolce and u have to play it cause it’s ur only theme intern link monster. Now we have the new puddingsis I guess is the name. Tbh this card is really good. This deck is actually consistent now I want to play this deck again, but everything that puddingsis does right makes sistart wrong. It just stops ur combos. This card is actually doing nothing. It try’s to stall with an Effekt that wasn’t even good or just okay in 2012. what is Konami trying to tell me. Should I summon this card and watching my opponent building tripple crystal wing ? Summon sistart gives actually no benefit. It just stops combos and let u have pieces of madolce on the field after the summon. Is the Strategie to let them die to special summon anther out with ticket? Would be really awful. Okay, at least I just hope Konami brings out another link monster that makes sense to summon for this deck and mabey a trap for defense, not this garbage like teabreak that no one plays."
a86iza,4,2018-12-20,Client with medical emergency + blurred boundaries = immense stress,awkwardintern18,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/a86iza/client_with_medical_emergency_blurred_boundaries/,"Throwaway to protect the innocent, etc. 

Hey reddit,

I’m interning at an outpatient community mental health agency while I finish my degree. As an intern, I’m kind of a “diet” case manager, so to speak...I don’t have all the responsibilities or privileges of a full-blown case manager, but get a lot of client contact and do many things case managers do. 

Unfortunately, our agency requires us to contact clients from our personal cell phones. Some employees pay for “burner phones” out of their own pocket, but I am incredibly strapped for cash so that’s not a possibility for me. This makes me uncomfortable, as some of our clients truly abuse the privilege and expect we should be available to them at any time for any reason, or that we are like free  Uber/Lyft (we often transport clients lacking transportation to doctors appointments, grocery store etc). However, there’s really no alternative to the situation and seemingly no plans for administration to change it or set firm boundaries with clients about when they should call us and what for. The program director I work under truly believes we should put ourselves last to be excellent at our jobs (so much for self-care, right?)

A couple weekends ago, I receive a call from a client on a day I have off (I am paid hourly as an intern, not salaried of course). I answer and she says she thinks she had an ovarian cyst rupture because she was having heavy bleeding and a lot of pain, and asked if I could take her to the hospital. I was an hour away from this client’s home at the time and was caught off guard, so I told her I’d contact my supervisor and call her back. I tried the program supervisor and two more experienced coworkers and did not receive an answer, so I reluctantly had to trust my gut. I called the client back and advised her to call an ambulance to take her to the emergency room, since she was experiencing a potential medical emergency (from the amount of pain and heavy bleeding she described) and I am not a trained medical professional, and neither is anyone else on our staff. I assured her it would be covered cost-wise with her state health coverage (she is low income) but that it would be her best bet to call EMS. She understood, said okay, and got off the phone with me. Right after the phone call, I received a call from the program supervisor and explained the situation to her...that what she was explaining could be a potential emergency and I didn’t feel comfortable transporting her under those circumstances and felt it could open me up to a lot of liability. Not to mention, I was off work that day, I was an hour away from this client’s home (and I have a life outside of work and I don’t work for free, but I didn’t say these things). The program supervisor didn’t sound thrilled about it but we got off the phone. 

Well, several weeks later I am reviewing this girls file and see that the very day she called, she had an interaction with another case manager listed that same day. It turns out another case manager ended up taking her to the hospital after I told her to call an ambulance. I later find out this case manager took her to the hospital because our program supervisor called him and told him he had to take her. It was this person’s day off as well. What? I spoke to several coworkers about this situation and they were in agreement with me that she should call 911 for an emergency. Yet some other case manager got forced to take this girl into the ER. This entire situation has me baffled. I feel as though this is horribly unethical and dangerous, and could set a harmful precedent to other clients that they should contact us instead of paramedics for emergency medical services. I feel like this issue needs to be escalated but I don’t know how. I feel so powerless as an intern, yet these blurred lines with clients, expecting staff to be accessible 24/7 and apparently expecting them to provide emergency medical transport is not sitting well with me. I plan to ask my internship advisor at school about this as well, but won’t see her again until January. 

So I guess what I want to know here from other social workers, is this situation as messed up as I think it is? Am I justified in thinking this is horribly wrong? And how would I go about escalating this? I feel so lost and powerless yet so frustrated as well. 

Thanks guys. "
a89kna,3,2018-12-21,The world building in my hero academia. Good? Terrible? What are your thoughts?,asilestr,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/a89kna/the_world_building_in_my_hero_academia_good/,"I recently made a few posts and comments about this. So I decided to put it all together. I REALLY want  to know what people think about the world building in the MHA. 

I have seen some people trying to defend it by stating it doesn’t need to be as “explorational” as one piece. I’m not trying to say that Izuku and the others should travel from country to country, but we seriously need some more world building in the country we’re currently in. For some reason that’s beyond me, we are always focused on U.A high school almost every single time. I know it’s called “my hero academia” but it seems like a lazy excuse. I want to see what the villains are doing. What about the pro heroes? 

What I liked about the yakuza arc, was that we weren’t focused on fucking U.A anymore. We finally explored more of the city, and the hero community. The students and pro heroes worked together and THAT’S what I want to see. I don’t want to see deku and the others rehearsal some dance moves, while I would be more interested in what the villains and important heroes are doing. 

This year has been REALLY boring in terms of story. The only real action we got, was the pro hero arc with hawks and endeavor, and that chapter was really short! What the hell Horikoshi? That arc was amazing! You had an opportunity to show us the world from a pro hero’s point of view. But no. You wanted us to see class A and B do some excises together, while class B clearly won’t be important to the story in the future, as much as 1 A. You want to show us how the students in class A has grown? Show us through their internships! Show us through sense of danger of death! Where the students can prove themselves in battle and go plus ultra! Show us that instead of some training.  

My hero academia should NOT be focused around ONE high school all the freaking time. It makes the story boring. This year has nearly been one big breather. We had that mr gentle arc, and the training arc right now. Those two were the biggest arc this year. And that’s so boring. The pro hero arc was so good, but Horikoshi thought: fuck giving the fans some view of pro heroes and way more world building than any other arcs. Let me show them U.A high school again” 

That mr. gentle arc we got was I fine with. It was a breather and all, so I accepted it. And then came the pro hero arc and I thought: YES, finally some world building from pro heroes view! That arc didn’t even last 10 chapters. We had the chance to see the entire hero society from pro heroes viewpoint. But it didn’t last very long. There was that billboard thingy, and the fight against high end. That was it for that arc. 

What I’m trying to say is, that we should be out there in the city and see something, rather than seeing Midoriya and the others do excises and dance rehearsals. 


From another post of mine: 

It’s like the fight after all might and all for one. 

In one piece, before and after whitebeard arrived at marine ford, we saw how the ENTIRE World reacted. We got to see how white beards death affected the world as a whole and how the war changed history as we know it. We saw how the marines, civilians, and pirates reacted to his arrival and death. THAT is what I would have loved to see in MHA. 

Horikoshi passed a FANTASTIC opportunity to show us how All might and All for ones battle affected Japan. Yes, we hear that more villains are coming from the shadows, and crime is rising again. But that’s about it. We aren’t really shown what has happened the Japan directly, we only hear it through other people.

Wouldn’t it be better if, after the battle of all might and all for one, that we just got 1 or 2 chapters of how their battle affected the hero society? What did the civilians think of it? What about the other heroes, what are their viewpoint of it all? After all that destruction by one man, wouldn’t there be some sort of hate towards those with quirks in some degree? 
BUT NO! we got some stupid license exam light after such an important battle l. I just feel the whole license exam is a little rushed. Horikoshi could have done like Oda, and shown us the aftermath of the fight, like with whitebeard. I mean, there was JUST a battle between the strongest people in the entire country, how did this battle affect society? I would love to know that before we go to the whole school thing again. 

Being so focused on ONE school and location all the time makes the story boring, when there is more important things going on in the city. We could have seen how all might retirement affected japan, but no. We only hear it though others. Horikoshi could at LEAST have given us 1 or 2 chapters about it. 1/2 would I be fine with. But no. We are always focused on a freaking high school, rather than seeing what the villains are doing, or what the pro heroes think about all of this. 

—————————————————

The whole license arc was unnecessary right after the battle with all for one. We finally had the chance to see how their battle affected society. But no. We just had to go straight to U.A high school to lighten the mood after such an important fight. 

This entire year has only been about U.A with the exception of the pro hero arc. Is has been one big breather except the pro hero arc. If I don’t know any better, we are gonna get some sort of Galla arc, one arc after our current one. That’s right. I really want to see the boys dance with the girls, while the league of villains are out there stabbing society’s trust on heroes...  

————————————————————

I’m not saying we should get the same world building as one piece. But we could at the very least get some world building around the hero society. We only hear what’s going on, but we never see it. THAT is the biggest problem MHA faces, and it doesn’t look like it’s getting better any time soon... 

I have heard people overhyping My hero academia’s story, and calling it “one of the best.” The story itself is very narrow minded, because we always are shackled to the school. I mean, the two STRONGEST people in the whole country fought, and we didn’t get to see the aftermath of society after such an important fight. We only heard about it. Could we at least have given some chapters or at least PANELS to what happened to the hero society, instead of constantly hearing it from someone else? Nope. We ran straight to U.A with an license exam... 

What do people think? Do the overall plot, action, and the focus of U.A justify the lack of world building to the hero society we have gotten? "
a8a72l,1,2018-12-21,[M4F] I wanna fuck you over a desk. (Office sex),mjd931,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/a8a72l/m4f_i_wanna_fuck_you_over_a_desk_office_sex/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.

&amp;#x200B;

Kik is mjd931 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc

&amp;#x200B;

\- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me

&amp;#x200B;

\- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

&amp;#x200B;

\- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

&amp;#x200B;

\- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

&amp;#x200B;

\- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

&amp;#x200B;

\- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

&amp;#x200B;

I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

&amp;#x200B;

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

&amp;#x200B;

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

&amp;#x200B;

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

&amp;#x200B;

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+"
a8amfj,1,2018-12-21,I quit my job after two weeks,icedtallcovfefe,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a8amfj/i_quit_my_job_after_two_weeks/,"I know it sounds bad but I’m confident I made the right decision.

I just graduated this year, and this is my first full time job after taking on an internship and freelance work. Midterm elections are coming up in my country and I managed to land a job in a senatorial campaign. I’m applying for law school next year, so working for a campaign fits my timeline well.

It’s not campaign season yet, so the work is relatively lighter for now. I’ve been placed in a very strategic position, giving me the advantage to know what’s going on in all aspects of the campaign. I also work closely with my candidate, spending 7 days a week with her for at least 12 hours a day.

But in the short time that I’ve worked for this campaign, I can confidently say that I’ve made the right decision for reasons being:
- I was underpaid and overworked. Working below minimum wage because of budget restrictions.
- I was being treated as a personal assistant by a candidate who is incredibly unprofessional and stubborn.
- I was constantly being undermined and insulted by our chief of staff (my direct boss) on matters that does not have anything to do with my work (i.e. my appearance).
- There’s just so much drama. The campaign is being ran by someone who has a huge ego and takes everything personally. She thinks everyone owes her.
- The family of the candidate adding to the drama by always protesting against how the campaign is being done. I mean, this is politics.
- It’s simply not good for my mental and physical health. Toxic environment.

But more importantly, I’ve lost faith in my candidate. She’s someone who needs to be constantly fed information. She doesn’t admit to her faults when she says something wrong EVEN IF WE FED HER THE INFO SHE NEEDED. We’re having such a hard time progressing because we have to constantly put out fires she’s starting. She is not the woman I was inspired to work for.

I know this may affect my future career endeavors in politics but walking away this early is worth it. "

* I'm Canadian (I have local undergraduate and graduate degrees in Accounting).

* I'll get my Canadian letters (""CPA, CA"") in a few weeks.

* I've done 3 busy seasons at Big 4s (in Audit; including internships) with a 4th just around the corner. 

* I'm looking to leave my current job in October 2019. 

It would be cool to do a working holiday visa in the UK for about a year, after I quit my current job. I'm open to any area within accounting/finance, except External Audit. 

How competitive is the UK accounting/finance market for foreigners on working holiday visas? Is it best to work with recruiting agencies to get a role? 

I can get a local ACA designation from the ICAEW if I pay about 675 GBP (there's a reciprocity agreement between the ICAEW and CPA Canada). Would it be worth it to make myself more competitive? Or would my Canadian CPA be sufficient? 

Any input would be amazing, thank you! "

Antwoorden op vragen van het lid Kuiken &amp;#40;PvdA&amp;#41; aan de minister van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties over het benoemen van een “burgerlid” in een commissie van een gemeenteraad &amp;#40;ingezonden 27 november 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht 'Eindelijk benoemd'? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1:   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke wet- en regelgeving geldt er ten aanzien van de benoemingsvereisten voor een burgerlid van een raadscommissie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Mag een gemeente aanvullende eisen stellen aan een dergelijke benoeming? Zo ja, welke eisen en wie mag die stellen? Wat is de rol van de burgemeester? Maakt het daarbij uit of een voorgedragen commissielid op de kandidatenlijst van een fractie heeft gestaan? Zo nee, waarom mogen er geen aanvullende eisen worden gesteld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2 en 4:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Artikel 82 van de Gemeentewet bepaalt dat de raad raadscommissies kan instellen ter voorbereiding van de besluitvorming van de raad en het voeren van overleg met het college of de burgemeester. Daarbij is aan de raad opgedragen om voor zover raadsleden benoemd worden, te zorgen voor een evenwichtige  vertegenwoordiging van de in de raad vertegenwoordigde groeperingen. De Gemeentewet bevat geen benoemingsvereisten ten aanzien van niet-raadsleden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is een autonome bevoegdheid van de raad om bij verordening al dan niet benoemingsvereisten te formuleren voor niet-raadsleden. In de praktijk komt het voor dat gemeenteraden voor het commissielidmaatschap van niet-raadsleden dezelfde benoemingsvereisten stellen als de wetgever doet aan het raadslidmaatschap, waaronder het vereiste van ingezetenschap en het bereikt hebben van de leeftijd van 18 jaar &amp;#40;artikel 10 van de Gemeentewet&amp;#41;. Ook wordt in sommige gemeenten als vereiste gesteld dat betrokkene bij de laatstgehouden gemeenteraadsverkiezingen op een van de kandidatenlijsten moet hebben gestaan. Dit staat gemeenteraden vrij. De burgemeester heeft in dezen geen specifieke taak of bevoegdheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunnen er belemmeringen zijn voor de benoeming van een burgerlid van een raadscommissie als die aan de formele eisen uit wet- en regelgeving voldoet? Zo ja, welke belemmeringen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kan de benoeming van een commissielid, waartegen geen formele bezwaren bestaan, door middel van stemming in de gemeenteraad geblokkeerd worden? Zo ja, op welke gronden? Zo nee, waarom niet en kan een dergelijk besluit op grond van artikel 268 van de Gemeentewet bij koninklijk besluit vernietigbaar zijn?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3 en 5:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Benoeming van personen kan plaatsvinden bij acclamatie of door middel van stemming. Vindt benoeming plaats door middel van stemming, dan bepaalt artikel 31 van de Gemeentewet dat de stemming geheim – en dus schriftelijk – is. Een stemming impliceert de mogelijkheid tegen de benoeming van betrokkene te stemmen. Dit kan ertoe leiden dat de kandidaat ondanks het voldoen aan de in de lokale verordening gestelde eisen, niet wordt benoemd. Het al dan niet houden van een stemming in relatie tot het bepaalde in de eigen verordening is een lokaal-autonome keuze; het is de raad die gaat over de benoeming van raadscommissieleden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ten aanzien van vernietiging door de Kroon is op grond van het wettelijk kader  en het Beleidskader schorsing en vernietiging  van belang of aan de betreffende beslissing een rechtsgevolg verbonden is, in de zin dat de beslissing bijvoorbeeld ten aanzien van andere bestuursorganen of particulieren een rechtsverhouding vastlegt, wijzigt of opheft. Brengt de beslissing geen rechtsgevolg met zich, dan komt die niet voor vernietiging in aanmerking. De benoeming van raadscommissieleden betreft de eigen bestuurlijke organisatie van de gemeenteraad. Het heeft daarmee een intern karakter: zij hebben geen externe werking naar andere bestuursorganen of particulieren zoals hierboven is bedoeld. Het al dan niet benoemen van een persoon tot lid van een raadscommissie is  dan ook niet vatbaar voor vernietiging door de Kroon. Daar komt nog bij dat in het geval de beslissing betreft iemand niet als commissielid te benoemen, er geen sprake is van een voor vernietiging vatbare beslissing omdat het hierboven bedoelde rechtsgevolg ontbreekt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe verhoudt de benoemingwijze van het in het bericht genoemd commissielid, zich tot de toelichting bij de Model Verordening op de raadscommissies 2018 van de VNG en tot hetgeen in de verordening van de gemeente Bodegraven-Reeuwijk staat, namelijk dat het mogelijk is “dat de raad &amp;#40;moet&amp;#41; besluiten een voorgedragen lid niet te benoemen tot lid van een commissie. Dit kan het geval zijn wanneer een “burgerlid” niet voldoet aan de vereisten van de Gemeentewet. Andere redenen om een dergelijke benoeming achterwege te laten zijn niet aan de orde""? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Een gemeenteraad gaat over de eigen vergaderorde en besluitvorming, dat is een autonoom, lokaal proces. Hoe de benoemingswijze zich verhoudt tot hetgeen in de verordening van de gemeente Bodegraven-Reeuwijk staat, dan wel het model van de VNG, dient om die reden door de desbetreffende gemeenteraad te worden beoordeeld op het moment dat het zich voordoet.

**Gender:** Female

**Age:** 17

**Birthday:** December 31

**Occupation:** High School Student, Intern in Investigations Department of the Misty Mountains Hero Agency

**Height:** 168 cm (5'6'')

**Weight:** 52 kg (115 lbs)

**Hair Color:** White-blonde

**Hair type/Haircut:** Pixie bob cut

**Facial Hair/Facial Hair Type:** N/A

**Facial Hair Color:** N/A

**Eye Color:** Light Red

**Skin Color:** Fair

**Blood type:** O

**Hero Agency/Villain Team:** Misty Mountains (霧の山脈 - Kiri no sanmyaku) Hero Agency

**Attitude:** Akira is outgoing, has strong leadership abilities, and is able to set the mood for groups of people. She doesn't care much about little things so her laid back behavior sometimes freaks out people around her. Though she's often late to events and can sometimes be a bit rude, she is incredibly resilient and flexible, enabling her to roll with the punches. Akira is a rocker at heart and a bit of a delinquent, sometimes climbing from her room window in order to attend a rock show. Though she's a bit rough around the edges, she dislikes people who pick on those weaker than themselves. Ironically, her Quirk is sugary, in almost polar opposite of her personality.

**School:** Southern Osaka Academy Hero Course

**Year:** 3rd year

**Department:** Hero Department

**Class:** 3-B

**Distinguishing Physical Features:** White-blond hair and red eyes with a thin figure.

**Hero or Villain:** Hero

**Hero/Villain Name:** The Candy Cane Hero: White Stripe

**Costume:** Akira's hero costume consists of tokkō-fuku uniform: loose fitting, white Japanese worker's pants, tall white combat boots, a red undershirt, and a long, white military style jacket. Alongside this, she wears a belt with many containers of sugar attached, two arm bands on her upper arms and ankles which also hold sugar containers.

Embroidered on the back of the Jacket is the Kanji ""英雄"" or ""Hero"" and ""
かかって来い"" or ""Bring It On!""

**Gadgets/Tech/Weapons:** Around her wrists, ankles, and her belt she carries several containers of table sugar. She also carries with her a small set of investigators tools.

**Name of their quirk:** Sucrose (ショ糖 - Shotō)

**Quirk Type:** Emitter

**Quirk Range:** Mid-Range

**Quirk Description:** Through her Quirk, Akira can control sucrose, commonly known as Sugar (C12H22O11), for various purposes. Utilizing sucrose, she can create tough sugar constructs, armor, and weapons. 

**Miscellaneous Quirk Info:** While utilizing her Quirk, any sucrose she manipulates gains a red aura which makes the sugar looked striped red, similar to candy canes.

**Quirk Strengths:**

Her Quirk has many creative applications, such as generating constructs, armor, weapons and objects. By condensing it, Akira can create sugar which is durable enough to be used in battle. However, this sugar is still weaker than normal metal weapons. As such, she usually creates smaller, pointed weapons such as daggers. She can manipulate sucrose similar to telekinesis, so a common technique is to create small, pointed sugar blades and attack from multiple angles.

**Quirk Weaknesses:** 

She cannot individually control Glucose or Fructose. Sucrose is comprised of both and both need to be bonded in order for her to manipulate them. This also prevents her from manipulating any sugar that has been broken down by the body. While she can remotely control sucrose, she must be able to see it in order to do so.

Water is a big weakness as it has the potential to dissolve her sugar constructs. While she can separate sugar from the water, utilizing her abilities with water present is more difficult.

**Special Moves:**

*Sugar Daggers*: After creating several daggers of sugar, Akira launches them at her opponent. She then manipulates them to attack from multiple angles. 

*Sugar Blindness*: Akira utilizes a cloud of sugar to blind her opponent.

*Sugar Fist*: Akira constructs a gauntlet, then utilizes it for melee attacks. 

*Sugar Blade*: Akira forges a short sword of crystallized sugar.

*Sugar Shield*: Akira creates a floating shield of crystallized sugar to help with defense.

**Personal Strengths:** Tough, cooperative, technically impressive with her Quirk, flexible planner, humorous, observant, musically inclined, heroic, laid back.

**Personal Weaknesses:** Cocky, poor time management, somewhat of a delinquent, can be rude and sarcastic, a bit too laid back, argumentative.

**Age quirk obtained:** 3

**How the quirk was obtained:** She would utilize her Quirk to pull down the sugar from her mother's cabinet.

**Likes:** Sweets, action movies, rock music, her friends, a good brawl, riding motorcycles, Interning at her Hero Agency

**Dislikes:** Bullies, classical Japanese music, spicy food, her parent's and teacher's nagging.

**Habits:** She has a habit of mouthing off to authority figures

**Fears:** That she won't be able to become a hero

**Reason for becoming a Hero/Villain:** She wants to protect people weaker than her. 

**Relationship with peers/classmates:** While certainly opinionated and mouthy, she is quite popular in class due to her leadership qualities, sense of humor, and positive outlook. She often butts heads with her teachers, especially Reiko Yamanikkō-sensei. Reiko was especially pleased when Akira became an intern for the Misty Mountains Hero Agency, as she could work her to the bone in exchange for all the grief she was given in class. As she works well with others she exceeds within the Investigations Department, impressing the department's Head, Mizuki Keanamoto. Once her internship is over, Mizuki has stated she wished to offer her a full-time Side-kick position at the Misty Mountains Hero Agency, much to Reiko's chagrin.

**Relationship with Family:** While she and her parents argue about her choice in music or the effort she puts forth in school, they are actually a close nit family. While Akira loves her parents, she also wants to be her own person and encourages her younger siblings to do the same. While this can result in headaches from her parents, when push comes to shove, her family is always first in her mind.

**Relationship Status:** Single

**Number of Kids:** 0

a8c8vk,24,2018-12-21,Why I Stayed For So Long,littlebunsenburner,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/a8c8vk/why_i_stayed_for_so_long/,"I'm trying to figure out why I stayed in an abusive relationship with a pwBPD for six years. These are some of the reasons I've come up with:

1) I grew up in a home where my father verbally abused and mistreated my mother on a daily basis. For this reason, I thought certain abusive behaviors were normal and/or didn't have a healthy relationship modeled to me.

2) I was a late bloomer and did not have a serious relationship in high school or college. After college, I met my pwBPD and was desperate to be with someone and to lose my virginity. I had VERY low self-esteem. This dynamic fostered a codependent relationship. Throughout the relationship and despite many of his abusive behaviors, my biggest fear was always that I would lose him.

3) In graduate school, I failed an internship at a mental health facility due to a bad relationship with my former professor and then-supervisor. Coming out of that experience, I was dismissive of mental health and wary of the potential for mental health workers to help people. While I encountered people with BPD at that facility, they were on the severe end--unable to hold a job, pay bills, take care of their surroundings, etc. It made me think that all BPD was on the severe end and that there was not a spectrum. 

4) My pwBPD was very high functioning--he was a personal trainer who took incredible care of his body, had a very good work ethic and eventually was accepted to a doctoral program and later obtained an esteemed position at a hospital. While I knew there must have been something off about a person who got explosively angry at the drop of a hat, only seemed to find enjoyment in impulsively eating, buying things or making sexual comments about other women, who repeatedly told me he felt empty and ""hated his life,"" had a history of unstable relationships and compulsively and illogically blamed me for everything wrong in the world, I minimized the situation. I thought he just needed to take anger management classes. 

5) When you think you're in love with someone, you wear rose-colored glasses. You think it's hard times but that you'll get through it. You will unfairly exaggerate their good qualities, even if they are outweighed by bad qualities at a ratio of 1:10. You become addicted to the love hormones that are released when you touch them, hold them, or have sex with them. You give a large portion of your identity to the idea of being with them. You move mountains that you were only meant to climb. 

This is why I think I stayed for as long as I did. But I think the first step of any recovery is admitting that you have a problem. Then it's just a matter of giving yourself time and making sure you do not fall into the same trap again.

a8ddwk,1,2018-12-21,Advice needed,Academic_Yak,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a8ddwk/advice_needed/,"Hey everyone.

Yesterday my relationship of a year ended for good. We had been going pretty strong - a few hiccups owing to life's stresses - but were generally navigating life and looking forward to a future together. Pretty much best friends. Never upset each other. Best friends loved each of us in turn. Fully supportive of each other's lifestyles. Amazing experiences all round. Came back from every tiny hitch in our relationship stronger and more in love. I'm 23 so I'm young and maybe I don't have a lot of perspective, but this was one of those loves that lasts because of the friendship that underpinned it. He's 22.

However, should probably add he and I were from different cultural backgrounds (Middle Eastern and Indian) and his don't really marry out - or even live away from their parents. He's still a student, so any commentary on him having to man up and move out is fair but also a little premature, given they've also actively stopped him taking jobs and internships outside of the city in which we live (nearly nonexistent opportunities here). He's always said if he finds one that pays enough for him not to have to rely on their support whatsoever he'll take it anyway, but recently they've become firmer and firmer about the fact that he cannot move out until he's married to a woman they've chosen, and have said that 'regardless of how he acts they will get the outcome they want' (ominous words) and I'm pretty sure they would harass him relentlessly if he fought it.

Anyway they found out about us. It's not entirely clear how but apparently somebody saw us together and sent them a photograph of us together.

I want this to be one of those situations where I can say he was a baby and couldn't stand up to his parents, because that would make it super easy for me to be disgusted and move on. But actually, they threatened both of us implicitly, which is why he ended it. I'm pretty sure the threat of being disowned alone wouldn't have deterred him. They said a lot of horrifically racist things about me, and were clear that if we continue they'll do everything they can to destroy us, ship him out of the country, potentially hurt me, do 'anything necessary to get me out of the picture'. We both found out yesterday there's some fairly sketchy criminal activity that's happened with his parents in the past too, so there is literally no limit to what they'd do. At any rate they made it clear they would never, ever, ever give up trying to ruin our lives. I could see it starting to happen too, as from the moment they suspected it they had eyes on us in public, taking photos, asking him to send his location, screaming at him and grabbing his phone anytime he was home, verbally abusing me to him, etc. We stupidly thought they would be reasonable if they knew he was happy and healthy and that I was a good person from a loving family. We had been planning this whole future together where we could try to manage all of this, but I don't think either of us knew how bad they would be, or how conditional their love for him really was.

I have a lot going for me, so he told me he could not in good conscience have me living the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. He said he didn't want my physical safety on his head, but that he will love me forever for the things we shared and the happiness I gave him, however brief. He said I showed him how good life could be when he's been surrounded by so much badness for such a long time. I accepted that.

I want to note here I'm not trying to get him back. If things changed and they suddenly weren't in the picture then yes - I would marry him immediately. But this isn't a good situation for me to be in too. I'm not an idiot. Nobody would want to walk into something so unsafe, especially not somebody who's worked as hard as I have for the life I'm living, for the people I'm surrounded with. I know his decision is the most loving one. But at the same time I can't really understand any of this. My mind is literally not processing it. It feels like a bad movie script. I can't understand how someone so gentle, who could be so good for me, could have all of this behind him. What's worse is that it feels like his life is slowly being ruined and I can't do anything to stop it. I know nobody can rescue him but himself, but he seems resigned to the fact that he will never be able to escape them, and that we will never work out - nor will anything he ever wants in life that flies in the face of what they think is right. Ordinarily I would tell somebody to fight that and keep faith, but not if their family has gone to the extent of threatening them like this.

I keep hoping some freak thing will happen, they'll wake up and realise what they've done, or they'll just leave him alone one day, but I know that's never going to happen. Idk, I don't know what I'm looking for except how to move on from this mess. I feel traumatised. I don't know how to deal with a breakup that isn't just two people falling out of love."

a8dwt8,10,2018-12-21,Question about a pain management patient (Daily MME = 570),Mr__Science,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/a8dwt8/question_about_a_pain_management_patient_daily/,"Hello, I'm a P2 intern at a retail-chain pharmacy with 6+ years of work experience. I would like your opinion on the safety/appropriateness of a pain medication regimen for a patient I helped today (based on the patient's total daily MME).

This patient (~63 years old) is on the following medications:
1. Oxymorphone ER 40mg, #120, 2 tabs BID
2. Percocet 10/325mg, #200, 2 tabs q 4-6 hours prn (to last 30 days)

Based on this, the patient's daily opioid doses are:
1. Oxymorphone = 160mg daily
2. Oxycodone = ~60mg daily

I have calculated the patient's MME = 570

According to the CDC, caution (or avoiding) doses &gt;90 MME is advised.
I know that many patients exceed 90 MME per day, but I personally have never seen a patient with this high of a MME.

My question is, what indication(s) would possibly warrant a MME of 570, in which the benefits outweigh the risks?
(Admittedly, I do not know the patient's medical conditions and my pharmacist filled the prescriptions based on past-fill history.)

Thank you all and have a pleasant holiday season!

Edit/Follow-up inquiry:
I sincerely appreciate all of your responses! 
As a follow-up, I have another question:
1. At what point, in escalating opioid therapy (related to MME values), do we have to begin to be seriously concerned about potential fatal respiratory depression? Or is that threshold solely related to each individual patient's tolerance/response?"
a8eegq,29,2018-12-21,Passed ICND1 896/832,kelvinmocrack,ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/a8eegq/passed_icnd1_896832/,"**Background Info:** College student who took some Cisco courses previously. That was the first time I was exposed to Cisco equipment and I had a great teacher who made the class engaging and fun. I also interned at a University over the summer and they let me config some switches as part of my job and even let me set up my own lab to practice with during my lunch. That helped a lot. 

**What I Used:** Lammle Book was great and easy to read, although it could have gone more in depth a little more at times. Lammle Videos on Lynda. My school gives us a free sub to Lynda so I used that and that helped me understand some things I didn't quite get reading. Lammle Packet Tracer labs: Really helped reinforce things so I didn't forget. You really need to the lab if you're planning on taking the exam it helps so much. This subreddit helped a lot too. 

Boson exam. This saved me. If you are on the fence about it I really recommend you buy it, it's fantastic. Also I never passed a Boson exam the first time. Highest I ever got on a fresh attempt was a low 600. With that said once I took them all, I used the random exam feature and that seemed to help mix things up enough where I wasn't just memorizing the questions.  I ended up scoring in the 800s every time after I took them all though. They definitely get harder as you go from A through E. Also read the explanations even on the ones you got correct!

**The Exam:**  Easier than all the Boson exams but DO NOT underestimate it at all. There were things on it that I did not study for at all but only kinda knew what the answer was because of the Internship and Cisco courses through school. I didn't get a direct subnetting question but you need to know how to subnet period. Know your show commands because show run will not be enough on some of the questions. 

**TLDR:** I had some experience with Cisco stuff before the exam. I used the Lammle book, video series, and labs. I also used Boson Exsim. The exam is easier than Boson, but do not underestimate it. Know how to subnet and your show commands."

I have always wanted to work in hospitality, and working for Evermore is the highest level you can get. After years of school and internships at small resorts, I have hit the big leagues... well... kinda. The Evermore Resort is an inclusive, futa, female, monster girl only Resort, and is very open sexually! People come from all over the world to experience what the resort has to offer. 

To be able to work for this Resort, you have to sign up as a ""Handler"". You live on site and depending on what level of Handler you are, you spend your days helping the guests... but not with their bags... Young girl nervous about her first time, you show her how it is done. A couple looking for a third, thats you! Someone just looking to let loose, thats your job! No matter the request it is the Handlers job to make the customer happy.

The higher of level you sign up for, the shorter you are on the waiting list, I am signing up as Dragoon Handler, meaning I am 100% on the clock, but it means I will be a full level staff member in only 6 months!

For Dragoon level I have to sign up for a week of orientation... I wonder what I will learn...

Hello DPP!

​

So I am going with something different today. I am looking for someone to play either a guest at the Resort, a staff member, or play as gm and control all the characters I interact with! We can discuss all the details together :3

Heads up, I only play submissive, and my only limits are: scat, death, beast, gore and vore

Kinks!: Futa, huge size, transformation, orgasm control, cum inflation, forced orgasm, DP, TP, multi cocks, through and through, furry, monsters, fantasy, magic, passionate/ intense love, romance. etc.

Also all of my futas have a pussy and cock, balls are optional!

Hope to hear from you soon xoxo"
a8fkxo,1,2018-12-21,What is wrong with me??,AHthegoat,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a8fkxo/what_is_wrong_with_me/,"Hi,

I'm fucked up.

This post will be super honest and revealing maybe sound narcissistic but whatever its the truth

I have a goal in life that  is deep rooted in purpose and is about something I really love doing but I am too lazy to put in the work to do it. Why do I procrastinate? I have exams that 1000% I can get a first in easily if I put the work in but I don't. I have internships I should apply for that will be fun for next year but don't. 

I just can't bring myself to sit down and start doing it. I think its because 1)I'm addicted to the easy comfort of the internet and the short term pleasure it brings 2) I am scared of both failure and success that I try and fail and im not good enough or I succeed and it not as good as I thought it would be so I am now depressed and it wold have been better as a dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm insecure that im not good enough because I don't have enough life experience to talk about or show off about, im all talk no action, my dad failed in life and I will also be a failure, my family are lower middle class, not smart enough and I don't know what I don't know (self deluded), im skinny and can't get girls, my brain works kind of weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up not being allowed outside the house and an only child with my mum babying me and my dad either babying me or being super distant. As a result I'm not good at talking to people and the self worth problem plus the overthinking situations makes my social life kind of shit. I have about 2 good friends and a total of 5 friends (including the good friends). 

&amp;#x200B;

I came home from university for Christmas and I can't get along with my family because I think my mum is too overbearing due to her insecurities of not having a happy family and her shouting all the time and my dad is ok but distant and annoying. My grandma thinks im a piece of shit because I don't want to ring her because idk how to talk to her due to her being religious (im not) and old and I have shitty social skills also. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an expectation of life that it just isn't living up to because of my poor social skills, laziness, bad family dynamics, lack of women, inability to make cool plans and also my insecurities and weird brain/mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think im really smart with lots of potential and alot of great ideas but I can't get past these issues and also I have crushing existential depression and the feeling/ fear none of this is even real. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

a8ggai,0,2018-12-21,Using sex for power and control.. help!,Exoticgurllll,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/a8ggai/using_sex_for_power_and_control_help/,"I met a married man, who was 13 years older, in 2015 when I was unhappy with my then-relationship and had an on-and-off two years affair with him till 2017. The way he made me feel was nothing I had experienced before- in short, he made me feel wanted and desired.

Eventually, I broke off the relationship with my then-boyfriend in 2016 and left the married man to start a new life in a new country. Before I left, I had a string of meaningless hookups, with the exception of one guy whom I fell hard for but he married someone else because I was just a hook-up buddy.

The biggest mistake I made when I was alone in a new country was I hooked up with a guy 8 years younger than me at campus party (he is the 21 years old undergrad and I am the graduate student). HE IS TOTALLY MY TYPE. I instantly did the love bombing (something I picked up from the married man I was with)- showering him with attention/ affection/ compliments to keep him coming back because he seemed like an easy target due to his age and I wanted to keep him around for as long as I could for my selfish needs. I relished everytime he showed his neediness or his emotions of missing me/ not wanting to lose me. The sex was crazily good because I knew how to make it good. Anyway, I had been exclusively hooking up with him for one year. Four month ago we had to stop our arrangement because he had to be away for some school internship. He will be back in less than two weeks.

Obviously I liked him as a person, that was why I kept seeing him and no one else. We bonded and shit, but nothing (no drinks or movies) outside of the bedroom. I also knew it was not meant to be serious as nothing good would come out of it.  So I was relieved that he went away because I would get the space and time to move on. However, we keep in contact throughout the past four months.. he got exasperated when he sensed that I was pulling away (i.e. stopped responding to his messages, taking longer time than usual to reply, or plain ignoring him). To be frank, he could be such an ass to me due to his emotional immaturity and sense of entitlement so he deserved such treatment. That was when we started having some ""serious"" talks. He was quoted saying ""so you don't want to have anything to do with me?"" ""but I want to have something to do with you."" ""I want to continue whatever we are having as long as it is sensible and practical."" He kept saying he wanted to see me because he misses me, I am unique, I am not like anyone he has slept with and he does not want to lose that, I was sexy as hell and sex with me was nothing like sex with somebody else blablabla. I told him that was not possible as I want something more and better for myself (i.e. relationship and commitment). Eventually, the answers I got from him was ""I am not serious about you or anything."" ""I/ my body is yours only when I am with yours.""

I never slept with anyone other than him in the past one year. In his absence over the past four months, I just couldn't bring myself to meet new people or sleep with strangers. I am also aware that I am not in a good place for a relationship or anything. Truthfully, at this point that it is best to have no contact and move on, which I did try but I always cave in and unblock him after two weeks because I miss talking to him.

Sometimes I don't really care about him (I do get attached to him and shit) but I care more about how he makes me feel. I was happy when I knew I had him totally wrapped around my finger. But he is someone with his own mind, a strong one.. I lost my power and control the moment I cared so much and it is obvious I am losing the entire game because he only wanted me for sex and nothing more. The sex was great because I made it great!  But all these men want me around for sex and sentimental values but none of them considers marrying me, it hurts my ego and pride badly.

Obviously, I need help but the appointment with my counselor is not happening anytime soon. I WANT TO SEE HIM WHEN HE IS BACK. He is talking about seeing me as soon as he is back and I know I am weak at the thought of having him again. I am burning with desire :( Plus, I still want to play the game even though I am losing.

Someone please analyse and knock some sense into me.  :( Any pills I can take to erase memories of past one year with him?"
a8gu8y,22,2018-12-21,I feel like I’d be losing so much if I stay with him,hunnybadger_,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/a8gu8y/i_feel_like_id_be_losing_so_much_if_i_stay_with/,"Hi everyone. 

I (20F) was cheated on a little over two years ago by my boyfriend who is now my husband. It was mainly physical, and he confessed to me about a week later. We were only about 3 months into our relationship at the time. I forgave him because I loved him, and he was sincerely asking for a second chance. 
It was very difficult for me immediately afterward, and I thought long and hard about the decision I made and whether or not I should stick with it. I’m a very contemplative person and I spend hours considering the nuances of any situation. But I was completely unaware of what kinds of deep psychological pain the cheating would entail. I brushed it under the rug, and we got married about 5 months later.
I suppressed thinking about the cheating for the year after it happened. I thought I was going to be okay, and he did too. But everything exploded in the second year post-cheating - this past year. This past year has been so overwhelming for me. I fell into depression and I now have anxious tendencies. I doubted everything he did, where he was, all of his female friends. I became clingy and dependent, whereas I used to be carefree and independent beforehand. 
I am a creative writer, and after dismissing the idea over and over again, I decided to try writing about the cheating in an attempt to heal, but it only sent me down to the worst mental and emotional state I have ever been in. People usually say that writing is healing, but that is far from the truth. Writing is a process, and so the act of crafting a nonfiction essay for me was the act of more self-discovery, into the darkest recesses of my mind. I went insane. I was absolutely hysterical for months, and so very anxious. I would have moments where I felt like I was losing my mind, screaming and sobbing episodes in the car where I begged the universe to let me escape my mind. My husband would be next to me in the car, feeling helpless as I repeatedly screamed, “I want to hide. I want to run away.” I have a very vivid imagination, which did not and does not help when I think about what they did in bed together or what they said to each other, little moments of affection and the nude. 
I was in this dark hole for a few months, and then it was a little better, or so I thought. My soul quieted some. These last three months I became an independent woman again. I am a triple major, but I’m graduating a semester early. I have a full ride scholarship to the university. This past semester, I started the first of my graduate classes, i was an academic assistant to an English professor, and I was a writer for a popular news publication in the city. I submitted my creative work to a journal as well. I am so proud of myself for coming this far. I am also planning to launch a nonprofit in 2019, I am applying for a paid internship in Manhattan at Penguin Random House for the coming summer, I will be an ambassador of my university, and I am also applying for a major scholarship to further my education in creative writing in England. 

I recognize that these are all accomplishments for myself, and not necessarily for both me and my husband together. To be honest, I have been disappointed in what I’ve seen in him. He also attends the same university as me, but he didn’t do much with himself this semester. He had a lot of time on his hands, and he would tell people that he was using this time to “better himself”, but I don’t really understand what that meant. I feel that he has lacked ambition and has been very complacent, and because of this and the memories of the cheating that have never completely escaped me, I started to lose my desire for him and make excuses so as to avoid sex. The past three months have been very bittersweet for me, but it seems that he believed we were completely fine. 
Every time I look at him, it’s always tinged with sadness because I feel robbed of the complete love I could be giving to him. I don’t think I can ever trust him the same way, and I don’t think I can ever love him like I did before he betrayed me. And I feel that it’s very unfair that I have to undergo the consequences of his actions. 
Towards the end of the semester, there was another man who was incredibly interested in me and pursued me, knowing about the pain I was going through in my current relationship because he had been reading my poetry. And I couldn’t help but think, “what is it like to be loved and cared for by someone from the very beginning? What is it like to trust someone wholeheartedly, and to love them in such a carefree way?” I have never been in a relationship in which I have not been cheated on, and I want to know what that’s like. I haven’t pursued this man because i don’t want to hurt my husband like he hurt me. I would divorce him before I pursued someone else. 
As the semester was winding down, i began to fall deep into the pit again, of self doubt and zero self esteem. I am so deeply scarred and have been crying myself to sleep every night. I want to escape the trappings of my mind. The world just feels big and unfair, and I feel so small. I feel that my relationship with my husband is stained, and I don’t think I can ever love completely again or feel free and pure if I continue to stay with him. My desire is for freedom and purity, and I have pretty much resigned myself to idea that only a divorce would bring me these things, although to do that would make many people around us sad. 
My husband has never cheated on me since. That was the one and only time. And he has been loving and supportive in the ways that he’s felt he could be. I would also feel bad for leaving someone who has been this good to me. I’m torn on what I should do.

I feel that I had and maybe still have a big heart that has so much capacity for love and trust, but I don’t feel that I can have that with my husband anymore. I feel that it’s been ruined. All my once-exciting plans for the future now seem intimidating because I’m scared of having them with someone I can’t completely trust. Ive always wanted many children, but im scared of bringing them into a world and a family where their mama carries a lot of intimate pain caused by their daddy. I want to be free of my shackles and I want to start over and pursue a new life with someone else who will take better care of me - also someone who I have more in common with, and someone who has even more similar ambitions. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy post. This is all my heavy heart. I am so eager to read the advice you all can offer me. "

It was great. I had fun and passion in life. I had friends and some times boyfriends but mostly : no more ups and downs that really took me along or affected me on school etc.

I got bored and went on a trip for my last internship and met this guy. We are still together but it hasn't been easy. I've been scared alot. To lose him, myself and the situation to not have things in control again.

We just emigrated to a new country together and live with his family now in their house. I just don't feel home. I feel good with my so and stuff but the whole situation just keeps on triggering me and has me down like 2 days good, 2 days bad. 

I haven't had suicidal thoughts that much but still. I feel like I will be happy again in the longer while, but not for now. I took this as a new challenge in life and I felt like I was ready. Now I just try not to think about my family in my home country that I celebrated Christmas with every year. Just put up a smile and talk about it when I can't hide my tears anymore to my so. I don't know how to change this situation since we are stuck here untill he and I find a job and a house. 

I've got no friends or family here except for them, but they are not the most understanding or caring people. They mean well but yea. They don't know my past. Only that I don't have a mom anymore. They once joked about depression ""that it wasn't a real thing and just work out and you'll feel better, you don't need meds"" so I won't open up to them.

I just have a hard time coping here but try to focus on the good parts so I don't fall in a down again for a few days. Not with Christmas atleast. I've looked into therapy here again, but it's over the phone? Idk."

I'm very bad at trimming my writing. TL;DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I (20F) have been struggling to come up with ways to do more things for my boyfriend (21M).

I want to start off by saying that in general things are going really well. If I kept doing as I do now I still think things would be fine. We've been dating for 7 months now, but we've been good friends for 3 years and this is the healthiest relationship ether of us have ever been in.  I think that's one of the reasons why I feel like I need to do more for him. My instinct is to buy him things or to do more affectionate gestures for him when he's having a bad day or something is bothering him. He's very good at doing these things for me but I feel like I'm not as good at reading him as he is at reading me.

We're both very honest with each other, but sometimes he won't tell me if something's bothering him so I don't know he could use a pick me up. He's also hard to get gifts for because he feels guilty when other people spend money on him, isn't materialistic, and is trying to watch his weight. Getting him something material or something he can eat can be a real challenge. He's also a college student with weekly athletic commitments and outside of classes he's putting together a portfolio so he can apply to internships, so he doesn't really have time for ""experience"" gifts ether.

When there are times that I can do something for him, I won't notice the opportunity until thinking about it later or I'll handle it incorrectly. To give a few examples when he mentions he messed up and it's bothering him I'll react like I would someone I'm in a platonic relationship with (I have very little romantic relationship experience) or I'll ask him a bunch of questions, analyze the situation, and try to tell him what he can do differently next time. I KNOW that isn't actually helpful and comes across as self righteous, but I just have no idea I'm handling the situation wrong until I'm reflecting later.

Finally, when I do bigger gestures for him, I get worried I'm messing it up or something's going to go wrong, he notices, and it becomes more about me instead. We recently took a two day trip. It was for an interview I had so I did most of the planning for it. The first day exhausted me so the second was spent mostly with him making sure I was feeling ok. We talked about it, and while we both still enjoyed it we both were very worried about making sure the other enjoyed themselves the whole time which took away from the experience.

TL;DR I'm bad at noticing my boyfriends emotional needs. How can I get better at reacting properly to my boyfriends needs in the moment? How do I stop overthinking my romantic gestures? And what the heck do I get for my boyfriend that hates frivolous items and is trying to cut back on how much he's eating?  


Oh also I totally realize I might be overthinking things so I'm open to that type of feedback as well."

a8ikud,2,2018-12-22,"My (22, M) girlfriend (22, F) is depressed, aggressive, nonsensical. Trying to make it work, but I need advice. (WARNING: long post)",Chumpchange13579,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a8ikud/my_22_m_girlfriend_22_f_is_depressed_aggressive/,"Hey guys, thanks in advance for reading all this. I know it's a horribly long post. Genuine advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to start so I will just jump right into it and fill holes as I go on. So, when I first met my girlfriend, we would spend every day together and I loved it. She would randomly stop by and visit me after her uni lectures or work. After about a month together, she had to temporarily relocate for an internship. We visited each other as often as possible (every 2-3 weeks because she was financially able to make this happen). Soon after (3-4 months in), we decided to move in together. At first things were fine, but they worsened for 2 months. During these times, I felt I didn't know her. She was cold, distant, and did not give a fuck about me. It was also around then that I told her to go seek mental help. After we got a dog together, things were improved. We would argue less, though she would still be a bit bossy, ungrateful and occasionally aggressive. She bites, pinches, and smacks me even when I tell her to stop. There have been situations where there was no reasoning with her. She would scream at me or try to humiliate me and manipulate me. Overall, things were better towards the end of our year-long lease. After that, I had to relocate for medical school. We are now long distance as I live a 4 hour drive away. I see her every weekend. Things are starting to worsen again. She has become jealous and more insecure than ever. Any female friend I make is questioned and she is full of accusations. I have cut friends out of my life because of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, she has stopped taking her antidepressants. Bringing this up makes her furious. She cries for almost any reason now. She says very hurtful things like “you’re useless” or “ I don’t love you” and claims they’re all jokes, but if I dare say anything like that, she explodes on me and says that I don’t love her. She perpetually says I do not love her, care for her, or understand her. I have tried asking why, but she refuses to answer a single time. I can’t help if she does not communicate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After the first 3 months, sex went from 2-9 times per day to a drastic 1 time every 2-3 weeks. Dramatic change. She had zero sexual drive and would often turn down any advances I would make. Eventually she would turn down dates and outing I would plan. The only time sex would be brought up was if I complained enough. Even then, it was purely duty sex. There is zero participation on her end. She just sits there and does nothing during it all. I even make sure she gets off before I do nearly every time. I am not selfish about sex. I have always put her first when it comes to sex. At one point in the relationship she began talking about “size” and started comparing me to her exes. Though I was never once insecure, I began to question myself and was brought down severely because of this mindset of hers. We’ve talked about how it made me feel and she has yet to do it again. Glad that aspect improved.  Regardless, our sex (for people in their young 20s) is definitely abnormal and infrequent…and dissatisfying. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s talk about her social behavior now. This is a girl that had all male friends during Uni. Frequently she would go out with her friends for hours in evenings and put them before me. At one point, she was impossible to reach for 4 hours in the evening while with a friend she went to church with. Mind you, she is not religious. She has in the past occulted the fact that she went out drinking with work buddies, and I got her to admit it after snooping through her phone. She recently started deleting parts of conversations from her phone (not that I can even check it because she has a lock code I do not know). She started accusing me of deleting messages from my phone, and I turned it back on her because it was total bullshit. It’s the guilty who are most suspicious. I have limited time. I study then I talk/game with her. I don’t have time to screw around. I don’t have the INTEREST or DESIRE to screw around with another girl. I am only interested in her. Though she has gained 45 lbs since we started dating, I still find her attractive. I still love her more than I did before. Infidelity is NOT an issue on my end. My father cheated on my mother, which lead to divorce. She keeps saying she is scared “history will repeat itself” and that I will cheat on her after marriage. I have given her NO reason to think I would cheat on her.

&amp;#x200B;

I have, however, given her a single reason to question me. I ONCE hid an outing with a friend (MALE FRIEND FROM MY YOUTH. BOTH OF US ARE HETERO MALES. NO CONCERN). She was snooping through my smart watch and found this out.  She was livid and insisted she could no longer trust me…after she has occulted many things about her male friends. She painted me as a monster to my own family because of this. Total misrepresentation of who I really am. This gave me insight that she portrays me in a horrible light. Imagine…if she makes me look like a monster to MY FAMILY. PEOPLE WHO DEFEND ME. IMAGINE how she must portray me to her friends. One of which, I absolutely abhor. This kid constantly makes her question the relationship and fills her head with doubts. This kid is a strange one that will break up with girls if any one thing is not perfect with them…so I hear. This kid lived with his parents his whole life, has never paid a bill in his life, and has no live experience to speak from. This is also the kid whose texts she deletes because she does not want me to find out that “he asked her how she was doing” because “ I will get mad and a fight will start because I saw his name”. Complete bullshit. She still keeps in contact with him after both ME and HER MOTHER have insisted that she cut this toxic person from her life. Though, I wonder how she presents the relationship to this kid. After the whole incident where she found out I went to dinner with a MALE friend of mine…my best friend…I doubt she presents me pleasantly when she isn’t hiding my existence from her male friends because “it might scare her guy friends away”. Apparently, this behavior has stopped, but how the hell would I know. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all so shitty because in plain writing it sounds absolutely miserable. There are so many good things to her as well. She is definitely selfless with her money, has many similar interests, is truly a joy to be around when she is in a good mood. I love all the memories we get to share when we are not fighting. I really love the good times with her. I want to find a way to get rid of all the negative shit if possible. If I could only share in the good with her, I would be with her forever. Her family loves me and considers me their son, we have a beautiful dog together, and I absolutely love her and miss her when I do not see her. I need some input/insight/advice on what to do. This is a relationship I care about. I have been in a few long term relationships, so I know this is not lustful/fool’s love. I definitely feel something for her that I didn’t with other girls. She refuses to talk about her antidepressants or even take them. I feel this is killing our positive streak we have had the past 3 months now. We have been together over 20 months now. If things keep going like this, I don’t know how much longer I can last. She’s perpetually doubting me, snooping through all my devices, and now back to hurting me physically. She will do things that make me uncomfortable and then claim they’re “jokes” when I get fed up with them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; rocky relationship of GF of 20+ months is starting to worsen again, but I absolutely love her and want to only have positivity in the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if something did not make sense or if clarifications are needed. I genuinely need an experienced soul to help me out. I need guidance and have nobody I can turn to at the moment. "

The Furstenbergs manage the Clintons. Diane von Furstenberg and her husband Barry Diller can be seen with the Clintons many times. Chelsea Clinton works with the Furstenbergs and IAC in New York. The German word Furst means first or prince. The German word burg means a fortified tower or stronghold. They are a first defense for the global crime syndicate. The House of Furstenberg are Roman Catholic and are intermarried with Italian and Austrian nobilities like the House of Windisch-Graetz, House of Schwarzenberg, and House of Hohenloe. They are also intermarried with some Jewish bloodlines as well as being involved with the Nazis. Prince Maximilian Egon II of Furstenberg was a friend of Willem II and was a commander of a Nazi paramilitary regiment. Gloria Guinness married Prince Franz Egon of Furstenberg-Herdringen and she was suspected of being a Nazi spy. Adelina von Furstenberg married Gloria Guinness' son Prince Franz Egon von Furstenberg-Herdringen and they reside in Switzerland. The Guinness family also married with the Greek Niarchos family. Prince Alexander's wife is Alexandra von Furstenberg from the billionaire Miller family and her sister is Marie-Chantal the Crown Princess of Greece. Victoria Niarchos parents were from the Guinness and Furstenberg families and she married the Greek billionaire Philip Niarchos. Diane von Furstenberg first married into the Furstenberg family and still uses the name even after getting remarried to the multi-billionaire Barry Diller who is a co-founder of Fox Broadcasting Network along with the Vatican knight of St Gregory Rupert Murdoch who is worth over 13 billion. The family has residences in the United States. The Vatican is controlling Fox Network and Fox News. The Furstenberg family are top members of the Holy Roman Catholic League and many members of the family are Knights of Malta. Talita von Furstenberg is an American fashion model who goes to Jesuit Georgetown and worked for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

Many members of the Furstenberg family are involved in acting, fashion, media, and they receive their education in Switzerland. They have residences in Switzerland because of private Swiss banking which allows them to conceal their wealth. They work with the Rothschilds and both the Jewish and Irish mafias in the United States. The German Furstenbergs married with the Irish Guinness banking family and the Guinness' married with the Jewish Rothschild family. Alexander of Furstenberg is the CEO and founder of Ranger Global Advisors and was CEO of Arrow Capital Management and a board member of W.P. Stewart &amp; Co. which is a subsidiary of AllianceBernstein based in Bermuda. Prince Alexander is also on the board of directors for IAC broadcasting with his step father Barry Diller as the chairman. IAC is a large media and internet company. Chelsea Clinton is another board member for IAC. IAC also bought out Savoy Pictures which takes its name from the House of Savoy. Savoy Pictures produced the movie a Bronx Tale another Hollywood mafia film that connects back to the Italian Nobility. Prince Antonius of Furstenberg married Princess Matilde Borromeo of the Italian Nobility. Edoardo Agnelli was a major shareholder of Fiat and his daughter Clara Agnelli married Prince Tassilo of Furstenberg and they are the parents of Prince Egon von Furstenberg. The Borromeo family are also intermarried with the Agnelli family and are involved with Italian media just as the Furstenbergs and Barry Diller work in the US media. The billionaire and murderous pedophile Oprah Winfrey who is nicknamed the ""Queen of All Media"" is close friends with Diane von Furstenberg. The Furstenberg, Agnelli, and Borromeo families are all closely working together. The Furstenberg family are like a top or first Holy Roman Nobility in authority due to their connections with the Vatican. Peter Freiherr von Furstenberg is Vice President of the German Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Prince Christian von Furstenberg was Jesuit educated from Georgetown and is also a Knight of Malta. Princess Massimiliana von Furstenberg is a Lady of Malta. The Furstenbergs originated from the ancient Bosonid dynasty and Boso the Elder. The Rothschilds were also related to the Bosonids with Richildis Bosonid.

 The Furstenberg family incorporate a jester on their coat of arms. The Furstenbergs have a high authority over the Masonic Royal Order of Jesters as well as the Juggalo gangs. the horror rap group Insane Clowne Posse are criminal bosses that run the Juggalo gangs which are involved in assaults, blood drinking, and terrorism. They are an officially recognized criminal gang. Bozo the Clown refers to Boso the Elder and the Bosonids. The Masonic Jesters are the most sadistic and menacing secret society involved with getting intoxicated off adrenaline filled human blood and then terrorizing people with threats, slander, and lies. The Order of Jesters also uses comedy for political manipulation and deflecting from serious issues. Barry Diller owns CollegeHumor with members connected with SNL, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, and the Daily Show. The Furstenberg family also use black and white colors on their coat of arms which is another Masonic symbol. Barack Obama is a member of the Royal Order of Jesters and is a ruthless terrorist that sacrificed the woman Miriam Carey through electronic harassment. Alex Jones is a Masonic Jester and once posed as the Joker during a radio show. Mark Dice is a Jester that turns exposing evil criminals into a joke and distraction and he is managed by the evil comedian Sarah Silverman. Ben Silverman has worked with Barry Diller and IAC through Electus. Ben Silverman is really evil. The pearl on the Furstenberg coat of arms symbolizes the shell of Venus and the Venetian merchants. The Furstenberg family produced several bishops and priests for the Roman Catholic Church like Cardinal Friedrich Egon of Furstenberg, Archbishop Franz Egon of Furstenberg who was also prime minister for Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, and Cardinal Maximilien de Furstenberg of Belgium. Prince Heinrich of Furstenberg is the current head of the House of Furstenberg and his wife is Princess Maximiliane of Windisch-Graetz Austrian nobility. Prince Antonius of Furstenberg and Prince Alexander of Furstenberg are both menacing and sadistic. Prince Heinrich was educated in Vienna Austria and is a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Prince Heinrich is a major private landowner with properties all over Germany, Austria, and Canada and the Furstenberg family still own many castles throughout the former Holy Roman Empire. They are the second largest private landowners in Germany. They are psychotic and dangerous terrorists. This family is insanely sadistic.

a8j6m6,2,2018-12-22,Unholy Roman Furstenbozos,AhuwahZeus,TopConspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TopConspiracy/comments/a8j6m6/unholy_roman_furstenbozos/,"The Furstenberg family are one of the most wicked and influential German nobilities and are deeply connected with the Vatican and Switzerland. The Furstenbergs manage the Clintons. Diane von Furstenberg and her husband Barry Diller can be seen with the Clintons many times. Chelsea Clinton works with the Furstenbergs and IAC in New York. The German word Furst means first or prince. The German word burg means a fortified tower or stronghold. They are a first defense for the global crime syndicate. The House of Furstenberg are Roman Catholic and are intermarried with Italian and Austrian nobilities like the House of Windisch-Graetz, House of Schwarzenberg, and House of Hohenloe. They are also intermarried with some Jewish bloodlines as well as being involved with the Nazis. Prince Maximilian Egon II of Furstenberg was a friend of Willem II and was a commander of a Nazi paramilitary regiment. Gloria Guinness married Prince Franz Egon of Furstenberg-Herdringen and she was suspected of being a Nazi spy. Adelina von Furstenberg married Gloria Guinness' son Prince Franz Egon von Furstenberg-Herdringen and they reside in Switzerland. The Guinness family also married with the Greek Niarchos family. Prince Alexander's wife is Alexandra von Furstenberg from the billionaire Miller family and her sister is Marie-Chantal the Crown Princess of Greece. Victoria Niarchos parents were from the Guinness and Furstenberg families and she married the Greek billionaire Philip Niarchos. Diane von Furstenberg first married into the Furstenberg family and still uses the name even after getting remarried to the multi-billionaire Barry Diller who is a co-founder of Fox Broadcasting Network along with the Vatican knight of St Gregory Rupert Murdoch who is worth over 13 billion. The family has residences in the United States. The Vatican is controlling Fox Network and Fox News. The Furstenberg family are top members of the Holy Roman Catholic League and many members of the family are Knights of Malta. Talita von Furstenberg is an American fashion model who goes to Jesuit Georgetown and worked for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

Many members of the Furstenberg family are involved in acting, fashion, media, and they receive their education in Switzerland. They have residences in Switzerland because of private Swiss banking which allows them to conceal their wealth. They work with the Rothschilds and both the Jewish and Irish mafias in the United States. The German Furstenbergs married with the Irish Guinness banking family and the Guinness' married with the Jewish Rothschild family. Alexander of Furstenberg is the CEO and founder of Ranger Global Advisors and was CEO of Arrow Capital Management and a board member of W.P. Stewart &amp; Co. which is a subsidiary of AllianceBernstein based in Bermuda. Prince Alexander is also on the board of directors for IAC broadcasting with his step father Barry Diller as the chairman. IAC is a large media and internet company. Chelsea Clinton is another board member for IAC. IAC also bought out Savoy Pictures which takes its name from the House of Savoy. Savoy Pictures produced the movie a Bronx Tale another Hollywood mafia film that connects back to the Italian Nobility. Prince Antonius of Furstenberg married Princess Matilde Borromeo of the Italian Nobility. Edoardo Agnelli was a major shareholder of Fiat and his daughter Clara Agnelli married Prince Tassilo of Furstenberg and they are the parents of Prince Egon von Furstenberg. The Borromeo family are also intermarried with the Agnelli family and are involved with Italian media just as the Furstenbergs and Barry Diller work in the US media. The billionaire and murderous pedophile Oprah Winfrey who is nicknamed the ""Queen of All Media"" is close friends with Diane von Furstenberg. The Furstenberg, Agnelli, and Borromeo families are all closely working together. The Furstenberg family are like a top or first Holy Roman Nobility in authority due to their connections with the Vatican. Peter Freiherr von Furstenberg is Vice President of the German Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Prince Christian von Furstenberg was Jesuit educated from Georgetown and is also a Knight of Malta. Princess Massimiliana von Furstenberg is a Lady of Malta. The Furstenbergs originated from the ancient Bosonid dynasty and Boso the Elder. The Rothschilds were also related to the Bosonids with Richildis Bosonid.

 The Furstenberg family incorporate a jester on their coat of arms. The Furstenbergs have a high authority over the Masonic Royal Order of Jesters as well as the Juggalo gangs. the horror rap group Insane Clowne Posse are criminal bosses that run the Juggalo gangs which are involved in assaults, blood drinking, and terrorism. They are an officially recognized criminal gang. Bozo the Clown refers to Boso the Elder and the Bosonids. The Masonic Jesters are the most sadistic and menacing secret society involved with getting intoxicated off adrenaline filled human blood and then terrorizing people with threats, slander, and lies. The Order of Jesters also uses comedy for political manipulation and deflecting from serious issues. Barry Diller owns CollegeHumor with members connected with SNL, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, and the Daily Show. The Furstenberg family also use black and white colors on their coat of arms which is another Masonic symbol. Barack Obama is a member of the Royal Order of Jesters and is a ruthless terrorist that sacrificed the woman Miriam Carey through electronic harassment. The Jesters were founded in Hawaii where Obama is from. Alex Jones is a Masonic Jester and once posed as the Joker during a radio show. Mark Dice is a Jester that turns exposing evil criminals into a joke and distraction and he is managed by the evil comedian Sarah Silverman. Ben Silverman has worked with Barry Diller and IAC through Electus. Ben Silverman is really evil. The pearl on the Furstenberg coat of arms symbolizes the shell of Venus and the Venetian merchants. The Furstenberg family produced several bishops and priests for the Roman Catholic Church like Cardinal Friedrich Egon of Furstenberg, Archbishop Franz Egon of Furstenberg who was also prime minister for Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, and Cardinal Maximilien de Furstenberg of Belgium. Prince Heinrich of Furstenberg is the current head of the House of Furstenberg and his wife is Princess Maximiliane of Windisch-Graetz Austrian nobility. Prince Antonius of Furstenberg and Prince Alexander of Furstenberg are both menacing and sadistic.

I  want to start by saying I matched at a program about halfway down my rank list, and I have honestly really enjoyed the people and my program, but it's across the country in a state where I know virtually nobody, and in a small-ish town in the southeastern United States. It's faster to go to Europe than to see my friends and family in the west.

The first few months of residency were really awesome -- I was surprised at how much I liked the area and my coworkers, how though residency is tough I was making friends easily and things were generally OK. I was on some pretty easy rotations, too.

But starting at the end of September, things started to go south. I had a long-distance boyfriend I was getting less and less happy with and could not see a future with for several reasons (even though he had been supportive and wanted to move to be with my from across the country), and one night I unexpectedly hit it off hard with another resident  (something that rarely happens to me) and I dumped my ex to pursue things with this new guy. Things were going AMAZING and we got along on so many levels are were obsessed with each other, and then about a month into the relationship something happened after dinner together and he just sort of got turned off -- not sure what it was exactly, maybe something I said or did, still no idea. But we went from seeing each other and texting constantly to him blowing hot and cold, and being just weird in general, to finally just kind of fading out and ghosting me, which really hurt after things were going so well.

Instantly I started to beat myself up and question what I had done to ruin the relationship, so I met him for beers (for which he flaked on me twice) and he just said that he had trepidation in dating me and there were little things about me that he didn't like and didn't want to be serious, even though he was so into me at first. I have been heartbroken ever since, feeling completely rejected and terrible about myself, and at the same time, residency has gotten really hard.

I went on to a really tough EM month, then MICU, then trauma ICU (I have no holiday time off to see my family) and I have been working so much it has been really hard to get away from the hospital and away from thoughts about this guy. About a week back he texted me asking to meet up and ""catch up"", which gave me all kinds of weird hope that he wanted to rekindle things, but I haven't heard back. Saw him at the hospital and he was all nice and huggy with me, but then never followed through on making plans when I told him I was busy the day he wanted to get together. I saw him yesterday at the hospital and he was super cordial and not warm and fuzzy at all like he had been, and I was kicking myself for holding onto some weird hope that he wanted to reconnect.

On top of this, my long-distance ex-boyfriend hates me and I found out yesterday unfriended me on Facebook and Instagram, and I feel like an asshole there too. I want so badly to move on from these guys, but I go to work every day and I am on super hard rotations, feel like a dumb intern all the time, am depressed, have no family here, and am too busy most of the time to see my co-interns. And I can't stop beating myself up over this new guy... wondering what personality flaws I have that turned him off so much, wondering how I fucked it up and how things would have been so much better if I had not fucked it up with him. I also got closer to this guy than anyone else here, and I really miss our friendship, but still have feelings for him so I am reluctant to reach out to see if he wants to be friends. I am also 31, turning 32, and just feeling terrible that in a conservative part of the SE, where men seem to want younger, more traditional women, (of which there are many), I am just fucked. I have a hard time in relationships to begin with and I just can't seem to keep anything together with anyone for very long. I look at my married friends and friends in relationships and am just so so jealous that they found the right people and worked things out and got married. My med school ex and I broke up over long distance, and I was totally in love with him but he was extremely selfish and though I saw his flaws and accepted them, I tried hard to make things work  and still failed. We broke up and he moved on immediately and got engaged, and I went three years being completely single, so I have definitely had my time being single too.

How do you get over someone you have to see a lot and that you were crazy about, who rejected you? How do you get over the guilt of leaving someone who supported you from day 1, but didn't feel 100% about?  How do I not feel terrified of becoming a single female mid-30s resident that nobody wants to date, and not having time to have kids? How to I get through intern year, coming home alone every night and obsessing about my broken heart? Anyone else been in a same situation? Does it get better? I am so depressed and getting counseling, and so far my program says I am doing well but I am dying inside. Please help.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently this semester, I didnt do too well in classes and lost my financial aid for the spring semester. As a senior who was projected to graduate next semester, I am extremely close to graduating and I really want to get out obviously. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so in order for me to graduate next semester, I could have done two things: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) go on a study abroad program and do an international internship and graduate spring of 2019. ($13,000)

&amp;#x200B;

2)stay at my university and graduate spring of 2019. ($13,000) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Each of these options are gonna cost me the same amount of money and I dont really know what to do. for the study abroad program, I have already invested quite a bit of money: 

&amp;#x200B;

1)student visa 

2) cancelled my rent with a 2 month extra penalty 

3)and all applications fee

&amp;#x200B;

all of this costed me $1000 already... so regardless of what i choose, I may or may not have already lost $1000. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason that I am currently not choosing to stay at my university in the states is because I think the internship is going to be very valuable for me to jump start my internship in the future right after graduation. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I have filled out an appeal form for me to reinstate my financial aid but i will not know if i get it until right before I am supposed to potentially fly out of this country and i need to let the company know whether or not i can go. 

&amp;#x200B;

If i do not let the company know, I will have to pay a $3500 cancellation fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

please guide me to whether or not I should do the study abroad or not? i literally have about 30 hours to make a decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

4)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

5)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo

a8kxv8,1,2018-12-22,I'm on my way to becoming a lady child,tofu_daddy97,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a8kxv8/im_on_my_way_to_becoming_a_lady_child/,"This may seem silly but the fact that my parents still won't let me drive by myself makes me so anxious. I have my license and have had it for almost 2 years now. When I drive with my dad to get ""my hours in"" I never get complaints but he does often helicopter me. What I mean by this is he'll tell me when I'm good to go, when I can merge, etc. It's not like I'm not looking when he does this but I feel like I don't gain much when I drive with him due to the fact he tells me what to do when at this point he should be focusing on making me independent enough for me to drive. It's to the point where I'm even anxious to ask because it feels like I'm never going to achieve such a simple goal. 

To give some type of background: my dad is a retired cop and I came out to my parents telling them that I was sexually assaulted earlier this year on campus so with both of these aspects it makes them both even more overprotective. I know it's because they care which makes me feel bad but still.

I have a co-op next semester in the same town as my college so I was considering saving up the money from that and getting my own damn car and insurance. Sure, that means I'll be living off of ramen during this period but it'll be worth it in my opinion. He didn't even want me to take the co-op but I did it anyway. He keeps telling me, though that if the train system there won't take me directly to the maintenance site I'd be working at then I'm not working. I'd rather walk than not take this job since this will be my first internship directly in my field. I'm afraid that this is going to affect where I'll be able to intern over the summer and honestly makes me afraid that I'll have to stay home for the summer. I'm a junior engineering major in college, I cannot do that. 

I know that it's out of love but my parents want me to stay home after I graduate so I can pay off loans and even though it's the smartest thing to do financially, I'm not sure if I can. Them babying me at this age seriously messes with my mental health. They like to pick me up pretty early as soon as I'm done with finals but when I'm at home I end up curling up in my bed and depending on Netflix and my dog to keep me company. My friends from back home all have retail jobs to keep them busy on breaks but since I'm only at home for 3 weeks no one would hire me.

 I'm the type of person who loves the outdoors so I like to go outside a lot as it makes me feel better. The closest city to my parent's house in roughly a 30 minute drive so there isn't much to do at home. Going out for a run will only do so much for me. With this I've realized being stuck inside for days to week on end makes my depression symptoms resurface so that's where I'm at right now. I end up getting depressed each time that I come home for holiday break. I was going to see if I can go back to my college town early to celebrate New Year's with my boyfriend and friends but that would mean less driving time even though I would be happier being back in my apartment. What should I do? I feel like a child even though I'm 21.

TLDR: My parents are overprotective to the point where they won't give me permission to drive on my own despite the fact that I've had my license for just about two years and I'm afraid that it's going to affect where I'll be able to get internships and later work once I graduate. Wat do."
a8kzx8,0,2018-12-22,[M4A Playing F] The Multiple prompt list. Something for everyone! I hope.. (Multiple prompts) (Open prompts) (Light or dark) (Very long!),Soapydopey69,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/a8kzx8/m4a_playing_f_the_multiple_prompt_list_something/,"Disclaimer: I am 18+ looking for someone 18+ for fictional roleplay!

Hey people of APP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

I have left the ages ambiguous on purpose, if you read this properly, you would have read this portion and you would know that I tend to play with our characters between the ages of 14-25, depending on the scenario.

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Tight clothing, CFNM and outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**The threesome with the two sisters:** It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister.

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D and C [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with Demi over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me.

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes;)"

I'm writing this here because I will spend all Christmas (until mid-January actually) alone in Taiwan. I'm currently doing an internship for my PhD but people at the office ignore me, and I had a hard time finding friends to go out.  So I thought posting here could be a great idea to make some friends worldwide and battle the moments of loneliness and boredom. 

So, a little bit about me: I'm a computer scientist working as a data scientist and am very into Linux, programming, machine learning and hating Apple and Microsoft Products (Spoiler: big nerd!). I like videogames, but I am a little bit outdated (responsabilities and stupid adulthood). I follow the Netflix mainstream shows, and I fell in love with Gordon's Ramsay shows idk why. Also, not very proud about it, into professional wrestling.

My first language is spanish,  so I am also up to language exchange. PM if you think we can have some interesting conversation :)

Thank you!"

I enjoy playing Futa but only if your character is female. This is important! If you're curious, I tend to play a more 'realistic' character and by that I mean one that isn't HH cup breasts, an ass as big as the earth and a cock the size of the empire state!

My preference of character is one that looks like Jenna Mcdougall (I'm aware she's a celeb, but I'm only using her looks not her status). If you don't know what she looks like, I recommend you google her, she's a petite blonde that should be okay for our RP. If you have a suggestion yourself about a 'natural' looking girl, let me know!

And if you're after a 'Surprise I'm futa!' Scene aswell, this can be incorporated if necessary.

a8lbme,4,2018-12-22,Moving on from four years of LDR after investing so much...,pierresderriere,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a8lbme/moving_on_from_four_years_of_ldr_after_investing/,"We met traveling and fell in love, and never thought we'd be able to make it work, but we tried. She was a medical student and working hard, I was treading water at home. Working different jobs.

We spent summers together and we visited whenever we could. We skyped as often as possible. When we were together it was heaven, but every time we had to say goodbye it was heartbreaking. the distance took its toll on both of us.

Our plan was for me to move to live with her in her home country, but we never really got it to work. At first I just couldn't get a job there because I no company could sponsor me for a work permit. 

We talked about getting married so that I could get a work permit and live with her, but she wasn't willing to do that because we hadn't had a chance to see if we can live together. It was a paradox.

In hindsight I could have tried harder to find a job, or I could have started a study. I think I was just making excuses beccause I was 

Eventually I did start a degree program, in my country. I did that because it would have been better for my long-term options to work in her country. It would have taken me two more years to finish.

But she started to have doubts, she'd already waited four years at this point, and she couldn't wait another two. The distance was painful to her, even if we could visit each other during the year.

What hurts the most is that she started communicating less and putting up an emotional wall right while I was in the middle of my first semester studying my ass off for finals.

I came to visit and see if I could salvage the relationship, or at least say goodbye, I didn't want it to end over skype. I think I just ended up making everything worse though I think. We met and had some nice times, but I should have realized in her mind the relationship was long over. I pushed too hard trying to get her to reconsider and it just ended up pushing her away.

Now I'm just fucking sad. I know the relationship is over, it's just hard to accept. I've seen this coming for months and I thought I could change things.

I'm looking at programs in her home country now because it would actually be a better fit for the field I want to study and would cost less, but it's too late for our relationship. It sucks because I already have an internship lined up in her home country for the summer, and I could start school there next fall, but it's too little too late. I had four years to make this happen, it just took too long.

Maybe someday in the future fate will bring us back together, but I need to get better at letting go peacefully, and being more secure in myself.  You can only control your own actions.

Sorry for any mistakes in the post English is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

just a backstory:

* I am madly in love with my gf let's call her P.
* I am an awesome coder.
* I have a few friends for whom I would take a bullet.
* I am in college

&amp;#x200B;

November 2017

So I was in a 2 year long relationship with P and it was going awesome. But lately I was getting a bit off feelings from her and soon one of my friends(let's name her JAG) tell me that P is cheating on me. Which made sense as I was the only one putting any effort in the relationship in past 1 year causing me to lose a bit of my social life. to confirm this I decided to hack her WhatsApp as she was hesitant to show it to me while she freely roamed my phone. My deepest fear was true she cheated on me and pretty bad. We have already decided names of our children and then I see all her messages there.

This is the time when I started smoking weed because of all of this stress.

&amp;#x200B;

January 2018

But I was too much in love way too much I decided to give her a chance to win my trust back which is my biggest mistake ever. She tried a lot and my feelings grew but not trust, that is never happening now. This was so devastating for me I lost all touch to coding and only way I felt good was through weed. I went to my friends house and cried in front of him. They were supportive that I should leave her, but I just couldn't. Finally I dumped her for good.

&amp;#x200B;

February 2018

She was still trying on me and my feelings started to show. I would leave my internship for her. Make gifts all over again.

We decided to try again. Then she suddenly sends me a screen shot from a chat with the guy she cheated on me with saying she is back with me and I saw that it was a recent message. So she still talks to him while we are trying to get back. I mean WTF!!!!. this hit me mentally pretty badly.

&amp;#x200B;

Remaining Time

She threw a birthday party for me where she invited all my friends and it was good we started again as a couple.

Then I caught her lying pretty badly to me and dumped her on her birthday.

I don't know how many times this happened but we came back in relationship again somehow but this time I caught her having late night long video calls with the guy she cheated on me with. just think of the mental stress that caused me.

&amp;#x200B;

again on after a month and I caught her lying again like a million times but just for me I decided to let all those things go as I was planning to remove her from my life as soon as college ends (May 2019). so I was like it's so common that you lie that I will give you a pass for my mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

She started going out with other guys and even my enemies. She went on date with people who tried to put me down.

it was all good as I was not serious with her and started to move on. Then all of a sudden I find out that my best friend is dating P. My fucking best friend who saw me fucking crying in his room is going out with her. When I found this out I caught both of them lying to me pretty badly. I ended all things with her forever no matter what. But my friends all left me for her, now not only my best friend but all of them. The reason being that she is a girl and MIGHT give them some action.

&amp;#x200B;

now I have no mental health, no friends, no support and for the next 6 months I have to be around people who who cheated on me for 8 hours a day. I just wanna die now. my coding died. Internship is finished with me in ""no job zone"" for my college (they are taking revenge as I left the internship which was important to them for no reason). Even to write this I had to get high, cry have a panic attack (which during a high is pretty fucking bad the intensity is enormous) but I can only think why am I alive.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ask you what would you do."

I am moving to Antwerp in a couple of months and I would really like to learn more about housing, transportation, and general tips about life in the city. I will be staying for about 4 months, doing my internship, which is in the Middelheim area.   

From some early research on housing, I found some places near Zuid-Sint Andries, Kiel and Middelheim. 
Is any of those a place to avoid? Which other areas would you suggest?  

Also, I'm thinking of buying a bike relatively cheap (new or second hand), is there a place that you would suggest?  

Any other tips are more than accepted!  

EDIT: I was thinking of taking some Dutch lessons while I'm there. I stumbled across Linguapolis but their schedule wasn't quite right for me. Do you know of any other options to learn a few things?

(Office sex),mjd931,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/a8n4wq/m4f_i_wanna_fuck_you_over_a_desk_office_sex/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.

&amp;#x200B;

Kik is mjd931

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc

&amp;#x200B;

\- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me

&amp;#x200B;

\- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

&amp;#x200B;

\- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

&amp;#x200B;

\- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

&amp;#x200B;

\- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

&amp;#x200B;

\- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

&amp;#x200B;

I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

&amp;#x200B;

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

&amp;#x200B;

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

&amp;#x200B;

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

4)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

5)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo

I would like for extreme brutality and betrayal. I have many scenarios and different types of pairings... also I am an adult looking for another adult to RP with.

stepson and stepmom on New Years Eve or mom son:

It's 11:50 pm on New Year's Eve and you've told dad about his special present waiting for him in his room at midnight. It's us and our gigantic, naked, growing, bodies making out on his bed, our stomachs large as my old grandparents are squirming the best they can as they get digested into nutrients for our growing lust filled bodies.


Doctor and daughter of ICU husband:

You father is severely ill and the bills are growing exponentially, the doctor (fresh out of med school) offers you a plan, you blow him and he'll reduce the bill by 3% each time you do this. Faced with no other option you take his deal. It's the first session and he pulls down his  pants, what lies below is a knee knocker cock that awaits to corrupt and steal you.

Scientist and you:

You work are an intern (high school or middle school) at pharmaceutical company where you notice that one of the scientist has lately become increasingly beefy and handsome. Flash forward to the Halloween  party, you and him sneak off into the basement and you bring him home with you...your bf was meeting you for trick or treating.




We can come up with other scenarios as well as pairing, also we can add more kinks as well as move kinks around. Now my favorite kinks are cheating, cuckolding, betrayal, ntr, giantess and giant, snuff, vore , gore, scat, water-sports, and ageplay.

Anything you can think of or can come up with we can see if it works

a8otkm,6,2018-12-22,"Cybersecurity Nanodegree - Udacity Lead us On for Two and a Half Months, then Pulled the Rug Out",PsychoSloths,Udacity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Udacity/comments/a8otkm/cybersecurity_nanodegree_udacity_lead_us_on_for/,"For the past two years I've been looking forward to try a Udacity Nanodegree. Two years ago they really appeared to have their shit together. The Full Stack nanodegree projects looked like they actually provided a good portfolio, everybody had good things to say about them, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

After some internships and school work as a front end developer, I decided I wanted to switch to cybersecurity when I saw they were offering a nanodegree program. I got the money together, registered for the program, cleared my schedule completely, and re-evaluated my career ambitions over the next year. The program was supposed to start October 27th. Then, on October 26th, a few hours before the launch of the program, and after a month of waiting, Udacity postponed the start of the program until mid-January. There had been no notice, no actually apology, just a vague statement about ""perfecting the course material"" and how they'd refund us if we had a problem with it. This was a punch to the gut, as some students had even taken out lines of credit just to pay for the program.

&amp;#x200B;

But hey, the nanodegree was still starting in January, so I rearranged my schedule again. I rearranged my goals, again. I re-evaluated how I'd accommodate the finances AGAIN. So another 7 weeks go by and everything is fine, I'm prepared to start the nanodegree in January. Then, Udacity cancelled the nanodegree altogether - once again without apology. They refunded everyone, but they didn't refund the wasted time, energy, and money in preparing for the program. So after two and a half months of waiting for the Cybersecurity nanodegree, most of the class left with nothing to show for it. Moral of the story - don't wait for any nanodegrees coming from Udacity, there's a decent chance they'll get cancelled unapologetically, and you'll have just wasted your time waiting for them.

&amp;#x200B;

At one point, the premium cost Udacity charged seemed reasonable for premium content. With this, I can't say it's worthwhile. See ya Udacity, you just lost a customer, and a fan."

A bit before, he suddenly lose his wallet (a gift I bought him, that had picture of me inside). And today, as all our pictures are on my computer I couldn't help but go down memory lane. It hurts so much at the moment. We looked so happy... And what hurts is that he doesn't have any of those reminders, because I also have the pictures of his old phone, as when he changed, he transferred his data to my computer.

He probably never thinks of me, ever. He blocked me on my birthday, because his new supply's birthday is a day after mine (he probably is a - overt - narcissist). I haven't talked to him since September and have met an amazing person since, despite the fact that to be honest, I haven't fully moved on.

But it hurts, to know that he will never have to face those memories, as he has no reminder at all. I'm the one with all the memorabilia. And it hurts, to imagine them, I just can't stop and I'm crying thinking about it. I just want to kinda end things at the moment, because I'm in so much pain."
a8py0f,1,2018-12-22,Am I (M/31) being paranoid about my LDR partner's commitment and a few broken promises (F/24),tldcq,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a8py0f/am_i_m31_being_paranoid_about_my_ldr_partners/,"I've been in a long distance relationship with my SO for 3 years. We got to meet recently for the first time, and it was better than I could have imagined. We have a very close and dedicated relationship, despite some arguments a few times. My whole family knows her as my fiance, as my mother had wanted to send her a ring or gift earlier in the year as a formality for engagement in my country. I have talked to her mother a few times, but her parents don't consider me her fiance because she says in her country, there must be a traditional engagement ceremony first.

&amp;#x200B;

We both live in different countries, and she has gotten a job in a third country, starting from next year. As we both have wanted to not permanently live in our respective home countries, our plan has been that I'll move to where she will be working.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been a few points in the relationship where it seems that she casually promises something, and later isn't able to or willing to keep her word. One such thing where it happens repeatedly is where she would start to write in capital letters/shout and curse, while I am talking normally. When I request her to talk calmly, she says I annoyed her and I deserve it. Afterwards she apologizes sincerely and promises to not do that, but it again happens and has been repeated about a dozen times. She has gotten offended and angry a few times when I mentioned to her some old broken promises; and how some of those broken promises related to our future make me doubt that our relationship is as much a priority for her as it is for me, or as much as she herself thinks it is. Last such incident was yesterday, and she told me I was just paranoid and was misunderstanding her intentions. I had also told her at that time that we can ask in some forum if I can trust her still, and if more than 50% say no, then we can amicably break up. Otherwise we can continue to hope and wait till the next time she has to prove your words (In past she used to casually mention she wants to break up after small arguments as well). Afterwards I had told her that I didn't mean that and was being silly, and even if 100% had told me to breakup I won't as I love her. A little recap of recent events which were a catalyst for my feelings:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Earlier in the year I was planning to meet her, and since she couldn't have come here, and her country was infamous for denying visas for alone guys from my country, I had suggested we meet in a third country. She was objecting to most of them, but was warm to one country, Y. The second time I discussed it with her, however, she said she can't meet there as her parents won't allow her to go there to meet with me alone. I had wanted to avoid applying for visa for her country because I kept reading that if a first visit visa is rejected, it can be bad for future travels. Especially for country like mine.

&amp;#x200B;

2. She had then asked me if I can't try to still apply for her country. I had agreed on the condition that if my visa is refused, then she will come to my country so we can get married quickly (without a ceremony) to make it easier for future travels and relocation. And then later we'll have a ceremony in her country when possible. She had agreed to that; i.e she will come to my country and we'll get married here, if my visa to her country is refused.

&amp;#x200B;

3. I applied for a visa for her country, and it was unfortunately rejected. In those days she was doing an internship in Europe, which was finishing in a month. Since I was really looking forward to meeting her, I told that I can come with my mother to country Y, so her parents didn't have the objection of meeting a guy alone, will she then come to Y. She said yes, and to quote her "" I can come to country Y at any time"".

&amp;#x200B;

4. I applied for visa for country Y with my mother, and it was granted. For a day after telling her that it was granted, I kept waiting for her to mention any of her plan to come to country Y, but she didn't. Then I myself asked her if she won't come there to meet me, and she said ""I am not sure"". She told that her father had just mentioned the loan he had gotten for her internship, and she wanted to give that money back to him instead. That was extremely hurtful and confusing to me, and all I could think of was how she was making an excuse, and I kept remembering her promise of "" I can come to country Y at any time"". She explained that it was only because her father had mentioned that loan thing just a day ago.

&amp;#x200B;

5. After a while of me reminding her, that my sole reason for going to that country was to meet her and she had assured me she can come there any time, she said she'll come. I then insisted to buy her ticket, as her hotel cost was considerable as well and she was paying that. (We were in separate rooms)

&amp;#x200B;

6. Our meeting was awesome and after she returned, I had mentioned in passing her assurance in #2, to reduce the months to year long process of the relocation process to the country where she had gotten job. She said she can't come to my country and risk her job visa. After I expressed how bad that sounded and of her promise, her explanation was that she wants us to be in a better country and is prioritizing that. We both are from developing countries, and her job is in a developed country in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

7. The preliminary plan was then to apply for her country's visa again, with family this time, and she will come on a leave for getting married there. She had told me it's not possible for her to get leave before 6 months in her new job (her first job). I asked her if the rule was for any leave or only paid. She told me it's for any leave. Some days later I had wanted to see if marriage might have some exception for that leave rule, and came to know that people can take unpaid leave before 6 months too. When I told her that, she said ""Why would I take a non paid one? you want me to get kicked off obviously"" . Then she said that her contract has a clause that she can take a LEAVE ONLY after 6 months. I tried to express that it will mention paid leave, but she insisted it was any leave and that it was a 1 year contract and she didn't want to get a leave so soon as the company might find it bad, and that my imagination and judgement is faulty about her intentions of living together soon.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Recently she had signed a contract for an appartment where her job is (14% of her salary). While finding the apartments I had mentioned to her how this apartment was too small for spouse visa requirement. In the ad where she had found this one, there were 2 other larger apartments which I had suggested to get instead (fulfilling the requirement for spouse visa) in same building for 27% of her salary. She told me she would rather get the smaller one to save money and can quickly change it when I'll have to apply for either a fiance or spouse visa. She was also concerned about the 3 months total advance rent she will have to pay, for which her father will need a loan. I had insisted that I will send her the deposit but she didn't agree. I had also seen in the contract that while advance notice is for 3 months, she can't terminate her contract until 6 months have passed. I had asked her to inquire the landlord about it but she said there is no need as the type of contract where she can leave early has higher rent. I hadn't understood exactly what she meant, but didn't want to argue or ask more so left it at that. (Paraphrasing her: She was told by many people that finding appartment takes at least 2 months and she has to stay in a hotel for 20 days before she'll be moving in that apartment, and it was hard to find

A few days ago I told her it seemed better to directly apply for a marriage visa for the country where her job is going to be, instead of first going to her home country after 6 months, and then having to wait 6 months to a year+ before we can be together. During that discussion I came to know that her apartment's ad had two options, one short term and one permanent contract which couldn't be terminated before 6 months. I got annoyed at why she had signed that contract, while also telling me she can quickly change apartments. And I said how she hadn't mentioned to me the possibility of a short term contract, and deliberately removed the question I had written for her landlord. She got furious and said she had mentioned to me the expensive rent for second contract, and I told her it didn't explain short term vs long term contract limitations. She is of the view that my accusation was sick and that I should trust her more. I had requested her to think of everything from my perspective considering the recent  promises and contradicting events as being the reason for my emotional state and doubts. She said I was paranoid and assume wrong stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like a third person's view if I had justification for the times I doubted her intentions and shouldn't have mentioned that she reneged. Or if I made ""sick accusations"" while being paranoid.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: A few promises, events and apparent contradictions related to my SO's intentions for meeting, marrying and living together had me doubt her commitment and priorities. She feels hurt and angry that I don't trust her enough and imagine bad stuff about her."

I’m hoping to find out from you guys whether my goals are attainable. I will be blunt because the sidebar hints that the responses might tend in that direction. 

My college career hit a rocky road in 2013 when I was suspended for a year from school for an academic violation related to an internship. I left the small liberal arts college I was attending and applied to the University of Edinburgh without transferring any credits. I left Edinburgh in 2017 due to mental health issues best handled with family support.

Since then I have been finishing up at UH and finished fall 2017 with all As, medical withdrawal spring 2018 due to severe depression, and now all As again this semester. 

My cumulative GPA (if I understand the weighting correctly) is a 2.9 and if I continue at my current rate (not guaranteed) it will sit at a 3.2 when I graduate (will walk fall 2019). 

Two years ago I did some studying and got a 172 tunes. I believe that if I were to consider preparation a second job this score would improve.

The question is, given my path and the obvious struggle I’ve had fulfilling academic requirements, does my narrative / low gpa make me an unrealistic candidate for top 20 admissions?

I know which schools would never accept me, but I’m stuck wondering whether I should abandon my dreams of attaining institutional success through law school and the highly weighted lsat.

Thank you for the help. "

We stoped talking for a while. But every couple of months *he* would message me and we would talk again for a couple of weeks then he would stop answering my texts. Then a couple of weeks later he would talk to me again, and so on. 

We were together a year. And I really thought we were going to stay together forever. He truly was the love of my life. We had an intense and beautiful relationship. We both are super introverted. So we found peace and comfort in each other. We didn’t really like going out. We would rather spend time together at each other’s home. We had a strong bond because we were so much alike. We don’t have many friends and we have a hard time meeting new people. 

Anyways, when we broke up, I felt like I lost a big part of me and my depression aggravated. I don’t know how I met two girls and we became friends. They are super friendly and extroverted. So Then more people would join our group. And now I have a solid friendship with around 10 people and we hang out regularly. Also, because of our internship we spend a ton of time together. 

My ex hadn’t been responding to my texts for the past 2 days. Last night I had a Christmas Party with my friends. We drank, we made food, we got a piñata and we played some music and danced. I put some of it on my instagram. We were having a wonderful time. 

Now, I have always loved to dance. And with my friends I felt so comfortable that I started dancing around. One of my male friends danced along with me. Not close or anything. And a friend put a video of it on instagram. 

I’m guessing my ex boyfriend saw that video because he sent me a message that says “Don’t even dare to talk to me ever again” 

I’m so confused. I’m thinking he got so mad because i was having a good time or maybe because i was dancing along with a guy. Or maybe because he thinks that isn’t who I really am, or that I have changed and I go out now and have friends and have fun without him. 

I texted him but he doesn’t want to explain why he said that. I am so confused. And sad. And regretting going out with my friends. Regretting dancing. I feel sad. And can’t stop thinking about it. 

I need advice, or I need someone else perspective of what is going on here. What should I do to avoid all of that conflict. I don’t know what to do. 

I am so sorry if this is so stupid. I thank you in advance. "

**The Death Star**

THANOS lumbered down a corridor in the official Disney-brand Deathstar^™ playset, flanked on each side by two stormtroopers. The stormtroopers were equipped with high-tech blasters with dynamic red projectiles and had fully posable limbs, although they had some trouble turning their heads a full 180 degrees. Marching like soldiers (because they were), the grunts of the Empire led our big purple friend down several more identical corridors and past several squadrons of identical stormtroopers before reaching a large set of blast doors. The imperial grunts GRUNTED something to Thanos and promptly fucked off. A few seconds later, the blast doors slid open with a hiss and out walked KYLE O’REN, the Emperor’s newest part-time apprentice and full-time angsty teenager. Kyle didn’t seem all that angsty at this particular moment, however, and as he passed by Thanos, he gave him a wink. 

**O’REN:** Heh, I guess this IS the most ambitious crossover event yet! 

Before Thanos could answer with “heh, you said it, not me, kid!” or something to that effect, O’Ren zipped past him on his heretofore unseen interstellar segway, leaving him alone in front of the big scary doors with big scary gargoyle heads on them. Before Thanos could use his time alone to contemplate the futility of existence and whip up the beginnings of a panic attack as everyone does when given alone time (Right..?), the sinister doors opened with a hiss, and out walked Father Damien. Wait, what? Whaaa? Doy….?

Okay, I think I’ve got it:

Before Thanos could use his time alone to contemplate the futility of existence and whip up the beginnings of a panic attack as everyone does when given alone time (Right..?), the sinister doors opened with a hiss, and out walked Father Damien, who despite being reportedly murdered by Aquarius Jackson some months ago was actually extremely alive, and apparently acting none other than Grand Moff Tarkin.

**TARKIN:** Thanos, my child, what brings you around here? Are you ready to accept conversion to Christianity?

He had also apparently written all of Tarkin’s dialogue. JJ Abrams or Kevin Feige or whoever directed this movie really shouldn’t have let that happen. It’s not accepted blockbuster practice. 

**TARKIN:** As I always say, the only power higher than the Emperor is Daddy Space God! Render unto Palpatine what is Palpatine’s and unto Papatine what is Papatine’s!

**THANOS:** Tarkin, I’ll never accept your monotheistic God while I still have knowledge of the infinity crystals...polyzetise...polythitise….polygamy...

**TARKIN:** Proselytize?

**THANOS:** Proselytize somewhere else, Grand Moff! I mean to speak with the Emperor. 
 
**TARKIN:** Very well, just don’t come crying to me when you find yourself up to your neck in Space Daddy’s swimming pool of fire and brimstone, heathen! His Highness will see you now, I suppose, but if I hear you trying to tempt him away from the true Christian faith, I’ll order Lord Vader to hunt you down! 

Thanos held his hands up, a comedic indication that he heard Tarkin’s warning and didn’t intend to give the big guy cause to actually send his myriad hit squads after his ass. The purple one then headed into the grand chamber of the EMPEROR, which was extremely dimly lit and was even more evil than even the warlord could have conceived of. Dozens of snazzy red-cloaked imperial guards milled around inside the chamber, many of them enjoying Nestle-brand products, which officially sponsored the movie. In the heart of all of this DARKNESS sat the emperor himself on his black space-throne. PALPATINE slightly moved his cloak to give him a good view of Thanos, and then beckoned him to approach the throne. 

**PALPATINE:** Speak, goy. 

**THANOS:** Lord Palpatine, I come to seek your blessing on a recent matter. Just one cycle ago, while I was returning from a space gas station, minding my business and generally doing my duty to the Empire, I was accosted by some rebel scum. I politely asked them to move their vessel so I could move mine, but in return I received rude comments and ruder actions. My eyes still sting from the reefer smoke, Lord Palpatine! When I returned to my lair, I swore revenge on the rogues and, using my great powers of technological evil, I was able to identify them and track them to the planet Earth. Earth.. that puny blue dot home to trees, talking racoons, and worst of all: humans. I wish to destroy Earth for the many crimes of its citizens, and once it’s cities and forests are nothing more than smoldering ash I will turn it into a giant smoke-free zone where no “dank” will be smoked for fear of eternal punishment! This, your royal Highness, is my plot, but I will only forward with it once I have your approval. 

Upon hearing of Thanos’ sinister plot to destroy earth, Palpatine began to chuckle rather imperially and rub his wrinkled, withered hands together.

**PALPATINE:** Oy vey, now we’re talking. Just wait until I inform my Council of Elders about this, those Heebs will be chomping at the bit once they hear about all the rare minerals we can extract from Earth after we’re done with it. Ay-yi-yi, I can already smell the profits! 

By now, Palpatine was rubbing his hands together so fast to the point where tiny bolts of electricity began to dart between his finger tips. Perhaps the only other time he’d ever been this excited was when he learned that the Sith Code didn’t forbid the practice of usury. Thanos grinned, for he was indeed going to destroy EARTH...and he had just received IMPERIAL PERMISSION.

**The Odeon**

Slurping, chewing, popping corn, cheering, and loudly reacting (“HOW THE HECK’S HE SO PURPLE AND EVIL? I JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES A MAN LIKE THAT, YA KNOW”), Gordon Cole had been enraptured by the Avengers: The Quest for Something to Avenge for thirty minutes now. This was, in his eyes, truly the greatest cinematic event of all time. It also happened to be the first cinematic event he had ever watched in the theater as he previously said, but the small sample size had no impact on his conviction: He was sure that this was quality cinema, what the Germans call “kino”, a modern marvel from Marvel that would change his life forever. Such was his determination to view every single frame of the picture that he had taped his eyelids back to prevent himself from blinking. Cole would not miss a second of this. 

Until, that is, he felt a twinge in his nether regions. Now, I know what you’re thinking, but don’t worry - Gordon wasn’t following in Doc Frost and George Osborne’s footsteps. He had idly drunk several liters of his still full heroic soda while watching the dazzling heroics in front of him, and he now had to let loose with his hose pipe, quite badly in fact. Fear overtook him. He was faced with two entirely contrary options, both of which needed to happen (Much like the Brexit negotiations). One, he had to leave the theater and go to the toilet, two, he couldn’t afford to miss any of the movie. As a reminder of the wonders Cole was poised to lose out on, Thanos was currently breakdancing on the screen while the Emperor continued to rant about “spice” and how Thanos could “teach that uppity goy Skywalker a lesson” when he was done on earth. Cold sweat ran down the back of Cole’s neck. He had to act, act fast, and act well. The thought of simply pissing in the aisle ran through his head and then ran out of it. He resolved to put his phone in position to record the portion of the movie that he was going to miss, and then watch that while he was heading home. YA KNOW, he thought, NO ONE SAID THIS HAD TA BE A LINEAR FILM. He had picked up the concept of linearity and nonlinearity from the incredibly well-read Earl Winston some years ago, and knew at the time that it would eventually come in clutch. So Cole did the thing that he had just decided to do, and then exploded down the aisle towards the door, barreling over that Polish child that was accidentally abandoned in the process.

**COLE:** SORRY, FELLA, BUT THANOS’ EVIL SCHEMES DON’T WAIT FOR ANYONE. 

Cole ran through the door and out into the main hallway, which was lined with other doors leading to various pictures, such as one for a showing of Quentin Tarantino’s Chalkboard Love 3^⅓, which was designed solely to build up hype for the next installment of that series, Chalkboard Love 4. Zipping past the showing of that modern cinematic masterpiece and a half-dozen others, the agency director finally arrived at the entrance to the bathroom, which flooded the otherwise dimly-lit corridor with almost heavenly bright light. Under normal circumstances, Cole might have stood in the middle of the hallway in awe at this sight, but with the immense kinomatic presence that was the plot to the Avengers: the Quest for Something to Avenge still looming large in his mind, he hurried on in without hesitation. As he walked into the bathroom, Cole noticed three men standing around a single urinal despite the fact that there were five others not in use. Again, under any other circumstances, he would have surely stopped to wonder what those dudes’ angle was, as I’m sure you are doing as well, but frankly the only angle Cole could focus on right now was Thanos’, and so he paid no mind to the communal pissers and took the urinal furthest away from theirs. Not wasting any time, Cole unbuckled his belt and dropped his pants all the way down to his ankles, followed by his underwear until he was BUTT naked. Then, the stream began, slow and steady at first but building in intensity and volume with each second to the point where the piss was hitting the porcelain so fast that some of it ricocheted back at his bare legs. Meanwhile, the three men, hearing this virtual hosing even a few stalls down from Cole, took this as a challenge and started pissing in unison, staring at Cole menacingly as they emptied their balls of fluid. , Unfortunately for them, our stalwart hero (Get dabbed on, Mac) was staring down at the floor and thus did not notice their showboating. Why was he staring at the floor and not at, say, the wall in front of him? Well, if you’ve ever looked intently at floor tiles before you’d understand why. Cole, by chance, had absent-mindedly stared down at the floor and, squinting down at the tiles, noticed something strange and rather alarming about the seemingly innocent squares. These squares, as he came to realise, were not so innocent after all, not unless you consider being IMPLICIT IN THE WORST GENOCIDE IN HUMAN HISTORY INNOCENT. That’s right, dear reader, Gordon Cole had just inadvertently swallowed a pill that only a select few of us have ever stumbled upon in our lives. For you see, when presented with an array of squares, the human mind instinctively begins drawing patterns, and sometimes.. Well, sometimes those patterns turn out to be swastikas. 

**COLE:** HOLY HECK, SOMEONE CALL SIMON WIESENTHAL. 

This perturbed the other three men in the bathroom, and with a not insubstantial amount of muttering about how people should keep quiet in bathrooms, keep to themselves, keep their feelings inside, et cetera et cetera, they marched out the door. Although Cole was too intently focused on the swastika patterns to notice their departure, we did, and we can say with some certainty that we never heard them zip up their flies. Strange fellas, eh? As Cole was analysing the ground patterns, something unfortunate happened - his leg began to cramp. Cole knew that he would have to pop another tilepill some other day, and headed into one of the dingy toilet cubicles, where he created a blanket of toilet paper around the seat and sat down, pissing like women did, or like men did before they evolved shafts. As Cole relieved himself, his mind returned to the swastika shapes. What was their angle? What about swastika graffiti? Was it in on it, as well? He didn’t have an answer, and he couldn’t even come up with the questions. Fortunately though, we have the exclusive scoop. The mystery of swastika graffiti, asian swastikas, and thai Hitler restaurants is going to be solved once and for all. It’s time to take the greypill, which is essentially the tilepill+. This is some deep stuff, so strap in.

The answer to the whole thing is aliens. Bonafide little green and grey men. Now, as you know, Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany, was in actuality just one of the many lives of the man currently known as Laurent Le Foll, although perhaps an abnormally notorious one. And as we learned in a bar in U Thant’s United Nations headquarters, the mystic agent, dreamer, and cuckooland chieftain Nathan Adler, after avoiding the calamity of the war as a draft dodger and conscientious (As in, “my conscience would like me alive”) objector, had managed to get himself dispatched to the ruined Berlin as a photojournalist for no less an establishment than the New York Times, documenting the suffering and destruction of the Nazi capital, and as Adler went on to inform us, he reached the Fuhrerbunker and detected a weird supernatural vibe, being naturally more attuned to the unseen ways of the world than the rest of us. What Adler didn’t deign to tell Gordon Cole (and by extension the audience) is that he had recovered a strange sort of time capsule or “crystal” from the ruins of the bunker and turned it, for some arcane reason, into a ring that he wore at all times. So that’s part one. The second part of this mystery is wholly down to the events that took place in Jacksonville, Illinois, in the mid-60s. As you’ll recall, Adler, Cole, and Earl Winston tracked down the arrival point of an interstellar craft to a crop field in the midwestern town, and were then blindsided by none other than Jimmy Page, (Who is about to arrive in London for his battle with the Spellmight). As Page dispatched the three secret agents, he knocked Adler’s ring right off his finger and under the alien craft, and then Gordon Cole shot Page’s guitar, unleashing a magical torrent which, according to Stephen Hawking, essentially retconned everything that had happened for those outside the field, but left the people involved with knowledge of it. The aliens picked up Adler’s ring with their probes and performed a sustained analysis of it, giving them all the secrets of Nazi culture, which they now believe to be the pinnacle of human civilisation. Using their advanced technologies and a recently established forward operating base in the clouds of Venus, the greys are now altering ordinary images, patterns, and symbols on earth to reflect famous symbols and icons of Nazisim in the hope that it will inspire us to rise up and restore the fascists to power - but this time globally. So there you have it. Gordon Cole was actually somewhat responsible for the very thing currently baffling him. Anyway, this isn’t spaceplace, so let’s head back to the big guy, who should be back in the screen by -

Oh, he’s still pissing. Yep. He’s still going. Gosh, uh, I don’t really have anything else left to say, I sort of thought he’d be done...Gordon, are you alright in there? You’re not encountering any difficulties, are you? If it’s a disabled toilet, you can tug a rope for assistance, or is it push a button? I can’t really remember, it’s been a long time since...I mean, I’ve never used one.

Dramatic sketches: The now deceased Pete Nance on losing a packet of nuts:-

- Man, one of those ropes sure woulda come in handy earlier when I dropped that bag full of tasty pistachios all over the floor. Maybe someone would’ve come and helped me gather ‘em all up before the five second rule had passed, maybe then they wouldn’t have gone to waste. And y’know what the worst part about it was, aside from not being able to enjoy my bag of salt and pepper-flavoured pistachios? Watching them sit there on the floor gathering dirt and germs and all manner of grime while I hopelessly tried to grab as many of them as I could before the five seconds had passed. I don’t know why I even bothered. I only managed to salvage about 25 percent of ‘em. The rest, I guess you could say belong to the gosh-darn bacteria now. And the dustmites. Well, I hope they at least get some enjoyment out of my bag of nuts.. 

Big Ed on the ongoing Darkplace Milk Crisis:-

- Yeah, I reckon things are still pretty tough ‘round these parts, what with the nightly raids and all, havin’ to fend off a buncha thirsty, teat-grabbin’ rascals, but we make do. I guess you could say that’s one thing we have going for us compared to them city-slickers: our resilience. I tell ya, though, it’s hard sometimes. Lookin’ at old Bessie I can see it in her eyes. She’s bothered by all this crap, disturbed even. Now I’ve seen plenty ‘a’ disturbed cows in my time, but not like that one. Shoot, I’m gonna let you folks in on a little secret I’ve been keepin’ up here [points to noggin]: I could end this thing whenever I so pleased, but y’know what I’ve come to realise? Those hordes of grubby, urban softies don’t deserve a drop of my Bessie’s milky goodness. There, I said it. Gosh.. sometimes I think to myself, “Ed, ain’t that a little mean?”, but then I remember there’s much worse I could be doin’. Yeah, I could be out there mailing bombs to that no-good carpet-bagger Mogg and all his highfalutin friends. Yeah.. I’ve thought about it before, y’know, but then I think, “Aw c’mon, Ed, you don’t have the heart or the stomach for that.” Then I think, “yeah, Ed, you’re gosh-darned right, Ed.” But I would, don’t get that twisted.

Sheriff Harry Wilson on Lucy and Andy:-

- Sometimes I wonder why I hate them so much, y’know? I think to myself: C’mon Harry, lighten up. Let ‘em have their fun. So I do. And then...then I see them, then I see Andy and I see Lucy, or I hear ‘em, and I’m right back to hating the dumb motherfuckers. I just don’t get why they have to be in my life, y’know? Y’see I mean, I don’t hate the concept of them *existing*, I just don’t want anything to do with it. I didn’t even willingly hire either of them. Lucy was grandfathered in with the station when the last guy retired, and Andy? Andy’s a goddamn intern. I pay him in monopoly money. You’d think a guy would realise that, but Andy’s so uniquely dumb that he tries to deposit it at the bank every month, gets rejected and told his money ain’t good, and then he comes back and asks me what he did wrong. I keep telling the son of a bitch that I’m deliberately giving him fake money to fuck him over, he walks out the door and sees a fucking butterfly and forgets about his money the next goddamn second! I don’t even know how the guy eats, how he sleeps, how he does anything. He’s goddamn broke. And then Lucy is just...shit. She just sucks. I exiled her to a goddamn plague cave and there’s not a minute since where I’ve thought about allowing her back in. I’m sort of concerned that she might make her way into town now that the plague’s over, but if that happens I think I’ll just book her a one way trip to some terrible hellhole country that she can never get out of. Hey Lucy, how’d ya like a trip to goddamn Somalia? You know what she’d say? She’d tell me people told her she’d get somalia if she ate uncooked chicken. Is there something in the water supply? 

---

After fifteen long minutes, Gordon Cole had finished pissing and made his way back into the screen, which had filled up some in his absence. Instead of it just being him and the Polish child, there was now a sinister drifter figure in the front row, as well as a man in a SWAT vest who was clearly planning to shoot up a more populated screen somewhere in the Odeon. Cole broke theater etiquette by greeting them as he moved past, and resumed his seat.

**Avengers Headquarters**

**THOR:** After he killed my brother, yes.

**The Odeon**

**COLE:** WHO THE HECK IS THAT?

This is why you don’t leave the screen, people.

**Avengers Headquarters**

THOR gritted his teeth and raised his hammer into the sky, while many other avengers, including CAPTAIN AMERICA, DIRT-MAN, BLACK WIDOW, and BRUCE BANNER watched him with great admiration and respect.

**THOR:** Thanos will **pay!**

**ROGERS:** I just can’t believe that an evil alien is coming here to attack our peaceful planet! Why! What did the people of America do to you, Thanos? 

**BANNER:** They stopped buying grape-flavoured kool aid!

Just then, Tony Stark flew in through a shaft in the roof of the Avengers HQ that had been specially installed to allow for such dramatic entrances, doing a perfect three-point landing that a keen viewer would recognize as the same shot used in the trailer for the film, and that an even keener viewer might also recognize as the same shot that had been recycled at least ten times over the course of the MCU. Regardless, it still made Stark like cool as shit as he approached his fellow Avengers with a look of urgency on his face, although this urgency did not in any way detract from the resting look of coolness on his face, but rather complemented it in a way that around 75 percent of female test viewers would consider “highly attractive” if they forgot that he was in actuality 5’4” and standing on stilts.

**STARK:** Hey gang, you’ll never guess what I just managed to do. 

**ROGERS:** Aw gee, you’ve got me stumped, Tony! C’mon, tell us! 

**STARK:** You remember that automatic abortion machine the Goblin forced me to build? 

**ROGERS:** Automatic.. W-what machine…?

**STARK:** It’s not important, Steve. Anyway, yeah, that thing. Well, using my advanced sciencing abilities I was able to convert its mainframe into an encrypted high-power interstellar telescope, which allows us to see Thanos’ ship in orbit around Titan.

**BANNER:** Wow, that sure is convenient!

**ROGERS:** Yes! It is! 

**ROMANOFF:** Heh, well, **I** was able to build a machine using only my feminine mystique and cunning wiles that lets me see exactly what Thanos is watching on his TV…. in real time. 

**STARK:** And yet you can’t make enough sandwiches for all of us? 

A stunned silence fell over the room. Could it be that, after all this time, Tony Stark was cancelled?

**THOR:** Yes, put the wench in her place, Stark!

**DIRTMAN:** Good one, holmes!

**BANNER:** Owned!
 
Black Widow indignantly made a big sigh noise or whatever and stormed out the room, leaving the good old boys to continue their conversation. 

**ROGERS:** Yeah, her place...sucking Mordecai’s ding-

Scene cut.

**ROGERS:** Alright, we men need to get down to business. How are we going to stop the villainous Thanos? 

**THOR:** I’m going to bash his big, purple head in with my hammer in revenge for his unjust slaying of my brother Loki! 

**ROGERS:** Yes, despite Loki’s villainy, Thanos killing him was a step too far. And he is very purple.

**BANNER:** Which is a good thing. According to my radiation calculations, if Thanos was green like the Hulk, he’d be entirely unstoppable.

**STARK:** Thank god we’re dealing with a grapefuit and not a lime, then. 

Stark’s epic fruit-based analogy was met with a hearty group-chuckle, because it was funny and really got to the true essence of Thanos as man, grape, and villain. As the laughing died down, one of the doors into the Avenger’s HQ swung/slid/cracked/hissed/munched open, and in walked HAWKEYE, who was known for carrying a BOW and having an EYEPATCH. Strangely, he also had on some manner of tribal (small t)-patterned garb and a string of shrunken heads around his neck. 

**STARK:** Hawkeye, it’s about time you showed up - Thanos has been having our asses for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner! 

**HAWKEYE:** Thanos..? 

**ROGERS:** There’s no time to explain, Jeremy. Just know he’s a big purple meanie who killed Loki and hates our freedom.

**HAWKEYE:** He killed… Loki? Isn’t that a good thing? Look, someone’s gonna have to explain this to me - You guys might not have noticed, but I haven’t been around a lot lately.

They laughed, as he hadn’t. Hawkeye glanced towards the camera as he said this. Very cool.

**THOR:** Thanos...Thanos is a damned space demon, a tyrant in the outer rim who’s seeking to unite all ten infinity stones into the infinity gauntlet, which he can use to recreate the universe in his own twisted image...he’s powerful enough that he...he killed half of my people…

**HAWKEYE:** Just like Hitler killed half of mine.

He was Jewish.

**HAWKEYE:** I’m sorry to hear that, Thor. What’s the plan, guys?

**STARK:** Wait up a minute, Robin Hood. Thanos attacked New York yesterday, how the hell didn’t you hear about that? What, were you too busy...what do you even do? 

**HAWKEYE:** Cap and I have been out in Wakanda for the last year, learning their ancient martial arts from the bushmen. In fact, he’s still out there now, I figured I’d come back and see if I could get you to take me off the international superhero wanted list, Stark.

**STARK:** Oh, yikes...sorry about that, no hard feelings, yeah?

**HAWKEYE:** There are definitely hard feelings, but Thanos comes first. You got a plan?

SCOTT LANG, alias the marvelous DIRT-MAN, spoke up.

**DIRTMAN:** I was thinking I might shrink down to the size of a piece of dirt, and crawl up his butt. Once I was up his butt, I’d expand to the size of a giant dirt mountain, causing him to explode. 

**THOR:** Or I could just smash his head in with my hammer!

**BANNER:** No, leave this one to me, guys...or should I say…**us**.

This was impressive, because in between being Bruce Banner and being Bernadette Boisterous, New York’s most famous drag-queen, Banner could sometimes be found in the guise of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, the largest and mightiest of all the Avengers.

**STARK:** Alright guys, I know we’re all eager to defeat Thanos, but let’s not talk over each other. Besides, your ideas all suck. 

As he said this, Stark pivoted around to Hawkeye and, pointing his finger at him, made a face that was probably described in the screenplay as “pensive” or “contemplative” but which didn’t translate very well onto the silver screen.

**STARK:** Wakanda… yes, Wakanda, that’s it. If there’s one place where we might stand a chance holding out against Thanos, it’s Wakanda. Let’s just hope they’re willing to share some of their advanced weaponry with us colonizers, amirite guys?

**BANNER:** That’s problematic, Tony! 

**HAWKEYE:** I could probably convince King T’Challa to let us in. Through our shared struggles on the harsh and unforgiving savannah, we forged a close brotherhood that transcends artificial boundaries and outdated racial classifications. 

**STARK:** Awesome, Wakanda it is. I’m thinking you all head over there and prepare for Thanos, while the important people, led by, naturally, me, board a ship bound for Thanos’ flagship slash grapvine orbiting Jupiter and neutralise him. 

**HAWKEYE:** I’m not sure if I like this plan, St-

**STARK:** Great, don’t care.

Owned!

**THOR:** Well I do! Ah Stark, we will rain hell down on that off-colour frost giant!

**STARK:** Oh no, you’re not going anywhere. You’re too hot headed after Thanos killed your shitty brother, I need cooler **heads** on my team.

**DIRTMAN:** C’mon Tony, you don’t mean MODOK, do you? Because your emphasis on the word heads makes me think so.

MODOK was, if you don’t know, an incredibly sinister giant head creature who was a frequent antagonist of the Avengers.

**STARK:** What? No, let me rephrase that. I need cooler heads on my **team**.

**HAWKEYE:** I don’t get it.

**DIRTMAN:** Yeah, me either.

**STARK:** Alright, forget it. Just get going to Wakanda. 

And don’t forget to go through the appropriate immigration channels, folks!

I need help guys. I tried to post on the stupid Montreal subreddit like around 4 times, and their stupid bot or whatever keeps removing my goddamn post.

Here is my story. I need to move to Montreal and live there for a while. I have a degree from Ontario (recent grad) in a pretty demanding field. I have gotten like around 6 in-person interviews alone in November once I started applying in late October in Ontario, if that helps. But right now I need to change up my life a bit, and have been learning French on my own (I think I am at the A2 level bordering the B1 level if I keep talking to French people on Discord) I don't have any internships but I have prior job experience doing stuff on campus as a TA and as a graphic designer for one of the organizations associated with my uni.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone here please guide me on what kind of jobs I can quickly get if I decide to visit their in January and try to apply to a bunch of places? I am also willing to commute back and forth a bit till I have my own place. I am willing to work a retail job in a clothing store or something, as thats the base level of work that I am willing to do full-time JUST TO GET SETTLED IN. As long as its not working at a restaurant or fast food I am fine, I am willing to even omit my degree from my resume and make shit up just to land a damn retail job.

We both have tech careers and both have had strong internships and side jobs while we are at school. We keep our grades up and are generally good with money.


My parents are immigrants to this country and have an ""old world"" mindset that women shouldn't ""play house"" and blah blah. They're Indo-Guyanese if that helps. I was born in America and like to do things my way and they have been supportive until now.


They have been living in this fantasy life that I had no idea existed until recently. I decided to go away for college and commute home for breaks. They assumed I would be coming home after college and living with them. We talking about this at the beginning of college I said I wouldn't be ashamed of doing that, but now that I'm an adult with needs for space it's not possible in a small Brooklyn apartment. And I've also found someone who strongly wants to create a family with me and who I want to share my space with.


I don't want to break their hearts, but it's time for my parents to grow up. They have a lot of life to live with retirement coming up very soon, but they seem so stuck on my life. How do I get them to understand that I want different things? How do me and my boyfriend convince them that we are serious about each other without being forced into marriage? I'm tired of lying about where I am and who I'm with and what I'm up to. I want to wait for marriage. Even if it isn't with this current person, I will not regret moving in with him as we lived together (secretly) during the summer and it went really well. It's really been hurting my relationship with my boyfriend. I've been really hurting my mom with it and it stresses my dad out. I really need advice from women from old world families, how do you do it?


TL;DR: I need advice on how to help my parents accept that I will be moving with my boyfriend soon. "

So I just started my month of internal medicine CTU this week and my father in law has been admitted to another hospital with pneumonia. My husband, a vetaran, has also been having very bad depression and anxiety around this exact time. My father in law has also had a recent aortic valve replacement surgery and aortic aneurysm repair in Oct. My husband has been screened for familial aortica aneurysm disease and unfortunately he has it so this is also contributing to his anxiety. Life has been very difficult outside of medicine and I have had a few emotional breakdowns recently with family and friends. I have informed my CTU team about these personal issues and my staff has been very understanding- i.e. let me go earlier on some days to see my family. I have always made sure to complete my work before I leave. 

My senior resident on the other hand keep on piling load of work on me. She gave me 3 consults to do overnight vs. 2 for other interns when I told her that I'm not doing well mentally. I guess she just doesn't give a fuck. But seriously what kind of heartless person is this?!?! 

She also made fun of a guy who called the ambulance to be brought to the emerg because he felt horrible due to the flu. She was making fun of his man flu the whole time until his results came back and showed bad AKI from rhabdomyolysis from flu induced myositis and required admission.

This movie, like all my movies, will be excellent. It's clear to me that Marvel paid their fanboys to attend my film showings to write false reviews like the scum they are. Infinity War, more like Infinity BORE.

Studies have shown that 93% of people who gave my movies a bad review were totally gay and paid by MarSHILL to LIE. In fact many prominent critics have privately told me that they think my movies are among the greatest works of fiction in history.

a8wgng,227,2018-12-23,Weirdest experience last night I am not proud of (adderall + weed),3M3RPU5,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/a8wgng/weirdest_experience_last_night_i_am_not_proud_of/,"*Brief background* \- I'm a college student on winter break with nothing to do alone in my apartment for 2 whole weeks before starting my intern / job. Honestly, I've just been playing video games, watching videos, hanging with some friends occasionally, and getting high / tripping.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up one day at 10pm (yup, my sleep schedule is messed) and decided to pop an adderall for the recreational high, maybe to focus on a video game or work on an instrument. It wasn't even a really high dose; a single 30mg IR. I've been limiting myself to one ""adderall session"" per week at most ever since my first dose, because I was scared of how good the high was. I don't ever want to become addicted to this magical substance that  makes everything in life so much brighter, active, social, and just better in general.

&amp;#x200B;

As the adderall started to kick in, the back of my mind told me that the inevitable was going to come; **the dreaded fapathon**. I've been struggling with resisting the urge to furiously masturbate for 6 hours straight ever since I tried adderall (which was what happened my first time), and being a college young adult with a ""healthy"" sex drive wasn't helping.

&amp;#x200B;

I ignored what my mind was telling me, but after just one very concentrated and enjoyable game of League of Legends, I came to lubing myself up in my adderall-induced high (if you're anything like me, you most likely know the importance of lube for adderall fapathons). I then proceeded to furiously masturbate like the world depended on it for **12 hours straight**, piss breaks included. This is no joke, I masturbated from 12am to 12pm the next day. My member was completely drained from life.

&amp;#x200B;

And let me tell you, the moment I blew my 12-hours-worth of load, the adderall comedown hit me like a brick. I was drenched in sweat and suddenly started shivering, I hadn't eaten anything for the past day, and my body was aching all over. Mentally I was just horribly depressed. I laid down to sleep, but sleep was just not going to come, which is a downside of adderall which I hate the most. I spent 6 more hours in bed not able to sleep before deciding to roll up an indica joint to finally catch some sleep. This is where things got a little weird.

&amp;#x200B;

*The experience* \- It was around 7pm, several minutes into chain smoking my joint when I started hearing sex noises. I thought ""What the hell? Are people fucking outside in public?"". My vision was also becoming layered with green and red static-like effects. I opened my windows to see where all the moaning sex noises was coming from. Nobody was outside. This was really beginning to creep the shit out of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I then checked my laptop and phone to see if I accidentally left a tab of porn open or something from my adderall fapathon, when it suddenly hit me; I'd been listening to nothing but porn for 12 hours straight. My mind was so accustomed to the repetitive sex noises from all the porn videos that it was replaying it **directly in my head**. The sounds and voices were so real and clear, but sure enough when I concentrated hard enough I recognized the audio from several videos I played on repeat through my adderall fapathon.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm curled up in my bed, already feeling terrible, higher than I'd ever been, listening to porn audio replaying in my head, not able to sleep at all. Today I woke up thankfully feeling a lot better, and no more sex noises. I could only link the weird experience to the combination of the adderall comedown + weed + psychosis from lack of sleep and furiously masturbating to porn for 12 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

That is all. I thought it was interesting to share.

Afterwards, I quit to focus on my grades and internship while my buddies continued to smoke.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm genuinely unsure to what extent marijuana has permanently effected my memory and cognitive ability. However, after reading all these studies and literature about how harmful weed can be to the mind I feel as though I've made myself 'placebo stupid'.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I forget something or do something stupid my mind immediately blames my past marijuana use and I feel regretful. However, it might have absolutely nothing to do with the weed, and be a case of my insecure mind attributing the normal everyday forgetting of things to drug use.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm constantly beating myself up for possibly shaving down my IQ by several points, especially since I have big ambitions for the next few years (I want to get an engineering job at Google or Microsoft).

a8xgk8,8,2018-12-23,Me [20F] and my boyfriend [21M] are going on our second break of our relationship.,juvox,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a8xgk8/me_20f_and_my_boyfriend_21m_are_going_on_our/," 

The first break of our relationship was in May, where we took a \~ 1 month break. This break resulted from communication and maturity issues. We spent a large amount of time together our first year together and were basically attached at the hip. This decreased over time. At this point, we've been dating for almost 2.5 years.

We met during our university's summer orientation and immediately had a connection. We started dating about a week after starting classes at school. He dated a girl before me for about a year, but he did not consider her an endgame/serious relationship. Prior to our relationship, I had one serious relationship where I had my serious fuck-ups and learned a lot. We had spoken about this lack of emotional experience early on. After our first year together, things in my life took a really bumpy road and we didn't spend as much time together (which was good for us) but stress on both ends definitely took a toll on our relationship. I openly admit that I threatened to break up with him during this time, and I know that was a huge fucking mistake and piece of shit move on my part and I will never forgive myself for saying that to him. It came from a place of insecurity and pain from family relationships.

Fast forward to after our first break (which had a clear and decisive ending, knowing we would get back together) and things are much better. I feel that our emotional communication has improved a lot and although not amazing, still improvement. This apparently is not enough as emotional communication continues to stir fights, but emotional communication no longer *prolongs* fights as it used to. Also, fights are never that big anymore.

If I have an issue in our relationship, I bring it up as soon as possible after thinking it over. He, however, lets things boil up and then only brings it up when it's such a large issue. He acknowledges this and wants to fix it but doesn't know how.

A few days ago I brought up the point to him that he has matured a lot in regards to being responsible and working on his academics (which had a large push from me to begin with), but I don't feel like he is maturing emotionally anymore and I just want him to think about that.

Last night, he calls me and tells me he wants to break up with me after thinking about things. Growing up and still today, he considers what other people want before him, so he doesn't have time to consider what he wants to do (in life, on a daily basis, etc). And I think he has done some growing up during our relationship that he no longer can see his life outside the scope of it. He's reevaluating his career choices and his best friend at college is leaving this upcoming semester and I am leaving this upcoming semester for an internship and he just considers it a new chapter. He reassured me several times that it wasn't me, but what's best for himself right now to think about his life without worrying about another person and what they want right now so he can figure things out for himself.

I believe in my core that if he could open up about issues and speak candidly with me, that the issues in our relationship would clear up, since they all derive from that. I also believe in my core that we are ""soulmates"". I get along with him unlike any other person I would consider my best friend and I feel a new level of comfort around him. I think we have a truly, special connection and he does think so too. We are still in love with each other, but he knows he has to put his future first. And he doesn't see us getting married the way things are right now. And I can't say I disagree with any of this. I also have contemplated this, but at the end of the day I know what we have is special and I could never see him as just a friend ever.

So we settled on taking a break last night. This break is indefinite and getting back together is only a possibility. I just don't know what to do because I feel like I am going through a major break up and it would hurt me to much to break up again at the end of this break, but I also consider the possibility of getting back together worth it. I am just lost and confused and heartbroken and seeking advice, reassurance, or anything to help.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - We are in love with each other, but our communication styles/maturity differences have brought issues into our relationship. We are now on our second break which could end in a break up or getting back together."
a8xj5j,13,2018-12-23,AITA for Taking my Cat Back and Cutting off my Friend?,Latter_Abbreviations,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a8xj5j/aita_for_taking_my_cat_back_and_cutting_off_my/,"TL;DR: My friend agreed to look after my cat while I got back on my feet. She tried to keep him when I came back to get him. I promised I would keep in touch and then blocked her.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, guys! First post. Thanks in advance and I apologize, but this is a long one.

A cat followed me home one night (we'll call her Fluffy). I wandered around the city and he just kept at it so I brought her into my apartment for the night. I took her to the vet and he was not microchipped. I posted flyers for a found cat and even contacted a bunch of cat rescues in the city trying to find her a home. No one called looking for her, and the rescues were all to busy dealing with kittens to worry about a 1-year old moggy. :( I was still getting over losing my dog of 12 years. I didn't want to get attached to another animal again. And so I dropped Fluffy off at the local Humane Society (and cried all the way home). After my sister (overseas) told me about her own horrible experience with that shelter, however, I went back and got Fluffy the very next morning. I treated her for fleas, worms and even got her spayed and vaccinated. Fluffy officially became my cat and I lived with her in my apartment for about 6 months.

Well, I graduated from school after that, and it turned out I needed to move to another very expensive city to seek out an internship in my field. This required moving back in with my father, who had made it very clear that he did not like cats and did not want a cat in his house. I turned to my good friend - we'll call her L - for assistance. L agreed to look after Fluffy until I got back on my feet and was able to take her back. As it turned out, L liked cats and wanted to see if she would enjoy having one of her own before she got one. Perfect!

I paid her for Fluffy's upkeep, and inquired about her regularly. She shared pictures. I only went to visit once since she lived 4 hours away from me. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I unfortunately found and had to leave an internship. She knew all about what was going on with me. The payments continued regardless. But because of the circumstances, this arrangement lasted for a year. During this time, I said that I wanted to take Fluffy and place her with family so that she would be closer to me and not cause L any further inconvenience. L assured me that she ""wasn't going to steal my cat"" and that it was fine. So the agreement continued. I got another internship and after months of convincing, my father agreed to let me keep Fluffy at our house.

I went to visit L and Fluffy. L had gotten herself a kitten a month before. We agreed about when I would come back to get Fluffy and how much I would pay her for her upkeep until then. But as soon as I got back home, L changed her tune.

Suddenly, I became this irresponsible pet owner and terrible, selfish person. She offered to return the money I had paid her over the year she had Fluffy and keep her. Uh... No, that's okay. I don't want my money back, I want my cat. She even tried to bring up my dropping her at the shelter even though that was 6 months before she even knew Fluffy existed. This was especially ridiculous because I had never told her about this. It was none of her business and - to me - it showed that she had been discussing me behind my back. Finally, I told L that I intended to have my cat back and that she had no right to refuse. I hinted that if she did refuse, I would be suing her for Fluffy's return. She agreed to give her back, but if Fluffy ""missed her bonded pair (i.e. the kitten she'd lived with for about a month) or her human (i.e. L)"" after a month or two, I was to return her. She was behaving like such a nut that I agreed just to get Fluffy back. Once she was back, I blocked L across all of my social media accounts. L even tried to contact me through a mutual friend, and I had to block them too.

Fluffy has been back with me for about 3 months. She eats well, sleeps on my bed at night and we have generally fallen back into our old routine. This happened immediately. Heck, when I came to pick her up from L's house, she got into the crate and laid down. No fuss whatsoever, so I know she isn't traumatized or anything.

To be perfectly honest, I am glad I have my cat back and I don't feel bad at all. But I am still curious to know what an objective observer thinks. AITA in this situation?"
a8y86j,2,2018-12-23,I think me [23f] and my boyfriend [23m] of 3.5 years might be incompatible. Thoughts?,rosedye,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a8y86j/i_think_me_23f_and_my_boyfriend_23m_of_35_years/,"Hi all,

Sorry this post might be jumbled with a lot of thoughts. It is the first time I am gathering my thoughts and I just don't know how to arrange it well.

To begin with, my boyfriend is an amazing guy. We have always had a pretty good relationship overall. We both generally don't cause conflicts and have a happy harmonious relationship. We both are also a bit non confrontational in general. I started dating him when I was 19 when I was still naive and honestly, just not aware about me or relationships. I lived under a bubble usually. We both are coming from south asian backgrounds so we both used to the concept of arranged marriages and working things out. I felt pretty blessed that I found a lover at age 19 when I moved from Dubai to Canada for university and we are working things out, what else can I want?

I am super talkative and my boyfriend isn't. In the beginning, when we were getting to know each other (we met in university), we had a lot of things to talk about. He was the first guy to show me attention, I was def head over heels. I believe my boyfriend has been in 1 proper relationship before so he is aware about it more than me. I feel since I am a bit silly in nature, people tend to be protective of me and most of my friends are super protective and spend a LOT of time with me. So I remained in that bubble for 2 more years. Now, since we both were dating and in university, we both often did assignment together and often cuddled and made out. We also moved in together. I feel I care about the fact my parents are conservation so we never had sex as I didn't want them to be disappointed in me. (Being the girl in my culture, it is slightly frowned upon having sex before marriage).

Around age 21, I started understanding myself a lot when I moved away for internship in California. I love talking and expressing my ideas. I really care about a lot of things, hobbies and activities. I have this energy where I wanna channel it into something useful which I am still trying to figure it out. I definitely started reading more books, gathering knowledge and met many people who are much more relatable to me. I didn't realized I was capable of so much and trying to embrace that. I didn't even know I was relatively attractive and got a lot of attention in general. I was always living in a nice content bubble. Now, I want to be uncomfortable, since I was always with my parents before I didn't know the world outside.

I changed a lot recently. Before, I was indifferent to several ideas, thoughts and philosophies. Now over the process of 1-2 years, I have changed a lot. Now my boyfriend is relatively quiet guy who is still in that indifference stage. Anytime I want to start a conversation or express a thought, he has the attitude of we are just members of the society with no power to change anything so how does it matter to have any opinion. I used to believe that too till I started caring and putting in effort. So I cannot have any general discussion with him because of that attitude. I am craving for just talks about how we want to contribute to the world or want to shape our lives or our goals of lives. He just wants to make money and live happily and peacefully whereas I want to be constantly tested upon and pushed to reach greater heights. I sometimes fall behind when I see him so content and happy where he is but I want to push myself forward. But being around him, I tend to start feeling content too and I don't want to be content. I wanna push myself and push each other. He says he can be the stay at home dad who ensures I am well fed when I am done with ""changing the world"". He also got into video games, weed culture and has a great paying job so he is definitely very content all the times.

Since he doesn't really talk much, we do fun activities together like cooking or going for a vacation and scuba diving and such. He has been supportive of me all through out university. For example, he got me gifts like calculator when he saw me struggling with an old one. (I didn't even realize my problems till he found those solutions) Super simple ones but he clearly cares as he constantly sees where I am struggling and helps me. Super caring guy in general. He even drove me home every single day from work in his car (now I can drive but back then I couldn't).

Whenever I used to go to his room, he would greet and cuddle with me while watching netflix. That is fine but I wanna do fun hobbies together or do goal setting or have a serious conversation. We haven't exactly have ever had any serious conversations about anything. Our conversation ends up being about other people since I just cannot connect with things I wanna talk about. He is more physically demanding than I ever can be. I just don't like the thought of making out, I would rather code together, cook something fun together and share a lot of laughs. I cannot sit down in one place watching netflix like him and just wanna do stuff together. Whenever I propose idea of some classes together, he rejects out of laziness and then I also drop it. I want to do classes together mainly to maintain the relationship and not because I am not comfortable going alone. He rather just cuddle, touch each other bodies and I feel maybe I am a prude as I don't want to touch him? I feel so horribly wrong doing it but do it to make him feel happy and loved.

He moved away to Seattle 4 months ago and we are in long distance relationship. We haven't video chatted much as he isn't talkative and I feel like telling my ideas is kinda a waste? I feel I cannot get energy from his reaction. I would rather have him give feedback on those ideas and we both work on it together but it isn't there. Whereas I have met other people who love listening my ideas and also sharing theirs and it's a great conversation. I just never had that with my boyfriend.

There is lack of general want to learn or improve from his end so I don't feel like sharing much. I am usually considered ""bubbly, hyper, energetic, really talkative"", but somehow when I am around him, I mellow down. He is more ""shy, reserved, smart"" kinda guy. Since we both are ""we will work things out"" kinda of people or non confrontational, I feel we just slide somethings through. He joined my social circle and since he is super reserved, I would be super upset if we break up and he loses friends.

What is going on here? I am feeling a bit confused about this situation. An amazing guy who cares about my needs but somehow feels super mis-matched. I feel bad for coming to this realization so late into my relationship especially for a guy who has supported me through out. We have never been exactly best friends (I guess I am his best friend, not too sure who are his other friends as he is super introverted and prefers just being in his room). Since he is really reserved, I do not know how to make out of him. I am terrible at reading silence but he just goes into a hole when I confront him and I feel terrible. I want us to both talk out our problems but he rather leave me in silence and just apologize. I am not blaming him, I just want him to tell his side of the story. He just ends up being sorry for everything. I feel miserable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also not too fond of his bitching nature where he kinda behaves as if everyone else is trying to hurt him and just lack of compassion and care to anyone else. I get super emphatic towards anyone I meet and listen to their story and get new friends. Whereas, he doesn't make a lot of effort meeting people and doesn't care about anyone easily. I think he takes it super slowly. I care easily and he doesn't. I know he cares about me but that's from his actions.  Not sure if my actions justify it but I need to feel more connected to care more. Like I need to learn about his goals to help him achieve it. He knows my goals so he can help me out. He never complains about me and is super content with our relationship. Somehow, I am not content. I feel terrible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I tell anyone my story, I feel I end up blaming me for everything and not making enough effort but I am not sure. 

What do I do reddit? I feel trapped.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Amazing supportive boyfriend feels not compatible. The way we react to situations is super different and I don't know how to handle it.  "
a8ymmj,6,2018-12-23,"Personal Statement Tips for Grad Students, Transfers, Veterans, and Job Seekers",koodoos,StatementOfPurpose,https://www.reddit.com/r/StatementOfPurpose/comments/a8ymmj/personal_statement_tips_for_grad_students/,"As you apply for college programs at various point in your life, your personal statement should differ as a result. Admissions committees expect a personal statement for a transfer student to be much different from a college admissions essay from an incoming freshman student. With that in mind, here are some unique considerations to keep in mind when writing personal statements as an undergrad, transfer, veteran, graduate school applicant, or job seeker. 

### Writing a personal statement for undergrad

When applying for undergraduate admission, you should primarily focus [your essay](https://koodooslearning.com/blog-list/what-is-a-personal-statement) on what has shaped your interests throughout your life, specifically over the last four years of high school. You should also focus on your academic studies and experiences in high school as well as how they’ve prepared you for a college-level curriculum. Another important topic you should write about for your essays is how you will fit into the culture of the college and what unique attributes you’ll bring to campus. For diversity and supplemental statements focus on your community, personal identity, and any adversity you’ve experienced in your life. 

### Writing a personal statement for veterans

As an active-duty veteran, I’ll be the first to say that in the military we get accustomed to writing in a very specific military-style, which is characterized by communication of the bottom line up front and and a focus on informing the reader. This concise and straightforward style is essential for military communications, but doesn’t work well for writing personal statements that are meant to be somewhat creative and introspective. So [for veterans](https://koodooslearning.com/blog-list/2018/9/1/5-tips-to-write-a-memorable-personal-statement), remember to inject your personality into your writing and ditch the objectivity characteristic of the military writing style. Further, most college admissions committees are comprised of civilians with little experience working with military personnel or reading military correspondence. So avoid using military jargon or translate military speak to the civilian equivalent. 

Some schools might also expect you to discuss your military service and how those experiences have influenced your educational and career goals. I recommend including this type of information in your personal statements in so far as you would with any other job you’ve had in the past, especially if the experience has been a significant part of your life over the last few years.

### Writing a personal statement for transfer students 

As a transfer student, you should have a bit of a different focus for your personal statement than the average high school senior. For instance, you might want to discuss the specific reasons you wish to leave your current college/university or program of study. You might also devote space in your statement to explaining your current academic interests and what prerequisites you will complete before transferring. 

Personal statements from transfer students should reflect the experience and maturity of someone who has already attended college. It should also demonstrate your understanding of the effort it takes to pursue a college education, and balance competing demands in a university setting.

For transfer students, the college application essay is also your opportunity to take responsibility for less-than-perfect grades, recognize academic challenges, and explain the steps they have taken to conquer them. 

### Writing a personal statement for graduate school.

Often, the readers of your [graduate school statement of purpose](https://koodooslearning.com/blog-list/brainstorming-grad-statement-of-purpose) want to see you answer three general questions:

* **Why them?** Your graduate school admissions essay should hone in on the specifics of why you want to study in the program you’re applying to. Why are you applying to *this* school, department, internship, or program and not some other? What is special about them? Are there specific professors you’d like to work and conduct research with and why? What are your connections to the program’s location? 
* **Why you?** What is special about you? What is in your background, interests, or achievements that shows you are an ideal candidate? Remember though that grad schools, more than undergrad program, also expect to benefit from having you as a student, so it’s important to also explain how you will contribute to the culture, reputation, and work of the program through your research and leadership activities.
* **Why now?** Grad school admissions committees and department heads are also hoping to understand why you’re applying at this point in your life, whether that is straight out of undergrad or after a 10-year career. More importantly, they want to know how the decision to pursue a graduate education right now fits in with your long-term goals?

### Writing a personal statement for a job or internship

A personal statement for a [summer job](https://koodooslearning.com/blog-list/2018/11/5/adrzfcgtl5iqqobcmsmbv04ep2va6t) or internship will differ than a personal statement for college admissions in that it should stress the qualifications that will make you successful in the workplace or lab. Your focus for these essays should be on the skills, experiences, and education that makes you a good fit for the job. Include content that explains the personal strengths and traits that have prepared you to be successful in the position you’re applying for. 

My recommendation is to take the job listing, list out the key attributes and skills the position calls for, and to focus your essay narrative on describing the particular experiences and learning that has prepared to fulfill those criteria. "
a8yonk,2,2018-12-23,Thoughts and advice on break-up,N0toriousDre,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a8yonk/thoughts_and_advice_on_breakup/,"Hi Reddit!

My ex and I were in a relationship for almost two years, with the last four being LDR. She got into a doctorate program 8 hours away. I didn’t get in, but I was so proud of her for achieving her dream. She really wanted to do long distance and I agreed 100%. When classes started, she kept telling me, “I’m so stressed and spread thin between classes, internship, and you. Something has to give.” I suggested doing “smaller things” to relieve stress and replace “big things” (ex. Long facetimes). She continued to say, “You don’t understand what it’s like out here”, though she told me she told other people that I am her “biggest support and a great boyfriend”. 

After these comments, I brought up the fact that when she says that, it makes me feel anxious and worried that I may be the thing to give. She responded with, “Jesus fucking Christ are you absolutely trying to make me feeling like shit?” She continued to become increasingly short with me over text messages as the weeks went by, stating she was “tired” and didn’t have the “emotional capacity” to respond to my text messages. A week before she broke up with me, I sent her a text saying, “Hey I know that you are overwhelmed and stress with your program, but I just wanted to let you know how appreciative I am that you still make time to text and call me.” She responded with, “I love you and that’s very sweet, but I don’t have the emotional energy to respond to that text in full”. 

We planned for me to visit in November when Thanksgiving break started. Four months into long distance, the day before I’m supposed to drive down to visit, she calls me and says, “I think we need to take a break or break up”. When I asked the rules of the break, she had no answer. She thought it was best for her to break up. I told her in times like this, we need to lean on each other and not move apart to no avail. She said she had no plans on dating because she had “too much work”, which made me suspicious because I didn’t bring her possible being interested in another guy. She then went on to say that after she completed her program and I completed mine (hopefully) that we could try again, but I suspect that was to ease her guilty conscious. She gave up on us. I was mad and told her I wanted my gifts back and “I love you have a good life”. The next day I called to let her know that she should keep the gifts (because gifts are gifts), but I would like the DVDs of my favorite show back I received as a gift. She agreed to mail them back after Thanksgiving, but did not tell me when she shipped them. When I finally received my DVDs, I noticed one was missing, but I did not break NC to ask for it back. There was no note in the box of DVDs, which would’ve confused me emotionally, but it just felt cold to me. 

The entire time I’ve suspected she’s been emotional cheating on me. She said she was going out for an hour-1.5 hours, but went out for 6 (very out of character). When I told her, I was worried because I didn’t hear from you till really late, she said I was being controlling and she doesn’t need to tell me every aspect of her life (ex. “Am I supposed to tell you when I get a drink, then when I play a game, then when I go to the bathroom?”). The next day she tells me how “Xxx is so funny and makes me laugh. He said I was good at darts and kept score. He jokes and says we’re not friends, but we definitely are.” 
I just don’t know what was real and what was fake anymore. I don’t know if she left me for that guy, or if this was an emotional decision. I don’t know if she used me to get to her program and then wanted to start new and left me behind. She has not reached out to me since I reached out to ask for DVDs back. I don’t know if she regrets her actions or try and reach out in the future. I don’t think it’s fair that she wants to try again after she finishes her program. She told me, “not to wait” and, “I just want you to be happy” after she told me she may want to try again in the future after her program is completed. I don’t know what to make of any of this and I was hoping for some advice. To me it sounds like the pressure of the program got to her and she found another guy to help ease the feelings of stress. Thanks reddit and let me know what you think!

a8yqzw,3,2018-12-23,May be going to OCS earlier than expected and scared I'm not ready (specifically fitness wise),navythrowaway72387,newtothenavy,https://www.reddit.com/r/newtothenavy/comments/a8yqzw/may_be_going_to_ocs_earlier_than_expected_and/,"Sorry for the long post. Graduated from college and got rejected for intel at the 12 JUN 2018 IWC board. Decided to just go for SWO after taking some time to figure things out. After slowdowns with paperwork and my recruiter getting changed on me (long story) my recruiter told me like a month ago that my package was in for the SWO board which would convene in FEB 2019. While all this was happening I previously got accepted for fall semester to an extremely stressful postgrad internship in DC with very big time commitments. I  unfortunately neglected physical fitness to some extent this semester because I had almost no time to work out, and figured I'd have at least 2-3 months after Christmas before actually arriving at OCS to get my shit together situps/pushups/running wise.

Fast forward to 19 DEC and my recruiter calls me to say that I was pro rec Y. (How? What?? Did they invent time travel?) My recruiter also emailed me a pre-commissioning form to fill out ASAP for insurance stuff. For some reason my cell reception is fucked whenever I call this guy and sometimes things are unclear but I believe he stated the order of operations was 1) return pre-commissioning form 2) wait for FINSEL letter 3) receive FINSEL letter 4) Show up for a pre-OCS PRT and swearing-in ceremony where I will receive plane tickets to go to OCS. I believe he also said there was no set date for when I would get the FINSEL letter or what class I would be in but I think he also said something about ""January"". As in it could be theoretically possible for me to be in the first OCS class this coming year.

At this point I said ""Wtf?"" and checked airwarriors. People are saying there was some kind of unannounced ""Immediate"" Selection Board that convened on 17 DEC. People are also saying on airwarriors that a reason for this would be that they have immediate slots to fill for the very first class. (I'm posting here rather than there because /newtothenavy  seems more willing to actually help people).

Now here's my main problem/question.  In retrospect neglecting fitness was a mistake that I am owning up to -- I'm by no means fat and have managed to get a few runs in here and there over the past few months. But I'm out of shape compared to my condition six months ago and I'm afraid if I took a test tomorrow I would fail. This ""immediate selection board"" caught me completely off guard and I'm afraid I've screwed myself.

1. My recruiter said I have to do a pre-OCS PRT at around the same time as my swearing-in ceremony. This runs COMPLETELY contrary to everything I have read and heard which is that your first PRT  is when you arrive at OCS (the Initial Strength Test (IST) according to a ""OCS preparations letter"" I found somewhere on public.navy.mil). I'm not saying I have an excuse for not being 100% ready right now because I should be. But I thought I had a 1-2 months buffer to really crank down and workout in addition to studying OCS prep materials. If there is a pre-OCS PRT and I hypothetically fail what happens? Do I get immediately and permanently DQ'd or do I get another chance? From what I can read they got rid of the pre-OCS PRT like 8 years ago, but when it existed, it had to be done within 30 days of the PRO-REC letter.  More than anything else I just want a clear answer on if this pre-OCS PRT exists and if so how much time I'd have to prepare for it. I may be able to scrape by if I have at least 2-3 weeks. 

2. Based on the weird ""immediate selection board"" circumstances what is the likelihood I'm going to be in the 20 JAN OCS class rather than a later one? Or is this one of those things where there's no way to know?  Leaving for Rhode Island for the 20 JAN OCS class would be a very quick turnaround for me in my current situation even beyond the physical readiness stuff. I will try to study some of the OCS study material that exists online in whatever time I have but I understand this amount of time is probably something out of my control.

3. Any other advice anyone has based on reading my situation? This would be a dumb reason for me to get myself DQ'd after the time and effort of the app process. I just flew back to my parents' place from DC the other day and am going out the door in about an hour to do a 4 mile run and pushups/situps burnout -- I will grind hard in whatever little time I have left. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: May have to take PRT for OCS sooner than expected and don't know for sure I can pass.

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

**2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you**

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) You are paying me to sleep with you (at least at first) which is both surprising for someone of your fame and beauty and also just a bit illegal

7) Some combination of the above... most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

a8zd8a,25,2018-12-23,So I graduated from college but...now what?,throwaway_2367,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/a8zd8a/so_i_graduated_from_college_butnow_what/,"I graduated with a B.S in Biology about 2 weeks ago after an agonizing 5 years of irrelevant gen ed classes and stress-inducing chemistry tests. Ugh. But getting straight the point, normally, seniors would be excited for this very moment. However, I wasn't all that excited for my graduation. Even in the weeks before when I knew it was finally happening, I was definitely happy to be out once and for all, but when I think about the reality of my situation afterwards, I just couldn't find that excitement that everyone else had. 

I have no friends in my area now that I'm back home. The very few friends that I managed to make at college live around that area which is an hour and some change away from my house. I already know they aren't going to want to make the drive to come up here and I won't make the drive to them either. They've already expressed their disappointment to such a far distance so that's why I assume they wouldn't want to. Now I'm back home with my mom who's controlling and thinks she knows everything and my dad who is corny and embarrassing and I have to live under their rules. Not being in a dorm now, I have no place to fully express myself anymore except when I'm alone in my room or if I have the house to myself which is very rare. My brother is still in high school but he's been the one person who has been the friend I need right now. Only problem is that I'm not out to him yet and still observing whether he would be receptive of it or not. I'm out to my parents and they are accepting so that's great even though it's still awkward to mention at times but that's besides the point lol.

I have a very rough plan for my future. My to do list now is to fill out applications for internships, jobs, and grad school but I haven't found any motivation to start yet. I've only started one internship application.

I also just feel down in the dumps all the time. I just don't know what to do with myself now. I don't feel like talking to or reaching out to anyone. I don't feel like going out in public. But I also know it's not good for me to waste my days here at home not doing anything constructive. I'm just so confused about my life right now. My chest feels full of anxiety and my mind feels like it's playing tug o war. I want to be alone and not do anything but I want the opposite at the same time. I haven't been able to sleep well either and I think it's because of all this. I just don't know what to do with myself now and it's frustrating. All I've known is school and home. I honestly didn't want to go to college but I didn't know what to do after graduating high school. That and mom forced me to go. She probably knew I had no plan so there's that. But now I've come back full circle with the same issue I faced 5 years ago. Frustrating is all I can say to describe this right now.

Sorry if I'm rambling but I have no plan, structure, or stability in my life. I don't know if this is a thing but I feel like I have post-grad depression lol. Idk I just need some sound advice right now. "
a8zni8,2,2018-12-23,Am I (M/31) being paranoid about and assuming wrongly because of a few broken promises (F/24),tldcq,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/a8zni8/am_i_m31_being_paranoid_about_and_assuming/,"I've been in a long distance relationship with my SO for 3 years. We got to meet recently for the first time, and it was better than I could have imagined. We have a very close and dedicated relationship, despite some arguments a few times. My whole family knows her as my fiance, as my mother had wanted to send her a ring or gift earlier in the year as a formality for engagement in my country. I have talked to her mother a few times, but her parents don't consider me her fiance because she says in her country, there must be a traditional engagement ceremony first.

We both live in different countries, and she has gotten a job in a third country, starting from next year.Both of us  have wanted to move out of  respective home countries, and to be with each other as soon as possible.

There have been a few points in the relationship where it seems that she casually promises something, and later isn't able to or willing to keep her word. One such thing where it happens repeatedly is where she would start to write in capital letters/shout and curse, while I am talking normally. When I request her to talk calmly, she says I annoyed her and I deserve it. Afterwards she apologizes sincerely and promises to not do that, but it again happens and has been repeated about a dozen times. She has gotten offended and angry a few times when I mentioned to her some old broken promises; and how some of those broken promises related to our future make me doubt that our relationship is as much a priority for her as it is for me, or as much as she herself thinks it is. Last such incident was yesterday, and she told me I was just paranoid and was misunderstanding her intentions. I had also told her at that time that we can ask in some forum if I can trust her still, and if more than 50% say no, then we can amicably break up. Otherwise we can continue to hope and wait till the next time she has to prove your words (In past she used to casually mention she wants to break up after small arguments as well). Afterwards I had told her that I didn't mean that and was being silly, and even if 100% had told me to breakup I won't as I love her. A little recap of recent events which were a catalyst for my feelings:

1. Earlier in the year I was planning to meet her, and since she couldn't have come here, and her country was infamous for denying visas for alone guys from my country, I had suggested we meet in a third country. She was objecting to most of them, but was warm to one country, Y. The second time I discussed it with her, however, she said she can't meet there as her parents won't allow her to go there to meet with me alone. I had wanted to avoid applying for visa for her country because I kept reading that if a first visit visa is rejected, it can be bad for future travels. Especially for country like mine.
2. She had then asked me if I can't try to still apply for her country. I had agreed on the condition that if my visa is refused, then she will come to my country so we can get married quickly (without a ceremony) to make it easier for future travels and relocation. And then later we'll have a ceremony in her country when possible. She had agreed to that; i.e she will come to my country and we'll get married here, if my visa to her country is refused.
3. I applied for a visa for her country, and it was unfortunately rejected. In those days she was doing an internship in Europe, which was finishing in a month. Since I was really looking forward to meeting her, I told that I can come with my mother to country Y, so her parents didn't have the objection of meeting a guy alone, will she then come to Y. She said yes, and to quote her "" I can come to country Y at any time"".
4. I applied for visa for country Y with my mother, and it was granted. For a day after telling her that it was granted, I kept waiting for her to mention any of her plan to come to country Y, but she didn't. Then I myself asked her if she won't come there to meet me, and she said ""I am not sure"". She told that her father had just mentioned the loan he had gotten for her internship, and she wanted to give that money back to him instead. That was extremely hurtful and confusing to me, and all I could think of was how she was making an excuse, and I kept remembering her promise of "" I can come to country Y at any time"". She explained that it was only because her father had mentioned that loan thing just a day ago.
5. After a while of me reminding her, that my sole reason for going to that country was to meet her and she had assured me she can come there any time, she said she'll come. I then insisted to buy her ticket, as her hotel cost was considerable as well and she was paying that. (We were in separate rooms)
6. Our meeting was awesome and after she returned, I had mentioned in passing her assurance in #2, to reduce the months to year long process of the relocation process to the country where she had gotten job. She said she can't come to my country and risk her job visa. After I expressed how bad that sounded and of her promise, her explanation was that she wants us to be in a better country and is prioritizing that. We both are from developing countries, and her job is in a developed country in Europe.
7. The preliminary plan was then to apply for her country's visa again, with family this time, and she will come on a leave for getting married there. She had told me it's not possible for her to get leave before 6 months in her new job (her first job). I asked her if the rule was for any leave or only paid. She told me it's for any leave. Some days later I had wanted to see if marriage might have some exception for that leave rule, and came to know that people can take unpaid leave before 6 months too. When I told her that, she said ""Why would I take a non paid one? you want me to get kicked off obviously"" . Then she said that her contract has a clause that she can take a LEAVE ONLY after 6 months. I tried to express that it will mention paid leave, but she insisted it was any leave and that it was a 1 year contract and she didn't want to get a leave so soon as the company might find it bad, and that my imagination and judgement is faulty about her intentions of living together soon.
8. Recently she had signed a contract for an apartment where her job is (14% of her salary). While finding the apartments I had mentioned to her how this apartment was too small for spouse visa requirement. In the ad where she had found this one, there were 2 other larger apartments which I had suggested to get instead (fulfilling the requirement for spouse visa) in same building for 27% of her salary. She told me she would rather get the smaller one to save money and can quickly change it when I'll have to apply for either a fiance or spouse visa. She was also concerned about the 3 months total advance rent she will have to pay, for which her father will need a loan. I had insisted that I will send her the deposit but she didn't agree. I had also seen in the contract that while advance notice is for 3 months, she can't terminate her contract until 6 months have passed. I had asked her to inquire the landlord about it but she said there is no need as the type of contract where she can leave early has higher rent. I hadn't understood exactly what she meant, but didn't want to argue or ask more so left it at that. (Paraphrasing her: She was told by many people that finding apartment takes at least 2 months and she has to stay in a hotel for 20 days before she'll be moving in that apartment, and it was hard to find

A few days ago I told her it seemed better to directly apply for a marriage visa for the country where her job is going to be, instead of first going to her home country after 6 months, and then having to wait 6 months to a year+ before we can be together. During that discussion I came to know that her apartment's ad had two options, one short term and one permanent contract which couldn't be terminated before 6 months. I got annoyed at why she had signed that contract, while also telling me she can quickly change apartments. And I said how she hadn't mentioned to me the possibility of a short term contract, and deliberately removed the question I had written for her landlord. She got furious and said she had mentioned to me the expensive rent for second contract, and I told her it didn't explain short term vs long term contract limitations. She is of the view that my accusation was sick and that I should trust her more. I had requested her to think of everything from my perspective considering the recent promises and contradicting events as being the reason for my emotional state and doubts. She said I was paranoid and assume wrong stuff.

I would like a third person's view if I had justification for the times I doubted that her intentions aligned with her actions,  Or if I made ""sick accusations"" while being paranoid. 

TL;DR: A few promises, events and apparent contradictions related to my SO's intentions for meeting, marrying and living together had me doubt her commitment and priorities. She feels hurt and angry that I don't trust her enough and imagine bad stuff about her."

a90tu3,2,2018-12-23,Broke up 3 months ago and I still feel something,mannybars93,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/a90tu3/broke_up_3_months_ago_and_i_still_feel_something/,"Hi guys,   


This will be a lengthy post and any comment on it would be greatly appreciated.   


I (25M) had my first ever relationship in 2017 that was when I got together with my then GF (22F). I wasn't her first but I thought that I will be the one that will eventually go all the way with her.  When we first started, we were very happy although there were alot of comments that we were not suitable for one another, particularly a few of my friends in college at the time told me of her past and that she was not who I thought she was. My heart, however, at the time felt that they were merely envious or jealous that I managed to get close to someone like that. She at the time was dating somebody (in an open relationship) and thus I did not make any moves, merely maintaining a friendship as I believed that it would be morally wrong and that it would not bode well for the other party.   


It was only after being together with her, that I realised that there were issues, I felt like I was putting in effort in the relationship trying to make things work out, adapting to her needs, understanding her. But I felt that she did not reassure me in some ways and would always do things behind my back. At the time, I thought that I was too controlling and that I was restricting her. There were other guys that she met on Tinder in the past that would text her and ask if she wanted to go on a trip with them, while others bought really expensive stuff and taking her to fanciful dinners. Above that, she liked the nightlife and would always get drinks from other guys (she felt that paying for drinks was overrated), while I was past the stage and felt that it would be fine if she went with a group of girls to party but it was always with a group of guys and they will join other guy groups to get free drinks. It made me feel at a loss but I accepted it any way because I did not want a break-up. Things got rocky 4 months in and she wanted a break, I talked her out of it as I felt that things could be solved if we merely had an open communication.   


A year in to our relationship, came a guy, she started hanging out with him more often and told me that they were friends, what I found out later from reading her phone ( I know, major intrusion of privacy but it was killing me inside) that she was majorly flirting with him and even told her friend that if her friend and him got together to let her know so that she can let go of him. Reading it made me feel as though I was not important but I still wanted to be together with her, whats worst was when I found out that on the night of her clubbing while talking to me, she texted the guy and asked him to meet her while asking if he slept alone and added a winky face at the end. I died a little bit inside but still try to make things work. She eventually told me that the guy was her old date and that she did not have closure and feelings arose again, this was before her flight to Australia, and she later on went on a date in Australia with the club manager and hanged out with different guys. Eventually we did break up over the fact that she realised that she has no feelings for me and it would be good that we ended things.   


A week in after the first break up, there was some issues and when I returned her clothes back to her, she texted me a lengthy text stating that she realised that she had feelings for me, and that there was not a day that she did not thought of me. That she loved me and missed me, reading her text, made me thought that maybe my friends were wrong of her. I FINALLY HAD A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS BECAUSE SHE LOVED ME. And we patched back in September, but things felt wrong after that, it felt like she was not putting in any effort. One fine day, I told her: "" I love you"" and she kept quiet and said that she did not want to say something that she did not mean. I asked her about the text she sent and she said that that was a goodbye text. Later I realised, that she told her friends that I am secure and stable and she was tired of knowing somebody new and being single. She had no feelings for me. I also developed panic attacks from the first break up and had suicidal thoughts one day, I needed an emotional support, not only did she sounded cold to me but she told her friend that I had panic attacks and that she was not a fking babysitter.   


I asked her about does she really has no feelings for me, hoping that we could still make things work but she told me that she felt that she was still young and that she has options, she wanted to be independent and did not want to rely on anybody. Above that she said that she did not have feelings for me anymore.   


We ended things, and I tried to be her friend after that because I did not want to lose her, but as I was still recovering, I would not text her constantly but I do reply her whenever she needed my help. One fine day, she deleted my contact and said that she felt that she was the only one maintaining the friendship, and just moved on. My heart shattered once again.  


I am now a shell of my former self, and that I am seeking a therapist to heal my panic attacks, while she is out on a date with another guy that she met, posting on her private account their dates and what not. I cannot seem to focus on my internship and felt pains in my heart all the time. Drinking and smoking seem to not help, and I am dying a little every single day. "

Sadly, it was mainly long distance, and lasted about 7 months or so. We did visits in between, she studied in Europe during the fall, I visited her twice. We both go to the same university in the US. After coming back from my 2nd visit, we had a big blowing out because I was tired of her not showing the same effort as I was. I had always let this slide because it was never really that big of a deal and it was just something that came with being distant physically, she made me aware of this when we started dating. When we're together we've never even had the slightest disagreement. Anyways, the little arguments and stuff started in about month 5, after the first visit. We had taken a break from the relationship after the 2nd visit, and broke up about 2 weeks later. She revealed she was planning to break up with me in person, so I had pulled the plug first in a somewhat mutual breakup. I was tired of waiting around. So I guess the question I am posing is this. We're bound to have an in person conversation when school starts up in early January. We both have to exchange things back and forth that we have. I haven't talked to her at all since we broke up. When we have this talk, should I:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Be willing to continue to fight for her and show that I'd like to have her back?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Be willing to give her a second chance on what has really been a relationship that fell apart in her hands?

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Be completely against the idea of getting back together and just move on?

&amp;#x200B;

Her reason for wanting to break up was that she KNOWS for a fact that we're ""incompatible"" long term. It was less than 2 months ago that we were making jokes about kids and marriage, and it wasn't something that I started the idea of. So I'm not blind, it just seems she had a major change of heart. I know the distance was part of it, and I feel like she was out of her normal life for so long being abroad that it just was messing with her head. I know she was homesick and really wanted to leave about 45 days earlier than she was supposed to, but couldn't. She has hurt me a lot over this whole break and break up ordeal but I do truly still care about her because I believe deep down there is a connection there and that she's a better person than she's shown. Like I mentioned earlier, not even the slightest disagreement in person. Every moment together in person seemed like a magical scene from a movie or something. It really has just left me extremely confused. As for how I've handled the break up, I'd say fine so far. I have caught myself trying to ignore the pain she caused and I realize that's not the best way of going about it. I'm still living my life normally and doing things with family and friends, so it's not like I'm crawled up in a ball crying all day and night over it. But again, I never really wanted to end the relationship in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: She hasn't removed any photos of me or anything. I should also mention that when we were on a break, I had blocked her on social media to avoid any childish games or stalking being played. I have anxiety issues she's aware of and I didn't need that messing with my head. Due to a responsibility I have at school, I need to access social media. So staying off completely wasn't an option. She didn't like this. I did explain to her the reasoning behind this when we began to talk about where we wanted to go about 17 days into the break, but she told me it was clear that I wanted to ""break up"" because I blocked her. I thought I was being mature. She also has admitted she needs to grow up a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

First girlfriend of 7 months and I broke up somewhat mutually, I didn't want to but she did, we did long distance due to internships and study abroad, made it almost to the end, and she seemed to ""give up"" over some really silly fights that weren't about anything other than her not giving me similar effort. Should I try to make things work when I see her next or just move on? I feel like if we had been able to spend all of this time in person, things would still be going strong."

This past fall semester I effed up my GPA big time. I started the semester with a GPA of 3.44. Not the greatest, but there was still hope for raising it. After this semester, my cumulative GPA is a 2.9 :( 

My problem was that this year I said “yes” to WAY to many commitments. I became an Resident Assistant, I had a job, I was in a fraternity, and I was in 6 student organizations, 3 of which I held leadership in. It all took a toll on me, and I was in a position where I half-assed everything and I let everyone down. I got super depressed, and I just stop caring about anything, much less school. 

Is there still hope for me? Can I still go to a T-14 law school or even another respectable law school? I have 2 good internships under my belt, one with a state senator, one at a non profit law office, I haven’t taken my LSAT yet, and I am a racial minority (if that helps)

If I want to go to a good law school, what steps to I need to take? I really am a hardworking student, and last semester isn’t an accurate reflection of what I am capable of. 

Please help,

Sincerely, a hopeless sophomore "

a92hqq,2,2018-12-24,Help me Upgrade a Gaming PC,fatrob22,buildmeapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildmeapc/comments/a92hqq/help_me_upgrade_a_gaming_pc/,"Hi,

I have a gaming pc that has become a little outdated and isn’t performing as while as I’d like in some new releases (BF5, BO4, Insurgency Sandstorm). 

Current Specs:

1.	Intel i5-4690k
2.	Cryorig H7 CPU COOLER
3.	Some Gigabyte Motherboard
4.	16 GB DDR3 Ram
5.	EVGA GTX 1080 ACX 3.0
6.	Samsung Evo 256 GB SSD
7.	Samsung Pro 512 GB SSD
8.	WD Black 750 GB HD
9.	 Corsair 750W PSU
10. Phanteks Eclipse P400

I have the Dell S2716DG 1440p G-Sync Monitor so I’d like to play at 1440p with pretty high FPS. 

I really like my case so I’d probably keep that, my storage devices would all come and I would just replace to 128 GB boot drive I have currently. I’d reuse the GPU and possibly the CPU cooler but that depends on what I would upgrade to.

I used to follow PC building super closely but school has picked up a ton and I’ve had an internship for the past couple months so I’m out of the loop. 

What would my recommended upgrade path be? I tend to game quite a bit and like to play the newer stuff as it comes out. I’ve head good things about RYZEN and am wondering if that should be the direction I should head in. It’s also a pain to move a system to a new CPU/Mobo correct? I’d probably need a fresh install but that shouldn’t be too much trouble.

Let me know if any more info is needed.

Thanks!

a92wbc,1,2018-12-24,Not the best christmas,bull____dog,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a92wbc/not_the_best_christmas/,"I try to keep this short. I guess I just need some kind words in a difficult situation.
We've been together with my fiancee for 5 years, lived together for 4. We we're supposed to get married and buy our own house this winter. She did an internship abroad this autumn and after her return she told me two weeks ago that she wants to move out, be more independent and figure out what she wants in life in general. ""It's not you it's me"" and all of that. Still she says that she loves me and wants to have some sort of a relationship with me. 

I feel like she is trying to leave me waiting for her if her new life doesen't work out. I'm finding it really hard to trust her that she is being honest about her true feelings and about what happened during her internship. Now we are spending the christmas at her parents place in a different city and acting like everything is okay. It's pretty much tearing me apart. I know the only solution for me is to break up with her and not to leave waiting for something that isn't there anymore. 

Merry christmas to everyone heartbroken. Next year will be better. "
a92xdd,2,2018-12-24,Psychotic Break?,seacucumber3000,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/a92xdd/psychotic_break/,"I don't know what happened. Ask anyone I know and they'll tell you I'm a normal college kid - got friends, good grades, I like my major, plays hockey, and most of all happy (or at least contempt) with life. No problems in my book. Maybe a little frustrated about not having an internship yet, but I still have a ridiculously cool part-time job prospect, finished up the year strong, just got back from our beach house after partying there with friends for two nights, and am now on break for four weeks. Like I said, no problems. 

But that changed this morning. After a good breakfast and hanging out with my dad at the dining table, I was excited thinking about the possibility of getting a desk for my room and moving some of the furniture around, so I'll have a place to work at home. But my dad, being frustrating as he can be some times, eventually says in a frustrated and condescending tone something like how he doesn't want the bedroom cluttered. I honestly don't even remember his exact words, but it's not that he was being a dick or anything.

Anyways, something right then and there broke. I had tea brewing in a loose-leaf tea maker, and I remember going to shake the loose leaves out right after he said that. I normally tap out the leaves into the can, but this time I hit it once, then hit it again harder, then hit it harder still against the inside edge of the trash can, almost knocking it over, in what I assume is anger and frustration. I then broke down into tears and rushed into the bathroom, locking the door behind me to make sure I could cry out in private. I don't even know why I was crying, it was honestly a violent mood swing.

Soon enough I clear up, but for the rest of the day I've been in an apathetic, tired, and antisocial state. Friends have texted me and I'm not responding to them. I've barely spoken to my dad today, and I was VERY quiet and ""out of it"" all dinner at a sushi place with my mom and two sisters. I am a huge hockey fan, but decided to roll over and close sleep instead of watching my favorite team play when I turned their game on tonight. 

After dinner, I got home, wrapped up two Christmas gifts and once again broke out into frustration over the most menial of things - probably something with the scissors not cutting the wrapping paper right. I angrily tries stabbing the carpet and floor with the scissors. Afterwards I took a shower, which was fine as far as I can remember. I got out of the shower, and still feeling bored and apathetic, decided to go to sleep wayyyy early around 9:00. 

I was fine when I first tried falling asleep. I was just thinking about some personal CS  projects, which is normal for me to do. But I couldn't fall asleep, and once again started getting frustrated at literally everything. I couldn't breath through my nose due to my cat allergies (we have one) despite being on prescription antihistamines. I was thinking about getting out of bed, and hunting the cat down, to snap it's neck or stab it. Then get up and punch my dad in the face, then jump in front of a train and kill myself. My hair was falling on my face, which pissed me off. My ears were ringing like they never have before, and soon enough I just started randomly thrashing about in bed. I felt super uncomfortable in bed, my pillow too hard and my sheets just not quite feeling right. Turning my head over to the other side would only leave me facing light of my air filter, which even as dull as they are were keeping me from sleeping. I picked up my phone, tried watching a video, then put it back down deciding I couldn't focus.  I thrashed around again, sat up, and started randomly pounding on my head, almost on the verge of tears of frustration, again. I tried watching a video again, but not  before googling shit like schizophrenia and psychosis, trying to figure out what I was feeling the way I was. I eventually got out of bed to take more antihistamine nose spray and a benadryl, hoping that would knock me out. Of course, I managed to drop a benadryl into the toilet while fumbling the package open. I immediately threw the whole box as hard as I could again the bathroom wall, leaving a pretty visible mark. I didn't care. I picked it up and fumbled around with it again, only to drop another one but stop myself before I did anything else disruptive. I frustratingly put the box back in the cabinet and took the pill I had dropped on the floor. I went back to bed, only to once again get frustrated, pissy, and uncomfortable. I sat up again and slammed the side of my hand into the wall as hard as I could, leaving a small dent. Somehow I calmed down and decided I needed to get up and clear my head. I got out of bed, fixed my hair, then put on the kettle for some late-night tea. I knew I needed/wanted to record how I was feeling, and that's what brought me here. I'm scared and confused as to why I broke and have had such violent and frustrated behaviour today. I was quite literally getting frustrated at everything. I'm scared to talk to my family about, I don't want to see any of them right now. I'm just hoping I'm not feeling like this tomorrow...

I mean I don't know at all what's caused this. I don't think it's a panic attack, since I'm not panicking about anything. I'm not having delusions or hallucinations either. Just INSANELY pissy and frustrated at EVERYTHING, leading me to trash out in anger. This has never happened before, and now I just want to be in a good mood, it's Christmas time for God's sake!"
a92z7k,4,2018-12-24,AITA for wanting my sister to acknowledge my apology?,FappableFerret,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a92z7k/aita_for_wanting_my_sister_to_acknowledge_my/,"  

For context: I am currently in Africa doing an internship and my sister is in our home country and has been mentally unstable for about three years now. All of our contact has been through messages sent back and forth. We both handle our problems very differently. I am a person who will apologize quickly, so I lash out once I truly lost my patience and she is more the person who will wait until something blows over.

So we have had a small argument about something insignificant a few days ago. I decided to swallow my pride and apologize to her. I thought I did so in a very carefully constructed way, telling I should not have done the things I did and that I was sorry. She did not respond. It might have been her way of handling the argument we had. Cooling down before sending a message, so that it would not be written out of anger. I decided to text my mom asking if I had done anything wrong.

As time went by, I was getting more annoyed, since I was the one reaching out and swallowing my pride. I did not want to show any of this anger to my sister though, since we have always been very close and me hurting her might sent her back into mental instability. I ended up venting a lot of my anger towards my mother and saying that I want my sister to apologize to me. She managed to calm me down and I went to sleep. 

This morning, I saw that my sister had sent some messages and I was secretly hoping they were apologies. However, These messages were just to show her side of the story and telling me she does not want to include our mother in our arguments. Then there were some casual messages afterwards to try and end this entire situation. This almost broke my patience, since I felt the only reason I included our mother was to protect her from myself. Additionally, she still ignored the apology message I had sent the night before. I sent one message saying that I did not like it that she ignored my apology, because I had to use a lot of self-control to type it. I think it might have been her way of putting this entire situation behind her and moving on. I feel that I need her to at least say that she appreciates that I apologized.

Now I feel like I might sent some hurtful messages if I contact her again, since my patience is almost spent, but I still want the opinion of others. She was right that I should have not included our mother, but the situation gnawed at me and I had to get a second opinion. 

So now I would like to ask you guys: Am I the asshole by saying I want her to acknowledge my apology?

Edit: IATA, after reading what others said. I'm going to apologize that I demanded her to acknowledge me and now I am not going to demand an answer."
a93t18,1,2018-12-24,"Confused about what to learn next for the next few months, Web (JS) or DS/Algo, preparing for a good job",sendmedankmemes3,desicscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/desicscareerquestions/comments/a93t18/confused_about_what_to_learn_next_for_the_next/,"Hi guys, I am an Indian CS undergrad graduating in 2020. I wanted some advice focusing on the Indian CS industry, I'll be glad if I could get a bit of advice here, defrag my mind if you will. My aim right now is to get into a decent software product company after (or during the final year) my graduation, good enough that I get started with really good chances of growth, meaning I do not prefer the large consultancy companies like TCS, Infosys and the like. I am not abandoning the idea entirely, if there is no choice, I will take the best out of whatever I get.

1. As I do not have the tag of a good institute behind me, I decided that self-study and motivation is my only way of learning, so I picked up Python in the beginning, followed by Java. Aside from making a few simple projects I did not do much, I did not do much in the second year due to health issues, and I wanted to learn Android but did not have a good machine then. So in August 2018, I upgraded to a slightly more powerful computer, and learnt native Android and built a couple of project apps and scored an unpaid Internship within 3 months, doing it at the moment.
2. I am starting to experience some major lag in Android Studio now, so the idea of continuing to make Android apps on my machine does not feel that productive for the moment. I feel like I should learn something else to make projects in. I am not particularly confined to any technology as I am only starting, I am willing to pick up and learn anything that is required.
3. Aside from coding, I have interests in UI/UX Design as well, as I really enjoy typography, colors, prototyping and all that stuff. I do use Adobe XD occasionally and make mockups with it. I am not making it my selling point because I am not aware of its value and salary in the Indian context.
4. I am thinking of learning some modern web concepts, so I could learn an employable skill and make projects with it. I feel under-confident about my coding skills, as I do not know Algorithms and Data Structures. I understand a basic level of optimization and the like, but nothing specific beyond that.

I know that I must focus on them both, improve coding, and learn a good technology stack, but how to approach starting it in a few months, what to pick first, choosing resources etc is causing a lot of unnecessary confusion and anxiety. I hope you suggest a good course of action, and clear some of the naivety. I will more than happy to listen to your advice and suggestions.

**TL;DR:** Not sure what to learn next, underconfident about coding skill, wants to be employable.

Thanks a lot and have a nice day :)

PS: Also, some advice on how to find mentors and networking online would be nice :)"
a94y9p,0,2018-12-24,My [30/f/American] wonderful boyfriend [25/m/South Indian] is probably going to need a green card in about one year,curlygirl507,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a94y9p/my_30famerican_wonderful_boyfriend_25msouth/,"Hello! I met my current boyfriend on Bumble about three months ago. He is the most wonderful person and I'm totally enjoying the honeymoon period of our relationship. (In fact I just bought lingerie for myself for the first time in over 12 years, if that tells you anything.) We live in a small town in the US. 

He told me my level of caring was unreal and he couldn't ask for more. I feel the same way about him. We live a mile apart, so we're together almost all the time when he's not working (I work from home so he can be around then). When we first started dating, I went on a two-week trip abroad; we messaged or video chatted every day. He's just overall a super supportive boyfriend. I have asked for a couple of different things sexually and he's obliged. He takes me out at least once a week but would do it more often if I wanted that. He pays $10 a day for a cab to come over because he doesn't want me to be driving him around all the time. He's also met my friends and family and talks to them pretty regularly. He hasn't mentioned me to his family yet but I'm not that worried about it. 

In the beginning, I got my boyfriend's assurance that if things did get serious between us, his family would not be against it just because I'm not Indian. They have no plans to try to find a wife for him or pressure him into a marriage. Most of his cousins have married Americans or Canadians. His mom and sister live in Mumbai and are younger (18 and 44). His dad lives abroad working. He's an extremely modern person and has no problem with the fact that I'm a normal American girl who has had a few boyfriends before him (I'm his 4th girlfriend, too). It's actually mostly like dating an American but a different form of English.

Anyway, he told me the only problem might be that he really wanted to stay here, but wasn't sure if he would be able to after 2019. He's on a student visa and it will end next December. He's completing an internship as part of his master's that he got in Europe and was recruited to come here. He's working really hard at his job hoping that they'll sponsor him, but I can't help thinking that because he's not a tech worker, it will be very hard to go that route. I'm not sure if I'm right about that or not. 

I later half-jokingly told him that an alternate route would be to get married to an American so he could start the green card application process. He had no idea about any of that and told me he'd never even considered it before, but seemed open to it. He joked about marriage to me later too. 

Now I'm kind of freaking myself out with this imposed deadline of one year from now. I've never been the kind of person to rush relationships and I've never been married or engaged before, although having several exes has helpfully taught me what I do and do not want in a relationship. Also, I'm about to turn 31 which means that at the end of next year, I'll be almost 32. 

I don't think it would be unreasonable to get engaged at that point, having spent so much time together and with me at least being a little bit older. People all over the world without that kind of deadline get engaged on a similar or even faster timeline. 

Of course, one or both of us may not want to get married. I am okay with that, but I don't want our relationship to end prematurely because of legal reasons and now I can't stop thinking about it.

Obviously it would be better if he could get sponsored on his own and not need me for that at all. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? 

TL;DR I'm an American dating a foreigner who's here on a student visa and may not be able to stay past next December unless we get married - which was totally my idea and not his. I feel like our relationship has an artificially rushed timeline and it's bothering me."
a95lv9,1,2018-12-24,MVC 5 admin manually changing user roles,DumSurfer420,dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/a95lv9/mvc_5_admin_manually_changing_user_roles/,"Hey guys! So I applied for my first internship, although I didn't finish my studies yet. I got an mvc project and i'm almost done, but there is just one more thing left and i'm completely lost.

Thanks in advance.

Little backstory: I used VS 2017, MVC 5 with individual authorization(when you make a new project you have a choice between no auth, individual, school and windows I think), my first mistake was not building from scratch.

I made all of the requested functionalities but the main topic of this question is:

* Admin having the privilege to see registered users and change their roles(Admin, Employee, Guest).
* Admin having the privilege to delete users.

So yeah, the users in my app get assigned a guest role when they register and I hard coded one admin. 


I wrote an SQL Query as an ActionResult in one of the controllers(I'm thinking now that I should probably make a separate controller for these and I will) to list the registered users ([picture](https://imgur.com/fKV7EZo)) and it works. But I lost so much time trying to write a query for changing roles and deleting users. So if you can help, today or tomorrow I would be very happy. How would these queries look like? 

It's not as simple as doing it without this bloody auto generated individual authorization. I would build it again without it if i had the time. I would advise opening this individual auth project before answering, but all help is welcome. These are the tables associated with the problem ([picture](https://imgur.com/0gzmqUt))


Thank you!"
a95qrg,2,2018-12-24,Thoughts and advice on break-up,N0toriousDre,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/a95qrg/thoughts_and_advice_on_breakup/,"Hi Reddit! I posted this text on a different subreddit and found the responses helpful, but the holidays have me in a rut and I would just like people's advice today as well.

My ex and I were in a relationship for almost two years, with the last four being LDR. She got into a doctorate program 8 hours away. I didn’t get in, but I was so proud of her for achieving her dream. She really wanted to do long distance and I agreed 100%. When classes started, she kept telling me, “I’m so stressed and spread thin between classes, internship, and you. Something has to give.” I suggested doing “smaller things” to relieve stress and replace “big things” (ex. Long facetimes). She continued to say, “You don’t understand what it’s like out here”, though she told me she told other people that I am her “biggest support and a great boyfriend”.

After these comments, I brought up the fact that when she says that, it makes me feel anxious and worried that I may be the thing to give. She responded with, “Jesus fucking Christ are you absolutely trying to make me feeling like shit?” She continued to become increasingly short with me over text messages as the weeks went by, stating she was “tired” and didn’t have the “emotional capacity” to respond to my text messages. A week before she broke up with me, I sent her a text saying, “Hey I know that you are overwhelmed and stress with your program, but I just wanted to let you know how appreciative I am that you still make time to text and call me.” She responded with, “I love you and that’s very sweet, but I don’t have the emotional energy to respond to that text in full”.

We planned for me to visit in November when Thanksgiving break started. Four months into long distance, the day before I’m supposed to drive down to visit, she calls me and says, “I think we need to take a break or break up”. When I asked the rules of the break, she had no answer. She thought it was best for her to break up. I told her in times like this, we need to lean on each other and not move apart to no avail. She said she had no plans on dating because she had “too much work”, which made me suspicious because I didn’t bring her possible being interested in another guy. She then went on to say that after she completed her program and I completed mine (hopefully) that we could try again, but I suspect that was to ease her guilty conscious. She gave up on us. I was mad and told her I wanted my gifts back and “I love you have a good life”. The next day I called to let her know that she should keep the gifts (because gifts are gifts), but I would like the DVDs of my favorite show back I received as a gift. She agreed to mail them back after Thanksgiving, but did not tell me when she shipped them. When I finally received my DVDs, I noticed one was missing, but I did not break NC to ask for it back. There was no note in the box of DVDs, which would’ve confused me emotionally, but it just felt cold to me.

The entire time I’ve suspected she’s been emotional cheating on me. She said she was going out for an hour-1.5 hours, but went out for 6 (very out of character). When I told her, I was worried because I didn’t hear from you till really late, she said I was being controlling and she doesn’t need to tell me every aspect of her life (ex. “Am I supposed to tell you when I get a drink, then when I play a game, then when I go to the bathroom?”). The next day she tells me how “Xxx is so funny and makes me laugh. He said I was good at darts and kept score. He jokes and says we’re not friends, but we definitely are.” I just don’t know what was real and what was fake anymore. I don’t know if she left me for that guy, or if this was an emotional decision. I don’t know if she used me to get to her program and then wanted to start new and left me behind. She has not reached out to me since I reached out to ask for DVDs back. I don’t know if she regrets her actions or try and reach out in the future. I don’t think it’s fair that she wants to try again after she finishes her program. She told me, “not to wait” and, “I just want you to be happy” after she told me she may want to try again in the future after her program is completed.

The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

4)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

5)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo

a95viz,3,2018-12-24,Girl at work.,Aangoan,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/a95viz/girl_at_work/,"Merry Christmas everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I really need your help on this subject, I feel like I'm drowning in so many emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

Few weeks ago I started working on this new job, and for the first few weeks I was simply excited by the work itself, it's what I studied for and I enjoy it very much, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But after 3 weeks or so, I spotted this girl from the first floor. (I'm on the ground floor FYI). She's from human resources department, and I'm from IT.

Oh my god she stroke me like a lightning coming out of nowhere! I instantly fell in love in such way, that now I only enjoy my work if I know she's there too. I've become so dependent of her, feels like happiness only comes when she's around.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19yo boy and I don't know her age for sure, but I'm certain she's a bit older then me, like a year or so, since she's here doing university internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.

2 weeks ago, I felt that I need to go talk to her, I've never heard her voice before, I wanted us to be on speaking terms. But she's always soooo busy, and always on her desk, and she's never alone on her department, so my chances to simply go there and tell her how I feel, are slim.

So because I'm from IT, I simply made something up just to talk to her first time. I went to her desk and told her this:

""Hi yesterday I was checking every computer, but since you weren't here, I didn't want to touch it without you being here.""

Something along these lines. Never felt so proud of myself, I knew I was nervous but I felt some nervous coming from her as well, so I felt more relaxed and I was able to pull it off more easily, I guess.

1 hour later, one of my co-workers tells me that me and him are having a formation.

and well she was there as well, and we were sat in front of each other for whole 2 hours, and we never exchanged words directly, which was pretty sad, but we weren't alone so yeah, there's that

&amp;#x200B;

So to me, that was the best day of my life. That was only a day the next days were all drawback days, I was simply flooding my head with bad thoughts, like, "" she doesn't feel the same way "", ""the feelings aren't mutual"", "" she wasn't that nervous after all"", etc

I was completely shutting myself down, as always.

&amp;#x200B;

Next week:

I made some stuff up, just to have an excuse to go there, and exchange some words, but nothing that big.

I was feeling like sh\*t the whole week, with bad thoughts and bla bla bla.

But one day I told my friends, ""I'm done, I've already f'ed up so many times at work, just because I'm always thinking about her, and getting hurt.""

Literally 10 minutes later, she shows up at my department, and I asked if she needed help, because she seemed a bit lost.

and yeah she indeed needed help, she needed directions on where she could find someone, and my co-workers were simply giving her directions on where to go. I got up and told her "" here, let me take you there!""

I went with her, we walked along side, best day of my goddamn life!! and because I'm new here as well I had no clue who she was looking for, so we both legit laughed, WE LAUGHED TOGETHER!! oh my life, felt like I could die right then and there. I was in heaven..

&amp;#x200B;

As you can imagine the rest was drawback again and again...

I decided few days later to send her an e-mail, telling her that I wanted to know her better and that I wanted to talk to her but she always seems so busy.

Well took her 12 hours to reply to me, she replied to me at 23pm from her phone. which can mean a lot of good stuff and bad as well, she even sent ""kisses"" instead of ""best regards"" as before, so I felt really pumped, but I was already too drunk.

The time she took to reply to me, I got drunk really drunk... bad choice but oh well

&amp;#x200B;

After all this I replied to that last e-mail she sent, and I basically asked her if she knew another way that we could talk besides work emails.

I sent that last Friday, 21st December, and I've got no reply so far.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what else to do, I really need your help, some friends of mine told me to let her go, to forget her. But I can't I feel like I haven't even tried, nor even told her how I feel about her.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways if anybody read this, and it's willing to give me some advice, It's highly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!, merry Christmas.

The past year I have been VLC with both of them. 

I’m 22, graduating college in Spring’21, and beginning to panic about my professional future. 

I’ve only begun therapy for the trauma this year, but the results have been incredible, and I completed 9 credits with all A’s this Fall! 

However, I’m considering applying to Summer internships, and I’m scared that the damage my past trauma has caused my academic career is going to keep me from succeeding professionally. I need some advice on how to proceed. 

Some quick stats:

- 3.2 GPA
- Withdrawn from two semesters, in addition to a gap year 
- Recent major switch to Information Technology (IT) 
- No experience yet academic or otherwise in that field 
- By Summer’19 I will have experience with 1-2 programming languages from a course I’m taking in the Spring 
- My background work experience is in women’s activist work (which I’ve heard is a “turnoff” for employers, so I’m worried about adding it to my resume)

Question:

Can anyone relate to this position? If so, how did/are you handling it? I know I’m smart and have a lot to offer, but I’m terrified my messy academic start is going to hurt my ability to get internships this summer, and maybe even a job after graduation. 

Any perspective, advice, insight, or encouragement is greatly appreciated!


TL;DR Past trauma gave me a rocky college transcript/resume which I’m gradually improving, but now I’m worried about being able to succeed in getting employed in IT/Tech after I graduate in Spring, 2021. Has anyone been in a similar position? How did you overcome it?

ACT is a 31 (36 reading, 35 english, 27, math, 24 science). I've taken no AP, but I pretty much exclusively take college courses now (currently 53 credit hours and I will finish with more than 60), some of which have been honors. I was homeschooled for most of my education (should I mention this in my app?), but now I am enrolled in a public high school (I don't believe they offer any AP) and ranked #1 out of roughly 250. EC's: nearly 300 volunteer hours, I go to Rubik's cube competitions, I watch almost 800 hours of film every year and do a ton of related independent research, and a STEM internship at a Maker-Space lab (at one of the universities I attend). My common app essay is decent, probably a 7-8/10. I'm white/male. I plan to apply ED II to Emory. Thank you very much for any feed back!

Edit: I'm also graduating with a STEM Honors diploma from my high school. Additionally, I've taken many math and science courses at the college level to try and compensate for the lower ACT scores in those subjects.

I’m in my early twenties and started investing in my Questrade TFSA in the last couple months. I currently hold some weed stocks and am looking to diversify into different sectors to reduce the risk for my portfolio. Next summer I’ll be taking out my pension from my student internship as a payment of around $10,000 and putting it into a mid cap US ETF, Russell 2000 ETF, and probably an Aristocrat ETF as well (all mentioned by my financial advisor).

I notice lots of investors on here are big fans of blue chip dividend paying stocks and using DRIP as it is a very efficient investing method. I’ve been looking into the following stocks and would like to start positions of $1,000 each (all I can currently afford and to keep fees low) into 2-3 of these in the next 6 months. I read the DRIP link on the sub and it says buying stocks for DRIP without a share purchase plan or if you are buying under 100 shares is a waste of money, why is this? What happens if I don’t have enough money from my dividends to pay for a full share of the company that doesn’t use a purchase plan, I’m assuming it gets paid as cash until I have enough for a share?

In buying these, I’m looking at a long-term investing outlook and my main goal is increasing my personal wealth to use this money for either retirement, using it towards a home in a few years once I’m done school, or just holding it long-term. Thanks in advance and happy holidays.

a97t8x,17,2018-12-24,Time Management,geekfella,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/a97t8x/time_management/,"Hi Folks!  I am trying to create a successful MSP and having a hard time managing my time.  Recently I put in a 86 hour week, and my normal is 65-70 hours.  Unsustainable for the long term.  My current business model is that I am the only experienced tech, a recent graduate of an IT Management program for a Operations Manager, and interns from the local community college computer science program.  Still working on nailing down a workflow that works well for our customers and employees.

Onto my question.  For those of you who have smaller MSP shops what methods do you use to block out time for help desk requests, appointments, sales calls, projects, etc.  Meaning do you block out specific times during the day for working on help desk requests, working on projects, etc.  For example, mornings are meetings and help desk requests with afternoons blocked out for projects, etc?  Or do you squeeze in projects throughout the days?  


Thank you for anyone even sharing a few sentences of the methods they use.  I generally work with small nonprofits who do not have alot of resources to spend on IT, therefore I am trying to see if I can make IT MSP affordable for them.  This means I have to get super efficient, and looking for any ideas on the best way to do this - especially in the area of time management.

Warning - long post ahead.   


Entering a new stage of my life and I am super excited right now. I just graduated college with a dual major in computer science and exercise science, I landed a sweet new internship for the upcoming months and already have a full-time job lined up for when the internship finishes. For the first time I feel like things are really working out in my favor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to meet a new friend to fulfill a lack of companionship I am currently experiencing. I have some friends but don't really have a 'best' friend. I go out occasionally but most nights usually end with me getting home from work, cooking a nice dinner, and relaxing with my cat, Tyrone while we watch a movie on netflix, play video games, or work on a side-project. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really have a favorite game at the moment, but I dabble in Overwatch, League of Legends, Escape from Tarkov, and a few others. One game that I really want to play more of is Town of Salem but its most fun when you have a big group of people to play it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I am working on a fitness mobile app that I really hope turns into something profitable. The goal of the app is to have it work as your virtual personal trainer - aimed at those who are inexperienced at the gym. It prescribes a completely customized workout plan for you and adapts based on the info you enter and your progress. Its a work in progress but I am happy with how its turning out.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day I am looking for a friend who I enjoy talking to and can have meaningful conversations with. Someone who I get excited to receive texts from. It can be completely platonic in nature. That being said, if there is a spark, I am definitely open to explore it.

# Questions

To get a better overview of Arena &amp; Assault habits (and giving ideas to other players wondering whether they should intensify their efforts or opt for build/team tweaks), here are questions anyone can answer.

    **What is your current situation in Arena (usual tier(s), score/ranking range)?**  
    **How do you aim for your highest affordable score in Arena (units, merges/builds, deathless)?**  
    **What are your main weaknesses/threats &amp; improvements you have in mind for Arena?**  
    **What is your current situation in Assault (usual tier(s), score/ranking range)?**  
    **How do you aim for your highest affordable score in Assault (units, merges/builds, deathless)?**  
    **What are your main weaknesses/threats &amp; improvements you have in mind for Assault?**  

With this, we would have a depiction of various game level profiles, from high-tier players to more casual ones.

Corrections will be progressively done over time. Thanks to everyone contributing to this tracking initiative."
a99bsw,1,2018-12-24,I need help on a love triangle very fable-like situation.,throwaway_260118,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a99bsw/i_need_help_on_a_love_triangle_very_fablelike/,"Alright, although this will be very long because this story is BOY-OH-BOY big, I'll keep it as short as I can. I'll include a tl;dr for those who can't be bothered.

&amp;#x200B;

Also EDIT: I'll say that we are 21 now, I'm a guy, she's a girl, we were friends for a month, FWB for 3, relationship for 2, then 2 pause, then FWB for 2.5 months, then idk some mix of FWB and friend for 1, and then 2 as friends.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, the ancient history is that there was a girl. She was in a relationship with her high school sweetheart. Now, I'll say that this is probably due to her personality, but for some reason she didn't really make many friends. She was a in an all girls class and I guess being fairly attractive and from what I heard somewhat flirty she was isolated. Now, usually when a person is like that they would try to make friends anyways but she had a boyfriend so she didn't try. The result was that she has 0 female friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Since coming to college, she enjoyed a life she didn't have - a life with friends other than her boyfriend. Despite college pretty much being the most stressful thing for her, the friends portion made it up. But, you know, because she loves it so much, she starts being distant from her boyfriend. Things happen and one of the people I know gets 3 bases and a homerun spread over 3 occasions. She keeps it a secret but tells her bf out of guilt after 3 months. They break up but after a week decide to be fwb.

&amp;#x200B;

Now fast forward around 6 months, she has that fwb relationship but is constantly looking for a real relationship. She loves her ex, but he's a disappointment so to say - failing classes, drinks a lot and hangs out with shady people. Then come I into the story. Apparently she had seen me once a year ago after I first saw her, before she screwed her life up, and she commented how hot of a friend I am (she was with a mutual friend). I helped her on an assignment and that was it. She added me on Facebook but I didn't really talk to her since I just saw her for 1 hour or so and had no idea she developed a crush on me. So things happen and after 2 more encounters on a party she falls in love with me.

&amp;#x200B;

She tells me this and since I was informed bit by bit on her situation I straight up tell her that I'm not really for fooling around. I scare her a bit since I knew she was kind of lacking in the self-confidence department, well some shit happen and here we are where she is choosing between me and her ex. She chose me in the end, which came as a surprise. We had a 1 month run or so before she ran into her ex. She was clubbing and had fun with him, so naturally, since she doesn't have a lot of experience, she begins thinking whether she really is in love with me or not. Well, a certain event made us break ties. After the last time we had sex, she wanted us to stay friends, but I told her that it would be impossible for me.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, there was like a 2 week period in which she would text random stuff until I finally called her in to talk and said that unfortunately, I was being serious. Now, I won't say I was heartbroken. I would say during that whole time I was very committed because we two fit very well and everyone, even when we just got to know each other said how good we look as a couple. So, it was hard for me, but like, what can a person she knows for 4 months do in a relationship that lasted like 5.5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, fast forward 2 months and we see each other in a mutual class. We're not even on talking terms but she passes by without looking at me and comments that my beard is nice. Later that day she said she would want to hang out with me. Now, every single atom in my body tells me no, but I do it and we grab some food in the cafeteria. Now, I don't know if it was guilt, but she couldn't even look me in the eye. She couldn't even talk. So I talked about how I managed to snag the highest paying internship as a 2nd year, and I guess she was happy for me. When we were supposed split, she actually stayed with me and my buddy on a class she doesn't even have. At the end, he noticed her rash is everywhere. Now, her neck gets a rash when she is nervous or angry. But this time, she was fully inflamed. Like she was as red as a tomato. I took it nice, but I mean, 2 months had passed and I was over it.

&amp;#x200B;

An hour after she went away I got a text saying that she would want to meet me once more before summer break starts. In the message she was wondering whether I even want to see her again because she noticed I was clearly over her. Now, it's true, I was over her, but I still cared. Not because I have oneitis or whatever, I just felt bad because I appreciated her and all the things she did to show me how she once cared.

&amp;#x200B;

So we go for a walk and end up staying from like 1 pm to 12 am in the park talking. In the end she was kissing me and touching me passionately. At that time, what I didn't know, what would make me run away was that she was still dating her ex. The reason why I never asked her was because when her mother called that day, she told her to get a boyfriend. It didn't cross my mind that she doesn't really like him so that's why she told her that.

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah, summer break starts, and I start working and we talk every day and it actually looks to me like she's back. But we only see each other once in a while until she comes to my place when no one was home. We watched a movie and well, went all the way, just like that. At the time I didn't suspect a thing but she seemed kind of melancholic after it. Well, I didn't think of it since she was constantly asking me if I have a thing with someone else because of how much better I was, which I'll be honest, stroked my ego hard. She also didn't want to tell me how she broke up with her ex, because she didn't tell anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

This lasted for the whole summer and I even got to meet her mom, which was a big deal - I was the only person her mom knew that wasn't her ex, and even he got to meet her after 2.5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

But at the end of September her ex started hanging out with a girl. Now, she thought of all of it as over, I mean, she cheated on him for the second time (note: I didn't know. If I did I wouldn't partake in it). But, anyways, she was trying to make him jealous and because he knew about us, she started to do it with others. She would open a Tinder account and such but never actually meet those people, but it had no effect. Eventually her ex started banging that female friend and well, she was a mess for most of October. All this time she slowly but surely distanced herself from me. We weren't dating and were at most FWB, but still, I was way more than a friend and still am.

&amp;#x200B;

Now a lot of shit happened, she even got his mother involved etc. it was a huge fiesta, but in the end, her ex told her that because he is scared of being hurt again, he doesn't wanna date her, at least not for now. So she said that she'll quit chasing after him and continue on with her life. Now this equated to her still inherently chasing after him, just not physically.

&amp;#x200B;

All this time, she's like my best friend. There is nothing she doesn't tell me, same on my side. Occasionally, to make herself feel better I guess she kisses me and gropes me, but it wasn't meaningful. I allowed it because the stupid me kind of wished for it to be true. Which, I'll admit, is a big mistake on my part.

&amp;#x200B;

Various things happened and somewhat recently, she was really pissed, I'm guessing PMS, and she said a lot of nasty things to me. I mean, I didn't mention the bad because it's not that relevant to characterize her - I've already started with the fact that she's the kind of person that probably because of herself doesn't have very many friends. Well, recently, fed up and hurt over everything, I ask her if she sees herself with me in the future. I was mostly hurt because she always somehow belittled what we had or made fun of the scenario in which we end up together. Now, it wasn't like public shaming, and maybe I'm just oversensitive, but I think she took it like I'm for granted, so she doesn't have to be sensible.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, she tells me that while yes, she sees me as a potential mate in the future, that now I'm only a friend (well, she says that but I'm obviously way more, and idk, I guess girls who aren't very forward with you or themselves downrank you to avoid frustration on either side). All I wanted was to hear that, not because I'm a beta that will wait for her forever - I wanted to know whether it was worth handling her shit. I spent like 10 years in a row on the seaside with 3 women in a small house, I'm kind of damaged by that and although I have a high tolerance for bullshit, I cannot endure it for very long. After a while, she explains in detail and because I told her how hurt I was she told me that maybe it's best we cut ties. Now, this wasn't truthful. Most of our problems are that we're both just trying to play games and hard to get with each other while the truth is that neither of us can handle being with each other. I am honest about this while she either isn't or doesn't understand it. But, I mean, it's obvious. Anyways, we end up cutting all ties. I don't know why I did it. I guess I was just so sad that I wanted out of it. But you know, the first few days, the really hit you.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it didn't hit me as hard in the heart as it did in the head. Like, ok, I wasn't that emotional over it because I didn't lose anything more than the best friend I had, but after I told one of my better friends, he told me that I fucked up, that if I truly cared about her, I wouldn't do that and that she obviously cares a lot about me based on our history. And I began to believe him. Not because it was easier to cope, but because I actually refused to believe she would do the things she did with anyone. Maybe it was cocky of me, but somehow I refused to think of it as normal.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of getting closure so to say. I'm not up to restore what we've had, because, it was not that much when you look at it. I enjoyed her company as she did mine and I pulled harder than her and the hypothetical rope broke. But, should I even do it? I'm constantly debating with myself that if she really cared that much she'd tell me. But then again, the first thing she said when reconnecting with me was that the reason this was so late is because she felt intimidated by my words which were ""Don't talk to me again"". I realize that perhaps, based on her history, she's objectively not worth fighting for. I realize that the truth is that I gave way more than what I received. But as a normal human being, is it ok that, despite all of this, I would want closure?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for making it this long, but all of this, oh my god, it's so much bigger. The amout of drama that happened in a single year should make like 5 years. At least that's how much I think I've lost. Maybe I'm just a an idiot with low self-esteem. But I truly want to believe that all of this wasn't just a stupid mistake. Is it arrogant of me to want closure in this case?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl;dr\*\* Met a girl who was on/off with the ex she cheated on, she ends up cutting all ties with him to be with me, lasts for a month or two (a real relationship) or so before she starts doubting in us and inevitably we cut ties because I don't want a friendship with her. 2 months later she reconnects, manages to cheat on the same ex again only this time with me (I didn't know), leaves him again, gets jealous 3 months after, when he starts hanging out with another girl. After her ex and the new girl enter a fwb relationship, she makes a scene, shortly after he tells her he doesn't wanna date her in fear of being hurt again, she stops chasing after him but only physically. We hang out and occasionally she kisses and gropes me for whatever reason, but recently she treats me very badly and after I ask her if she sees us together, after receiving an affirmative answer, we still somehow cut ties. Thinking for a few days, I somehow begin thinking that I want closure because the things she said and did with me didn't match up. Want to know if I'm selfish despite her clearly not being objectively worth to work for. Also, I do realize that because of the effect and motivation I bring to her life she would eventually try to reconnect with me, but I'm really humble on this, I guess, because I think I'm in the wrong. I guess I just care too much to be arrogant or cold."
a99iew,424,2018-12-24,People in academia who picked themselves up from very bad grades? [Discussion],Excllencepersonified,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/a99iew/people_in_academia_who_picked_themselves_up_from/,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am an international student who has had to deal with 2 deaths in my family in the past 2 years as well as a lot more health and financial issues. I mentioned “international student” cause I thought that also explains extreme loneliness that I have had to deal with (even now on Christmas holiday).

I was clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety and for the past year have barely gone out of my room or attended classes. I have managed to skim past most of my courses. Trying to barely pass. I know this has to stop.

But I feel I need encouragement from people who have been in my situation. I am currently going to the gym. Using todo  lists to get organised so that I stop wasting my day (frankly, I have accomplished nothing in the past year) and am looking for clubs to join on campus in the next semester. So you see, all  of this actions are based on helping me recover mentally and physically. I think and feel I am generally on the right path now  and my psychiatrist is encouraging me on this.

&amp;#x200B;

But I have been feeling rock bottom for the past few weeks. You see: my academics tanked completely in the past 2 years. I can and will gradually recover but I feel like my life is beyond savaging at this point. It sounds completely ridiculous but I am in a major that requires grad school. I have always planned to attend and never doubted that I will. I had my pick of top unis when I applied to undergrad because of sky high grades but now I am literally in the gutter. I have this extremely deep fear and anxiety now that even if I do my best and manage with a 2.9/ 3.0 by graduation, it will be for naught. That my life will now be very hard and that I will be jobless. I know it is irrational  but cannot shake it. Ofc, I know it is not my fault my mom and aunt got cancer and died but somehow I still blame myself for crashing.

I want to know more about people who got really bad grades out there in university and managed to make a comeback. How do you shake this off? How do you minimise the effects of your “crash” on the rest of your life? In a world where your “dark period” has closed off many doors that would otherwise have been open in an already tough job market?

That is all I am worried about now. It is hard to get through each day when I keep hearing internal voices that go “You have fucked up your life”. I am 19 rn, soon will be 20. It is irrational and yet when I talk to my profs and HR managers from job fairs, it is clear that they sift through resumes for grad/ job apps via GPA’s and I will be fucked. This might be less of a problem for those with less academic leanings professions but do I have to give up my life long dreams I worked extremely hard (used to sleep at 5pm, wake up at 12 am just to study because I found out that evenings with my family were academically unproductive) in secondary school for?

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing is that most of my acquaintances at school (not sure if I can call them friends cause I have never been really close to any one except my mummy who died) won’t understand. They are just like me before my crash. Their struggle is A- or A or even better, A with 87 or A with 93. Heck, I am ashamed and try to avoid them now cause they are set for further studies. This makes my social life even worse, I hate to admit it but I am simply no longer interested in them getting into MD/PHD’s or getting internships at facebook so I hide from them. My dad and sister are far away and out of reach. They too have their own issues and occasionally call me. This leaves me alone **thinking all the time**. Quite frankly terrified.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I went roundabout with this rant. What I want is experiences from people in academia on recovery from a college level negative event and how to do so. I didn’t ask for High school level because usually those don’t show up on resumes but I feel that just because of the past 2 years, my entire life’s work till this point will be rendered useless.

&amp;#x200B;

Merry Christmas!"
a9a5eg,33,2018-12-24,Offer “contingent upon drug test” but haven’t heard anything in 2 months,nhlyoung,Petioles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petioles/comments/a9a5eg/offer_contingent_upon_drug_test_but_havent_heard/,"I recently accepted the internship of my dreams (large tech company), that could very well lead to a career.

I accepted my internship about 8 weeks ago, and since I accepted I haven’t smoked once. I’ve taken a dip test once a week and I can comfortably say I’m squeaky clean. My offer said that I had to accept by a certain deadline, and was contingent upon completion of a pre employment drug screen and background check. However, it’s been some time since I’ve heard from them and I’m wondering when this drug test is gonna be. The internships for the summer.

I’m curious if the internship will test after the new year, 60 days before (as I’ve heard some friends tell me), or right before my start date. What is your guys experience with this? Have any of you accepted offers where you haven’t heard anything and randomly gotten a call much later than your acceptance date? I was expecting a call right after I accepted but I have yet to hear anything. Would it be inappropriate to ask when my test is supposed to be?

Thank you, and sorry if this post is somewhat redundant. It’s a big opportunity and not one that I want to fuck around with."
a9aybd,1,2018-12-24,21 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/a9aybd/21_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Merry Christmas Eve to those who celebrate! Today I am looking for someone to tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

A few things:

Be literate please! No text talk/bad grammar. I only rp in 3rd so please do 3rd person! I DO NOT TF! I am looking for a tfer, so please be okay doing that. You should also be okay with me playing as original characters. If you are not, this post isn't for you. Be an active rper. I understand life comes up, just please try to reply as much as humanly possible. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM or kik:

N1njastar28

Thank you for reading, and hope to hear from you soon! And happy holidays!"
a9b2kr,1,2018-12-24,"Existence Through Reflection, noitcelfeR fo ""fleS""",LloydHumancondition,u_LloydHumancondition,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LloydHumancondition/comments/a9b2kr/existence_through_reflection_noitcelfer_fo_fles/," 

**\*\*\*Existence Through Reflection, noitcelfeR fo ""fleS""\*\*\***

Reflection shows itself through existence. The ability to express the internal and external of ""self."" When perceiving existence, the reflection of existence gives the perspective of life. This core fundamental of Nature's Laws, reflects itself throughout everything.

**\*\*\*What is Reflection, and Why is noitcelfeR important?\*\*\***

Reflection is the expression of something either internally, externally, or both. Everything has a reflection of some form or another. Without reflection, the ability to see one's self and express, would not be existent. Inanimate objects reflect as well. The expression of what is. An instinctual reflection of the very thing that exists.

It is important to know the balance and contrast of the very reflection that an individual is. How the creation and destruction process of an individual, creates external and internal of ""self."" The contrast of that balance creates the overall reflection of an individual. Not only in a ""mirror,"" but what is inside the ""mirror."" Transparency of the illusion through creation.

Understanding how an individual reflects through existence, gives the individual the ability to perceive the reflection of themselves in a dimensional way. This allows the individual to exist both inside and outside the ""mirror."" To give more possibility in existence, outside of first person perspective.

**\*\*\*Why is Reflection Important When it Comes to the ""Human Condition?""\*\*\***

The ""human condition"" is the reflection of how humans see themselves. The over all picture of how humans reflect themselves into existence. To appropriately understand the true nature of humans through reflection, gives humans a clearer ""picture"" of themselves. Humans look into ""water"" for their reflection. The ""water"" bends the light that passes through it. The reflection of how we see ourselves is not a clear view. When humans can ""calm the water,"" The ""human condition"" will become a clearer ""picture.""

**\*\*\*How Can an Individual Apply and ""Read"" the Reflection of Themselves?\*\*\***

Humans naturally reflect whether they realize it or not. Existing naturally creates reflection unintentionally. Humans even reflect each other when socializing. The understanding of how an individual reflects, will give that individual the ability to reflect the way that individual wants to.

Reflection of ""self"" comes out in multiple ways. An individual can see their reflection through; others, literal reflections like mirrors and ""water,"" actions, internal perspective of emotions and thoughts, creations through imagination; etc.

Being able to ""see' yourself, will give the individual an appropriate assessment of themselves. Through that assessment, an individual can change the reflection of themselves. The recognition in the choice of change, gives the individual the ability to accept the change. If an individual cannot ""see"" their reflection, then that individual should find other avenues for perception of their reflection.

**\*\*\*How the Reflection of ""Self"" is Shaped\*\*\***

The external and the internal of definition shapes an individual's reflection of ""self."" The external demands the existence of an individual to be a certain way. This intern, naturally influences the internal of the individual. It takes internal expression to portray external reflection.

Characteristics are chosen to accommodate these demands. A lot of the characteristics of an individual is chosen through the preservation of ""self"" to survive in existence. This takes away from the natural choice of ""self"" an individual would be, without external and internal demands.

Example: If a job did not exist, what would an individual do? If there was no such thing as social culture, what would an individual exude as culture? If an individual had no reflection of characteristics to choose from, what would your characteristics naturally be?

When the perspective of existence other than nature is taken away, you are left with the individual as is. The individual still has cognitive understanding, and there would be natural expression of ""self."" Not expression of ""self"" through influence. For an individual to say that they are ""themselves,"" is an illusion of compromise through existence of what that individual finds themselves to be.

**\*\*\*Conclusion\*\*\***

Everything takes a ""step"" to start heading a direction. No matter how small or big it is. It's up to the individual to put one foot in front of the other, and consistently do it.

By the time the individual takes a hundred steps. That individual will look behind themselves, and see the reflection of what they were. That individual will no longer recognize themselves, and see the reflection of where they came from.

It is the ability to recognize the charter of an individual's past, and the character of the individual's future; that gives the individual the perspective and reflection, of the character now.

There is Hope in Humanity

a9bhet,24,2018-12-24,How come FUT is so popular?,damdam019,FifaCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FifaCareers/comments/a9bhet/how_come_fut_is_so_popular/,"I just don't understand how people get so much joy out of being ripped of with basically online gambling for virtual players that at max have value for 1 year untill the next Fifa comes out. Why not just play normal head to head matches online and career mode? Playing ultimate team is basically throwing money at EA and assuring that there will never be any substantial changes to the game. I mean if I was EA why would I change something that has proven to work? It's just so frustrating seeing basically the same game year after year with minor gameplay changes, just enough to get a feeling that they changed anything! 

It angers me even more knowing that at the core FIFA is actually an enjoyable game. It is just so much wasted potential especially in career mode that I just sometimes wanna cry.

After all those years, we still accept that player ratings magically fall off after 30+ even when scoring 30 goals a season.  We accept having the goddam SAME career mode for the last couple of years. We accept that player development, especially for youth  players is just pure garbage. How is it possible that a youth player I decide to have in my starting 11 that's scores goal after goal is not exploding in rating? I mean in real life all it need for a young player to have instant 80+ rating is to play 1 goddam good season and EA will be the first to hype a fucker up so they can sell them on FUT. That's how it works, player ratings rise and fall with actual gamestats and hype. 
Player stats should also decrease more rapidly and realistic after having bad performances for longer periods of time. This would actually force players to think about alternative players and coming up with strategies etc. Fifa career in general just feels sooooooo goddamn outdated it's unreal. It's just we always played it so we accept it. Goddamn EA give us at least mod support for the PC and I'll build my own dream FIFA I don't even want you to do this I know you'll fuck it up.


Sometimes when I'm in bed I dream about being super rich and buying a developer team to build me the perfect football game. FIFA COULD BE SO MUCH BETTER WITH SO LITTLE EFFORT I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY EA IS NOT DOING IT.

goddamn let an intern come up with a new stats system id be fine with it as long as it's different and more dynamic. Career mode is just so fucking casual it no fun at all.

You can win the treble with every shit tier team in the game after maximum 2-3 seasons. How is that realistic? 


EA NEEDS TO DO MORE FORE THE TRUE FOOTBALL ENTHUSIASTS OUT THERE BUT IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN BE AUSE FOOTBALL BY DEFINITION IS A SPORT FOR THE MASSES AND HENCE FIFA PLAYERS WILL ALWAYS BE CASUALS. 

I can not stand it anymore. I am done. I am sick and tired of winning every game on ultimate garbage cpu difficulty 6-2. Yes 6-2 not 6-0 because when the AI decides to score a goal the 45th minute and the 90th minute there's is literally nothing you can fucking so about it besides telling yourself ""yeah it's about to happen now it's the 45th minute and the shit tier enemy team had flawless passes for too long now"" 

The game is so goddam predictable and easy yet at the same time so frustrating and unfair at times. It is just not fun in the long term. 

The worst of it all is that nothing. Nothing will change unless EA actually has to make a good fotball game year after year and cannot sit it's ass back on stupid people throwing money at them for the minimal chances of getting virtual Ronaldo 96 rated that runs with flappy Bird hands. 


The only hope for us as Fifa career mode lovers is that loot boxes and ultimate Team falls under gambling law in Europe and gets banned. 

If this doesn't happen ( which it probably won't, I lost hope ) then our only other chance is for Ronaldo and Messi to still be incredible players at age 35+ so EA is forced to give them good ratings and maaaaaybe is forced to adjust their ratings system since old player doesn't instantly equal to bad player.

I am sorry for this rant I just had to vent. I see a game I once loved stagnate and it just hurts me. Thanks if you made it this far, I hope I can sleep now goodbye.

a9bvgp,7,2018-12-24,Android Book Recommendations?,A_Literally_Penguin,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/a9bvgp/android_book_recommendations/,Does anyone have any recommendations for good books on Android programming? I'm going abroad at the beginning of January and have an interview for a Android Developer internship pretty much right when I get back. I'm not bringing my computer so I'm looking for a book or an ebook that I can take with me so I don't fall as out of practice over the time I'll be gone. Does anyone have any recommendations for good Android books? Preferably something high-level/advanced and that doesn't focus as much on programming exercises. Thanks in advance!!
a9bw6l,0,2018-12-24,21 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,TransformationRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransformationRP/comments/a9bw6l/21_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Merry Christmas Eve to those who celebrate! Today I am looking for someone to tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

A few things:

Be literate please! No text talk/bad grammar. I only rp in 3rd so please do 3rd person! I DO NOT TF! I am looking for a tfer, so please be okay doing that. You should also be okay with me playing as original characters. If you are not, this post isn't for you. Be an active rper. I understand life comes up, just please try to reply as much as humanly possible. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM! 

Thank you for reading, and hope to hear from you soon! And happy holidays!"
a9c57y,11,2018-12-24,"A Simril Story. In Prose. Being a Nightal Parable of the holy day of Tymorra. Acquired under Fair Use for re-purposing under the Acquisitions Incorporated trademark, all rights reserved. Part 1",MrGigaSloth,TheCTeam,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCTeam/comments/a9c57y/a_simril_story_in_prose_being_a_nightal_parable/,"Jim Darkmagic was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. He was summoned to Hell and dragged, clawing and screaming, to a doom that only the most unfortunate of mortal souls could empathize with. Jim Darkmagic, of the Newhamp Shire Darkmagics, was dead as Bhaal.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, whether or not the long-forgotten god of murder is particularly dead at this moment. The cosmos have a particular way of making mockery of such final prognostications. But by the wisdom of scholars, who's words are put to paper to both vex and illuminate, you will therefore have to accept the fact  that Jim Darkmagic is emphatically dead.

This fact was as certain to Ominifis Hereward Dran, CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated, as it now is to you, kind reader. The memory of Jim's passing from the realm of the living, if it was to be remarked upon by a passer-by to Omin, would illicit no strong reaction this way or another.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted fellow, in both emotion and deed, Omin! a scheming, manoeuvring, machinations, ambitious old documancer. Hard as cord-wood from which no fire had ever been kindled, secret, thrifty, and contemptuous. A severity held his features somewhere between a scowl and sneer, his chin turned haughtily this way or else grasped by fingers deep in calculation, his broad half-elven ears flat against his close-cropped flaxen hair. The nibs in his pocket, when they could ever be pried from his fingers, seemed cold to the touch even on a warm day. He wore armour every day over a close-cut jerkin, the cold of the steel chain against him, even on Deadwinter Day, doubtless warmed Omin as he imagined himself encased in a flowing drapery of jingling currency.

It should therefore come as a surprise to the viewer, knowing all I have told to be true, when Jim Darkmagic suaved his way through interns, clerks, and clockwork creatures of Gnomish and liquid-bearing construction and into Omin's office in Waterdeep.

""Happy Simril's Eve, Omin!"" Jim sang, his purple velvet cloak flourishing out around him as he crashed through the door with gusto. It might then shock the viewer to see Omin, standing as he was with his back to the door, several documents laid out on a varnished pine desk in the corner, was as far from surprised as Jim Darkmagic should be from the living.

""Jim,"" Omin intoned in that low, deliberate voice of his. ""We talked about you knocking."" Omin shook his head, rolling up the particularly fine kid-skin vellum he had been inspecting.
""Yea, I know. But tomorrow is Simril, Omin! C'mon, it's the best day of the year! You get to stay up past your bed time, look up at the stars, there's free food everywhere, and it's like... Tymora's big night. Isn't that your thing?"" Jim gestured, with either insincere or actual confusion, at the brass Acquisitions Incorporated brand Tymora holy symbol currently adorning one of the other desks in the room, it's weight currently holding down several parchments and papers for future perusal.

Omin turned and sighed, in that exasperated, patronly way that betrayed no hint of  affection. ""Jim, I have shit to do. Important shit. Cataclysmically relevant shit. The shit I need done is already taking a geological age to get done, and I have literally no time at all, in this world or any other, for your shit."" Omin gestured furtively at all of Jim's features, from his raven-black hair to the tips of his curled purple boots.
Jim Darkmagic, employee of Acquisitions Incorporated, was used to this sort of dismissal. The gallant and buoyant showmanship of the wizard was not easily deflated. Still, the spell caster's tone took on a plaintive, pleading tenor. ""Aww but Omin, I'm performing at the Watedeep Orphanage in the Trades Ward. I'm going to teach the kids how to read a horoscope, we'll throw some doves around, and I'll predict which one of them is going to get adopted. C'mon, I've got these kids for the whole day, just me and my little future fan club! You really gotta see it.""

Ominifis raised a sanctimonious eyebrow at his oldest employee. ""Isn't this part of your edict? Your community service after burning down the last orphanage? Was it this, or..."" Omin tapped his chin with a mailled finger, staring off pensively with dramatic effect. ""Wait, don't tell me. Ah, yes! Exiled naked into Undermountain, covered in honey, with a cattle bell around your neck."" The cleric of Tymora growled like a roused cat at Jim, who seemed to wither under the bitingly precise proclamation of his plight.
""Well, when you say it like that..."" The scion of the Darkmagic clan began, but Omin cut him off by bringing his thumb and forefinger into contact, then sliding them across Jim's lips. ""Do your little magic show, try not to incur any vandalistic expenses the company is liable for, and get the fuck back to work.""

The wizard left, the expression on his face not unlike that of two tins of condemned veal, only to be replaced a moment later by a much more trepidacious form. But where Jim's wardrobe was velveteen and dark, this character appeared to leap fresh from a stage production containing colourful singing sailors.

Red hair, half cloak, and a filigreed rapier all painted the picture of someone who should be standing in a billowing wind somewhere, but instead he stood half-in the doorway, swallowing hard the knot in his throat to crush the butterflies in his belly. ""Umm, boss. I heard you and Jim and, well I was kinda wondering..."" The rakish fellow was cut short with a glare.

""Viari, do we have to have another talk about the box?"" Omin asked with ominous inflection, gesturing to a small crate in the corner of his office that was not, strangely, filled with documents, but instead contained everything in life Viari owned and cherished. It was a small box, or perhaps it was larger at some point in the recent past.
""No, no please... No."" Viari winced softly, holding up his hands. ""But I... Feel... I have been working very hard, for you, and the company... Acquiring things lately."" Viari floundered a little, but quickly found his verbal footing. ""Like... The middle finger of Vecna! That was something, right? And..."" Viari snapped his fingers fervently, trying to recall something on the tip of his tongue. ""That... Baby dragon! I mean, sure it turned out to be a regular sized lizard, but I still flipped it for a cool sixteen silver!""

""Viari, your obsequious advantages do not avail you in this matter."" Omin said, with all the sternness and edge of a slate wall. ""Spit it out. What do you want? After that shit you pulled in Ravnica, you're lucky I don't have interns practising their Polymorph spells on you.""

Viari blanched and swallowed again, feeling the open front of his shirt strangely tight around his neck. ""I kinda had... Plans for Simril as well."" The air seemed to grow cold suddenly in the already unheated office, the only sound for a moment was the grinding of steel like tectonic plates as Omin Dran crossed his armoured hands across his chest. ""It's just one day every Nightal, boss! Omin, c'mon, it's been a year hasn't it?"" Viari smiled, warm and full of charm, the sort of smile that could swoon a dozen hearts, the kind of grin that would turn an illithid to veganism. But the smile grew fainter, as no reaction from the CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated could be discerned.

""This counts as your one company allowed sick day a year."" Omin betrayed no sign of exasperation or resignation in his voice, simply pronouncing the sentence in the same manner he would order a loaf of stale bread. ""Be here all the earlier the next morning.""

The flame-kissed rogue nearly leapt with joy, his heels coming off the ground before the gravity of Omin's dour expression forced him back to the floor. With that, Viari took off with a loping gait, hugging interns, expressing a Happy Simril to any in he passed, and did not once pick the pocket of anyone who didn't share his mirth.

For his part Omin worked not much later, as much of the staff had been mysteriously disappearing all day. It was like this every year, Omin consoled himself as he walked through the spacious lobby and lowered a heavy iron switch. He then locked the building from the outside, hearing the low grinding in the guts of the building as it's innards were arranging themselves into something more defensible, all the trapped rooms moving to the foyer and adjacent sections.

Omin Dran then took to the streets of Watedeep, trudging through high snow and ignoring the hails of carriage drivers who offered to take him to his destination. No, Omin had two working legs and walking was by far the most efficient means of transpiration. He walked under the shadow of the God Catcher on his way to the North Ward, where Acquisitions Incorporated owned a small mansion, but had partitioned it off and rented it out to many other businesses over the years.

A barber, a millner, and a seamstress all worked out of the building Omin made his home. For two months last year a fuller practices his trade in the basement, before it became apparent to Omin exactly what a fuller did for work. But they all had their own doors, their own walls, and their own spaces, and the Lord Dran's took up the smallest room on the Eastern side.

Nothing about this part of the building would betray the wealth and confidence of the half-elf who dwelled within. It was simple, one of the window shutters needed repainting, and some of the clay tiles were loose on the roof. Even the door was unremarkable, the handle salvaged from some ironmonger's scrap pile for a few bits, and the knocker was a simple loop of bronze on a hinge . It was therefore doubly remarkable when Omin reached to open his door and saw the face of his employee, Jim Darkmagic, staring back at him. The hoop had twisted into a kind of horrible rictus grin, and the oak behind it seemed to melt like wax to form the familiar shape of the wizard's cocked eyebrow and pointed chin. The bronze ring parted, and the door uttered a hissing, “Ominifis...” before it was consumed by a bolt of blinding light.

Omin stood on his stoop, holy symbol clutched in his gauntleted hand, having just called into the world a fraction of Tymora's radiance to burn a hole clean through his door. “Damn mimics...” Omin muttered, preparing another spell... But it seemed to be just a door now. No mucous or sinew leaked from the door, no gibbering came from the creature the cleric thought to slay, just the familiar smell of hissing burnt metal and wood. It appeared, to all who might examine it later, to be just an ordinary wooden door with, perhaps, an overly large peep-hole now set into it.

Omin glowered for a moment, calculating what he saw and the likelihood it was an illusion. But no, no trace of magic remained. Without further comment or consideration, Omin forced the door open and shut it with a thud, giving not a care for the hole in the door as the Nightal winds blew freely through the drafty old manse anyway.

Not bothering with a candle, for Omin had a penchant for seeing into darkened places (for was not in many dark places the possibility of opportunity?), he took a brief inventory of his home, a precaution against any further miscreant mimicry. Investigations of his foyer, parlour, kitchen, his upstairs bedroom, and the water closet, revealed nothing out of sorts. His fireplace was cold and stocked with the barest minimum of wooden fuel (Omin was able to secure cheaper insurance by installing a small iron stove and bricking up the hearth), his bronze shrine to Tymora betrayed a hint of patina (surely, he had polished it just last week), and the shelves upon shelves of documents in the master bedroom were stacked neatly, alphabetically, and by date received (except for those on the nightstand, those were the only dishevelled stationary to be found!).

Satisfied that nothing else would leap out and snarl at him, Omin divested himself of vestments, his tabard hung neatly on a peg beside a rack which bore the weight of his maille armour. His mace, as was Dran custom, hung off the leather belt of his housecoat.

Striking the iron stove with a bit of that divine spark and some oil, Omin pulled up a folding wooden camp chair and enjoyed his late night meal of cold porridge with a mug of watered-down ale and a half-loaf of bread the consistency of soft granite.

It was a chill fire for cold thoughts, as the master of the house turned over numbers in his head as easily as he turned the spoon in his gruel. If a confession was forced, Omin would simply shrug and say that calculating odds relaxed him, making sense of the roil and run of the day through the focusing lens of probability. And not just numbers, oh no that was what he hired accountants for! Omin's mind was a an iron maw, hungry for politic and gossip, sniffing and snuffling out new opportunities like a rust monster finds errant knights. Mere numbers, money... Crums and pebbles. Fate and power fascinated Ominifis Dran.

It should then be a surprise to you, dear reader, as to why Omin held the festival of Simril in such disdain. How could a ponderous and inquisitive imagination as his find scorn in the holy day of his goddess, Tymora? Would he not find value in the augurs of the night sky, to see the celestial spheres of the tapestry cast like dice on a silken carpet? Could it be that this priest armoured himself against fanciful celebrations as he did against the blades and bites of his foes? Did Omin Dran have no star he considered his own?

All of these thoughts may have  turned over in Omin's mind, and such a deep and abiding brood might excuse one from recognizing the subtler signs of malfeasance. Omin sniffed the air, and wondered at first if some poultry had laid their fowl eggs in the rain gutters again and had just now fermented. But that break in his concentration allowed him to discern a familiar sound, like coins being stacked and dribbled onto one another. It was a familiar sound, and a welcome one to be sure, but only when Omin was either the holder of such coins or about to be the receiver of them! As it was, he thought himself alone in the house and lept to his feet, spilling his soupy supper across the ground as his half-elven eyes peered about the drafty, dust-dappled old room. But nothing moved, and nothing stirred, and no glint of gold betrayed itself. Only his oven, his armour, and his chair cast shadows against the walls in relief of the dim orange light.

But the smell persisted and Omin took up a guard, moving slowly towards his suit of armour. “First mimics, now this chicanery.” He muttered, drawing his mace into his bare hand, feeling the comforting creak of the salt-worn leather wrapped around it's oaken handle. He stepped back towards his armour, feeling exposed and chilled to his toes. Another step, then another, that soft clinking sound could be heard again, the thud of blood rushing in Omin's ears made it sound distant, yet close beside him. “Out with you, whoever you are!” Omin called into the darkness, to no reply except the slow grating, clinking sound. “Vacate the premises immediately, and I promise I will use only the minimum amount of force required to cave in your sternum.”

The jangling metallic noise ceased then, and Omin relaxed, feeling that perhaps two cups of watered-down ale tonight might be in order, when he felt his legs crushed together by some grinding force which sent him to the floor like a spent children's top. From this newly acquired angle, Omin realized his error in perception. The floor was writhing with riveted iron chains, like snakes in heat, wrapping around his ankles, his knees, his wrists, and his neck. Omin thrashed like a fish in a net, his eyes seeking some foe in the shadows. To his horror he realized too late the source of his adversary, the sturdy suit of armour he had been backing towards was unspooling rapidly, like a knitted sweater unravelled by a child's insistent tugging.

The chains bored into Omin and scraped and gouged at the floor, his shoulders fastened and unable to swing his mace. Trying to conjure the favor his divine Tymora, he found the chains whipped around his chin and head, clamping his teeth shut so hard his ears rang. Then he felt the floor burning away around him, the hardwood melting like wax under the heat issuing out from bellow. “No, no not again. No!” Omin screamed through a muzzled mouth before he fell.

He did not fall far, it seemed to him. No, not so far as the last time. He fell and was caught by the chains that bound him, wrapped like swaddling cloth so tight and so secure Omin was not sure why panic overtook him a moment ago. He hung in a dark place, as a cocoon would from a spring tree, and there was no light. Even for the half-elf, this place seemed unlit. The kind of sprawling, cavernous darkness that seemed at once agoraphobic and suffocating. The chains became a constant, the little metal rivets digging into his skin helped Omin to keep a sense of himself as he hung in the void, weightless and drifting.

Then he realize the only thing more terrible than this vast, empty place was realizing that he was not, in fact, alone in it. “Omin. So good to see you.” The voice, as cold and dry as frostbite, was coming from right in front of Omin, but he could not discern it's source. Not until it opened two baleful, violet eyes. The light seemed to infect the darkness, spreading out from those two points and slowly revealed a room of chissled blue bricks, a deep cistern or well in the middle, and so many chains.

But there was something else to the chains, something that Omin's racing mind recognized as a shape within the patterns. As the room was lit, Omin realized that there was flesh between the chains. Dark, thick flesh, the colour of lilacs frozen and dead. And  the flesh was the source of the voice. The flesh moved between the chains, and Omin recoiled in horror.

“What? You don't recognize me, you fucker?” The inflection, the vocabulary, was unmistakable. Omin shook his head violently, trying to free his mouth to scream, or spellcast, or just to bellow a denial to the creature before him. Thick, purple hands with vericous blue veins, took hold of Omen's head and peeled the chains away like paper. “Don't act so surprised. After all, this is what you signed me up for.”

Omin spat blood, realizing he had bitten down on the flesh of his cheek in his descent. “Yea, I signed you up for this. You mistake. You momentary lapse in judgement. You second-fiddle...” Omin's repudiations were cut short when he felt the chains around his chest constrict, crushing his ribs into his lungs like one might squeeze juice from a fruit.

“You piece of shit!” The monstrous form howled. “You think you're so smart?” The pettiness of the statement would strike Omin as amusing if his vision wasn't desintigrating into large black blobs. “You shucked me off like some tinker's garbage. You signed a contract with the powers below, and you had it all wrapped up nice, and neat, and tidy.” The pressure relented, and Omin sucked in the most satisfying air he had ever tasted, thick with the stench of copper and iron and refuse. Then Omin was falling again, except his fall was broken, along with he was sure a few ribs, by the floor of the chamber. All the chains retreated into the ceiling, like rattling roaches fleeing a flame. All the chains except those twisted around the muscled, naked, purple-skinned form of one Jim Darkmagic.

“I had a life, Omin! I was a whole person, I had all of his memories, his desires, and his power. And I trusted you!” It spat, it's eyes flaring with light. Rage burned in those cold, deep sockets. The sort of anger one feels only once in a lifetime, the kind that leaves one shaking with fists clenched at the mere memory of what caused it. This is fury that makes even the most heinous of slights felt afterwards as if they were mere annoyances. This was what kept Jim Darkmagic focused for all the decades he spent in the care of those Omin had turned him over to.

For it had been years, an age to Jim Darkmagic, as time passed with agonizing lethargy here compared to the mortal material realms. At each new torture, with every passing agony, Jim would find himself laughing through the pain as he imagined inflicting even worse upon the one who bound him here. Much of this Omin gleaned from that glare, that baleful look the devil before him. Omin swallowed and conjured all of his not inconsiderable resolve.

“I struck a deal, you waste of perfectly good iron salvage. I held up my end, and shits higher in the outhouse than you gave me a guarantee.” He sniffed and drew himself up to his full height, his housecoat in tatters and his mace nowhere to be seen. But Omin's back was straight and his shoulders set, the barest hint of a snarl on his lips as he stared down the devil before him. “You have no power over me.”

The chained creature that was a Jim Darkmagic stood stock still, it's expression hidden behind layers of chain draped across it's mouth. But one bald, protruding eyebrow was raised in an expression that was unmistakably one the wizard had made in life. “You don't get it, yet, do you?” It shook it's head, a grating, raspy chuckle like a coffin being dragged along cobblestones came from behind the metal veil. “You signed a contract, Omin. You did the work of the powers here.”

Omin scoffed at this, eliciting a growl from the hulking purple fiend. “You think I signed something without reading it? Really reading it? I mean, come the fuck along. This is me.” Omin pronounced with all the certainty of a preacher at the pulpit. The scorn was cut short as the chains lashed out again, tearing at the air in front of Omin with a wet sound, but this time they were not gouging flesh. The manacles instead seemed to rend the space, opening a place between places, as something wholly unpleasant began to manifest in the rent between worlds.

“Did you read this, shit for brains?” Chided the was-Jim, the rift opening like a fillet and to reveal words of infernal script. But not just infernal, it was written in every language that ever was, and ever will be. Omin's cocksure posture slumped, and he stared agog into the writhing portal at the document, the original document, the contract from which the idea of contracts was born. Witnessed by angels, notarized by Primus, signed by Asmodeus, the Pact Primeval blazed before Omin Dran.

“You consigned an innocent soul to hell, Omin.” The devil whispered, stepping beside his former but never employer. “You did the devil's work. And it was good work, man. You shoulda heard them talk about it. Passed it down the layers, everyone was impressed.” A tongue snaked out, wet and cold, brushing the oxidized links aside as it savoured the scent in the air. That cold, salted smell of dawning dread. “You read the document that sent me here. Read it careful as you could. But nothing exists in a void, Omin. There's a cosmic policy about these sort of things.”

That hissing, rasping voice seemed to bear Omin down with all the weight of all the iron in all the realms. That suffocating feeling was back again, that crushing sensation, that hopeless and overwhelming anxiety. Omin clutched at his arms, his face, panic overcoming him for a moment as the hellish script in the rift before him scrolled on, and on, and on, the voice of damned Jim shredding the cleric from the inside out.

“Wait, what does that say?” Omin asked in a suddenly cogent voice. “That, right there!” He pointed at a bit of fine print as it roiled and razed against his eyes. The chained creature turned and looked. “What? Oh, that's nothing.” “No, no that's clearly something.” “It's probably an old provision, nobody's read that in ages.””Yea, well fuck you, not-Jim. Read it and weep.” “I don't have to read it, I know what it says. I'm a fucking devil, you dick!” “Listen, do I have to read it to you? I will fucking read it to you.”

The churlish argument was over a small sub-paragraph that caught Omin's panicked eye. It stated that any who swore themselves to one of the divine powers would have three opportunities, presented at their patron's discretion, to regain agency over their hell-bound soul.

“So?” “So, I'm a fucking cleric of Tymora. Or did they eat your brain before they turned you into a nib-a-peek carnival freak?” “So what? We have lots of clerics down here!” “Yea, well do you want to send me into the pit so I can tell them all them about this fucking clause? How's that gonna look to management? Bunch of your clients complaining to head office.”

The chained Jim froze, suddenly feeling that unfamiliar sense of dread and unease. Few things threatened an infernal creature more than gaining the notice of those in higher places. The chains about it's form writhed like worms on a griddle, the dry air suddenly growing warmer.

“Fine.” Hissed the creature before Omin. “Your appeal has been noted, and all the proper channels will be used to notify your... Deity of your situation.” The thing that was a Jim lashed out with all it's chains, the burred edges of raw iron scraped and scoured Omin again as the bound him mercilessly, the terror once again overcoming the otherwise unflappable cleric. “If she gives a shit, she'll send for you after midnight tonight. If she doesn't...” The bonds forced themselves into Omin's mouth, breaking his teeth, burning his throat as they went down, deeper...

And then Omin was awake, on the floor beside his chair, a puddle of gruel and his mace beside him and his suit of intact armour staring impassively at him from the corner of the dimly lit room. Omin stood, holding a head to his clammy head, feeling around in his mouth for missing teeth and examining his body for bruises and lacerations... nothing.

He was fit as a fiddler during Kythorn, and it was with that conclusion that he brushed himself off, made his way upstairs to the second-hand four poster bed, and fell fast asleep with but a murmured prayer of thanks to Tymora it was all a dream."

I already hate group work, but in this classroom format it was hell from start to finish. All three of my group mates were different majors than I, and while the class was mandatory for me, it was a filler English class for them. We will call them T, J, and G. It gets a little long because I ramble. TL;DR at the bottom.

I spent the first week sending email after email to these three students asking if they had looked over the information/had any ideas (we were supposed to be ""acting as interns"" for a fake company, by writing emails, memos, and putting together a formal presentation. Just various technical writings.) T is the only one that consistently responded to me, though by only agreeing with everything I said and not offering any input. J only ever emailed to say ""I will look at the files tonight!"" (only to never contribute), and G never responded. 

Three weeks into the project and two drafts submitted later, G finally emails and gets angry with me because I didn't do enough to explain the project to him and he doesn't know how he is supposed to help if I don't explain it. (I did kindly inform him that we had all the same files and we aren't in grade school, I'm not his teacher and I'm not there to hold his hand. He could have accessed everything just the same as I or T or J did). At this point I've already emailed the teacher several times to complain about my group mates not helping (her response was always ""Turn it in blank where they did not do their parts. Make sure to label what you have done"").

When our final project was due, I gave them one last chance. I created the Google Slide and asked everyone to contribute a couple of slides. At 11.55pm, the night it was due, I locked the slide (that only I had edited and no one had helped me with), removed everyone's name from the title page and added in nice petty bold letters ""Research: lynndaem . Slide created by: lynndaem"" on Ever. Single. Slide.

Needless to say, when I had another class last semester with G in it, he promptly left the group to join a different group. 

TL;DR : 
Group mates wouldn't help me after I constantly badgered them for help for over a month, so I locked the Google slides the night it was due, removes their names from the cover slide, and put my name on every slide. A student from that group then refused to be in a group with me the next semester. "

Please Help me fight this pain.",undozthree,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/a9egz6/please_dont_give_up_on_us_please_help_me_fight/,"Her text-&gt; Thanks for giving me my time. I’m not quite ready to talk yet ... it’s not easy . I’ll reach out to you once I’m ready .. but merry Christmas to you and your family

My unsent response:

Thank you for putting up with me and my anxiety. Thank you for giving me the best years of my life. Thank you for loving me and investing your emotions in me.

I don’t think we are ever going to be ready to talk, because you and I both know where our relationship is heading. I don’t think both of us want it to go down this way, which is why we should talk things out, and communicate how we feel about things so we both can be on the same page and move forward. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we have to break up or stay together if we talk, but it gives both of us an idea of how the other person feels and what the other person wants to do. We can then give each other time to decide if needed, try to change things, or finish things so we can move forward. 

Maybe you are just unsure, which is ok. We have been apart for a while already, which is why it might be a good idea to hang out and remember what it was when I was back home. If i remember correctly, we were like this when I came back from my internship in Seattle. There was a disconnect at first , but after a few days things went back to normal. If it’s really the distance, then i promise you we can work something out. I didn’t leave you, I left for because of my career. I left because I thought my shiny new job would give me financial stability, hope, and success for our future. I was extremely mistaken. Regardless, I’m coming back home sooner than you may think. I had the chance to talk to other couples while you were in Mexico, and I can tell you the advice that they gave me. They also went through/are going through the same thing. 

Maybe you have already made a choice of ending things with me, and that is ok too. I haven’t been the best boyfriend, and my career has definitely made an impact on our relationship. But if this is the case, then in order for both of us to move forward and start to heal then we need to end things on a positive note sooner rather than later. I need to be a bit selfish here, and say that I need you to tell me this soon because my family is here to comfort me. I have very little people to talk to back at my apartment in the midwest. Everyday that we don’t talk about it, will be a day less that I can mourn with my family. If you truly are thoughtful of my emotions and about my current well-being, than I ask you to please communicate this to me as soon as possible. 

Maybe it’s something else. Whatever it may be, just know that I am here for you and support you in whatever you decide. You don’t have to make this choice alone if you don’t want too. I’m sorry for pressuring you in the past, my anxiety got the best of me and made me loose sight of what really matters. 

I hope that this helps you decide and makes it easier for you to reach out. I apologize if I come off as a bit cold. I am only doing this because I don’t know how you feel, and don’t want to make you feel worse. You know exactly how I feel about you, and I don’t want my emotions to alter any choices that you may make on your own. I also hope that we can ultimately make this choice as a team, and not as individuals.

If you feel ok just to talk, it would be nice to hear about how your last days in Mexico went. We don’t need to talk about the relationship if you don’t want too. It would be nice to get to hear your voice for Christmas, but it’s okay if you don’t want to talk 🙂

Goodnight. 

To internet -&gt;
Thank you for reading. This person continues to be my cure for anxiety, we are on the rocks right now. I need help bad. I left everything back home in California for a dream job in the Midwest. It was suppose to be for only 6 months, but things in the company changed unexpectedly and caused me to stay longer than expected. Financial problems, stress, and the amount of time I spent doing internships, struggles as a first gen college student, etc. pushed me to accept the offer before this change. Things didn’t go as expected. I am not happy, and I am about to loose the thing that is most dear to me. The person that helped me through so much these past 5 years. I live on my own, I really need help. Please help me.

a9fkra,1,2018-12-25,21 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/a9fkra/21_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Merry Christmas to those who celebrate! Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

A few things:

Be literate please! No text talk/bad grammar. I only rp in 3rd so please do 3rd person! I DO NOT TF! I am looking for a tfer, so please be okay doing that. You should also be okay with me playing as original characters. If you are not, this post isn't for you. Be an active rper. I understand life comes up, just please try to reply as much as humanly possible. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM or kik:

a9fs3w,4,2018-12-25,Controlling Mother,sombervoyager,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/a9fs3w/controlling_mother/,"Hi guys I'm new here and this is my first post on Reddit. I have so much to pour out and want to gather views from you all. 

Just some background on my family:

We're from Singapore, and I have 3 other siblings (F21, F16, M11). I myself am 19 this year. My mum grew up with 3 siblings too, and is the oldest child. Her parents' relationship is bad - they've been separated for years and my mum doesn't get along well with her mum. (My grandma dotes on her sons and my grandpa dotes on his daughters). So basically my mum grew up with her parents not restricting anything she does, and did not care about her studies etc hence she only finished secondary school. 


My elder sis is 21 - very shy and quiet girl (though she's the opposite when she's home), no bf, doesn't go out much and studies very hard. Meanwhile I do not like studying and like going out with friends, although not often. My results are actually slightly better than average even though I cannot make it into University. I do not wish to go to Uni as I really hate school (my first year in polytechnic was emotionally difficult for me, so bad that I would sometimes cry on my way back from school and I really wanted to drop out). I'm having my internship right now, and I really enjoy what I'm doing so I intend to start working after graduation, and am considering to study part time after I've settled at work. But my mum insists that I go to Uni even though I can't make it to a local uni and I really hate school. She thinks that without a degree I'd be disregarded by others who hold a degree. When we talk about this, she'll always blame her parents for not forcing her to study when she was younger. I understand that my grandparents didn't play a good part as her parents during her childhood but I really want her to respect my decisions and not make me suffer through Uni, which is what she wants, not what I want. 


Besides that, she also doesn't allow me to go out much. About 80% of my friends are males and my mum doesn't like that. I go out about 4-5 times a month with my friends, and I usually go out with \~3 guy friends in a group, and would bring along a female friend most of the time. When I go out with my friends, I usually go out in the late afternoon and would be home by 1am (curfew set by my mum). However, when I'm out with my friends, my mum would always call me 4-5 times and keep wanting to know where I am, who I'm with, what I'm doing, etc. It's gotten to a point where it's really annoying me and it also embarrasses me - I'm 19, not 9. I keep having to excuse myself from my friends and pick up my mum's calls. I lie to her about who I'm with most of the time (I'll just say that I'm at the girl's house, and not mention that there are guys there). If she finds out that there are guys and I happen to be at a guy's house, she would get extremely angry and would call 5-10 times within an hour to get me to come home. I really have had enough. I don't smoke, have sex or do anything illegal. Why won't she just let me be? The guys I go out with are all friends that I've known for at least 5 years, and they wouldn't do anything to me. Their parents know me and are okay with having me over at their house or just going out to chill with them. But my mum just wouldn't stop pestering me, saying that my elder sis stays home all the time and comes home early, so why can't I be the same. 


I really have put up with her for a very long time now, and would like to know what you guys think, or what I can do. Thanks!


Sorry for the very long and confusing post anyway!

Edit: I’m not too sure if my culture plays a part in this. Asian families are conservative and parents can be very protective. But my mum seems to be too excessive and other families around me don’t seem to be as strict as mine. My mother even screams at me just because I don’t shower before 10pm, which I honestly find ridiculous. 

I also just remembered that she ever said to me “Are you a prostitute? Why keep going out with boys?” This happened when I was only 11 or 12 and I can’t forget what she’s said ever since that day. "

a9geji,3,2018-12-25,How I almost got emotionally manipulated into spending a summer with my abuser. :),Firewave480,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/a9geji/how_i_almost_got_emotionally_manipulated_into/,"For reference: I am 19, college sophomore, and spent last summer doing an on campus internship at Uni. My mom is an emotional abusing narcissist, my dad an actual Godly saint.  Currently on winter break, so i stay with my N and my Dad. Please feel free to go through my post history for more context.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom recently sat me down at the table, just to two of us (I immediately felt a bad feeling, because whenever its just us, she truly actives her N mode.)  She was like, ""So there is this big family reunion coming next December in another country, and it would really help out me and your dad if you can help fiance it"" ""There is a really well paying summer job that you can do here with your dad, you would make plenty of money, and it would help cover a couple of tickets and some pocket money and this and that."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Now because I love my dad with all my heart, I was like, sure that makes sense and while it would make me want to kill myself, I decided okay I'll stay this summer. For the past few days, I have been feeling like I want to tear my heart out and kill myself in every way possible. The idea of being here for two weeks already makes me want to die, so the fear of being here for a whole summer was enough to kill me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My little brother (who is very much aware that she is a narc and is honestly one of my life lines) was like, why are you trusting that everything she says is accurate and at face value? When has she ever been 100% completely honest? And im like, ""hmmmm"" So I immediately asked my dad, (who is a saint mind you, like he is the ying to my mom's yang) 

&amp;#x200B;

He was like, ""Oh yeah, \*chuckles\*, that trip thing, i'm going to finance it for our family primarily"" I'm like, ""so should i stay there this summer and work with you to help you finance this?"" Him: ""Who told you this?"" 

Me: ""Mom""

Him:\*chuckles and is clearly confused\* ""Don't mind her and don't worry about what she says. You do what you want."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Speechless, because he is clearly treating me like an adult who can make his own decisions. ""I was also thinking about doing my internship and taking some summer classes."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Him: ""That sounds good, focus on your education and do what you want, don't mind her.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my brother at this point: Oh, so she tried to pull some high level clown nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

So in short; my mom tried to emotionally manipulate me into spending a summer in a house that I would hate, destroying my mental health, just to make some money that I could put into funding this family trip that I don't even want to go on, name dropping my dad in order to make me care. My dad instantly shut it down when I told him and clearly wasn't informed or communicated about this and also doesn't approve of it.  I suppose that is what I get for being naive and trusting of her nature and for being a kind person in general.

So you know what I am going to do? I will work for myself this summer, take my summer classes, further my education and save that money up for a car! Because, fuck her, I refuse to be treated this way as an adult, and you won't go behind my Dad's back to manipulate me anymore. I can clearly sense when you are about to pull some serious Narc shit and I simply won't have it."

Looking for anyone wanting to play, girls and guys welcome. Prefer someone playing a character older than mine. I prefer the story to evolve into sex, romance and some social play, but your take on it is fine too. I have many kinks, but none are real requirements. Feminization, size difference (you being tall and strong or chubby), BDSM, sensory deprivation, training, light blackmail, pushing my boundaries, light public play etc. Feel free to message even if this post is old. Right now I'm looking for more long-term play with slower/daily replies. Busy Christmas  and start of the next year =3)

Three weeks ago we met for the first time when I was lost downtown in this, for me, new country. My name is Kim, I'm 19 years old and from Sweden. I have just moved here for an internship working with care of the elderly at a gated community outside town. We instantly got along really well and have been hanging out a lot ever since. With my bright blonde hair, short and petite form you can't help but find me really cute. I'm only about 160 cms tall with a fit lithe body from good (?) genetics and a lot of running. My pale skin does not handle the sun very well so I'm often sunburnt and have plenty of summer freckles. You know I'm quite nerdy and enjoy playing video games and tabletop RPGs in my spare time.


I'm usually happy and energetic but easily get flustered and shy when you turn on the charm. You enjoy teasing me and flirting lightly, finding it adorable when I don't know how to handle it. We live just a few blocks from each other, you at your own rather large place and me renting a 1 room apartment from a girl that's studying abroad for a year. It was furnished and all so I'm a bit embarrassed with it being so girly, but with my low income it's all I can afford in a decent part of town. 

Today it's Friday evening and you've been working. We've got plans to hang out tomorrow but you know I tend to forget to eat sometime and since you've been wanting to hang out you thought you'd surprise me with taking me out to eat. It's been a hot week and you know I find the heat hard to deal with, so as you park your car outside you see my windows being open. You've tried to teach me not to open windows when there's AC but I never seem to learn.

You head up the stairs and as you reach my door you suddenly get the idea to sneak in and see if you can surprise me even more. Without thinking much further you carefully feel the door. You've tried teaching me to lock my door too since that's kind of important in this country, but as usual it's unlocked and silently swings open for you as you try it. You sneak inside and reach the doorway to the right that leads to my room and - Your eyes widen in surprise, your heart rushing.

Laying there on my stomach on the couch you see me dressed cute girls clothes with my phone in my hands. My legs are mostly covered by a pair of purple thigh high socks, revealing just a few inches of pale creamy skin before my short also purple skirt covers me up. My legs are lifted up behind me and the roundness of my butt gives you a glimpse in under the skirt where you see frilly purple fabric from a pair of panties. My bright blonde hair is tied up in a pair of small pigtails with purple ribbons, and my upper body is covered by a tightly fitting white and purple top with full length sleeves. The look definitely reminds you of a cheerleader outfit. Under the skin tight top you notice a hint of straps, probably from a bra. I've got a pair of large white headphones on and you see my legs moving slightly against each other. On the table next to me you see two cans of cider, both opened, my Nintendo switch with the pause menu of Dark souls up, and a small bottle of lube. 

Your heart beats like crazy as you look at me, amazed, almost in awe at how cute I look laying there on the couch amongst the slightly girly pillows. You had no idea I was into this. Admittedly my body is very cute and you've had stray thoughts I look a bit girly but... Wow. You can tell I haven't noticed you yet and if you want you can probably sneak a peak of what I'm looking at on my phone.

a9hrxf,17,2018-12-25,Medical Dosimetry v. Medical Physics v. MD-PhD... help!!!,kroekatoa,MedicalPhysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/a9hrxf/medical_dosimetry_v_medical_physics_v_mdphd_help/,"Hello there. I have finished a BS in Physics and am trying to decide what is next for me. I know I want to do something with physics and medicine, and possibly research later down the road.

&amp;#x200B;

**A little about me**: I have worked as a physician scribe in a local hospital's ER for the last \~3 years while doing my bachelor's, and that along with some lectures I attended during a summer internship at CERN while in college is how I've come to be so interested in medicine/medical physics.

I am currently teaching high school physics as an intern (don't have my credential/am not in a credential program yet). I knew this wasn't the path for me when I started- mainly I knew someone who was retiring and decided to try it out without the commitment and hopefully save up some money. Turns out I barely make more than a ER scribe, go figure.

When the year is up in June, I am going to start doing research with a professor at my college in medical physics as well as start taking anatomy and biology classes at a city college that I know are prereqs for a few of the different programs I am interested in.

My dilemma is I'm not quite sure which career path is right for me... I've been weighing the options heavily over the last few weeks, have spoke to both my professors and ER doctors that I still occasionally work shifts with, and yet I still am very undecided. I still need to shadow both a dosimetrist and a medical physicist and hope to do so this spring or summer.

Here are my thoughts on each one, and if anyone can help me weigh in on this I'd be very grateful:

&amp;#x200B;

**Medical Physics** \-  Long amount of schooling, potentially MSc, then PhD, then residency for me, since I don't think I'd be able to get straight into a PhD program with my stats. Seems like there is more potential to do research in either imaging/therapy with this option? Competitive for residencies due to CAMPEP, which also makes limited options for MS and PhD programs. Per a few MDs I work with, anyone with only a PhD is not given much authority at a hospital even if that is not fair. I've read somewhere that MDs make decisions about the equipment medical physicists use and are the ones sent to conferences to purchase, MPs are not consulted and have to deal with the MD's decisions. Not as much opportunity for lateral career changes.

&amp;#x200B;

**MD-PhD** \- Most of the doctors I work with highly suggest this option because of the potential to get an MD degree that is fully funded, as well as finish a PhD quickly because PIs will be less able to keep you for ""indentured servitude"" due to NIH rules on grants/funding. Also they make it seem like this is great for anyone who wants to do research because projects with an MD on them are more likely to be funded. They tried to sell me on the great lateral career change opportunities - could potentially start my own clinic down the line, or have more opportunities to teach at local universities than just a PhD would have. However when I looked at a few of the MD-PhD programs, they 1) seem uber competitive and 2) the PhD options are mostly in biotech/biochem/epidemiology/pathology etc, and not a lot of options that seem to involve the physics I am interested in. I'm trying to wrap my head around how this could translate into medical physics research, unless I do a residency in oncology afterwards maybe?

&amp;#x200B;

**Medical Dosimetrist -** Shortest schooling option, I'd still have to take some anatomy/biology prerequisites to do their certificate or masters programs. Less competition to get into and more job opportunities (per me looking up in a job search engine) than medical physicist. Lifestyle might be more repetitive like a 9-5 job. Automation may potentially wipe this position out later down the line? Still could make a decent living and would be easier to have kids/make time for family. I'm leaning towards this option currently because it is the least time-intensive one. My boyfriend will be applying to medical school soon and I think this would be the best option if I wanted to help support him during that time as well as have kids before I turn 30 (I'm currently 23).

&amp;#x200B;

**A few questions...**

1. What are the day to day job differences from a clinical medical physicist and a medical dosimetrist?
2. Is there any potential that if I became a medical dosimetrist that the hospital/company I would work for would pay for me to go back to school and get a degree in medical physics? Or any potential for research if I just do medical dosimetry?
3. Does anyone have any thoughts on MD-PhD and potential to still do medical physics research or practice in a clinic? I still feel I need to do a lot more research about this career path.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance! Sorry for the uber long post. Also Merry Christmas!

Largely I guess it has to do with the fact that I see guys (myself included) struggling with writing posts so here's some for y'all to use.

Women of DPP feel free to use these as your starting point too...

1)The Home Invasion?

Dropping your keys and purse on the table, you head towards the bedroom, kicking off your shoes and unbuttoning your silk blouse as you walk down the hall. Inside the bedroom, the silk slides down your shoulders and back with a cool, sensual touch as your blouse glides off of your body. You close your eyes and imagine the soft touch of your husband's hands in it's place.

But no. This is not how he touches you. His caresses don't feel like this. This is the caress of someone else. Your head tilts back as the image of a faceless stranger replaces your husband. It could be any one of the sexy hunks you saw earlier tonight, or someone else you've never met before. 

A small shiver dances down your spine at the lewd thought of someone else touching you. You realise that it excites you, this new fantasy. A stranger. Someone dark and dangerous, strong and sexy. Definitely sexy.

Your hands drop the blouse and it sinks to the floor. Your fingers move to touch your bare stomach and slowly glide upwards, caressing your body. His fingers. You imagine this soft stroke to be his strange hands gliding up over your bra, cupping your breasts and gently squeezing them. Your nipples are already hard, pressing into your/his palms. A gentle sigh escapes your lips at this stranger's intimate embrace. The hands move down, the fingertips sliding smoothly over your skin, down to the hem of your skirt. The zipper eases down and the skirt slowly begins to slip down, over your hips. The fingers gently probing your now bare skin as your skirt falls to floor, baring your flesh against the strangers hungry touches....

2) The high school quarter back with a secret... You! - This may seem clichéd but the amount of fun you can have while masquerading as an innocent audience member while providing the athlete with some much needed motivation can never be turned down...

3) Classy Mother to White Trash? - Oh yea.... The epitome of beauty being ravaged by an average ghetto dweller. Your husband can't satisfy you? Check. You are turned on by a rippling chiseled body? Check. You are mewling and moaning with your ass up while he pounds you? Check!!!!

4) Milf Teacher? - You could try to seduce a student or be taken down by one. Either ways this busty teacher has had this a long way  coming... How far would you want to be degraded?

5) Husband's new intern? - Could be female or male... But what's better than having your legs spread apart and being fingered while your oblivious husband sits merely a foot away? Being fucked senseless by said intern of course! Better even if he does it tucked away in the bushes right next to your table? 

6) The Babysitter

To me, Tuesdays were the best nights of the week. Between myself and my kids, we  could eat and do (no pun intended) whatever we wanted. My wife couldn't harp on us for this, her own nightly work schedule keeping her from protesting any more strongly. I would tend to be home early enough for this brief shared meal, because  then, because it was a school night the boys would be off to bed early, and I could catch up on the TV programs I had to give up when they were far younger and less prone to sleeping soundly.

But best of all, with how my shift ended on those Tuesdays at five they'd have you, their babysitter, over to watch the boys. I  did appreciate it greatly, with all three of them being a handful as they were.

 The little devils only seemed more prone to minding themselves when their Mama or you were around, meaning watching them by myself was quite the challenge. It was because of that, that  you had agreed to stay awhile even after I got back, at least to get them to bed, though you oft asked to stay for the entirety of your shift so you could get your homework done and even catch some TV or Instagram or whatever it is you did on your phone.

That was the major issue if you asked me, what riled me up the most was just how much you had blossomed growing up. Big pillowy breasts, flaunting, flared hips with long legs that drew my eyes along  teenage curves. All crowned with a bright-eyed smile, flowing locks of gold, and a penchant for wearing the smallest, tightest clothes that could barely cover you up. Meh... As my wife often said, fashion was never my strong point...


Hope you had a fun read. 
Merry Christmas people...

a9jume,3,2018-12-25,I have a tradition of texting the 12 Days of Christmas to my friends (don't read if you want to stay cheery on Christmas).,ValuableLemon,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a9jume/i_have_a_tradition_of_texting_the_12_days_of/,"Every year since high school I've had a tradition of texting a lot of my friends the 12 Days of Christmas. One message a day, every day leading up to Christmas day. It's always been something my friends have enjoyed. Some people consider it trolling and send back joke messages like 'when will it end? Oh God please make it stop,' and some people discuss the ramifications of their true love mailing so many birds. That's been part of the fun of the tradition - seeing everyone's reaction and connecting to friends I have not spoken to throughout the year but mean the world to me. 

Every year, it never fails that someone is an asshole and instead of nicely asking to not have the messages sent to them, they make a scene or yell about me and my 'stupid messages.' I'm used to a couple of grinches and it usually doesn't bother me too much, but this year has been especially bad so I didn't want to do the tradition altogether to avoid the small amount of negativity. Then a friend who is used to the tradition messaged me at 11:30 pm, the day before the first day of Christmas would begin. He miscounted the dates and thought I had forgotten, begging me to make sure the tradition continues. He told me he looks forward to it every year. 

I decided that night, crying about things I don't have much control over, that I would send the 12 Days of Christmas with a secret message at the end of each day. I hoped this would reduce the number of rage messages, and I was happy to learn that my plan was successful. This was the message: 

I really need my friends to know how much I love them. 

I really need my friends to say why they care about me. 

TW: Sexual assault 

I've received some responses back from people who took the time to crack the code, but I hope more people will notice my small cry for hope. The last week of July I was forced to quit my salary position and have not been able to find bachelor degree or above work since. I worked a couple of days at UPS for a seasonal gig but vomited during each shift from the physical labor and decided to quit prematurely. They were going to let me go on Christmas Eve anyhow. I got my Master of International Affairs degree in 2017, I was a first-generation college student and the first in my entire family to get a Master's Degree. I was really proud, and ignored the amount of debt I was getting into because I believed in the American Dream. I now know that I should not have pursued my passion and instead have pursued something more lucrative. 

The month before losing my job, I started going to therapy because a friend I've known for eight years tried to rape me. He broke up with his girlfriend who was living with him and told me he wanted to give her space for the weekend. He asked if I would visit my hometown and spend time with him, going as far as paying for a hotel for us so we could hang out with our friends during the day. I didn't expect this to be a meticulous trap. We've both been victims of rape previously, him with roofies and me with a friend from my undergraduate university in 2013. He consoled me through the panic attacks the first time around and was someone I really leaned on during that time. If I didn't know him so well, I would not have known what to say to get him to loosen his grip enough to push him off and get away. He's not my first rapist and, considering my history, I doubt he'll be my last. 

This incident was the icing on the cake after being mugged at knifepoint, having a stalker for four days, and my most recent ex tell me while I broke up with him that 'I always assumed you had the capacity to cheat on me. Your views of sex make it so easy for you - if you haven't already.' Yes this all happened in 2018. All of this has made me asexual; I've tried to have sex since and my body starts to have a panic attack when I try to touch a guy's penis. Based on everything that has happened, it's not like I've really had a good relationship with sex, so there's no point in trying to pursue sexual relations further. 

My dream with my degree was to get an international development job. Apparently, the easiest way if you don't have the financial capability to do years of unpaid internships is to go to Peace Corps - which honestly was also a dream of mine. I got accepted and was planning to leave in June 2019, up until Peace Corps denied my medical clearance. Because I went to talk therapy for everything that has been going on. I'm not diagnosed with PTSD or anything of the sort, but because I decided to ensure I had good mental health I can't do Peace Corps. 

I ended up crying at my grandma's house while we were still celebrating Christmas. I didn't want to go in the first place, but tried to put a smile on my face and make it through the day and failed. I feel bad about that, but I'm having trouble finding value in day-to-day activities; much less a holiday where family surrounds you and asks about work and suggests hundreds of places to apply. I'm trying and not succeeding, and the way my body has been used makes it hard to place much confidence in myself that everything will turn out alright. 

I've been living off of savings for the past couple of months and that well has finally dried up. The holidays are hard for hiring because employers are more focused on vacation for their current employees, which I understand. My best friend is helping me with major expenses until I can find a job. I live in Texas but I'd move anywhere at this point so long as the pay is good. I'm not asking for assistance, but if this magically connects to someone who just needs me to send my resume to them I wouldn't say no. 

I just need things to get better. Thanks for reading. I hope your holidays have been better. "

I suppose these kind of questions are asked all too frequently, but due to the urgency and the lack of concrete information online from what I searched, I thought maybe you guys can give me some helpful insight.

I am about to finish a 5 month long internship (Aug 1 - Dec 31) and my D4 visa expires on Jan 4 (already extended 1 week as initially it would have expired on Dec 27 before my return flight). However, my company would like to extend my contract for another 8 months and since I want to stay in Korea for a while longer and they offer increased salary, I accepted.

Is it possible to extend my visa on such a short notice before the expiration? I am traveling to Japan from Dec 29 to Jan 1 and thought that maybe I could just return my ARC while leaving and come back on a tourist visa and then deal with all immigration issues. Or is it possible to apply for an extension of visa now and then I would get some sort of extended deadline while the application is processed?

I tried to reach the immigration office, but couldn't reach anybody thus far.

Thank you :)"

I have so much to pour out and want to gather views from you all. 

Just some background on my family:

We're from Singapore, and I have 3 other siblings (F21, F16, M11). I myself am 19 this year. My mum grew up with 3 siblings too, and is the oldest child. Her parents' relationship is bad - they've been separated for years and my mum doesn't get along well with her mum. (My grandma dotes on her sons and my grandpa dotes on his daughters). So basically my mum grew up with her parents not restricting anything she does, and did not care about her studies etc hence she only finished secondary school. 


My elder sis is 21 - very shy and quiet girl (though she's the opposite when she's home), no bf, doesn't go out much and studies very hard. Meanwhile I do not like studying and like going out with friends, although not often. My results are actually slightly better than average even though I cannot make it into University. I do not wish to go to Uni as I really hate school (my first year in polytechnic was emotionally difficult for me, so bad that I would sometimes cry on my way back from school and I really wanted to drop out). I'm having my internship right now, and I really enjoy what I'm doing so I intend to start working after graduation, and am considering to study part time after I've settled at work. But my mum insists that I go to Uni even though I can't make it to a local uni and I really hate school. She thinks that without a degree I'd be disregarded by others who hold a degree. When we talk about this, she'll always blame her parents for not forcing her to study when she was younger. I understand that my grandparents didn't play a good part as her parents during her childhood but I really want her to respect my decisions and not make me suffer through Uni, which is what she wants, not what I want. 


Besides that, she also doesn't allow me to go out much. About 80% of my friends are males and my mum doesn't like that. I go out about 4-5 times a month with my friends, and I usually go out with \~3 guy friends in a group, and would bring along a female friend most of the time. When I go out with my friends, I usually go out in the late afternoon and would be home by 1am (curfew set by my mum). However, when I'm out with my friends, my mum would always call me 4-5 times and keep wanting to know where I am, who I'm with, what I'm doing, etc. It's gotten to a point where it's really annoying me and it also embarrasses me - I'm 19, not 9. I keep having to excuse myself from my friends and pick up my mum's calls. I lie to her about who I'm with most of the time (I'll just say that I'm at the girl's house, and not mention that there are guys there). If she finds out that there are guys and I happen to be at a guy's house, she would get extremely angry and would call 5-10 times within an hour to get me to come home. I really have had enough. I don't smoke, have sex or do anything illegal. Why won't she just let me be? The guys I go out with are all friends that I've known for at least 5 years, and they wouldn't do anything to me. Their parents know me and are okay with having me over at their house or just going out to chill with them. But my mum just wouldn't stop pestering me, saying that my elder sis stays home all the time and comes home early, so why can't I be the same. 


I really have put up with her for a very long time now, and would like to know what you guys think, or what I can do. Thanks!


Edit: I’m not too sure if my culture plays a part in this. Asian families are conservative and parents can be very protective. But my mum seems to be too excessive and other families around me don’t seem to be as strict as mine. My mother even screams at me just because I don’t shower before 10pm, which I honestly find ridiculous. 

I also just remembered that she ever said to me “Are you a prostitute? Why keep going out with boys?” This happened when I was only 11 or 12 and I can’t forget what she’s said ever since that day. "

Hey all!

I recently moved from New Zealand to the United States, and in doing so, left behind a three year-running campaign. Obviously, I'm a little late to the party, but as it's Christmas-time-ish, I wanted to get my old DM the Xanathar's Guide to Everything book to add to his DMG, PHB and MM. It'd mean the world to me if someone could help me out.

For some backstory, I lost my younger brother and my parents in a car crash earlier this year. A couple days later, I (finally) got accepted into a paid internship at a law firm (the place my parents dreamed of for me) in the States. But, well, as you would likely know if you've lost family, there was no way in hell I wanted to do anything with my life. If it wasn't for my DM I'm not sure I'd be here today, in this relatively nice apartment in Brooklyn doing my dream job. He helped me get a temporary job to save more money for the move, he put me in touch with a therapist, and he sat by my side at the funeral. He held me as I cried, and looked after me when I needed it most. Not only that, but this is a man I've known since being a child at primary (elementary) school. I grew up with him, and I'd dare to say he's the best friend I've ever had, and also a phenomenal Dungeon Master.

I don't like asking, or scrounging, but because of the move and all that's gone on, I'm tight on money. I might be able to pay for the shipping, but I'm not sure what that's like from the States to NZ, and the Guide itself would probably put me out of money for food for the week.

I'm afraid he might see this and ask me not to try to get it for him, because I know he's on here sometimes, so I'll keep his user anonymous but if you want to know who it is, I can private message you his username. He did something kind that awarded him a lot of internet points kinda recently too, so you might even have heard of him.

Anyway, thank you for giving this a read. I know it was long and a little shameful, but he deserves it. Thanks (edit, if anyone has any better ideas, let me know!)."

It all started during my sophomore/2nd year of high school over a video game. A mutual friend of ours introduced me to this guy who didn't stand out very much. I didn't think much of him at first but we both came to realize that our personalities clicked almost like puzzle pieces, as cliche as it sounds. We were both cuffed (dating other people) and we stayed as friends for an entire year. I didn't ""like"" him at the time because of my boyfriend atm and because I wasn't physically attracted to him. He was nerdy, a little odd and not very attractive to put it bluntly (sorry if this sounds really mean). 

Over the course of my junior year, I broke up with my boyfriend and was introduced to an amazing group of friends by the guy (we'll call him Milton from now on). This was a changing point in my life as I can say this group of friends, Milton included, saved me. High school was alright but I felt as though many people were fake and though I had plenty of friends, I never let down my guard around them. I would run home immediately after school to play video games with these newfound friends. Though they were not attending the same school, we got along because we shared similar interests/humor. They quickly realized that I was slowly falling in love with Milton and helped me realize this as well. The summer of junior year/senior year was when this crush peaked. I had nothing to do all summer and Milton invited me to partake in this ""job"" with him and a couple of our high school friends. Milton was still cuffed to his girlfriend (2 yrs+) but we hung out every day after the job and online. I never pursued him directly out of respect for his girlfriend and partially because I was scared of rejection, but I couldn't shake my feelings. Our group of friends pressured me to approach him, justifying that the feelings were mutual, and when Milton broke up with his girlfriend, I felt as though there was hope. I still didn't do anything lol but as a high schooler I definitely did some not so slick cringy shit like looming around him all the time. By the end of summer, my group of friends verified for me that Milton liked me back but was too preoccupied with applying to college to do anything about it. 

Fast forward to the December of our senior year of high school. Milton got accepted into a great school and I settled for different school a ~6 hr drive away. I got asked to prom by Milton in front of all our friends and we started dating from then on. My senior year of high school was probably one of the highest points of my life. We hung out daily and fell hard for one another. He was like me but simultaneously everything I wasn't. He was funny, kind, athletic, well off, incredibly smart and hardworking, thoughtful, and overall an amazing person that people enjoyed the company of. I was pretty similar but I think our biggest difference was that I could never find myself putting effort into school or my future. 

Thinking back now, I felt awful for neglecting my friends for Milton but I was just enamored with this guy. When high school came to an end, Milton wanted to break up. He suggested we try different experiences in college and I was heartbroken. We went on our after-prom trip with some random friends of ours and while walking, Milton changed his mind. He wanted to stay together but on the terms of an open relationship. I was an idiot and easily obliged, thinking this would mean us staying together.

From here on starts the college era. This was all just the post story fml I'm sorry if you're up to here...  
We attend our respective colleges on the terms of an open relationship. You know how it goes, parties, new people, etc. I am still in love with Milton and try to maintain our relationship but it is fucking hard. Milton is mia and doesn't even bother designating time out of his days to talk to me. He video calls me maybe once every two weeks and details me on his life at college. He glowed up and became a popular kid. His personality was always amazing but people only started realizing it in college. He tells me he's been hooking up with girls and I act like I'm okay when it secretly kills me. I tell him I haven't been hooking up with others, though I had plenty of opportunities to do so. I don't feel like relationships should be like this but I agreed to these terms. 

By the end of my college freshman year, our relationship is crumbling. Urged on by my suite mates, I eventually told him how I felt about the whole open relationship concept. Milton agreed that he had been an asshole and genuinely apologized for everything. Milton and I visited each other at college. When I visited Milton, he was incredibly busy so I ended up sitting in his dorm alone for a week. When Milton visited me, we barely did anything. When were physically apart, Milton rarely responded to my messages, though it got slightly better compared to the beginning of the school year. At this point, it is March (school years run from Sep-April I think). Two guys from school have outwardly expressed interest in me. I decided to initiate the break off with Milton and move on. It was painful, really painful but we mutually came to the conclusion that it would not work out. 

I chose to date one of the two guys from my school in the month following (let's call this guy Rob). The relationship was okay, but I realized early on that this ain't it. I couldn't bring myself to like Rob as much as I liked Milton. Though Rob had had his fair share with girls, he had never settled down for a relationship until I came along. Rob constantly showered me in affection, proclaiming that I was the love of his life and such. He also would get sad sometimes as he noticed this immense love was not reciprocated by me. I played the part of a good girlfriend and appreciated Rob's company and dedication, but deep down inside, I didn't realize i but I still missed Milton. Milton and I actually still talked as friends afterwards (I appreciate keeping exes as friends because they were friends before we dated too) especially since we maintained the same friend group. Rob was an alcoholic, like a raging alcoholic. He cheated once and I forgave him. When he told me, I don't think I was offended that he cheated on me. I was more offended that he told me that I was the absolute love of his life (he wasn't kidding about this, all his closest friends knew this too). It was very hypocritical. I stayed with Rob for his company at school but he continued to drink and do some awful stuff I won't mention. This man even continued to flirt in front of me with other girls yikes. I decided that I had had (wow this is the second time I used had had... crazy) enough and broke up with him once and for all. All my friends supported this decision LOL. Rob tried to get back together for months after but I wasn't having it (pat on the back). And this concluded the end of my sophomore year (Rob and I dated for almost a year, I think).

Did I mention, Milton and I were still talking? Milton was offended by how Rob treated me but the dynamic of our close friends is to make fun of each other a lot so it eventually turned into a joke. I quickly forgot about Rob... like really fucking quickly, and fell back in love with Milton. Milton previously introduced me to his friends at college in real life and in person and would always make an effort to include me. I heard from them that Milton always talked about me, even when we weren't together, and that though he made fun of me, he held me in high regards. Over the summer of sophomore/junior year, I visited Milton at college and we hooked up. It all felt the same as my high school days with him, chilling in bed watching anime and making shitty offensive jokes. Milton really wanted me to become acquainted with his close college friends and dragged me around to meet everyone. I don't think he does this often with other people. After I came back from that trip, a guy from my school confessed that he liked me (let's call him Tony). This guy was really sweet and madly in love, but I told him that I loved Milton for many years and couldn't get over it. Tony said okay, he'll wait. I told Milton that I loved him, Milton said that long distance wouldn't work out. I had an internship this summer, where I met one of Milton's close friends and got close to this friend. This friend told me that it wasn't a problem with me, it was because of Milton's mindset. Milton is very goal orientated and is focused on the things close to him. He puts his all into school to make himself and his family proud. The friend told me the only options would be to attend the school they were attending (not possible) or wait until college was over. I interpreted this as a chance. 

When the summer ended, I began hanging out more with Tony and eventually started dating Tony. Tony was like Rob, madly in love, but Tony was pure hearted and would never do anything to hurt anyone. It was then I realized how dependent of a person I was. Though I don't have trouble making friends, I'm an extroverted introvert. I enjoyed Tony's wholesome company. I still talked to Milton and realized that it was after we broke up that we started talking a lot more like how much we talked in high school. I felt awful but I told Milton how I felt about him again (while dating Tony). I told Milton that I would break up with Tony and try to make things work. I told Milton that over the course of these past four years, he was always my go to and I never thought about anyone else when I was alone. Milton told me he felt somewhat the same. We agreed that we had been each other's number one ever since we met, but I had the experience of dating and he hadn't. Milton said he was scared of dating because he was scared that he wouldn't be ""stepping up"" compared to our relationship. He's the kind of guy who always wants to be improving or moving up in the world. Milton once again said it wouldn't work out and I was devastated. I was disappointed in myself for using Tony like I used Rob as a cushion, and disappointed by the rejection. 

Milton has been recently pursuing this girl at his school. He got rejected and I can't help but feel happy about this. He consistently asked me for advice and I gave him real advice but felt awful while doing it. Milton definitely knew and was making an attempt to get me off. He told me this girl wasn't remarkable to him and paled in comparison to me but felt as though he wanted dating experience and physical affection. But he still got rejected uh oh.

Recently, we attended an event with our og group of friends and some other people. In a drugged up state, I told Milton that I was giving up on him and he said okay. On the car ride back, I somewhat fell asleep. I heard Milton telling our friends that I was a good girl and person. He told them that he wishes I would find happiness and he knows that I need someone to be emotionally there for me, because he knows he can't be. And here I am! Rambling about my feelings at 5:30 am. I said I would give up on Milton but I have been saying that for over a year now. I am trying to bring myself to like Tony more, as we still are dating, and see him for the good guy he is but I can't find myself compatible with him. No one really understands me as well as Milton does and I can't shake the fact that I've met my soulmate. If I let him go, I'll lose something one of a kind. When school starts again, I know that I will be diverging my mind again with Tony like I did with Rob by spending time with him. When I am dating during the school year, I actively avoid talking to Milton. It is only then that I can temporarily forget about him but I still end up thinking about him every night when I'm lying in bed. wat do :'0? Sorry this was so long.

TLDR: I've been in love with my high school boyfriend/ex for around four years now. I've dated other guys and had flings but nothing feels the same. I can't find new love and I can't move on. "

Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

a9obae,41,2018-12-26,My Best Friend Just Killed His Wife,rhonnie14,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/a9obae/my_best_friend_just_killed_his_wife/,"Christmas was getting closer. But I didn't care. Not me. Not Dr. Jimmy MacMurray. Okay, so maybe being Jewish kept me out of the Yuletide loop. But I understood the holiday. I mean shit, I'd dated plenty of women after all. Plenty of Christian women at that. 

And trust me, the girls I talked to... they were hot. Some were my nurses, some interns, but they were all *attracted* to me. I guess I had more than enough money to support myself. I lived in a nice home near a lake. I was like a Cordele, Georgia aristocrat.

And for a doctor, I was pretty damn friendly. And of course, my attractive looks and physique helped. I was only 35. To say I was a success with women (and sometimes men) would be an understatement. I was the Jewish Dr. McDreamy. Okay, maybe more Jeff Goldblum with my acerbic wit and huge glasses. Then again, my Lothario status was all part of my ""wild and crazy"" reputation. Not that I was a party animal by any means... I usually hid out in my rural fortress. With my ""conquests"" for company. Maybe once in awhile, I'd attend a hospital function or go to my buddy Danny's place.

Danny lived in the same neighborhood as me. Not because he was a doctor. He wasn't. Instead, his wife Janet owned a few businesses here in Cordele. Restaurants and clothing stores. Danny was a plumber. His wife the breadwinner. They'd only been married two years, but it may as well have been fifty considering how much they argued. Danny was five years my junior but looked about thirty years older. I suppose marriage could make you age in dog years. Especially when you were married to a mean-spirited bitch like Janet.

On the other hand, Janet was about ten years older than Danny. Much less attractive than Danny's All-American chiseled good looks as well. Her bleached-blonde hair like a bright wig adorned by a flea market mannequin. Janet's face nothing more than a permanent scowl. Without money, she wouldn't even garner crackwhore status... but with the Cordele cash, she was a ""catch."" What-the-fuck-ever. All I knew was her shitty attitude matched her looks.

The tragedy was Danny was a nice guy. Soft-spoken and chill. Kind eyes. But I could tell a suppressed rage made his face more haggard than it had any right to be at 30. His red hair was already starting to grey. All thank to his marriage, of course.

When I first moved in, Danny was the only neighbor who'd talk to me. The only one who was genuinely friendly. The rest of them were a bunch of stuck-up assholes. Including his cunt of a wife.

Like a refuge, Danny would party at my house from time to time. We'd watch the Braves and Noles. Drink beer, shoot the shit. We were a great pair. Call us a bromance. The jock and the brain. I gotta say in a long line of lifeless sex, the bond I had with Danny was a welcome catharsis. Like a jolt to my otherwise mundane routine. 

Of course, we'd always chill on nights when I didn't have a date. But Danny understood the drill. Whenever I'd alert him I had someone coming over, I could always see the longing in his ocean blue eyes. 

And then there where the times when the chain that was Janet would come yanking Danny back. Like the end of a movie or event you didn't wanna leave, Danny would always get sad anytime the fun was over. Anytime he had to head back to Janet's Lakeview Drive prison.

And tonight wasn't any different. Danny and me had stayed up watching a shitty Monday Night Football game. Both of us with a Miller Lite. Around ten, Janet came calling. Even standing from afar, I could hear that bitch's wail pierce through Danny's frightened ears.

""Bring your ass home now!"" she'd yell like an abusive stepmother.

Helpless, I could only watch Danny's shoulders slouch. See that dread hit his face. And essentially, witness the downfall of a man defeated by both his wife and life.

But tonight, Janet had good timing. One of our nursing interns was coming over to my place. And she was the one coming on strong to me... Her name was Emily. A beautiful blonde coed. She looked to be quite an athlete judging by how swift she grabbed my arm back in that hospital hallway. Talking about a tight grip...

Danny looked over at me, agitated. ""Hey, Jimmy, I gotta go, man!"" He jammed his phone in his pocket.

Like a neglected child, Danny just stared at me with those solemn eyes. I felt bad for him... but then again, Janet was a great excuse to get him out of here for my hot date.

""I understand, man,"" I said. Supportive, I draped my arm around Danny's shoulders. ""I'll walk you out.""

Still nursing our beer, we entered the kitchen. On the fridge, the souvenir magnets held up all my vacation photos. All the exotic locales. Each photo showed me with a different beautiful woman. Even some beautiful men. Hey, vacations were never fun alone!

Kitschy artwork and paintings decorated the kitchen walls. Not to mention all the weird figurines I'd collected from my travels. I was like the world's most eclectic art enthusiast... or maybe the weirdest one.

Danny and I headed over toward my front door. Along the way, we passed my walk-in freezer. A colossal freezer. Storage for frozen goods and beer. Amongst other cherished items.

I did my best to comfort Danny in his time of need. Like a ticking bomb though, his phone kept him on edge. Janet's barrage of angry texts, voicemails, and missed calls hit the man like bullets.

Trembling, Danny reached toward the walk-in freezer. ""Hey, let me get another beer-""

In a quick grab, I snatched his hand. ""Naw, I got it!""

""I just need one for the road."" Full of unease, Danny leaned against the counter.

Grinning, I opened the freezer door. ""I understand, bro.""

""She just keeps calling and calling..."" Danny bemoaned.

The freezer's cold air hit me like a blizzard. Persevering, I disappeared in there. So damn cold I felt like I'd entered an igloo. All for the sake of cheap booze.

""She said I was her little bitch,"" Danny continued spewing. ""That if I bit the hand that fed me, she'd skullfuck me and throw me out in the fucking street!""

Shivering, I stepped into the kitchen, closing the freezer door behind me. A fresh Miller Lite in my hand. ""You can't let her talk to you like that,"" I told Danny.

Like he was grabbing medicine, Danny snatched the beer. ""I've got no choice, man!"" He took a long swig. As if he were a Death Row prisoner savoring his final drink. ""Without her, I'm fucked. She has the money, the house is in her name.""

I clasped my hand on Danny's shoulder. ""You always got me, bro.""

With a weak laugh, Danny waved his longneck toward the fridge. ""Not when you're out with all them!""

Amused, I chuckled. ""Okay, so maybe not every night.""

""Naw, I appreciate it, man."" He clanged his beer into mine. ""I appreciate everything...""

Like two soldiers returning from the battlefield, we approached the front door. ""Aw, don't worry about it,"" I reassured him. ""Stay strong. You know how Janet is.""

""Yeah, and you don't! That bitch is crazy!""

Gripping his shoulder, I stopped us at the door. We looked at each other eye to eye. ""I know her type, man. She's scared, Danny."" I squeezed his shoulder. ""She's scared to lose you because you're better than her.""

Like an insecure teen, Danny chuckled. ""Oh, I don't-""

""You are, bro!"" I pointed the beer at him. ""You're better looking, you're smart. You're just a nice fucking guy. And yeah, you're cool as shit too.""

""Well, thanks...""

Like an alcoholic professor, I waved the beer at Danny's face. ""No, I mean it! Don't let her tell you otherwise, alright. You got power too, my man.""

Danny nodded.

""You fucking got this,"" I said. With that, I patted my boy on the back. ""Just don't let her bring you down! You're better than her!""

Okay, maybe I wasn't the best motivational speaker. Not this drunk anyway. But afterward, Danny left, and he left in far better shape than he was when Janet first ambushed his phone.

With Danny now gone, I got to work prepping for my date. I cleaned up our ""guy time"" mess in just a few minutes. And then after a change of clothes, I was ready for Emily to blow my mind...

And boy, did she! Emily was the best I had in awhile. And like a kid forced to leave DisneyWorld, I was sad when it was over. Emily gave me the kind of high high I hadn't had in awhile. Especially considering I'd been working so hard at the hospital lately... no one wanted to work the holidays. Except me for obvious reasons.

Now close to one A.M., I was home alone. And even drunker than before. I popped open another Miller Lite. The house's heater thawed me out from my latest freezer visit.

Taking a soothing sip, my eyes drifted over toward the living room. I was thinking of watching a cheap horror movie before going to bed.

But then a vibration shattered me from my stupor. I checked my phone and saw Danny's incoming call. Jesus! my drunken mind panicked. What if that bitch really had kicked him out! Maybe I should be glad I got done with Emily earlier after all...

Moving with intoxicated slow motion, I answered the call.

""Jimmy!"" Danny's shrill panic greeted me. His insistent voice helped sober me up. And keep me awake.

""Jimmy, I fucked up, man!"" Danny went on. Heavy breaths accompanied his ferocious unease. ""I did it, man... I fucking did it...""

""Whoa, chill-"" I started.

""No, listen to me!"" Danny interrupted. ""I killed her, Jimmy! I fucking killed her!""

Shocked horror hit me. Danny the gentle henpecked husband. The pussy-whipped prisoner... had he really killed Janet?

I heard Danny weeping like a beaten schoolchild. Pathetic sobbing more befitting a Lifetime movie than his morbid predicament.

""I tried talking to her like you said,"" Danny struggled through the tears. ""But she wouldn't stop... she got mad at me, man. She called me a bitch! She called me a fucking pussy like she always does! And she just kept yelling!""

""I know, bro,"" I said, my quiet unease the polar opposite of Danny's histrionics. ""Just tell me everything.""

Through the phone, Danny's sobbing only grew louder. ""She hit me and then I just... I just lost it, man. I couldn't stop!""

Biting my lip, I stared down at the floor. ""Danny, look.""

""I don't know what to do!""

""What do you mean?""

""The body!"" Danny yelled. His weeping became more unhinged. Like the cries of a helpless asylum inmate. ""I don't know. I need to just call the police-""

""Naw, you don't have to do that."" Behind intense eyes, I looked over toward the fridge. At all those vacation pics. At all the beautiful people. ""I'm here for you, Danny, alright,"" I said. And I meant every word.

Danny's heavy teardrops felt like they were seeping through the screen. ""Naw, man, I'm fucked..."" Danny finally muttered. ""I'm fucked...""

""No, you're not, Danny!"" My hand gripped the phone so tight, I thought I might crush the damn thing. ""Just hang in there, alright! We can figure this shit out!""

""You know how she is, man. She was always beating me, harassing me...""

""I know, bro."" My gaze drifted all around the kitchen. My heart pounded like a drum. Concern conquered me. ""Believe me. I know.""

Danny let out an exasperated sigh. ""I don't know. I don't know what to do to her... you're the only person I can talk to. You're my only fucking friend!""

""Ditto, man."" Worried, I paced around the room. My footsteps formed a frenetic rhythm. ""Listen, you think you can you clean up over there?""

Confused, Danny hesitated. ""What?""

My agitated hand slammed against the freezer. ""The blood and shit? Can you clean it up!""

""I mean yeah."" A nervous pause overtook Danny's dramatic sobs. ""Like what are you saying, Jimmy?""

Like I was grabbing Danny by the shirt collar, I held out my hands. My intense focus solely on him. ""I mean bring her ass over here. Then you go home and clean-""

""Jimmy-""

""Then you go home and clean all this shit up!"" I continued. ""You understand!""

All I got was silence.

""Goddammit, Danny!"" I yelled. ""This is serious fucking shit, alright! You'll fry if you don't-""

""Okay!"" Danny yelled in a quivering voice.

""Just bring that bitch here,"" I stated with cold authority.

""But what are you gonna-""

""I'll take care of it."" With that, I hung up right then and there. A tough love move, sure. But one that'd light a fire under my best friend's ass.

And sure enough, it did. Within fifteen minutes, Danny was banging on my door. 

Looking through a window, I saw Danny toting a rolled-up red rug. A long and heavy rug.

Ready for ""work,"" I placed my half-empty beer on the counter. I opened the door and let Danny in.

Straining, Danny struggled to carry that damn rug. Sweat covered his face and drenched his clothes like he'd just climbed out of a pool. His shirt was clawed and scratched. Scattered red stains ran all along his flesh. Somehow, his hair looked even grayer...

""Help me, Jimmy,"" Danny panted.

Like a co-pilot, I helped guide the rug down to the kitchen floor. A wet thud erupted upon impact.

""The bitch just lost it!"" Danny said.

I pulled my hands back and saw moist redness all over them. Nervous, I realized the crimson was from the rug. A redness that wasn't part of its design...

Panicking, Danny grabbed my arm. And now I could feel more of that redness sticking to my skin.

""She punched me, man!"" Danny yelled like a madman. ""She fucking slapped me like a little bitch!""

Simultaneously curious and terrified, my eyes drifted over to that rolled-up rug. Like an uneven road, large bumps protruded up throughout it.

""Then she punched me!"" Danny went on. His grip tightened on my arm in excitement. ""She kept fucking hitting me!""

My curiosity won out. I leaned down and unrolled the rug.

Even if I wasn't too surprised, the sight was still vicious. Like a twisted work of art... only the brutal artistry had been taken out on a human model.

There was Janet. For once, she was quiet and not bitching. For once, there was no scowl. Just a battered mask for a face. Her face caved in and split open as if her fucking fury had caused an earthquake to erupt throughout her skull. Her hair was now bleached red... and since the personality was gone, she actually looked more attractive dead than alive. 

""She wouldn't stop!"" I heard Danny's voice persist.

Yanking my arm, Danny made me look into his frenzied face.

""Please, you gotta believe me, man!"" Danny said. ""I had no choice!"" He motioned his trembling hand toward the splattered mess that was his wife's corpse. Her face resembled bug guts at this point. ""She hit me, and I just lost it! Everything just made me go crazy!"" His voice grew louder and more desperate like a news anchor determined to be believed. ""I couldn't stop! But she fucking hit me, Jimmy! She fucking hit me first!""

Keeping my cool, I just stared into Danny's eyes. Those ocean blues looked like they had a Category 5 hurricane blowing through them. ""So you're gonna say this was self-defense,"" I said in a dry tone.

Danny reached toward my face. ""Goddammit, Jimmy! Just listen to me!""

In a quick flash, I grabbed Danny by the shoulders. A tight harness of a grip.

""Shit, man..."" Danny muttered. Startled, he looked right at me. Stunned by The Brain's strength... then again, most people were.

""I heard you, alright!"" I hurled at Danny. My voice strong and steady. Nothing like his panicky whines. ""But none of that shit's gonna fly, Danny!""

Faint tears slid down Danny's cheeks. He couldn't say a word.

I tightened my grip on him. ""But you're gonna be alright. 

You're gonna be fine. I can get you out of this, you just gotta listen to me, okay, buddy?""

Danny's tears accelerated. Pathetic tears.

Frustrated, I slapped him harder than Janet ever had.

""Aw, fuck!"" Danny cried.

I shook him silly. ""Do you fucking understand me?""

Nervous, Danny stared into my eyes as if he were facing a drill sergeant. ""Yes!""

""Now I get it, man. I know Janet was a fucking nightmare, but this is serious shit, Danny!"" Supportive, I wiped away Danny's tears. ""But as long as you listen to me, you'll be okay. I got you.""

Trembling, Danny looked over at Janet. At her gory remnants of a face. No longer crying, Danny's eyes became hollow. ""What do I have to do?""

I caressed Danny's cheek, making him look right at me. No homo. Not at this moment, for sure! ""Without a body, they can't get you,"" I reassured him. ""That's the key.""

""So what...""

Full of conviction, I waved toward Janet. ""I'll hide the body!""

Danny hesitated. ""But how, why-""

I snatched Danny's shoulder in a harsh grip. ""I'll take care of it, Goddammit!"" Intense, I shoved Danny back toward the door. ""You just clean that shit at your house! Clean it up good, okay!""

Trying to suppress his panic, Danny just looked at me. ""Okay. Clean that shit up...""

""Now, Danny!"" I barked, channeling my inner R. Lee Ermey.

At my command, Danny stumbled to the door. ""Alright!""

As Danny reached for the knob, I grabbed his arm.

Turning, Danny faced me.

""Just remember, I got your back,"" I comforted Danny. ""Just remember that.""

All he did was give me a rattled nod.

""I know Janet treated you like shit,"" I continued. Supportive, I rubbed Danny's shoulder. ""You'll be okay. Just do what I say, bro.""

Danny stared right at me.

In his eyes, I saw that hurricane go down a notch. Maybe a Category 3 instead of the fucking disaster I saw earlier.

""Thanks, man,"" Danny said. ""Thank you, Jimmy...""

Eager to get him out of there, I held the door open for Danny. ""Alright, call me when you get done.""

""Okay.""

From the doorway, I watched Danny go out into the dark night. Straight to his truck. 

The cold wind blew against me, but I didn't shiver. I felt numb from the frigid temperature at this point. And I had the house to warm me up anyway. Not to mention my burgeoning adrenaline.

I stepped back inside. My harsh gaze focused on Janet's obliterated remains. Her flesh and mushy brain pieces stuck to the rug like they were forming a morbid pattern. At least, I'd no longer have to hear her putdowns or constant complaints. And neither would Danny as long as he did what I told him. As long as he played his cards right, he'd be okay. At the very least, Janet's body would be well taken care of.

My eyes shifted over toward the walk-in freezer. I was already prepared to deal with its bitter cold air. Of course, Danny owed me big time for this... but that's what friends are for. He's a pretty cool dude after all.

Using my immense strength, I grabbed the carpeted corpse. Like I was holding a bride, I carried Janet's body toward the freezer. To her ultimate resting spot.

The bitter cold greeted me. I was back in the igloo. But I didn't slow down. 

I carried the rug all the way to the back of the freezer. Well past the frozen goods and crates of beer. A ten foot journey through the eye of this ice storm. One I was all too familiar with.

I reached the very back. Two operating tables lurked before me. Nearby, an instrument tray full of scalpels and knives awaited my cold touch. My large coat rested beside the utensils. Like a predator in its natural habitat, I was back in my territory. Only this freezer wasn't for saving lives...

Behind the tables, naked bodies swung on several meathooks. Some were women, some were men. All of them were oh so beautiful. And all the bodies were even more beautiful once I got through with them.

Incisions hacked up their cold necks and chests. Crude dissections ran all over their bodies. Sloppy stitches could barely piece together those vicious slices. Like a mad scientist, I'd had a field day working overtime.

I laid the rug out on one of the operating tables. The other table already had a blonde on it. Her eyeballs dangled out of their sockets. Like plastic surgery gone awry, most of Emily's face had been flayed earlier. By my precise touch, of course.  

Ready for the late-night fun, I slipped on the huge coat. Not that I needed it. I'd gotten used to the cold after all these visits... especially when I had the adrenaline to keep me warm. And the warm, hot bloodlust stirring in my soul.

Armed with a deranged grin, I placed my phone on the tray. Tonight, I was gonna put on a little Christmas music.

The Beach Boys's ""Little Saint Nick"" began echoing through the freezer. The track a change of pace for me... but I couldn't resist. After all, the soundtrack matched the season... and my own frigid operating room.

I grabbed the largest scalpel. And there in the cold, I turned my hungry eyes over toward Janet. She never looked better. And by the time I got through with her, she may even be beautiful."

""You fucking got this,"" I said. With that, I patted my boy on the back. ""Just don't let her bring you down! You're better than her!""

Okay, maybe I wasn't the best motivational speaker. Not this drunk anyway. But afterward, Danny left, and he left in far better shape than he was when Janet first ambushed his phone.

With Danny now gone, I got to work prepping for my date. I cleaned up our ""guy time"" mess in just a few minutes. And then after a change of clothes, I was ready for Emily to blow my mind...

And boy, did she! Emily was the best I had in awhile. And like a kid forced to leave DisneyWorld, I was sad when it was over. Emily gave me the kind of high high I hadn't had in awhile. Especially considering I'd been working so hard at the hospital lately... no one wanted to work the holidays. Except me for obvious reasons.

Now close to one A.M., I was home alone. And even drunker than before. I popped open another Miller Lite. The house's heater thawed me out from my latest freezer visit.

Taking a soothing sip, my eyes drifted over toward the living room. I was thinking of watching a cheap horror movie before going to bed.

But then a vibration shattered me from my stupor. I checked my phone and saw Danny's incoming call. Jesus! my drunken mind panicked. What if that bitch really had kicked him out! Maybe I should be glad I got done with Emily earlier after all...

Moving with intoxicated slow motion, I answered the call.

""Jimmy!"" Danny's shrill panic greeted me. His insistent voice helped sober me up. And keep me awake.

""Jimmy, I fucked up, man!"" Danny went on. Heavy breaths accompanied his ferocious unease. ""I did it, man... I fucking did it...""

""Whoa, chill-"" I started.

""No, listen to me!"" Danny interrupted. ""I killed her, Jimmy! I fucking killed her!""

Shocked horror hit me. Danny the gentle henpecked husband. The pussy-whipped prisoner... had he really killed Janet?

I heard Danny weeping like a beaten schoolchild. Pathetic sobbing more befitting a Lifetime movie than his morbid predicament.

""I tried talking to her like you said,"" Danny struggled through the tears. ""But she wouldn't stop... she got mad at me, man. She called me a bitch! She called me a fucking pussy like she always does! And she just kept yelling!""

""I know, bro,"" I said, my quiet unease the polar opposite of Danny's histrionics. ""Just tell me everything.""

Through the phone, Danny's sobbing only grew louder. ""She hit me and then I just... I just lost it, man. I couldn't stop!""

Biting my lip, I stared down at the floor. ""Danny, look.""

""I don't know what to do!""

""What do you mean?""

""The body!"" Danny yelled. His weeping became more unhinged. Like the cries of a helpless asylum inmate. ""I don't know. I need to just call the police-""

""Naw, you don't have to do that."" Behind intense eyes, I looked over toward the fridge. At all those vacation pics. At all the beautiful people. ""I'm here for you, Danny, alright,"" I said. And I meant every word.

Danny's heavy teardrops felt like they were seeping through the screen. ""Naw, man, I'm fucked..."" Danny finally muttered. ""I'm fucked...""

""No, you're not, Danny!"" My hand gripped the phone so tight, I thought I might crush the damn thing. ""Just hang in there, alright! We can figure this shit out!""

""You know how she is, man. She was always beating me, harassing me...""

""I know, bro."" My gaze drifted all around the kitchen. My heart pounded like a drum. Concern conquered me. ""Believe me. I know.""

Danny let out an exasperated sigh. ""I don't know. I don't know what to do to her... you're the only person I can talk to. You're my only fucking friend!""

""Ditto, man."" Worried, I paced around the room. My footsteps formed a frenetic rhythm. ""Listen, you think you can you clean up over there?""

Confused, Danny hesitated. ""What?""

My agitated hand slammed against the freezer. ""The blood and shit? Can you clean it up!""

""I mean yeah."" A nervous pause overtook Danny's dramatic sobs. ""Like what are you saying, Jimmy?""

Like I was grabbing Danny by the shirt collar, I held out my hands. My intense focus solely on him. ""I mean bring her ass over here. Then you go home and clean-""

""Jimmy-""

""Then you go home and clean all this shit up!"" I continued. ""You understand!""

All I got was silence.

""Goddammit, Danny!"" I yelled. ""This is serious fucking shit, alright! You'll fry if you don't-""

""Okay!"" Danny yelled in a quivering voice.

""Just bring that bitch here,"" I stated with cold authority.

""But what are you gonna-""

""I'll take care of it."" With that, I hung up right then and there. A tough love move, sure. But one that'd light a fire under my best friend's ass.

And sure enough, it did. Within fifteen minutes, Danny was banging on my door. 

Looking through a window, I saw Danny toting a rolled-up red rug. A long and heavy rug.

Ready for ""work,"" I placed my half-empty beer on the counter. I opened the door and let Danny in.

Straining, Danny struggled to carry that damn rug. Sweat covered his face and drenched his clothes like he'd just climbed out of a pool. His shirt was clawed and scratched. Scattered red stains ran all along his flesh. Somehow, his hair looked even grayer...

""Help me, Jimmy,"" Danny panted.

Like a co-pilot, I helped guide the rug down to the kitchen floor. A wet thud erupted upon impact.

""The bitch just lost it!"" Danny said.

I pulled my hands back and saw moist redness all over them. Nervous, I realized the crimson was from the rug. A redness that wasn't part of its design...

Panicking, Danny grabbed my arm. And now I could feel more of that redness sticking to my skin.

""She punched me, man!"" Danny yelled like a madman. ""She fucking slapped me like a little bitch!""

Simultaneously curious and terrified, my eyes drifted over to that rolled-up rug. Like an uneven road, large bumps protruded up throughout it.

""Then she punched me!"" Danny went on. His grip tightened on my arm in excitement. ""She kept fucking hitting me!""

My curiosity won out. I leaned down and unrolled the rug.

Even if I wasn't too surprised, the sight was still vicious. Like a twisted work of art... only the brutal artistry had been taken out on a human model.

There was Janet. For once, she was quiet and not bitching. For once, there was no scowl. Just a battered mask for a face. Her face caved in and split open as if her fucking fury had caused an earthquake to erupt throughout her skull. Her hair was now bleached red... and since the personality was gone, she actually looked more attractive dead than alive. 

""She wouldn't stop!"" I heard Danny's voice persist.

Yanking my arm, Danny made me look into his frenzied face.

""Please, you gotta believe me, man!"" Danny said. ""I had no choice!"" He motioned his trembling hand toward the splattered mess that was his wife's corpse. Her face resembled bug guts at this point. ""She hit me, and I just lost it! Everything just made me go crazy!"" His voice grew louder and more desperate like a news anchor determined to be believed. ""I couldn't stop! But she fucking hit me, Jimmy! She fucking hit me first!""

Keeping my cool, I just stared into Danny's eyes. Those ocean blues looked like they had a Category 5 hurricane blowing through them. ""So you're gonna say this was self-defense,"" I said in a dry tone.

Danny reached toward my face. ""Goddammit, Jimmy! Just listen to me!""

In a quick flash, I grabbed Danny by the shoulders. A tight harness of a grip.

""Shit, man..."" Danny muttered. Startled, he looked right at me. Stunned by The Brain's strength... then again, most people were.

""I heard you, alright!"" I hurled at Danny. My voice strong and steady. Nothing like his panicky whines. ""But none of that shit's gonna fly, Danny!""

Faint tears slid down Danny's cheeks. He couldn't say a word.

I tightened my grip on him. ""But you're gonna be alright. 

You're gonna be fine. I can get you out of this, you just gotta listen to me, okay, buddy?""

Danny's tears accelerated. Pathetic tears.

Frustrated, I slapped him harder than Janet ever had.

""Aw, fuck!"" Danny cried.

I shook him silly. ""Do you fucking understand me?""

Nervous, Danny stared into my eyes as if he were facing a drill sergeant. ""Yes!""

""Now I get it, man. I know Janet was a fucking nightmare, but this is serious shit, Danny!"" Supportive, I wiped away Danny's tears. ""But as long as you listen to me, you'll be okay. I got you.""

Trembling, Danny looked over at Janet. At her gory remnants of a face. No longer crying, Danny's eyes became hollow. ""What do I have to do?""

I caressed Danny's cheek, making him look right at me. No homo. Not at this moment, for sure! ""Without a body, they can't get you,"" I reassured him. ""That's the key.""

""So what...""

Full of conviction, I waved toward Janet. ""I'll hide the body!""

Danny hesitated. ""But how, why-""

I snatched Danny's shoulder in a harsh grip. ""I'll take care of it, Goddammit!"" Intense, I shoved Danny back toward the door. ""You just clean that shit at your house! Clean it up good, okay!""

Trying to suppress his panic, Danny just looked at me. ""Okay. Clean that shit up...""

""Now, Danny!"" I barked, channeling my inner R. Lee Ermey.

At my command, Danny stumbled to the door. ""Alright!""

As Danny reached for the knob, I grabbed his arm.

Turning, Danny faced me.

""Just remember, I got your back,"" I comforted Danny. ""Just remember that.""

All he did was give me a rattled nod.

""I know Janet treated you like shit,"" I continued. Supportive, I rubbed Danny's shoulder. ""You'll be okay. Just do what I say, bro.""

Danny stared right at me.

In his eyes, I saw that hurricane go down a notch. Maybe a Category 3 instead of the fucking disaster I saw earlier.

""Thanks, man,"" Danny said. ""Thank you, Jimmy...""

Eager to get him out of there, I held the door open for Danny. ""Alright, call me when you get done.""

""Okay.""

From the doorway, I watched Danny go out into the dark night. Straight to his truck. 

The cold wind blew against me, but I didn't shiver. I felt numb from the frigid temperature at this point. And I had the house to warm me up anyway. Not to mention my burgeoning adrenaline.

I stepped back inside. My harsh gaze focused on Janet's obliterated remains. Her flesh and mushy brain pieces stuck to the rug like they were forming a morbid pattern. At least, I'd no longer have to hear her putdowns or constant complaints. And neither would Danny as long as he did what I told him. As long as he played his cards right, he'd be okay. At the very least, Janet's body would be well taken care of.

My eyes shifted over toward the walk-in freezer. I was already prepared to deal with its bitter cold air. Of course, Danny owed me big time for this... but that's what friends are for. He's a pretty cool dude after all.

Using my immense strength, I grabbed the carpeted corpse. Like I was holding a bride, I carried Janet's body toward the freezer. To her ultimate resting spot.

The bitter cold greeted me. I was back in the igloo. But I didn't slow down. 

I carried the rug all the way to the back of the freezer. Well past the frozen goods and crates of beer. A ten foot journey through the eye of this ice storm. One I was all too familiar with.

I reached the very back. Two operating tables lurked before me. Nearby, an instrument tray full of scalpels and knives awaited my cold touch. My large coat rested beside the utensils. Like a predator in its natural habitat, I was back in my territory. Only this freezer wasn't for saving lives...

Behind the tables, naked bodies swung on several meathooks. Some were women, some were men. All of them were oh so beautiful. And all the bodies were even more beautiful once I got through with them.

Incisions hacked up their cold necks and chests. Crude dissections ran all over their bodies. Sloppy stitches could barely piece together those vicious slices. Like a mad scientist, I'd had a field day working overtime.

I laid the rug out on one of the operating tables. The other table already had a blonde on it. Her eyeballs dangled out of their sockets. Like plastic surgery gone awry, most of Emily's face had been flayed earlier. By my precise touch, of course.  

Ready for the late-night fun, I slipped on the huge coat. Not that I needed it. I'd gotten used to the cold after all these visits... especially when I had the adrenaline to keep me warm. And the warm, hot bloodlust stirring in my soul.

Armed with a deranged grin, I placed my phone on the tray. Tonight, I was gonna put on a little Christmas music.

The Beach Boys's ""Little Saint Nick"" began echoing through the freezer. The track a change of pace for me... but I couldn't resist. After all, the soundtrack matched the season... and my own frigid operating room.

I grabbed the largest scalpel. And there in the cold, I turned my hungry eyes over toward Janet. She never looked better. And by the time I got through with her, she may even be beautiful."
a9ogs7,23,2018-12-26,My straight friend started the day wishing me happy holidays...,straightfriendcrush,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/a9ogs7/my_straight_friend_started_the_day_wishing_me/,"Hello, fellow gaybros.

Almost two years ago, I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5m2ijh/yet_another_crushonastraightguy_post/) post, detailing my crush on my straight (ex) friend. You can read more about my feelings for him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/8jae9n/all_of_a_sudden_i_miss_everyone/?st=jq4f8d7p&amp;sh=51f37b67) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/8tnvj1/how_do_you_deal_with_unresolved_feelings_itt_in/?st=jq4feecl&amp;sh=0f41fbfd), but really, all you need to know is that we met in college, he went out of his way to gain my friendship, we started into the same internship, then he forced me to come out, then didn't spoke to me for a while, then we were friends again, then he got this girlfriend and she didn't like us, so he dumped me and the rest of our friends, then broke up with her and we got back together, then got back with her and ignored me again, then we got back just in time to get access to the notes of my smartest frien, then we had a huge fight because he was being a little shit and I thought that was the last of him in my life, but he contacted me earlier this year to ask for a favour (which I didn't do)... until Christmas.


I woke up very late today, so I knew I'd have a bunch of messages wishing me happy christmas and etc. But honestly seeing his just made my heart and stomach sunk so low. He started with his usual ""oh I know you must hate me still"" (even though I never said I hated him, just couldn't care to be his friend anymore) but that he really wanted to wish me a merry christmas and stuff. I thought about just ignoring him but I wasn't gonna be the asshole to ignore someone on Christmas. He didn't have any other friends other than me when we were friends, despite being highly social and quite needy. So I just replied, being casual so he didn't think I was being cold, but it was like a professional message - something I would be comfortable sending to the lady who works on the other side of the building. 


That didn't stop it from developing into a conversation, even though I was really trying to cut it. I was not giving him any details of my current life nor anything, but at some point, he just went 'can I tell you something?'. I thought about ignoring it and honestly, I should have. But no, I said sure. Then he proceeded to remind me of some stuff and tell that a lot of stuff he did to me wasn't very nice and that he doesn't know how or why I put up with so much stuff, but that he was very sorry. He then went on about how he is seeing a therapist and that so much stuff that he did was because he couldn't bear the thought of 'liking' me. 


I asked him what 'liking' meant. He told me that 'he didn't think he wanted to be just friends with me at some point', but that he was able to manage because he was straight and I was straight and nothing could ever happen... until he got suspicious that I was not straight and forced me to confirm. He said that from the point he just dwelled upon it, sometimes hating me completely and wanting to cut me open and other times not being able to think about anything other than holding me. 


He said everything he did, from getting a girlfriend that would make him go away from me and refusing to go to my/our graduation party because he couldn't meet my family was because of all this mess. 


This is all so fucked up. I don't think he knows I loved him, or how much he actually hurt me doing these things, but I am now so angry. I pressed him on why he would do these things and he just said that he's straight and that his family wouldn't never accept it and that he couldn't bear the thought of someone knowing he thought about 'another guy'. 


I don't think I like him anymore or want him in my life but I also can't help but remember his voice and those eyes looking at me and how warm his touch feels. I don't even know what to reply. I couldn't ever give him the satisfaction of telling him that I liked him too. I don't think this is worth trying, even to be his friend again. I guess I don't have a specific answer and kinda just wanted to rant a bit. "
a9p8gs,22,2018-12-26,Career Counselor?,abigdumbrocket,philadelphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/a9p8gs/career_counselor/,"I've been struggling financially since I finished college in 2010. I've whittled my goals down to: live in a safe neighborhood, buy groceries, maintain health insurance. I haven't ever managed all three and after being robbed and assaulted and being in a concussed stupor for a month (the scariest twenty-some days of my life) I moved back in with my dad. This is driving me insane and making day to day life really hard. He's a really great guy and completely supportive but he's old and not all there and I feel so ashamed and sick with myself for being a 33-year-old living at home. I went back to school at the community college and have been holding on to a 4.0 GPA in their biology program and am completing an internship at a cancer research center this summer, but job prospects for a biotechnician in terms of salary are about on par with what I made when I worked as a housekeeper or laborer. It's less than what I made when I worked as a house painter, but it's more stressful because you always have a PhD or MD who has dedicated his life to research and expects you to do the same. I keep applying to job postings for an administrative assistant, library service associate, I've even tried to find cleaning work again or retail work, but I haven't had an interview in over a year. I work hard, I'm reasonably smart, I'm never late or take days off, professors all say they'd gladly recommend me to any employer, but I can't figure out how to make it work. It feels like 35, 40k a year would be more than I would know what to do with. Right now I tutor calculus at the community college for $7.50/hr. They are clearly taking advantage of me, but it's all I have right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing all this not because I'm looking for a quick answer for how to fix my life. I need to find someone who can help me out of this mess. Which is why I'm asking if anyone has any positive experience with a career counselor in the Philadelphia area. Is there anyone here who was chronically underemployed but managed to find a way out with a professional's help?"
a9pfhc,392,2018-12-26,Christmas Eve Fuck with the College Intern,winco92,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/a9pfhc/christmas_eve_fuck_with_the_college_intern/,"You guys liked my [college intern](https://old.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8tcjmp/gonna_be_a_good_summer_got_fucked_by_a_19_year/) stories of the summer intern that [fucked me in the office](https://old.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/978a98/getting_fucked_in_the_office_by_the_college_intern/), that I [taught how to eat ass](https://old.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/94t784/teaching_the_intern_how_to_eat_ass/), and [who shared me with one of his friends](https://old.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/97j53l/the_college_intern_shared_me_with_one_of_his/). I didn't hear from him through the entire semester and last week I got a ""hey"" text. He was going to his aunt's and uncle's for Christmas Eve with his family and wanted to know if I was going to be in town. I told him I was driving to my parents at 2pm on Christmas Eve, so if he is in town before then he should come over. He said he would make up some excuse to get out of family time and come see me but we would have to be really quick. My dick got hard remembering how selfish of a top he is and how hot that is. He's 19 or maybe 20 now with buzzed blonde hair and looks like a frat bro. I'm 25, blonde and have some muscle on me from working out a lot since the spring. I'm on prep which is good as I have never used a condom with this guy.  

On Christmas Eve I woke up with a little bit of a hangover, and went to the gym to work it off. Thirty minutes into my set I got a text from him saying that his aunt told him to go get cranberry sauce, and he asked me if I could pick some up and meet him at my apartment in an hour. I immediately got hard and cut short my workout. The grocery store was a mess with last minute shoppers but I got in and out real quick and then got home and showered and fully clean for him.  

About an hour later, the college intern knocked on my door and I opened it just wearing a jockstrap and holding the bag with his cranberry sauce. He was completely bundled up in winter clothes but took off his boots, jacket and all his clothes just in the hallway in under a minute. He told me that he had 20 minutes and that he hadn't cum in three days and needed to unload. He took me right back to the bedroom bent me over and started to eat out my hole. He has gotten much better at rimming since this summer so I figure some lucky guy at his college is letting him practice. After just a minute I was opened up and his tongue left my hole and I heard the lube bottle open up. I could feel his familiar six inch dick against my hole. I took a deep breath and he went all the way in and told me he missed my hole. It only took just ten thrusts for him to blow his first load into me. It was a fucking huge load and I felt my hole warm up. I was rock hard.    

He pulled his cummy dick out of my ass and told me to go missionary and I got on my back on the bed and he slid his still-hard dick right into me. He told me that he needed to load me up with as much of his cum as I he could and that he was going to cum in me three times today. He fucked hard and like a machine into me. His muscular body had a small layer of sweat on it. We kissed some but he was really just focused on fucking my hole going almost all the way in and out. Just a few minutes later he started fucking really hard and told me to ask for his load. I started telling him how much my hole missed his cock and that I needed to get loaded up by him again. He slammed all the way in and came a second time in under ten minutes. We both were breathing really hard and he just gave that cute smile at me that a guy makes after he's cum.    

We started kissing with him still in me and I asked if he could really get a third load out. He told me if I was a good boy and begged for his load that he should be able to. He pulled his dick out and it was covered in cum. I got cleaned up real good before he came over so I got on my hands and knees and started sucking his cummy dick. I had never done ass to mouth with him and he immediately got hard again and told me that no one had ever done that to him. I sucked him for just a little longer before he told me to get on my stomach. I tried to get to my dick and stroke myself but he told me to just focus on getting him off. His dick slid right back into me, real easy this time as I had been fucked really hard and was filled with his cum. He fucked rough and pushed his hand down on my back and told me to beg for his load. I kept backing my ass back up into him to meet his thrusts. I grabbed the poppers and took a couple of deep hits and now was just lost in the fuck. He kept whispering into my ear what a cumslut I was and that he fucked a ton of cum into my hole all summer.   

I kept fucking back on him and we got into a good rhythm as I could feel his sweaty body on my back. The room smelled of cum and I could just hear the rhythms of his balls slapping against my ass as he was fucking into me. He grabbed the back of my neck and told me that he was going to fuck his third load into me and I begged him for it. He let out that familiar groan and his body tensed up and then collapsed onto me. My hole had been so destroyed by his dick that I didn't feel the third load at all but I knew he had bred me again.  

He looked at the his watch while still in me and said he had to go and so he pulled out and went to the bathroom to wash off. I wanted to jerk off right then but knew I should show him out so I stood up and went into the living room. Having been fucked hard for the last 20 minutes with three loads in my hole, I could feel some of his cum running down my leg. He came out of the bathroom, got on his clothes, took the cranberry sauce, said thanks and headed home to Christmas Eve dinner.  "
a9pq5t,1,2018-12-26,What's the best way to manage a Gen Z employee?,frustratedwithgenz,u_frustratedwithgenz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_frustratedwithgenz/comments/a9pq5t/whats_the_best_way_to_manage_a_gen_z_employee/,"I run marketing for a large hotel. I just started the job. I inherited a new employee, Marketing Supervisor, who is 22-23 and just graduated with a business degree from a mid-sized liberal arts school. FWIW, he had OK grades and had an internship doing almost exactly the same role at a large hotel which is likely how he got the job. He makes $50K which is a REALLY good salary for that position in this industry in this market so the expectations are very high.

&amp;#x200B;

So, at any rate, I've really been struggling with how best to manage him as I've never directly managed someone that age before.  Nothing I'm doing is working so I am was curious as to your opinion as the best way to handle this situation. Am I managing him correctly (I try to be very sensitive to each of my employees' needs as a manager) or maybe I just have a bad employee?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some examples:

&amp;#x200B;

1. There were complaints of him not being on time. Previous person didn't believe in schedules as we are all professionals so come and go as you please. Typically everyone is here between 8:30 - 9 and leaves at 5-5:30 he's routinely here between 9:30 - 10 and leaves at 5:01. So, I put together a schedule that clearly says 9-5:30. No change in his schedule. 
2. Routinely misses meetings or is late, especially early morning ones (e.g., 9 am). I've had direct discussions with him. He has a work-issued phone. 
3. Has no intellectual curiosity. 
   1. We had a small giveaway which he was put in charge of. It was very clear it was his responsibility. It was at 6 on a Saturday night. As I was new, it wasn't my expectation that I needed to supervise this event but I needed to be there anyways for goodwill. Well 5:30 rolls around and no sign of him and no sign that any of the prep work for the giveaway had been done (probably 2 hours work of work). So I freaked out and rushed around to do all of the prep work. He shows up at 6. He knew the drawing was at 6 and he knew that the various entry points for the drawing were throughout the hotel and needed to be collected so not sure how he expected for that all of that to happen when he showed up at 6. 
   2. I told him to deliver a small Christmas tree to one of our hotels because they don't have one yet because they're new. He waited until the last minute then the manager called me and said ""where are the decorations?"". No, I didn't specifically say ""trees and decorations"" but I would think that if you're delivering the tree because the hotel is new and they don't have one, one might ask if there are decorations.  
4. Will not complete any task without a deadline. Put him in charge of making sure all marketing collateral is up-to-date around the property. For example, it's no longer Christmas so there shouldn't be anything on the property that references Christmas on it beginning today. Well obviously that takes some planning to understand where all of the collateral is, what is on it, when it expires, and what should go in its place. There's no deadline because it's an ongoing responsibility. I even gave him a template I've used in a previous life. Over a week where I had an explicit conversation with him about these duties, there still is outdated collateral on property (not talking about Christmas stuff). 
5. No attention to detail - We have a courier service that delivers things among all of the sister properties. It was his responsibility to make sure some things for a new campaign were delivered by a certain date. It is also known that the courier is unreliable (something we're working on). He put the things in the courier's box and never followed up. Well the courier dropped the ball so because we didn't follow-up with either the courier or the sister property we were very behind the 8-ball.  I've since coached him and said it's ultimately on you, not the courier so you have to own this even if it means you have to drive around yourself until the courier situation is fixed. 
6. No communication. He came to me and said  he felt a little lost and without direction when I first started. So I've been over-communicating and encouraged him to as well. There's no stupid question. There's still very little proactive communication from him (despite the above) and I have to drag it out of him. 

At any rate - I know everyone and every generation likes/needs to be managed  in a different way (and I've never directly managed a Gen Z before), so before I just chalk this stuff up to just not being a good employee I wanted to get everyone's opinion on the situation. "

But I didn't care. Not me. Not Dr. Jimmy MacMurray. Okay, so maybe being Jewish kept me out of the Yuletide loop. But I understood the holiday. I mean shit, I'd dated plenty of women after all. Plenty of Christian women at that.

And trust me, the girls I talked to... they were hot. Some were my nurses, some interns, but they were all attracted to me. I guess I had more than enough money to support myself. I lived in a nice home near a lake. I was like a Cordele, Georgia aristocrat.

And for a doctor, I was pretty damn friendly. And of course, my attractive looks and physique helped. I was only 35. To say I was a success with women (and sometimes men) would be an understatement. I was the Jewish Dr. McDreamy. Okay, maybe more Jeff Goldblum with my acerbic wit and huge glasses. Then again, my Lothario status was all part of my ""wild and crazy"" reputation. Not that I was a party animal by any means... I usually hid out in my rural fortress. Maybe once in awhile, I'd attend a hospital function or go to my buddy Danny's place.

Danny lived in the same neighborhood as me. Not because he was a doctor. He wasn't. Instead, his wife Janet owned a few businesses here in Cordele. Restaurants and clothing stores. Danny was a plumber. His wife the breadwinner. They'd only been married two years, but it may as well have been fifty considering how much they argued. Danny was five years my junior but looked about thirty years older. I suppose marriage could make you age in dog years. Especially when you were married to a mean-spirited bitch like Janet.

On the other hand, Janet was about ten years older than Danny. Much less attractive than Danny's All-American chiseled good looks as well. Her bleached-blonde hair like a bright wig adorned by a flea market mannequin. Janet's face nothing more than a permanent scowl. Without money, she wouldn't even garner crackwhore status... but with the Cordele cash, she was a ""catch."" What-the-fuck-ever. All I knew was her shitty attitude matched her looks.

The tragedy was Danny was a nice guy. Soft-spoken and chill. Kind eyes. But I could tell a suppressed rage made his face more haggard than it had any right to be at 30. His red hair was already starting to grey. All thank to his marriage, of course.

Like a refuge, Danny would party at my house from time to time. We'd watch the Braves and Noles. Drink beer, shoot the shit. We were a great pair. Call us a bromance. The jock and the brain. I gotta say in a long line of lifeless sex, the bond I had with Danny was a welcome catharsis. Like a jolt to my otherwise mundane routine.

Of course, we'd always chill on nights when I didn't have a date. But Danny understood the drill. Whenever I'd alert him I had someone coming over, I could always see the longing in his ocean blue eyes.

And then there where the times when the chain that was Janet would come yanking Danny back. And tonight was no different. Danny and me had stayed up watching a shitty Monday Night Football game. Both of us with a Miller Lite. Around ten, Janet came calling. Even standing from afar, I could hear that bitch's wail pierce through Danny's frightened ears.

""Bring your ass home now!"" she'd yell like an abusive stepmother.

Helpless, I could only watch Danny's shoulders slouch. See that dread hit his face. And essentially, witness the downfall of a man defeated by both his wife and life.

But tonight, Janet had good timing. One of our nursing interns was coming over to my place. And she was the one coming on strong to me... Her name was Emily. A beautiful blonde coed.

Danny looked over at me, agitated. ""Hey, Jimmy, I gotta go, man!"" He jammed his phone in his pocket.

""I understand, man,"" I said. Supportive, I draped my arm around Danny's shoulders. ""I'll walk you out.""

Still nursing our beer, we entered the kitchen. On the fridge, the souvenir magnets held up all my vacation photos. All the exotic locales. Each photo showed me with a different beautiful woman. Even some beautiful men. Hey, vacations were never fun alone!

Kitschy artwork and paintings decorated the kitchen walls. Not to mention all the weird figurines I'd collected from my travels. I was like the world's most eclectic art enthusiast... or maybe the weirdest one.

Danny and I headed over toward my front door. Along the way, we passed my walk-in freezer. A colossal freezer. Storage for frozen goods and beer. Amongst other cherished items.

I did my best to comfort Danny in his time of need. Like a ticking bomb though, his phone kept him on edge. Janet's barrage of angry texts, voicemails, and missed calls hit the man like bullets.

Trembling, Danny reached toward the walk-in freezer. ""Hey, let me get another beer-""

In a quick grab, I snatched his hand. ""Naw, I got it!""

""I just need one for the road."" Full of unease, Danny leaned against the counter.

Grinning, I opened the freezer door. ""I understand, bro.""

""She just keeps calling and calling..."" Danny bemoaned.

The freezer's cold air hit me like a blizzard. Persevering, I disappeared in there. So damn cold I felt like I'd entered an igloo. All for the sake of cheap booze.

""She called me her little bitch,"" Danny continued spewing. ""That I was nothing...""

Shivering, I stepped into the kitchen, closing the freezer door behind me. A fresh Miller Lite in my hand. ""You can't let her talk to you like that,"" I told Danny.

Like he was grabbing medicine, Danny snatched the beer. ""I've got no choice, man!"" He took a long swig. As if he were a Death Row prisoner savoring his final drink. ""Without her, I'm fucked. She has the money, the house is in her name.""

I clasped my hand on Danny's shoulder. ""You always got me, bro.""

With a weak laugh, Danny waved his longneck toward the fridge. ""Not when you're out with all them!""

Amused, I chuckled. ""Okay, so maybe not every night.""

""Naw, I appreciate it, man."" He clanged his beer into mine. ""I appreciate everything...""

Like two soldiers returning from the battlefield, we approached the front door. ""Aw, don't worry about it,"" I reassured him. ""Stay strong. You know how Janet is.""

""Yeah, and you don't! That bitch is crazy!""

Gripping his shoulder, I stopped us at the door. We looked at each other eye to eye. ""I know her type, man. She's scared, Danny."" I squeezed his shoulder. ""She's scared to lose you because you're better than her.""

Like an insecure teen, Danny chuckled. ""Oh, I don't-""

""You are, bro!"" I pointed the beer at him. ""You're better looking, you're smart. You're just a nice fucking guy. And yeah, you're cool as shit too.""

Okay, maybe I wasn't the best motivational speaker. Not this drunk anyway. But afterward, Danny left, and he left in far better shape than he was when Janet first ambushed his phone.

With Danny now gone, I got to work prepping for my date. I cleaned up our ""guy time"" mess in just a few minutes. And then after a change of clothes, I was ready for Emily to blow my mind...

And boy, did she! Emily was the best I had in awhile. And like a kid forced to leave DisneyWorld, I was sad when it was over. Emily gave me the kind of high high I hadn't had in awhile.

Now close to one A.M., I was home alone. And even drunker than before. I popped open another Miller Lite. The house's heater thawed me out from my latest freezer visit.

But then a vibration shattered me from my stupor. I checked my phone and saw Danny's incoming call. Jesus! my drunken mind panicked. What if that bitch really had kicked him out! Maybe I should be glad I got done with Emily earlier after all...

Moving with intoxicated slow motion, I answered the call.

""Jimmy!"" Danny's shrill panic greeted me. His insistent voice helped sober me up. And keep me awake.

""Jimmy, I fucked up, man!"" Danny went on. Heavy breaths accompanied his ferocious unease. ""I did it, man... I fucking did it...""

""Whoa, chill-"" I started.

""No, listen to me!"" Danny interrupted. ""I killed her, Jimmy! I fucking killed her!""

Shocked horror hit me. Danny the gentle henpecked husband. The pussy-whipped prisoner... had he really killed Janet?

I heard Danny weeping like a beaten schoolchild. Pathetic sobbing more befitting a Lifetime movie than his morbid predicament.

""I tried talking to her like you said,"" Danny struggled through the tears. ""But she wouldn't stop... she got mad at me, man. She called me a bitch! She called me a fucking pussy like she always does! And she just kept yelling!""

""I know, bro,"" I said, my quiet unease the polar opposite of Danny's histrionics. ""Just tell me everything.""

Through the phone, Danny's sobbing only grew louder. ""She hit me and then I just... I just lost it, man. I couldn't stop!""

Biting my lip, I stared down at the floor. ""Danny, look.""

""I don't know what to do!""

""What do you mean?""

""The body!"" Danny yelled. His weeping became more unhinged. Like the cries of a helpless asylum inmate. ""I don't know. I need to just call the police-""

""Naw, you don't have to do that."" Behind intense eyes, I looked over toward the fridge. At all those vacation pics. At all the beautiful people. ""I'm here for you, Danny, alright,"" I said. And I meant every word.

Danny's heavy teardrops felt like they were seeping through the screen. ""Naw, man, I'm fucked..."" Danny finally muttered. ""I'm fucked...""

""No, you're not, Danny!"" My hand gripped the phone so tight, I thought I might crush the damn thing. ""Just hang in there, alright! We can figure this shit out!""

""You know how she is, man. She was always beating me, harassing me...""

""I know, bro."" My gaze drifted all around the kitchen. My heart pounded like a drum. Concern conquered me. ""Believe me. I know.""

Danny let out an exasperated sigh. ""I don't know. I don't know what to do to her... you're the only person I can talk to. You're my only fucking friend!""

""Ditto, man."" Worried, I paced around the room. My footsteps formed a frenetic rhythm. ""Listen, you think you can you clean up over there?""

Confused, Danny hesitated. ""What?""

My agitated hand slammed against the freezer. ""The blood and shit? Can you clean it up!""

""I mean yeah."" A nervous pause overtook Danny's dramatic sobs. ""Like what are you saying, Jimmy?""

Like I was grabbing Danny by the shirt collar, I held out my hands. My intense focus solely on him. ""I mean bring her ass over here. Then you go home and clean-""

""Jimmy-""

""Then you go home and clean all this shit up!"" I continued. ""You understand!""

All I got was silence.

""Goddammit, Danny!"" I yelled. ""This is serious fucking shit, alright! You'll fry if you don't-""

""Okay!"" Danny yelled in a quivering voice.

""Just bring that bitch here,"" I stated with cold authority.

""But what are you gonna-""

""I'll take care of it."" With that, I hung up right then and there. A tough love move, sure. But one that'd light a fire under my best friend's ass.

And sure enough, it did. Within fifteen minutes, Danny was banging on my door. 

Looking through a window, I saw Danny toting a rolled-up red rug. A long and heavy rug.

Ready for ""work,"" I placed my half-empty beer on the counter. I opened the door and let Danny in.

Straining, Danny struggled to carry that damn rug. Sweat covered his face and drenched his clothes like he'd just climbed out of a pool. His shirt was clawed and scratched. Scattered red stains ran all along his flesh. Somehow, his hair looked even grayer...

""Help me, Jimmy,"" Danny panted.

Like a co-pilot, I helped guide the rug down to the kitchen floor. A wet thud erupted upon impact.

""The bitch just lost it!"" Danny said.

I pulled my hands back and saw moist redness all over them. Nervous, I realized the crimson was from the rug. A redness that wasn't part of its design...

Panicking, Danny grabbed my arm. And now I could feel more of that redness sticking to my skin.

""She punched me, man!"" Danny yelled like a madman. ""She fucking slapped me like a little bitch!""

Simultaneously curious and terrified, my eyes drifted over to that rolled-up rug. Like an uneven road, large bumps protruded up throughout it.

""Then she punched me!"" Danny went on. His grip tightened on my arm in excitement. ""She kept fucking hitting me!""

My curiosity won out. I leaned down and unrolled the rug.

Even if I wasn't too surprised, the sight was still vicious. Like a twisted work of art... only the brutal artistry had been taken out on a human model.

There was Janet. For once, she was quiet and not bitching. For once, there was no scowl. Just a battered mask for a face. Her face caved in and split open as if her fucking fury had caused an earthquake to erupt throughout her skull. Her hair was now bleached red... and since the personality was gone, she actually looked more attractive dead than alive. 

""She wouldn't stop!"" I heard Danny's voice persist.

Yanking my arm, Danny made me look into his frenzied face.

""Please, you gotta believe me, man!"" Danny said. ""I had no choice!"" He motioned his trembling hand toward the splattered mess that was his wife's corpse. Her face resembled bug guts at this point. ""She hit me, and I just lost it! Everything just made me go crazy!"" His voice grew louder and more desperate like a news anchor determined to be believed. ""I couldn't stop! But she fucking hit me, Jimmy! She fucking hit me first!""

Keeping my cool, I just stared into Danny's eyes. Those ocean blues looked like they had a Category 5 hurricane blowing through them. ""So you're gonna say this was self-defense,"" I said in a dry tone.

Danny reached toward my face. ""Goddammit, Jimmy! Just listen to me!""

In a quick flash, I grabbed Danny by the shoulders. A tight harness of a grip.

""Shit, man..."" Danny muttered. Startled, he looked right at me. Stunned by The Brain's strength... then again, most people were.

""I heard you, alright!"" I hurled at Danny. My voice strong and steady. Nothing like his panicky whines. ""But none of that shit's gonna fly, Danny!""

Faint tears slid down Danny's cheeks. He couldn't say a word.

I tightened my grip on him. ""But you're gonna be alright. 

You're gonna be fine. I can get you out of this, you just gotta listen to me, okay, buddy?""

Danny's tears accelerated. Pathetic tears.

Frustrated, I slapped him harder than Janet ever had.

""Aw, fuck!"" Danny cried.

I shook him silly. ""Do you fucking understand me?""

Nervous, Danny stared into my eyes as if he were facing a drill sergeant. ""Yes!""

""Now I get it, man. I know Janet was a fucking nightmare, but this is serious shit, Danny!"" Supportive, I wiped away Danny's tears. ""But as long as you listen to me, you'll be okay. I got you.""

Trembling, Danny looked over at Janet. At her gory remnants of a face. No longer crying, Danny's eyes became hollow. ""What do I have to do?""

I caressed Danny's cheek, making him look right at me. No homo. Not at this moment, for sure! ""Without a body, they can't get you,"" I reassured him. ""That's the key.""

""So what...""

Full of conviction, I waved toward Janet. ""I'll hide the body!""

Danny hesitated. ""But how, why-""

I snatched Danny's shoulder in a harsh grip. ""I'll take care of it, Goddammit!"" Intense, I shoved Danny back toward the door. ""You just clean that shit at your house! Clean it up good, okay!""

Trying to suppress his panic, Danny just looked at me. ""Okay. Clean that shit up...""

""Now, Danny!"" I barked, channeling my inner R. Lee Ermey.

At my command, Danny stumbled to the door. ""Alright!""

As Danny reached for the knob, I grabbed his arm.

Turning, Danny faced me.

""Just remember, I got your back,"" I comforted Danny. ""Just remember that.""

All he did was give me a rattled nod.

""I know Janet treated you like shit,"" I continued. Supportive, I rubbed Danny's shoulder. ""You'll be okay. Just do what I say, bro.""

Danny stared right at me.

In his eyes, I saw that hurricane go down a notch. Maybe a Category 3 instead of the fucking disaster I saw earlier.

""Thanks, man,"" Danny said. ""Thank you, Jimmy...""

Eager to get him out of there, I held the door open for Danny. ""Alright, call me when you get done.""

""Okay.""

From the doorway, I watched Danny go out into the dark night. Straight to his truck. 

The cold wind blew against me, but I didn't shiver. I felt numb from the frigid temperature at this point. And I had the house to warm me up anyway. Not to mention my burgeoning adrenaline.

I stepped back inside. My harsh gaze focused on Janet's obliterated remains. Her flesh and mushy brain pieces stuck to the rug like they were forming a morbid pattern. At least, I'd no longer have to hear her putdowns or constant complaints. And neither would Danny as long as he did what I told him. As long as he played his cards right, he'd be okay. At the very least, Janet's body would be well taken care of.

My eyes shifted over toward the walk-in freezer. I was already prepared to deal with its bitter cold air. Of course, Danny owed me big time for this... but that's what friends are for. He's a pretty cool dude after all.

Using my immense strength, I grabbed the carpeted corpse. Like I was holding a bride, I carried Janet's body toward the freezer. To her ultimate resting spot.

The bitter cold greeted me. I was back in the igloo. But I didn't slow down. 

I carried the rug all the way to the back of the freezer. Well past the frozen goods and crates of beer. A ten foot journey through the eye of this ice storm. One I was all too familiar with.

I reached the very back. Two operating tables lurked before me. Nearby, an instrument tray full of scalpels and knives awaited my cold touch. My large coat rested beside the utensils. Like a predator in its natural habitat, I was back in my territory. Only this freezer wasn't for saving lives...

Behind the tables, naked bodies swung on several meathooks. Some were women, some were men. All of them were oh so beautiful. And all the bodies were even more beautiful once I got through with them.

Incisions hacked up their cold necks and chests. Crude dissections ran all over their bodies. Sloppy stitches could barely piece together those vicious slices. Like a mad scientist, I'd had a field day working overtime.

I laid the rug out on one of the operating tables. The other table already had a blonde on it. Her eyeballs dangled out of their sockets. Like plastic surgery gone awry, most of Emily's face had been flayed earlier. By my precise touch, of course.  

Ready for the late-night fun, I slipped on the huge coat. Not that I needed it. I'd gotten used to the cold after all these visits... especially when I had the adrenaline to keep me warm. And the warm, hot bloodlust stirring in my soul.

Armed with a deranged grin, I placed my phone on the tray. Tonight, I was gonna put on a little Christmas music.

The Beach Boys's ""Little Saint Nick"" began echoing through the freezer. The track a change of pace for me... but I couldn't resist. After all, the soundtrack matched the season... and my own frigid operating room.

I grabbed the largest scalpel. And there in the cold, I turned my hungry eyes over toward Janet. She never looked better. And by the time I got through with her, she may even be beautiful."

And boy, did she! Emily was the best I had in awhile. And like a kid forced to leave DisneyWorld, I was sad when it was over. Emily gave me the kind of high high I hadn't had in awhile.

Now close to one A.M., I was home alone. And even drunker than before. I popped open another Miller Lite. The house's heater thawed me out from my latest freezer visit.

But then a vibration shattered me from my stupor. I checked my phone and saw Danny's incoming call. Jesus! my drunken mind panicked. What if that bitch really had kicked him out! Maybe I should be glad I got done with Emily earlier after all...

Moving with intoxicated slow motion, I answered the call.

""Jimmy!"" Danny's shrill panic greeted me. His insistent voice helped sober me up. And keep me awake.

""Jimmy, I fucked up, man!"" Danny went on. Heavy breaths accompanied his ferocious unease. ""I did it, man... I fucking did it...""

""Whoa, chill-"" I started.

""No, listen to me!"" Danny interrupted. ""I killed her, Jimmy! I fucking killed her!""

Shocked horror hit me. Danny the gentle henpecked husband. The pussy-whipped prisoner... had he really killed Janet?

I heard Danny weeping like a beaten schoolchild. Pathetic sobbing more befitting a Lifetime movie than his morbid predicament.

""I tried talking to her like you said,"" Danny struggled through the tears. ""But she wouldn't stop... she got mad at me, man. She called me a bitch! She called me a fucking pussy like she always does! And she just kept yelling!""

""I know, bro,"" I said, my quiet unease the polar opposite of Danny's histrionics. ""Just tell me everything.""

Through the phone, Danny's sobbing only grew louder. ""She hit me and then I just... I just lost it, man. I couldn't stop!""

Biting my lip, I stared down at the floor. ""Danny, look.""

""I don't know what to do!""

""What do you mean?""

""The body!"" Danny yelled. His weeping became more unhinged. Like the cries of a helpless asylum inmate. ""I don't know. I need to just call the police-""

""Naw, you don't have to do that."" Behind intense eyes, I looked over toward the fridge. At all those vacation pics. At all the beautiful people. ""I'm here for you, Danny, alright,"" I said. And I meant every word.

Danny's heavy teardrops felt like they were seeping through the screen. ""Naw, man, I'm fucked..."" Danny finally muttered. ""I'm fucked...""

""No, you're not, Danny!"" My hand gripped the phone so tight, I thought I might crush the damn thing. ""Just hang in there, alright! We can figure this shit out!""

""You know how she is, man. She was always beating me, harassing me...""

""I know, bro."" My gaze drifted all around the kitchen. My heart pounded like a drum. Concern conquered me. ""Believe me. I know.""

Danny let out an exasperated sigh. ""I don't know. I don't know what to do to her... you're the only person I can talk to. You're my only fucking friend!""

""Ditto, man."" Worried, I paced around the room. My footsteps formed a frenetic rhythm. ""Listen, you think you can you clean up over there?""

Confused, Danny hesitated. ""What?""

My agitated hand slammed against the freezer. ""The blood and shit? Can you clean it up!""

""I mean yeah."" A nervous pause overtook Danny's dramatic sobs. ""Like what are you saying, Jimmy?""

Like I was grabbing Danny by the shirt collar, I held out my hands. My intense focus solely on him. ""I mean bring her ass over here. Then you go home and clean-""

""Jimmy-""

""Then you go home and clean all this shit up!"" I continued. ""You understand!""

All I got was silence.

""Goddammit, Danny!"" I yelled. ""This is serious fucking shit, alright! You'll fry if you don't-""

""Okay!"" Danny yelled in a quivering voice.

""Just bring that bitch here,"" I stated with cold authority.

""But what are you gonna-""

""I'll take care of it."" With that, I hung up right then and there. A tough love move, sure. But one that'd light a fire under my best friend's ass.

And sure enough, it did. Within fifteen minutes, Danny was banging on my door. 

Looking through a window, I saw Danny toting a rolled-up red rug. A long and heavy rug.

Ready for ""work,"" I placed my half-empty beer on the counter. I opened the door and let Danny in.

Straining, Danny struggled to carry that damn rug. Sweat covered his face and drenched his clothes like he'd just climbed out of a pool. His shirt was clawed and scratched. Scattered red stains ran all along his flesh. Somehow, his hair looked even grayer...

""Help me, Jimmy,"" Danny panted.

Like a co-pilot, I helped guide the rug down to the kitchen floor. A wet thud erupted upon impact.

""The bitch just lost it!"" Danny said.

I pulled my hands back and saw moist redness all over them. Nervous, I realized the crimson was from the rug. A redness that wasn't part of its design...

Panicking, Danny grabbed my arm. And now I could feel more of that redness sticking to my skin.

""She punched me, man!"" Danny yelled like a madman. ""She fucking slapped me like a little bitch!""

Simultaneously curious and terrified, my eyes drifted over to that rolled-up rug. Like an uneven road, large bumps protruded up throughout it.

""Then she punched me!"" Danny went on. His grip tightened on my arm in excitement. ""She kept fucking hitting me!""

My curiosity won out. I leaned down and unrolled the rug.

Even if I wasn't too surprised, the sight was still vicious. Like a twisted work of art... only the brutal artistry had been taken out on a human model.

There was Janet. For once, she was quiet and not bitching. For once, there was no scowl. Just a battered mask for a face. Her face caved in and split open as if her fucking fury had caused an earthquake to erupt throughout her skull. Her hair was now bleached red... and since the personality was gone, she actually looked more attractive dead than alive. 

""She wouldn't stop!"" I heard Danny's voice persist.

Yanking my arm, Danny made me look into his frenzied face.

""Please, you gotta believe me, man!"" Danny said. ""I had no choice!"" He motioned his trembling hand toward the splattered mess that was his wife's corpse. Her face resembled bug guts at this point. ""She hit me, and I just lost it! Everything just made me go crazy!"" His voice grew louder and more desperate like a news anchor determined to be believed. ""I couldn't stop! But she fucking hit me, Jimmy! She fucking hit me first!""

Keeping my cool, I just stared into Danny's eyes. Those ocean blues looked like they had a Category 5 hurricane blowing through them. ""So you're gonna say this was self-defense,"" I said in a dry tone.

Danny reached toward my face. ""Goddammit, Jimmy! Just listen to me!""

In a quick flash, I grabbed Danny by the shoulders. A tight harness of a grip.

""Shit, man..."" Danny muttered. Startled, he looked right at me. Stunned by The Brain's strength... then again, most people were.

""I heard you, alright!"" I hurled at Danny. My voice strong and steady. Nothing like his panicky whines. ""But none of that shit's gonna fly, Danny!""

Faint tears slid down Danny's cheeks. He couldn't say a word.

I tightened my grip on him. ""But you're gonna be alright. 

You're gonna be fine. I can get you out of this, you just gotta listen to me, okay, buddy?""

Danny's tears accelerated. Pathetic tears.

Frustrated, I slapped him harder than Janet ever had.

""Aw, fuck!"" Danny cried.

I shook him silly. ""Do you fucking understand me?""

Nervous, Danny stared into my eyes as if he were facing a drill sergeant. ""Yes!""

""Now I get it, man. I know Janet was a fucking nightmare, but this is serious shit, Danny!"" Supportive, I wiped away Danny's tears. ""But as long as you listen to me, you'll be okay. I got you.""

Trembling, Danny looked over at Janet. At her gory remnants of a face. No longer crying, Danny's eyes became hollow. ""What do I have to do?""

I caressed Danny's cheek, making him look right at me. No homo. Not at this moment, for sure! ""Without a body, they can't get you,"" I reassured him. ""That's the key.""

""So what...""

Full of conviction, I waved toward Janet. ""I'll hide the body!""

Danny hesitated. ""But how, why-""

I snatched Danny's shoulder in a harsh grip. ""I'll take care of it, Goddammit!"" Intense, I shoved Danny back toward the door. ""You just clean that shit at your house! Clean it up good, okay!""

Trying to suppress his panic, Danny just looked at me. ""Okay. Clean that shit up...""

""Now, Danny!"" I barked, channeling my inner R. Lee Ermey.

At my command, Danny stumbled to the door. ""Alright!""

As Danny reached for the knob, I grabbed his arm.

Turning, Danny faced me.

""Just remember, I got your back,"" I comforted Danny. ""Just remember that.""

All he did was give me a rattled nod.

""I know Janet treated you like shit,"" I continued. Supportive, I rubbed Danny's shoulder. ""You'll be okay. Just do what I say, bro.""

Danny stared right at me.

In his eyes, I saw that hurricane go down a notch. Maybe a Category 3 instead of the fucking disaster I saw earlier.

""Thanks, man,"" Danny said. ""Thank you, Jimmy...""

Eager to get him out of there, I held the door open for Danny. ""Alright, call me when you get done.""

""Okay.""

From the doorway, I watched Danny go out into the dark night. Straight to his truck. 

The cold wind blew against me, but I didn't shiver. I felt numb from the frigid temperature at this point. And I had the house to warm me up anyway. Not to mention my burgeoning adrenaline.

I stepped back inside. My harsh gaze focused on Janet's obliterated remains. Her flesh and mushy brain pieces stuck to the rug like they were forming a morbid pattern. At least, I'd no longer have to hear her putdowns or constant complaints. And neither would Danny as long as he did what I told him. As long as he played his cards right, he'd be okay. At the very least, Janet's body would be well taken care of.

My eyes shifted over toward the walk-in freezer. I was already prepared to deal with its bitter cold air. Of course, Danny owed me big time for this... but that's what friends are for. He's a pretty cool dude after all.

Using my immense strength, I grabbed the carpeted corpse. Like I was holding a bride, I carried Janet's body toward the freezer. To her ultimate resting spot.

The bitter cold greeted me. I was back in the igloo. But I didn't slow down. 

I carried the rug all the way to the back of the freezer. Well past the frozen goods and crates of beer. A ten foot journey through the eye of this ice storm. One I was all too familiar with.

I reached the very back. Two operating tables lurked before me. Nearby, an instrument tray full of scalpels and knives awaited my cold touch. My large coat rested beside the utensils. Like a predator in its natural habitat, I was back in my territory. Only this freezer wasn't for saving lives...

Behind the tables, naked bodies swung on several meathooks. Some were women, some were men. All of them were oh so beautiful. And all the bodies were even more beautiful once I got through with them.

Incisions hacked up their cold necks and chests. Crude dissections ran all over their bodies. Sloppy stitches could barely piece together those vicious slices. Like a mad scientist, I'd had a field day working overtime.

I laid the rug out on one of the operating tables. The other table already had a blonde on it. Her eyeballs dangled out of their sockets. Like plastic surgery gone awry, most of Emily's face had been flayed earlier. By my precise touch, of course.  

Ready for the late-night fun, I slipped on the huge coat. Not that I needed it. I'd gotten used to the cold after all these visits... especially when I had the adrenaline to keep me warm. And the warm, hot bloodlust stirring in my soul.

Armed with a deranged grin, I placed my phone on the tray. Tonight, I was gonna put on a little Christmas music.

The Beach Boys's ""Little Saint Nick"" began echoing through the freezer. The track a change of pace for me... but I couldn't resist. After all, the soundtrack matched the season... and my own frigid operating room.

I grabbed the largest scalpel. And there in the cold, I turned my hungry eyes over toward Janet. She never looked better. And by the time I got through with her, she may even be beautiful."

My name is Goofy Brah of Leviathan and I am a returning NIN looking for a static.

So off the bat... I haven't played in about 6 months. I had a very demanding internship (I am college student) that made it impossible to raid so I took a break to focus on that. It wasn't until now that I feel I have enough time between my work and school to get back into the game and raiding. While I was active I was able to clear all tiers from FCoB to O8S while relevant. As I played I improved consistently and was routinely clearing with strong numbers while still being a team player. I know the balance between getting top level DPS and just getting the clear. I am fairly active in voice and research ways to optimize not only my own DPS but also the raids with improved uptime and speedkill strats. 

My gear is very lacking but I can get crafted gear easily and will be melding vit on my old gear until I start improving iLvl.

Who'd you cast in each role?,shablam96,DC_Cinematic,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/a9uh05/discussion_scenario_cavill_really_is_out_and_the/,"Look I don't want Cavill gone. But I accept it's a possibility at this point. But I also like to fancast, so if you were to reboot the Superman franchise who would you cast? Oh and you can't say Bryan Cranston for Lex Luthor or Armie Hammer in anything cos good god I am sick of those fancasts

- Superman: An unknown as they always seem to go for them. Or maybe Richard Madden? I dunno why but I could see it
- Lois Lane: If they were to go for an older Supes+Lois I'd've said Jennifer Connelly but they won't. Soooooo I'm a little stuck buuuuuut........Blake Lively? I dunno, I could see it. Or maybe Tatiana Maslany, Alicia Vikander, Lady Gaga or Natalie Dormer
- Lex Luthor: OK I got a little stuck on this one. But perhaps......Matt Smith? or Matthew Goode
- Zod: Not that he's perfect, but it's hard to see someone else as Zod other than Michael Shannon he did such a good job of it. But maybe Jason Isaacs
- Jimmy Olsen: OK this is hardly a recast but whatever. Quinn Lord (if you haven't seen Imaginareum do it, it's a great movie by a great band (Nightwish) and also the best Tim Burton movie not done by Burton), or KJ Apa or Logan Lerman or Asa Butterfield (who was always my choice for Tim Drake but by the time the next Batman movie comes out he might be too old)
- Martha Kent: TBH I liked Diane Lane a lot more than most but eeeeeeeeh......Frances McDormand? I'm spitballin here
- Perry White: Hugh Laurie
- Jor-El: Jeff Bridges just cos

Director: Brad Bird seems the obvious choice to most. Maybe Michelle McClaren

Writer? Honestly just give it to Grant Morrison, no-one does Superman better than him. Or let Kevin Smith have another shot at it. Or whichever intern they'll hire to do whatever the execs wants cos they won't let anyone else have control over the character it seems

Yeah I got stuck on these, I'm mostly just posting this to hear others suggestions. I've already said my suggestion for the next Superman movie that I think could work with or without Cavill so go figure https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/9a28w1/discussion_brief_idea_for_mos2_based_on_henry/"

Hello!

First things first, thanks for taking the time to read this, I feel it will drag on for a bit. I like to write so once I get going things can get a little out of hand as it were. So sorry in advance if this turns into a wall of text!

List of celebrities I'm interested in playing will be towards the end, feel free to mention some that you like when you PM me! Be them from my list or just ones that you like that are not on my list, because there's no doubt I've missed naming some.

Before getting into the meat of things, some stuff I wanna clear up. Not everything in here is super important but at least scan through it, would make things way easier in the long run.

care what you look like. If you start mentioning things like that I will just instantly block you, no matter how good the rest of your PM is**

**One liners and similar things will be ignored. I put effort into my posts as well as my rp, so I sorta expect the same in return. I'm a multi-paragraph rper, while I do no expect the same type of length in return, effort can still be made.**

**If you struggle to figure out what to write in a first PM, a general idea of what you wanna do, character info, kinks, limits and similar things are always a good start!**

**I'm totally fine with playing multiple characters.**

**I only rp in 3rd person perspective, sorry you 1st person people!**

**Only interested in dem big dongs. 9""+**

**Massive fan of interracial and raceplay related things!**

There! With that out of the way, let’s get to the fun stuff, eh?

Righto! So like the title might suggest, if not I shall clear things up, I'm looking to do a bit of celeb play. More specifically, a female celebrity getting fucked by a big, fat cock. Because who doesn't like that, eh? I'm totally okay with playing multiple characters at once, so if you're interested in more than one celeb, please say so. I wont play them all at once but you know, jumping from one to the other as it were. 

I don't have any super specific idea in mind for all of this. I will however slap some cliche, stereotypical ideas down below just to get those creative ideas flowing so to speak. I'd be happy to change any of them around as well as add things to make them more fun. And of course I'd be happy to listen to any idea that you might have yourself, so don't feel shy about things like that!

**Blacked:** I mean... This one is very simple.. A white celeb getting some big, fat black dick. Could be one celeb getting the BBC or could be multiple! As well as easy to combine with other ideas.

**Fan Meet:** Fan meets are everywhere these days. Conventions, interviews, shows and so on and so forth. So who's to say that a celebrity can't have a bit of fun, eh? Maybe they spot you in the line, looking all excited and decides to use some of that energy. Or maybe you just run into one in a hotel that you're checking in to and suddenly find yourself in their room, getting your dick sucked by them? There's many ways to go about it really! Cute little young fans are always the cutest and most excited ones after all!

**Bigger dick (Now with cuckolding!):** If you're a celebrity, you can pick and chose what type of man you want. But some picked wrong and want something else! They want a bigger cock that can fill them up more.. So why wouldn't they cheat? They got tons of fans and co-workers that no doubt dream about bending their famous asses over and just going to town. And hey, why not send a video or two or just live chat it to the boyfriend while you're doing it? (Cuckolding would require you to play the hubby/boyfriend as well)

**Co-Worker:** Being the new kid on the block is never easy, even less so in the world of acting. It's even worse when you're paired up with a really famous and well known celebrity which everyone loves! All the blame if something goes wrong will obviously fall on you.. But then again, having sex scenes with them is great! And so is the fact that your more famous co-worker shows up and asks if she can have a bit more of an 'intimate' practice of the scenes. And gotta teach those younger up and coming actors how to do things right!

**Personal assistant:** Now this is a job that takes effort! Keeping track of everything, bringing them coffee, making sure they're on time, taking the abuse when you screw up, making sure she's always presentable, fucking her brains out whenever she asks.. Wait, what was that last one? Oh right, having a big dick means you also get to fuck her plenty of times! Guess they didn't mention that in the job description, did they? Huh? You're only 14 and an intern?.. You'll be getting extra lucky then!

**A casual sex world:** Imagine a world where sex, nudity and anything lewd wasn't quite as taboo as it is in our real one! Wouldn't that be fun? One were it's common to go on twitter and find tweets from celebrities where some fan is balls deep inside of them. Movies get a lot more hands on and sexual, not shying away from showing off the sexual part of a relationship. On talkshows it's a common question to ask about gossip about who's packing the biggest gun in hollywood. Oh and of course, in you happen to be an actor, all the sex in a movie or show.. Well.. Of course it's real and not fake.

**Tinder!:** This one is simple enough so I don't feel like I need to even explain it!

So yeah, like I said, some cliche and standard ideas that are always open to change and adding things and so on. Again, totally open to your ideas as well.

Regardless. I mostly only do long term due to time zones and me having a very busy life currently due to studying, meaning that some times it can take me quite a while to reply. As I mentioned earlier I'm a multiple paragraph writer. I love world building and doing some talking beforehand. I also only really use third person perspective since that's what I'm the most used to.

Alrighty then, celeb time! This is by no means all that I enjoy and I will no doubt miss some that I do like, but they will give you some ideas at least: Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams, Daisy Ridley, Sophie Turner, Shakira, Taylor swift, Rose Leslie, Avril Lavigne, Emma Watson, Natalie Portman, Kristen Stewart, Rhonda Rousey, Keira Knightley, Emma Stone, Rihanna, Anne Hathaway, Selena Gomez, Miley cyrus, Katy Perry, Camila Cabello, Ariana Grande. Amy Adams, Nicole Kidman

In terms of kinks. I'll get around to making a kinklist at some point, but in general I'm a tad bit more on the vanilla side of things. Anal, oral, titfucks, femboys, large cocks/ass/breasts/, size difference, size play, facials, creampies, ageplay, flaccid play, hotdogging, cuckolding, cheating, raceplay, interracial, light petplay, ageplay, age gaps, handjobs, celebs, casual sex/nudity, clothed sex, possessiveness (on either end), jealousy (on either end) , cock shock. That's to give a bit of an idea of the stuff I like!

Limits are the usual stuff. Anything filth related, blood, gore, feet, vomit, snuff, pain, scat, watersports etc etc etc

So yeah.. Think that about covers it. It dragged on for a bit but now we're at the end of it at least!  So I hope you enjoyed all of my ramblings there. 

Please put your favorite celeb in the title of your PM so I know you at least read it this part at the end here."

I am currently a sophomore in college and I have recently been offered an internship with a firm in New York City for the summer of 2019. I am fortunate and grateful to have been provided this opportunity, especially since it I will be paid for it ($15/hour). My concerns with this, living in NYC, include how to best manage my finances, establish a successful budget, and how to calculate my taxes payable. I have done a bit of research, but I am confused with the tax policies, since I know that there are federal, state, and city taxes applied to my income. $15 an hour in NYC will be extremely burdensome on my personal finances, and I want to begin preparing for the summer. Specifically, I am asking for help in calculating the amount I will have to pay in taxes (a percentage, per-month, or lump-sum figure), and for advice in budgeting myself this summer. I can't wait for this exciting opportunity, and I want to make sure I can make the best of it. Thank you in advance!

Here is some information that may be relevant:

• Pay: $15/hour

• 40 hours a week with overtime pay of $22.50/hour (time-and-a-half)

• Two-month internship period (June - August)

• Resident of Illinois

• Student of a university in Wisconsin

• U.S. citizen

• Second-year student

• Currently exploring housing programs through NYU, EHS, my own university, etc.

The reason why I'm sharing my whole situation is so that there is background information on where I'm coming from, I am aware that all relationships are different but I am hoping that by sharing my full story, I will receive advice/stories that can help me understand what it is exactly that I need to do. SKIP THE STORY IF YOU WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT LOOK FOR THE ""!!!!!!!""\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

To start it off, here's some background information about me. I was dating this guy (let's call him G), that I will always consider as my first love, since freshman year in high school. We broke up this year, our senior year (I'm 18) in April and I was so emotionally traumatized. Our relationship was already beginning to become very toxic, so although it was a relief to both of us it still hurt because we spent 3 years of our lives together and were always known as the high school sweethearts. 

Fast forward to about a month later in June I was already moved on and ready to face the world  (It may seem really early that I got over G but like I said our relationship was already too toxic &amp; we were only holding on because of the title as ""high school sweethearts"" that pressured us into staying together for so long). My friends and I downloaded Tinder just for shits and giggles, and that was when I met R. R was 20 when I met him, turning 21 in a couple months. We started dating in May after a month of taking each other out and flirting, getting to know each other. 

The first time we broke up was in July, we had already been arguing (not because I was still holding onto emotional baggage from G) but because this was the first time he ever seriously liked a girl and he didn't know how to handle it, so there were a lot of times when he didn't know how to react/handle a situation and I would get upset about it. Anyways, when I woke up one morning there was a huge hole in my gut. Something was telling me that there was something...off. I immediately downloaded a dating app (OkCupid) and swiping through the guys, until after a while there he was. He popped up and my heart just shattered. I looked through his pictures thinking, ""Maybe he just forgot to delete his account after he deleted his Tinder account."" WRONG! While I was looking through his pictures, the same exact selfie he had sent me just days before was there, smiling in my face. I was so hurt and broken, I immediately called him and confronted him about it. I was hesitant on breaking up with him because even though it was already rocky with the 2/3 months we had, I saw potential in him. He already made me happy and treated me better than G did, but this incident was eating away at me and it killed my self esteem. He apologized to me so many times, but I did not budge. We broke it off for good. 

During the time we were broken up, I talked to 3 other people at the same time. I was hurt and lonely after being in two relationships the same year and them both not working out. I slept with one guy, sexted the second, and got into some messy shit with the third guy, whose psycho ex girlfriend tried to jump me. 

In August/September, R reached out to me. At first, I was like, ""I'm starting to get over this guy already so I don't really care what he has to say."" But after informing me of what had been going on in his life prior to our breakup, something in me wanted to take care of him. It wasn't out of pity or anything, it was just the fact that he had to reach out to me because he was at a low point and he just needed someone to talk to. I understand that feeling and wouldn't want anyone to be by themselves when they feel like that. We talked about what was going on with him (he got fired from an internship he was so happy to have over a mistake he made) that made him feel really upset. He also brought up the fact that he missed me, despite us dating for 2/3 months and it being a little rocky, he had never felt the way he did with other girls. I was not having it. Although I did comfort him, he then begged me if he could take me out so we could talk. 

He picked me up so we could catch up. We went to the park we went to after our first date. It was really nostalgic. We ended up telling each other everything that the other had been up to, and eventually there were some tears when our breakup was brought up. I agreed to give him a second chance but it wasn't going to be easy. He tried and tried and I just felt uninterested, so he eventually gave up and I asked if I could give him his stuff back. When I came to give his stuff back, I mentioned that I was trying to dye my hair blonde to cope with the breakup (jokingly). He offered to help dye it for me, and I thought, ""Eh, what's the harm in that."" We eventually had sex together after, and something clicked again but we couldn't put our finger in it.

After spending time with him in his house, we started planning things that we can do together- as friends of course. He was aware that I wasn't really interested in getting back together with him, but something clicked when it came to us just hanging out and having fun together (sex included). But then there was a point where feelings started to get involved, I was starting to miss him as my boyfriend. One day we were having sex, I became very off putted/upset mid stroke and pushed him away. He asked me what was wrong; I replied, ""I just feel upset that you had sex with other people like this."" He didn't say anything for a bit, he just leaned down and gave me a long, loving kiss. That was the moment where I got hooked- again. After that happened I was a little distant because I was scared of the feeling, I had already been trying to assert that I wanted to be friends, but after what happened I wanted more. I told him after a few days and he accepted me. 

We told each other ""I love you"" around August/September I believe. I know, our relationship sounds so rushed, but to us, it felt SO right. We weren't scared of the fact that we loved each other. Things were amazing with R, but little by little there were things that we both didn't communicate enough with. R is the second person I have truly loved since G, so I was still used to being treated a certain ""girlfriend"" way. However, I will admit that I am very immature at 18, but not in a way where I want to explore dick and drugs and alcohol. I'm immature in a way where I feel like I HAVE to get what I want, I HAVE to have things work in a way that I like, I HAVE to have his attention on me at all times. He was immature in a way where he still wanted to explore what was out there (He just turned 21 so I understand) but at the same time he still loves me so much. There were petty arguments I made, the last one that made him want to take this break was when I asked him if he wanted to get breakfast with me and he replied with, ""I can."" I FLIPPED because at the time I thought, what kind of answer was that??) 

!!!!!!STRAIGHT TO THE POINT STORY!!!!! We've had other petty arguments but that was when he finally decided that we needed to take a break. We've been dating for 7 months (He's 21 and I'm 18) and yes, I know it seems like ""Wow, just stop wasting each others time and move on!"" But I want everyone to understand that we both love each other and feel like we found the right one. According to him, we are ""right for each other, but the timing isn't right."" He suggested we take a break and figure ourselves out, if there is any hope for a future for the both of us. He did tell me that we could still talk everyday, he would tell me goodnight every night to help me sleep, and that he still loves me and hopes that we could get back together but at the same time he says ""we'll see."" He tells me ""we need this break to better ourselves so that the outcome can help us have a better relationship, because the rate we're going it's going to break off completely and that'll be the end of us. I'm the first love and he wants to make sure it happens right."" This happened last night (Dec. 25) through text (seems like a douchebag but he's a sweetheart, he has a history of very depressing circumstances so telling me through text rather than on the phone told me that he just wasn't ready to see me). I mean I understand him telling me ""we'll see in the future"" and all that so that he doesn't get my hopes up but I NEED to know what's his intention. I myself will focus on healing, bettering who I am as a person, making more money, and focusing on school. I've been reading other reddit posts and decided to make my own so that I can see advice for my particular situation.  We are planning on talking it out officially face to face this Friday (Dec. 28) and was hoping if anyone can help what should I ask him, what boundaries should be set (if necessary) or should I just save both of us the trouble and break it off completely. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to the replies."

Is it worth it?,youkii,usyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/a9wb3a/transferring_from_software_engineering_to_science/,"I'm a little bit tired of my SENG degree right now. I've been enrolled in this degree for two years, but I've had to do so many unnecessary and poorly taught subjects, so I would like to graduate as soon as possible. With regards to employment opportunities, is it worth transferring to a Science Degree with CS major so I can graduate at the end of this year? Or is it beneficial to graduate with a SENG degree + honours. I could look for paid internship opportunities now so that I can earn some sort of income, but I'd prefer to jump into the workforce already and chase that money.  


For people considering Software Engineering at Usyd, think about your other options such as coding bootcamps (much shorter, cheaper and greater accountability for teachers) and self-teaching if you want to be a professional programmer. Or if you want to study at university, consider a data science degree or cs/data major. SENG has been pretty shit so far imo."

To start it off, here's some background information about me. I was dating this guy (let's call him G), that I will always consider as my first love, since freshman year in high school.

First time posting on this sub, but I was wondering how a 17 Y/O should use $4000 he earned over the summer (high school senior, filling out college apps atm)?

The money I earned is from interning at a large tech organization (could hopefully return for future internships and a job), and I plan to pursue a STEM major (most likely CS, Aerospace Eng, or Electrical Eng). I'm planning to go to a 4 year college (maybe a UC or a decent private school), and I'll likely be paying for latter half of it. I want to set up a good foundation to build off from for the future, and was wondering if any of you had suggestions.

Thanks so much! "

a9xewb,1,2018-12-27,"Mom, leaving you after this week is going to break my heart",Millef,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/a9xewb/mom_leaving_you_after_this_week_is_going_to_break/,"Background context: my dad passed away ten years ago (I’m 25) so it’s been just me, my younger brother, and my mom. The kicker is that since I was 11 and my brother 10, went to boarding school a 6 hour plane ride away so we really only saw our parents during American school breaks. Then off we went to college and again we were at the mercy of holiday schedules. My mom moved to Indonesia 8 years ago and since that I’ve only seen her 3 times in the last 8 years due to internships in the US, my job after graduation, etc. 

So now that the background is out of the way, here’s the current situation. I finally was able to save up enough vacation time to make the super long and expensive flight and it’s been a great two and a half weeks but I leave the 30th of December. This is the first time I’ve seen her in 5 years and I don’t know when the next time will be. Each flight is easily 28+ hours of travel time so I’m already losing roughly 4 days just to get to Indonesia and back to the US. I’m so heartbroken I have to leave and it seems like with the uncertainty of being able to see her next, every time I visit it gets more and more difficult. 

I think I just need some advice on how to make this not hurt as much, how to stop being so angry about her being in Indonesia and me having my life be in the US (per my mother’s request, Asian ideals and such for careers), and just how to accept this shitty situation. I wish I could see her more often but I can’t take three weeks off all at once every year. My boss was already hesitant this year to let me do it as I am part of a small group that reports directly to higher ups and we all carry a lot of weight work wise. Who knows if my next boss will even consider it. 

Thank you! "
a9xqh3,1,2018-12-27,My (28 M) boyfriend (25 M) stepped outside the boundaries of our open relationship while we were apart for 6 months. I have no idea if I need to leave him.,catunia,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a9xqh3/my_28_m_boyfriend_25_m_stepped_outside_the/,"Hi. I've lurked this subreddit for a long time but never posted. But I'm in a mess and am totally confused what to do.

Sorry for the novel in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend went away for 6 months because he had an internship to do with school. We had been together for a year and a half, and were basically in bliss. We communicated extremely well, we always were completely in sync, we valued all the same things. Although I was apprehensive about him leaving for so long, I had had a similar experience a few years earlier that totally shaped me and helped me grow as a person, so ultimately I was happy for him to do it.  He has some intense pressures with his family (especially related to him recently coming out as gay) and I knew it would be good for him to get some time away from them and explore independence. 

Being young, gay men, we understood that each of us might get bored being celibate during such a long time apart. We talked about the idea of having an open relationship, and had a truly judgment free discussion about what worked for us. We both agreed that we could sleep with other people once, because we both were fine with a little after-the-bar fling, but we wanted to remain emotionally centred to each other and not risk anything messier than that happening. So our rule was that we couldn't sleep with anyone more than once, and we should try and be up front with people about keeping emotions out of it.

The open thing went great. We were don't ask, don't tell, and both of us found that it reduced our jealousy a lot. We didn't worry when one of us went out, because if they hooked up, it wasn't a harm to our relationship! While he was away, he met some amazing friends, had lots of adventures, and got some valuable career experience. Everything was perfect.

I went and visited him overseas a couple of times, and each time was magical (including him crying with joy (???) because of how happy we were together). We would joke about how we had to stop ""fake proposing"" because a real proposal would probably happen soon, and that we'd assume it was fake. Basically, things were good!

We had a few struggles communicating over the 6 months. We didn't always miss each other at the exact same times, and I got very busy with work, or we wouldn't connect so well at certain moments. But overall, I felt like we had braved the storm that any long distance relationship goes through - communication wise.

Then, he came home.....We had been waiting 6 months for this. The first week was horrible. I was very sick with the flu, I found bedbugs in my apartment the first night he came back, we weren't getting along. It was nothing like we had imagined, and both of us recognized how ridiculous the circumstances were. But I also found him distant and strange.  I've been cheated on in a past relationship, and I always had a sixth sense for it. I immediately got my back up, and after feeling my instincts perk up for a couple days, I asked him point blank if ""anything more serious had happened"". He denied it and claimed he was just acting strange because of the sickness and disappointment of the lackluster return getting to him.

I then found a couple other little hints that set me off, and was sort of going crazy, and kept bringing it up. He kept denying, but seemed more and more strange each time. But we had to go to several family christmas events, so we mustered through it. I agreed that I should just ignore these feelings - that they were probably based on past baggage.

  
THEN, tonight, I came home and opened his computer to charge my phone. All of a sudden, a prompt came up from a name I recognized, a name I had questioned him on in my craze the day before. The prompt was for an email, of this guy writing to my boyfriend about how ""they had been living in denial"" when they were together.  He opened the letter with ""Baby,"" It had a few other hints that made me realize exactly what it was.

I lost it and immediately confronted him about it. He told me it's been eating him alive for a long time, but he never knew when to tell me....but that he was about to soon. Apparently, he had felt distant (I know that's a bullshit excuse) and this guy was in their group of friends, and he understood ""our situation"" and thought it would be easy to have something casual with him. Then, that went on for over a month.

I was extremely upset, and questioned him more and more about it. I found out that it had been happening before and after I had visited a month ago. Apparently they both knew it wouldn't last past his return from overseas, so he felt like it wasn't necessarily more harmful to keep it going until he left to come back to me.  But then, apparently, near the end he realized how big of a mistake he had made. Through explaining all of this, he couldn't stop crying and apologizing.

I was livid. I had followed our rules exactly, not just because I'm obedient or care about the exactness of it, but because what we have meant so much and I couldn't risk jeopardizing that. Now it all feels meaningless. I'm worried I'm overreacting because of past horrible experiences being cheated on and lied to. But I worry I can't ever trust him again. 

He is EXTREMELY remorseful. But I filter between hate and unbearable sadness and nothing makes sense. Is this salvageable? I have no idea what to do.

TL/DR: My boyfriend went away for 6 months, we agreed to be open with very specific rules. We often made sure the rules were working for both of us, and we always agreed. He has just returned, and I found out (from coming across an email) that he had a longterm fling with some guy, completely violating my trust."

a9yqmi,19,2018-12-27,2019 for Choices,Fearless_Diva,Choices,https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/a9yqmi/2019_for_choices/,"So we have been told roughly when we can expect some of the sequels of various Books CHoices recently (i.e. BB 2, AME: All Stars, RCD Book 3, heck even Hero Vol. 2). We have also been told when we can roughly expect ATV to come back from the longest hiatus to date for a book... But  That can't be all we'll see right? PB has been putting out 2 books a month for the most part in the latter half of 2018. So will they keep the 3 days a week of releases? Will they expand to another? Would you guys want to see that happen? Personally, I rather see a consistent amount of books across Mon/Wed/Friday. Like 3-4 a day and 9-12 a week isn't bad imo. But more importantly, I don't want for 1-2 books ending around the same time and waiting for what feels like forever for a  new book to replace it. Case in point, The Senior just ended last week and BSC is ending this week... Which will leave TE as the sole book for a while and it looks like that book is nearing the likely 16 chapter mark. Any theories as to when we'll see some of the books they teased? Personally, I kinda want to see the untitled medical book ASAP and I hope they draw inspiration at least from the first seasons of Grey's Anatomy with the interns. XD"

a9yyav,36,2018-12-27,My experience in a cult,agnosticmeta,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/a9yyav/my_experience_in_a_cult/,"Hi everyone! First of all, I've only been on this sub a couple of weeks, but I'm really loving it here. There are some incredible conversations going on.

Anyways, I've recently come to realize that my Christian experience was probably far from normal and that I was in a kind of soft cult as defined [here](https://jayakula.org/soft-cults/).

So I wanted to share my personal story of my journey in some extreme form of charismania and get your input.

Mainly because you guys rock, but literally my only friends are still the people from this cult group and my wife is still in it deep. Plus, I've literally been a part of this group since I was a teenager, so I don't really know what is weird but typical for charismatics and what is plain batshit crazy, so I'm wanting to share my story and get your input. Be warned, this is long, but here goes.

# The Call

Like many of you, I grew up in a Christian home and went to church before I can remember. I got saved at 5 or 6. I went to a moderate charismatic church until I was 12 and remember learning to speak in tongues and stuff like that.

But then the pastor had an affair (surprise) and it split the church so my parents stopped going to church altogether for several years. In this time, I was pretty depressed with my life. I was a skinny brainy outcast and hated school but loved learning.

So when I was 15, I was at a very low place and I remember praying a lot and reading the Bible a lot. One day I was praying for direction for my life and just wanted to hear from God and so I asked him to speak to me and I just listened for some answer in my heart.

And I got one. A still small voice inside of me, that I immediately identified as Jesus, said: ""Will you follow me no matter what happens to you?"". I can't explain it exactly, but I knew in my heart that this was like some call to be a committed disciple of Jesus and not just a ""regular believer"". But I was afraid to say yes so I told Jesus, no and he left it at that lol.

A couple of weeks later I was in the same spot and I heard him speak to me again with the same question, ""Will you follow me no matter what happens to you""? This time my resolve melted away and I said yes with all my heart. In my mind, I had just heard the God of the universe asking me to follow Him with all my heart.

So I asked Jesus, what do you want me to do with my life? And I heard him say in my heart/mind: ""If you could be anything or do anything for me, what would it be?"" and I swear I never thought of this before or had an experience like, but I felt like an answer was put in my mouth and I said ""A prophet, I would like to be a prophet of God like I read about in the Bible"". Then I heard Him say, that's good because that is what I've called you to be.

So yeaaaahh, that was my frame of mind at this point and I was totally sold on the fact that God himself had called me to be a prophet and do great things for His people. But it was the late 90's and there wasn't a lot of information at your local Christian bookstore on the prophetic (there is shit ton now).

# Finding the Cult

So I searched online and I came across a small, obscure ""online ministry"" that shall remain nameless.  They didn't have a church, but were a parachurch ministry. At the time they had just launched a prophetic school and it sounded like it was going to give me the answers I needed on how to become a prophet.

I was skeptical at first (I should have listened! :) and waited a few months and dug into their online teachings and became convinced that they had a real revelation from God that I hadn't seen anywhere before.

So at 16 years of age, young, naive as hell, hyper-spiritual me,  applied to join the school. To their credit, the saw my age and made me get my parents consent, but once I was in, I bought into their doctrine completely.

The core of their teaching is loosely inspired by the Latter Rain movement, and basically that the generation of disciples after the apostles (Timothy, Titus) had failed to mentor and pour into the generation that came after them so the power of God started to fade away which led to the beginning of the early Catholic church.

But God's true pattern was for the Fivefold Ministry (apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors) to lead the church, with apostles and prophets first of course. Hence, God was restoring his ""End Times Church"" and the glory of the latter house was going to be greater than the glory of the former early Church.

They also believed that God was revealing his ""**pattern**"" for the End Times church to select apostles that he was raising up and this would come by revelation and by Old Testament allegory. Literally, they believed that the things that happened in the Old Testament were a type and a shadow of what God was going to do in the End Times.

So, I'm from SoCal originally, and this ministry was largely online but the leaders lived in Tijuana, Mexico (but they were actually from South Africa, long story). So about six months after I 've joined their school and drunk the Koolaid, I hooked up with another student from SoCal and went to Mexico to meet them for the first time.

I don't know if every cult leader is like this, but I immediately felt like I was closer to Jesus. I had a ton of questions about how the whole prophet and apostle thing worked and their other doctrines, but all of their answers made sense to me. And from that moment on of meeting them, I felt like I hadn't just found a ministry, but a home.

My parents were and still are Christian, but they were never the intense super spiritual kind and all my life they just wanted me to get a good education, get a good job, and let me my light shine through whatever I did in normal life. In retrospect, I should have been more like them, but these new found religious leaders were just more exciting.

# Going Deeper In

Anyway, fast forward a couple of years, I had graduated their prophetic school and started their apostolic school. I was in college but feeling restless because I just wanted to serve God and go into the ministry like my spiritual leaders were doing.

So one Christmas they invited me over to Mexico to celebrate Christmas with them and I had what I considered a good time. I worshipped with them, I got prophecied over a bunch, delivered from a demon I picked up from watching Harry Potter and one demon I had apparently picked up from my guitar teacher lol, and at the end of it, they offered me to stay on as intern and to really train me to be a prophet like them (getting visions, praying for inner healing, all that jazz).

To me, this was a dream come true, so I dropped out of college and told my parents that I was moving to Mexico to be an intern. My parents were ***understandably*** upset but eventually, after they met the leaders themselves, they were somewhat okay with my decision.

There are a lot of twists and turns in my story, but over time I moved from being a student to being an intern to being a minister to being in the leadership of that ministry.

# The Darker Side

That in itself is not bad, but the problem is that deeper I went into the organization, the more normal certain things began to seem to me that in retrospect are just horrible. For example,  my leaders firmly believed in the idea of the chisel and the diamond.

Meaning that just like a diamond is formed by pressure and by heat and time and polished by also by chiseling and buffing away the bits away that not diamond, so in essence, you are that lump of coal and your leaders or mentors are the tool in the hand of God to mold and shape you into who God wants you to be.

The idea was that since you chose to answer the call of God and you chose to submit yourself to a process of being trained for your call, you gave God and your leaders license to speak into your life, to put pressure on you, challenge your flesh, address your weakness and failures, often quite aggressively, those parts of who you are that aren't good enough. Thus you needed to trust God in your mentor, or that God was working through your mentor, even if they were not perfect.

Oh, and I did I mention that we **all lived together in the same house**? Yeah, we were very New Testament like that. My leaders believed that in order to effectively train and mentor, a disciple had to live with their mentor like Elisha followed Elijah around everywhere and learn by first being a servant. They called that concept a ministry center, and over time they opened several of them up in different countries.

Also, finances were incredibly tight, as surprise surprise, not every Christian on earth knew about them or even wanted to buy their books or signup for their school. And for a long time, we lived the book of Acts where we had as much in common as possible.

I didn't have to give them access to my bank account or anything like that, but I felt like my money wasn't my own, and if there was a need, and I had the means to meet that need, I should offer it up. So for a long time, the only money I had was the 100 bucks a month my parents sent me for personal necessities. That's it. Working full time, but no salary. Over time, I got deeper and deeper into debt to make ends meet and only just starting to pay it off now.

So, I lived more or less like this, in financial need, being molded and shaped by my leaders to be what God had called me to be (i.e. like them), ministering to a lot of different people online and in person, ministering overseas and meeting my wife there, coming back to the States and opening up a new branch of the ministry, and on and on and on.

# The Leadership

One of the things that really started to wake me up was noticing the difference between how my leaders — and at this point, there had been a new revelation called spiritual parenting and I considered them my spiritual parents and  even called them Mom and Dad (ouch :) —  could be so loving and so amazing in public and even most of the time in private.

But then shocked at how arrogant and vicious they could be in private yet then wrap themselves in a garment of morality and humility and say that they were doing it because they love you and want to see you rise up and be the leader God had called you to be.

For example, my ""spiritual parents"" ***really*** believed in the gift of discerning of spirits, big time. Meaning they believed they could sense the presence of demons physically and even judge the condition of a person's spirit. They called spiritual contamination and the presence of demons ""oppression"" because Christians couldn't be possessed, but simply oppressed.

I remember me or other team members sometimes coming down in the morning (remember, we all lived together) and one of them would take one look at us and say ""You are so oppressed, what's up? What have you been reading or what's going on that your spirit is so awful? I feel demons all over you"". Which would precipitate a ministry session of dealing with some sin or the other.

That was something I struggled with for a long time, because I felt such phenomena too of feeling icy chills or like ants in my hair when around creepy people.

They also really believed that rebellion was as the sin of witchcraft and it brings a curse so if they were addressing us and could tell that we were disagreeing with them even if we hadn't said anything, they would say something like ""stop giving me rebuff"" meaning stop disagreeing with me, I'm speaking for God right now, or you are being rebellious, sort your spirit out.

And heaven help you if you deliberately disobeyed an order because then you really got an earful. Also, because they weren't super puritanical they often swore when they shouted, and boy could they shout.

# The Conundrum

This was so confusing for me because I genuinely loved and admired and trusted them and felt like they loved me too. And when you have been so intimately involved in ministry together for years, pouring out your guts to help other people, and going through more shit together than I can describe here,  you don't want to think you were in a cult the whole time but the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that I was indeed a part of a cult. Worse than that, to think that everyone you consider closer than family, are in there gladly and don't see any problem with the setup.

But at the same time, it wasn't a stereotypical cult. For example, on hand, my spiritual parents encouraged us to be individuals and to be leaders and not followers. But on the other hand, they always had firm control over the running of the ministry, and I was often reprimanded for not obeying their instructions to the letter.

One one hand, it was a ministry because everything was so spiritual with revelations from God every other day and seeing demons and believing in curses and apostles and all sorts of charismatic shit.

But on the other hand, it was also a business, and my leaders were clear that the ministry was a mix of business and ministry. For the longest time, the ministry was supported only by book and course sales. If you've ever been in a struggling business you know how unpredictable money can be.

Now imagine you are living together with 15 to 20 people in a big house (actually, an old hotel) and you believe in curses, so every time finances are slow your leaders are looking introspectively at their sin and outwards at the sin of the team or even further outward at spiritual warfare and ""words"" spoken against  the ministry as the reason for the slowdown in finances, and that is what I lived in for years.

As a leader responsible for a division, if finances were slow in my division, or even if we didn't get enough phone calls or emails in a week, I would be told I should start asking God for revelation as to where I had opened the door to a curse, because if every other division was doing fine, and mine wasn't, that was obviously the reason why mine was failing.

Anyways, I would say that we were basically fundamentalist Christians whose basis for doctrine was a highly allegorical interpretation of the Bible combined with personal revelation and experience. They wouldn't say this, but honestly, revelation trumped what the Bible had to say. The letter kills but the Spirit gives life, you know?

# The most painful thing

I believed all the Bible's miracle claims were true, and as I've shared elsewhere, for a long time I resisted going to the doctor for treatment because I was believing in God to heal me. But it was worse than that.

Because I had zero sex drive and could hardly perform in bed due to my medical condition, my wife felt like I didn't love her or that I wasn't attracted to her. We were both so super spiritual and naive (we were both virgins), but she thought if she was just more attractive or more submissive, that that would turn me on.

Sorry, but that doesn't fix a medical problem!

But I didn't know that back then, and so my marriage went through a long rough patch. And so we sought a lot of marriage counsel from our spiritual parents and every time I brought up the idea of going to get medical treatment, I was told that I was dodging the real issue which is that I didn't want to embrace my masculinity and that I should ""pick up"" the example of masculinity that my spiritual father had. That I should pick up this mystical concept of spiritual DNA and become more like my spiritual parents.

My body wasn't responding to the Spirit of God in me because of somehow I had judged or rejected my real Dad as a boy an that's why I had a problem, or some shit like that.

Eventually, I was even told that my desire to feel good in my body was an idol. That I was no different to a drug addict looking for a fix and I didn't really care about my wife but was only thinking about myself. **What the actual fuck?**

# No other friends

And during all this time (over a decade) because I was so busy doing the ""work of the Lord"", that I never built any friendships outside of the ministry inner circle. If I did meet other Christians (always only Christians), I always steered conversations towards spiritual topics and felt like the sole reason for my friendship was that God had sent me there was to be available to minister to them if they are open to it.

Also, we believed in something called spiritual links, which was like a spiritual blood transfusion which could contaminate your spirit if you opened your heart to someone under oppression or with major sin in your life. So literally after meeting anyone else, or even often other team members, I would have to pray a quick prayer and ""break spiritual links"" with someone so I wouldn't come under a curse.

I even got into a lot of shit with my leaders for being too social (not spiritual enough) to people who came to us for ministry and not being strong enough with members of my own team when they were ""out of line"" and didn't follow my instructions. They said, if you don't follow our instructions to the letter, how will others follow you?

We had this idea that the existing church was flawed and we had a superior revelation from God. We called the existing church the ""status quo"" church and felt we were going to bring change to the church to be more like us (not that it was said that way).

# The beginning of the end

Eventually, sometime two years ago, I started to reach my breaking point. I had had an increasing number of fights with my leaders on things I didn't agree with from a scriptural basis and each fight had led to a demotion in status.

You have to understand, at this point over ten years later, the ministry had grown, there were multiple branches, and my wife and I were ""high up"" in the leadership and were expected to be loyal examples of obedience, servanthood, and leadership.

So when I started publically challenging their authority by questioning their decisions in front of other team members who I was in charge of, that did not go down well. My brothers and sisters were very quick not to back me up and I often had to stand my ground against several other people with no support, even from my wife, until eventually I relented and admit that I was probably wrong and then could be ministered to regarding my bitterness, trigger, or whatever the hell else.

Eventually, my leaders brought in another couple from a different country to take over the leadership of the ministry in the country I am in. My wife continues to work with them in the ministry and if I ever bring up anything negative about their leadership, she will defend them.

Eventually, I went all the way from being a team leader and a lecturer in the school to being demoted to answering phones and online correspondence.

You have no idea of the malaise I felt. I still believed in God and still wanted to fulfill my calling, yet I realized that while I was in this ministry, I was never going to be free to follow my heart.

I remember once sharing with them what I desired to do for the Lord and asked them if I could do that. To which they replied, It's great that you want to do that, but right now we are going to use you where we see fit to accomplish the mandate that God has given us. Over time, if you prove yourself faithful enough in what we've assigned you to do, we will give you more responsibility again and maybe allow you to do what you are passionate about. But for now, you need to learn to the basics again of SOS: submit, obey, and serve.

I kid you not. And all of it justified by their interpretation of the Bible and sounded so humble. Why wouldn't a true Christian want to submit and become nothing just like Jesus became for us?

# Searching

So after that I just was exasperated and I started searching online for answers in the middle of the night because when the fuck else could I do it? All day long I was with everyone else, and couldn't just watch videos without someone noticing. Because once any other team member noticed a ""problem"" they felt obligated to help you which often meant tattle telling to the leaders and talking about you behind your back.

Eventually, I became convinced that I wanted to be a ""tentmaker"" and get an online job (I don't live in the US right now) to support the ministry financially and be able to still help out in the school and support the ministry however I could. That would allow me partial independence to do what I felt God wanted me to do.

My wife was devastated that I wanted to do — because why would you want to give up serving God and changing the lives of people — but in the end, she said come what may I'm behind you.

To me, I thought that the proposal sounded completely reasonable. I wasn't doing anything of importance any longer, this way I could do some real good and help out with the financial situation. I was not prepared for the response I got.

I was told that they (my spiritual parents) had prayed about it it and **GOD** had told them that I was like the Israelites in the wilderness hankering after the leeks and garlic of Egypt and that I had failed the final test that God had given me to be a part of the ""glorious"" thing he was about to do in the ministry aka the Promised Land.

That God had been testing the leaders themselves and they were prepared to lay everything down and hand it to other team members, but their focus wasn't on money but on their spiritual fitness to lead God's people. And that through that I had shown my true colors and wasn't qualified to be a part of the ministry team any longer.

They said my wife could continue on in the ministry because through this time she had passed the test, but I would need to move out and get a job. So I did and that was about this time a year ago.

Since that time I've moved out in our own place with my wife and daughter (the first time in my adult life!), but I've still been very involved with these people socially, as they are the only people I really know well in the country that I live in.

During this past year, I questioned everything and once I had come to the conclusion that everything I ever believed was explainable by natural explanations, I couldn't believe in God anymore and I started questioning what the fuck I had done with the past 20 years of my life!?

# Getting on with my life

It is fucking **hard** to start over with no real-world career experience. Fortunately, because the ministry was also a business and I was interested in IT, I became the sole web developer for the ministry's websites, so I at least had something I could use to make money.

But it has been so hard for me this past year. I halfway came out to my wife and she freaked out mostly because I hadn't told her what I was going through, but also because she just thought I was hurt and bitter at the leadership and that I was just reacting to them instead of having a real inquiry into my faith. Of course, being bitter at someone is like one of the worst sins you can commit, lol.

We fought a lot, and she just said it doesn't matter what I believe, she knows what she believes and what she wants to do with her calling, and she will love me nonetheless.

So we are at this sort of standstill where we have agreed not to talk about beliefs, and for the sake of peace, I haven't told anyone in the ministry what I've been going through, because I can predict their response, and I just don't want that drama.

Even though I definitely no longer believe in what my leaders/spiritual parents teach, I'm still struggling emotionally coming to terms with my experience with them.

Because as awful as everything I've shared is, at the same time, most of the time they are really nice people. As backward as they are about demons and my medical problem, they are very open to talking about sex and intimacy and talking about hurts from the past and bringing to the light things that simply don't get talked about in church, or quite frankly, in most families.

As controlling and authoritarian as they could be, they were also incredibly generous and often went into debt to put food on the table or buy clothes for us and stuff like that.

As much as they wouldn't accept any dissent while correcting you, they would also really listen to your opinion when they asked for it.

And that is the conundrum. I can't universally condemn them as your typical cult leaders and horrible people. I really think they are just ""true believers"" who are completely deluded and are doing everything from a good place in their heart.

Is that just Stockholm syndrome? The fact that they were my only social environment so that became my standard of normal relationships? Were they sociopaths?

I don't know. I'm just glad I left when I did. I have seen so much since I've left, but in a way, I still haven't left. I still haven't made any friends in real life and I'm worried about what they will think if I say I went to a secular meetup or stuff like that.

Hell, I even turned off notifications on my phone so that my wife doesn't see a reply from r/exchristian.

You might wonder, why I don't just come out all the way given all the shit that is there. Well, one reason is my wife. I love her to bits, and I don't want to hurt her any more than I have in the past, and being in that ministry is what she wants to do with her life. So I support her decision and I don't want to rock the boat.

The other reason is legal. I don't want to get into too much, but I need to remain in the country I'm in for very personal reasons, and getting another visa depends upon my wife working for that ministry.

So yeah, I am in a bind, but hanging out here is really refreshing to me. I know this has been way too long, but I wanted to give you a glimpse of what my life in a cult was like. To regular charismatic Christians looking from the outside, it looks like a normal legitimate ministry, but on the inside, it is a different story and I could write a book of all the shit I've seen go down.

If you've read so far, thanks for listening to me ramble and I would love to hear your opinion about my experiences. How far down the rabbit hole do you think I stumbled?

Cheers.

Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

A few things:

Be literate please! No text talk/bad grammar. I only rp in 3rd so please do 3rd person! I DO NOT TF! I am looking for a tfer, so please be okay doing that. You should also be okay with me playing as original characters. If you are not, this post isn't for you. Be an active rper. I understand life comes up, just please try to reply as much as humanly possible. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

aa06lc,6,2018-12-27,Fall recruiting season,MWLoser,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/aa06lc/fall_recruiting_season/,"I'm on track to complete my BBA next December.  I will graduate with about 147 hours.  Based on what our uni advises, I plan to take one more grad class to fill that 150 hours, non-profit accounting or something.  It supposedly covers an area on the CPA exam.  My question is how to present myself at fall recruiting.  Should  I interview for full time positions with a  January start date, or do I interview for January (busy season) internships?  I will be done with my undergrad, will they allow me to take an internship if I am already graduated?  I could easily delay my graduation, my school has a combined Bach/MAcc program I could transition into and say I am still in school, but I plan on starting full time work before I would ever finish a Masters degree.  I have a summer internship this year in Industry, large manufacturing firm, F500, but no other experience. High GPA, currently at 3.9, will drop some. 

Just not sure how to present myself this fall, ideally I would like to land in public accounting with either a large regional or B4.  Recruiting will be mostly large regional firms for full time, though Deloitte , EY, and BDO come looking for busy season interns.  "

I have been lurking for a little bit. I’m graduating this upcoming May from college and I’m looking at my potential options following my graduation, mainly in the nonprofit sector. The area I’m in has many nonprofits, but as I search and view various qualifications, most of the listings are searching for previous experience in nonprofits (like 2+ years already). For example, I applied to a local nonprofit listing for a part-time position this upcoming semester, but was told that they’re looking for someone with more experience in nonprofits. 

I am going to be looking for other internships or something in my area, but I just am wondering how I put my foot in the door when the organizations around me are looking for more experienced people?

aa128s,2,2018-12-27,Too Autistic for an ABA career,autisticambrosia,BehaviorAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/BehaviorAnalysis/comments/aa128s/too_autistic_for_an_aba_career/,"Throwaway account here, I haven't had the best luck with ABA jobs despite graduating with a 3.8 and a bachelor's degree in behavior analysis. I did well in my internships, but then when I applied for an actual job, I kept getting fired, so far I got fired three times, two times recipient rights complaints due to misunderstandings and another time it was because I snapped at my supervisor due to a sensory overload I was experiencing and one time I was pretty much told I couldn't work with kids anymore and I was pretty much placed into doing menial tasks and because I couldn't deal with the boss who pretty much said I had to give up being a practitioner and harassed me and kept telling me to stop stimming and acting ""so autistic around the kids"", I quit that job.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the thing, I am autistic, have been diagnosed ever since I was 5 and I can't seem to maintain a job. I try to get accommodations for my job but they either have no idea how to accommodate me and when I try to stand up for myself, nothing works out or they say ""it's not our job, that is your therapists job"" even though my therapist says that it is the employers job. I am sick of being misunderstood and mistreated when the field of ABA should be the field that knows how to work with people with autism the best and I'm completely dissatisfied. They are totally clueless how to work with adults that are even somewhat high functioning. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am going through rehabilitation services to find a job and did a paid work trial and they pretty much said, I am fine working with disabled people and I love working with disabled people, it is more the problem with the supervisors and how sensitive everyone is, I mean, I was accused for harassment saying stuff that was offensive even though the person I said it to wasn't offended (it was someone else listening in who was offended) and I didn't mean it to be offensive. I did some assessments through rehabilitation services where I was told I was better working with data and doing clerical work making that one ex-boss right which I hate admitting. Problem is, I tried getting into grad school last year, but failed to get into any school of the 4 I have applied for. For the past several months I have been mourning the death of my career in behavior analysis. It just really sucks because I was told I could be whatever I wanted, but I am starting to realize that some jobs are off-limits to me having a disability and I have limits and it would really be no different than if I was in a wheelchair.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently working with a job counselor to find a job and it is going well, but I can't help but regret ever going into the field of behavior analysis, had I known this would happen, I would have never done it. I still want to do something with behavior analysis and I was thinking starting taking pole dancing classes again and training to be a pole dance instructor since that is what I originally wanted to do when I was in college, but my mom was like ""Well, what if you are injured? You can't teach if you get injured"" and tried to convince me to pursue a real job then my studio closed and then I sorta forgot about it, I want to regain my strength then begin my training, but first I need to save up for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have just been really depressed these past months and how awful I have been treated and really regretful of ever thinking of pursuing a career as a BCaBA. I hate how people try to act all nice to me, but act all ableist behind their backs and I am not impressed as an autistic person how I was treated in the field of ABA, I feel like a token in that they want to hire me to show how inclusive they are but then don't take the effort to help me and expect me to behave normal."

One time, I was following orders from the person in charge of my case, but my boss didn't agree with the person in charge of the case and another time, I was not having much luck with normal praise, but did get responses from scolding and saying no so I playfully scolded and the client was laughing and seemed to enjoy what I was doing, but I was accused of verbally abusing her and was fired. 

Another time it was because I snapped at my supervisor due to a sensory overload I was experiencing and one time I was pretty much told I couldn't work with kids anymore and I was pretty much placed into doing menial tasks and because I couldn't deal with the boss who pretty much said I had to give up being a practitioner and harassed me and kept telling me to stop stimming and acting ""so autistic around the kids"", I quit that job because HR sided with him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I currently live in Grand Rapids, where he has 3 rental units, and we are currently living in my 4 bedroom house (all the properties are almost paid off. Less than $40,000 between all of them/car payments. No school debt). We both work as bartenders in town, and make pretty decent money at it, especially since we don't have kids. I am 27, he is 44 .

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We both have agreed that we want to move up north, but we are having some disagreements as to when, and if we would be able to make enough money. I'm looking to hear from some of y'all who have made the move. How old are you? What do you do? How much does your operation/equipment/bills cost a month? How have your plans changed throughout the years? Have you made a positive impact in a small rural community in any way? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Skillset: Iyengar Yoga teacher, Culinary Arts graduate, basic knowledge of organic farming (I start a small garden from seed every year, with mixed results. Still learning, and would love some more space to have room for errors), more than basic knowledge/interest in foraging/knowing medicinal benefits of local flora, lover of backpacking with some basic knowledge of trail and forest management, and a keen interest in beekeeping (been on the search to intern with a master beekeeper for the summer of 2019). Also skilled at making Lye Soap and beeswax products (salves, candles, chapstick, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Vision of the property: Minimum 10 acres. About 3/4 wooded. Water would be nice (stream or river). I don't want to be near any industrial farms where pesticides will be sprayed. I would also like to be within an 45 min of some semblance of a town, and hopefully no more than 1 1/2 hours to a legitimate town. Ideally I would love to have a large flower and herb garden, that would be for the bees, as well as for herbs for market, and homemade tea blends for market as well (with a mix of farmed and foraged for the tea blends). Other flowers also for market/floral shops. Most of the vegetable garden would just be for home use, although I would like to plant some passive perennial food stock (asparagus, artichokes, berries, fruit trees) that I could possibly sell too? For the wooded areas I would love to start a mushroom farm to sell to market/restaurants. I've read that there is some positive correlation between raising bees and growing mushrooms for disease resistance. I mostly want bees to help the earth, but would just keep growing depending upon where life takes me, whether it be wax products, honey for market, rearing queens, or renting my bees for pollination. I'm not opposed to having a few animals, ducks maybe to help with the bugs, or chickens to help with the compost, but I'm not looking to have anything bigger than some goats. I would like to learn how to hunt/break down large animals, but have no hands on experience with that sort of stuff. I also would love to work with the neighbors to cross utilize products so there is less waste.  I used to take pottery lessons, and at some point I would love to have a kiln and get into that again to sell in shops or online. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I want to just sell my house and buy some property and get started now, since I know it will take a good few years to set up the permaculture on the property and to start yielding results. My husband wants to work in town for another 5 years or so to save up more money first, and then rent out my house while we get a loan or pay cash for the property. He is very scared of failure, and us going broke (which I think part of is because of our age difference, that he would have a hard time finding another job). He is willing to help, and wants to move too, but I am the driving force with a deep desire to work with the land. Left to his own devices he would still be perfectly content living in his bachelor pad eating ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor (although he is the first to admit that he is much happier and more fulfilled sharing our lives together, and is 100% on this ride with me). I think if we have everything paid off, and are getting the $2,100 of passive income (from the rental properties. or $3,700 if we rented my house out as well) that we would have plenty of income to get us by. Am I being naive? Is he being a worry wort? I'm under the mindset that if we follow our passion and work hard (while we are still able bodied) that money will come. We might not be rich, but we will have plenty to live happily. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? What advice do you have? Do you know of any services or organizations to look into? I'm sorry about this huge ramble! In the meantime I just keep working, keep reading, and keep practicing new survival and artistic skills until he gives the green light to gtfo of town!"

I am moving across the country soon for work, but we had planned to stay together and are very serious. She even wants to get an internship where I work and eventually move to the same city. The problem is that she has been lying profusely throughout our relationship over things I wouldn’t even care about that much if she just told the truth in the first place. I’m worried that our relationship won’t work long distance if I can’t trust her.

&amp;#x200B;

Early in our relationship, we briefly talked about our sexual histories. Hers was all very recent. She told me the first day of school she had her first kiss: A guy on Tinder texted her to come over in the middle of the night so she blew him then he got her an Uber back. The next day she blew another random Tinder guy, and then 20 minutes later another Tinder guy picker her up. She let him finger her on the street then she went back to his place and showered with him and blew him a bunch of times and let him finish on her. Then about a week later (and 2 week before we met), she blew a fourth Tinder guy (let’s call him Z). 

&amp;#x200B;

Call me old fashioned, but I was kind of weirded out that those were her first sexual encounters ever. She could tell I felt a little uncomfortable when she told me, but I didn’t really say anything, and never thought about it again after that.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem started about a month into our relationship. She has a private twitter, but told me she never tweeted. One day she was on Twitter, and I saw that she had like a thousand tweets so I asked if I could follow her. She said no because they were embarrassing, but said I could read them if she looked through them first. She spent about 30 minutes reading through her tweets and deleting some before she finally showed me. After scrolling for a bit, I read this tweet: “i was spite swiping on tinder last night and there’s a rly small chance I swiped on one of his house mates. i lowkey hope it is bc the ensuing chaos would b funny and then things would prob end without me having to do anything.” 

&amp;#x200B;

I was shocked because I thought everything was going great at that time. She claims she was just worried I would break her heart because I was moving away in a few months so she swiped to ease the pain. I was really worried she cheated on me so she let me read her texts from her best friend at the time to prove she didn’t. When i was scrolling through the messages, I saw a message she sent saying she felt super guilty about hiding something from me but thinks the guilt will go away and I’ll never find out. She immediately grabbed the phone away and said it was about something personal about her family that she didn’t want to tell me. She told me this story about her aunt being sexually assaulted throughout her childhood. The story didn’t make any sense, and the text was definitely about something else so she finally admitted she made up the story.

&amp;#x200B;

She revealed the secret was that she actually went to Z’s (the 4th Tinder guy) house the day we met. She told me that Z wanted to apologize on cancelling plans the night before. When she went over, Z apologized and tried to kiss her. She kissed him back for a minute then left. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was upset she lied about the day we met because I built up this really fond image of our first date in my head. We were texting all day getting excited to meet each other and when we started talking I even stopped messaging another girl I was talking to because I liked her so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I was still suspicious about everything because of how much she lied already. I asked if I could read texts with her friend from that day to prove she was telling the truth. I saw the texts and it looked like she was. She even texted her friend asking her about Z and the day we met. Her friend’s texts back sounded really fake, almost like they were planned. I wanted to jokingly text back “He knows the truth”, but she convinced me not to because her friend would know I said that and I would look like a weirdo. Later that night I explained I was so upset because I have trust issues because of bad stuff that happened in my family when I was a kid (which I will not go into here). She cried with me and promised that she is telling the truth and will be 100% honest from now on. She even explicitly bet our relationship on every detail of her story being the complete truth.

&amp;#x200B;

The day after that she sits me down and told me that right before our first date, she blew Z and he fingered her. She admitted she prepared this fake story she told her friend to text when she was with me, and she deleted a bunch of texts from the day that I checked. I was super upset because of how much she staked on her promise just the day before. She tells me details and insists to me that she didn’t swallow him, and I ask how the fuck thats supposed to make me feel better. She said she thought it would make me feel better that I’m the first person who she swallowed (this is relevant later). I tell her I need some space, and a day later I go to her place to talk. She begs me to give her another chance and promises she will never lie again so I end up giving her another chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next couple of months, I catch her lying a couple more times about unrelated things, but I always ended up forgiving her. I wasn’t mad about what she lied about, it was how she was able to lie. One time I tested her on something I knew was a lie and she looked me in the eye and promised from the bottom of her heart, and the whole time I couldn’t detect a shred of guilt in her eyes. Over time, we talked about it a lot and she kept promising me how she was getting better and doing everything she could to tell the truth and earn my trust back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, we had one more discussion about trust and how important it was when we were away. We talked about the day we met, and I told her that I was dubious she hadn’t swallowed Z because of how much she brought it up. She would mention that I was the first one she swallowed during sex a lot because she thought it turned me on. At one point when I asked if we should get tested for STD’s because of the day we met, she said probably couldn’t have transferred anything because she didn’t swallow Z (I didn’t even know that made a difference). She looked me in the eye, promised me she didn’t swallow him, and even gave me a vivid description of exactly what happened with lots of detail.

&amp;#x200B;

On Christmas Eve, she sends me a long message admitting she did swallow Z the day we met and lied about a ton of other details from that day, too. She also told me she was swiping on Tinder the week we met before we were going out, but never messaged anyone. At this point I have no idea what to do, especially since we’re going to be long distance.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m just so conflicted because if she had told me the truth about these things form the start, I wouldn’t have cared. Even if I cared a little bit, I would’ve gotten over them immediately and could never hold anything against her for them. It makes me think that there’s more she’s hiding. I’m also upset that she would always use my love against me to manipulate me. Whenever I expressed doubt, she would get mad at me for not trusting her, but those things turned out to be lies anyway! 

&amp;#x200B;

If she lies so much, what are the chances this is actually it? Are there bigger things she’s hiding or just more small things I wouldn’t even care about if I knew the truth? Does this make her more likely to cheat or lie when we are long distance? Does voluntarily coming clean mean she really is trying to get better or is she just building a false sense of trust to hide other secrets?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Girlfriend blew someone 2 hours before our first date and lied about it profusely throughout our whole relationship for seemingly no reason."

I ended up selecting a smaller firm in a smaller Texas city due to the lower cost of living and the quieter lifestyle that my wife and I could have there. After 16 months with the firm, I was released due to ""not performing/developing to their standards"".

Regardless of the specific circumstances that led to my dismissal, I struggled for 20 months to find a new permanent opportunity. I even went as far as San Francisco for an internship with the hope of securing a permanent opportunity, but failed to make it happen. Thankfully, I have finally ended this search by securing an offer from Grant Thornton once more to join their firm (which I accepted very quickly).

I feel that I have received a second chance that I cannot and will not squander. I know that I will need to extremely diligent to avoid the same mistakes I made that led to my dismissal those nearly two years ago. Is there anyone in this sub who has experienced a similar story who can provide their feedback and/or guidance on what I can do to stay strong and prosperous with this new opportunity? As I said, I CANNOT allow to let what happened to me with the smaller firm EVER happen again. "
aa48cy,8,2018-12-27,Carleton vs Queen's Computer Science,Alan0104,OntarioUniversities,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioUniversities/comments/aa48cy/carleton_vs_queens_computer_science/,"First time poster here, based on my averages, the universities I will be going to will most likely be Queen's or Carleton for computer science. I have a few questions for both.

1. Although Queen's is a much more recognized university than Carleton, I've heard Carleton's computer science program has a better reputation than Queen's/a better computer science program to attend. Is this true?

2. How is the social life like at both schools? Generally I've heard that Queen's has one of the best campus communities however I've also read that the atmosphere around Queen's feels too much like a bubble, and you get disconnected from the real world. I honestly wouldn't mind it too much but how much truth is there to this? Ultimately, from your opinion, which campus has the better campus atmosphere?

3. The internship at Queen's is still a little confusing to me. 16 months straight of work after the 2nd year at the university if you choose to. Is it possible to work in far away cities, or maybe even countries considering the amount of time we are given for the internships? Ultimately, where would I be able to get better work experience, Carleton's co-op in Ottawa or Queen's internship?

Thanks to anyone in advance."
aa4ie4,9,2018-12-27,"(xpost: r/cscareerquestions) Deciding between two job offers, one in NY and one in Tokyo",CSQThrowaway31415,movingtojapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/comments/aa4ie4/xpost_rcscareerquestions_deciding_between_two_job/,"Apologies if this sounds like the ultimate in first world problems, but as someone with bad anxiety making large decisions this is eating me up and I figured I'd ask for advice.

I'm a senior Computer Science student from Canada looking at two competing job offers, both with companies I've done 4 month internships with before (one last winter, one which just ended).

The first company is a medium-large sized firm in NYC, that is very highly respected in it's field. It pays incredibly well (starting at 250k USD/yr + 401k matching and an incredible health plan with lots of potential to grow, and a 50k signing bonus), is stable and growing, with free lunch and gym and all the usual crazy tech perks. It's also only a 7 hour drive or 2 hour flight where I grew up and where all my family is. I found it a pretty good place to work. I also like to cook and have a lot of cooking equipment that I could easily move to NYC and have a nice setup.

The second company is small (\~10 people) stock trading firm in Tokyo. It pays very well for Tokyo (\~175k/yr), but might not be the most stable company in the world (plus a good chunk of the pay is tied to firm performance) and has limited growth potential (as all the employees except the owner are effectively equal and paid the same with some slight tweaks to the bonus structure). It's also 12 hours by an expensive plan ride away from my family and existing friends, and I'd imagine making new friends and finding other jobs in the future will be harder there given the language barrier. However, I just worked there, and absolutely fell in love with Tokyo and Japan. The city is amazing, the general way of life feels like a better fit for me, and the transit, infrastructure and food give an incredible quality of life. My university program involves finding a lot of 4 month internships, meaning I've been able to live in many cities around the world and this is the first one I've reached the end of and not had any real desire to return home. I also quite enjoyed the freedom of the smaller firm, both in terms of the work done and the working style (you could order whatever setup you like to work on, you could work from home most of the time if you want, or come into the office, hours were mostly flexible).

Part of me thinks that I'm giving up an incredible opportunity if I don't take the NY firm, and that the foreignness of Tokyo may grate on me eventually (even if it didn't at all in the 4 months I was there). It's an insane amount of money, a highly prestigious job that I enjoy doing, and a world class city near my family where I speak the language. The other part of thinks I'm being too conservative taking that job, and should take the risk and return to Tokyo, which has been by far my favourite place to live.

How would people who have done this before say their feelings at 4 months in and multiple years in compare. Assuming I put more effort into Japanese (currently just N5), how is it making a social life in Japan?"
aa5cuj,0,2018-12-27,I (23M) am concerned my brother (21M) is addicted to drugs and I dont know how to bring this up,BrownThunder95,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aa5cuj/i_23m_am_concerned_my_brother_21m_is_addicted_to/,"So my brother and I were born and raised in India. He is currently studying computer science in the US. I graduated about a year ago from the same school.

Now my brother has always surrounded himself with people that are heavy into partying and drugs. He particularly enjoys acid, weed, shrooms. I know he has tried prescription drugs and cocaine on one occasion. In fact I met a meth addict at a mental health hospital I was going to for unrelated reasons who parties with my brother. This kid doesnt even go to our school. 

Anyway, last summer he landed an internship that pays super well. All of a sudden we started hearing ""this is my money and I can do what I want with it"". He started growing more and more distant. Before he used to speak to my mom at least once a week but now he refuses to pick up our calls or reply to our texts. I can only assume he is lying when he says that his phone is not working properly or that notifications arent showing. He replies to my messages maybe 3 weeks after I send them. There is one exception to that.

When he needs money, he gets in touch with us asap. Often enough its an emergency need like rent is due or some payment needs to be made. This results in my dad running around trying to transfer the cash over to his account. He claims that chase (his bank) has been messing up and locking him out of his account or preventing him from taking money out of the atm for the past 3 months and thats why he ends up in these emergency situations. He now says that he is changing banks because of it. Chase is a multi billion dollar bank, one would imagine such issues are nipped in the bud immediately. I dont know if I can trust him.

He was supposed to deposit about 120 dollars in my account which was left over from my apartments deposit. He put it in his ""by mistake"".

A few months ago I noticed about 80 dollars being wired out of my dads bank account every month that was unaccounted for. We filed a claim and cancelled the cards. Turns out my brother was using my dads credit card information to pay for amazon and his AT&amp;T bills. We gave him that information when he couldnt pay rent a few months prior. We never imagined he would abuse our trust. When my mom pushed him on it, he just said,"" Its not like I abused it on purpose"".

My parents bought him a ticket home for new years. He calls us the day off saying he doesnt have money for the shuttle to the airport. I get upset and tell him he is frustrating us a lot. He immediately shuts down and kills the call. He refuses to pick up or reply to our messages. Finally he messages my dad saying that if we are going to make such a big deal about something so small, he may as well cancel the flight and stay there.

He gets very argumentative and defensive when we have tried to bring this up. I want to talk to him about this and figure out where the money is going. He needs to be able to account for all the money that he claims he cannot touch sitting with chase. I have already come clean to my parents regarding all of this. Any advice on how to go about this?  


sidenote: My brother also has BPD which would make drug abuse far more detrimental."
aa5idx,1,2018-12-27,19 m4F Where are all the MILFs at?,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/aa5idx/19_m4f_where_are_all_the_milfs_at/,"Hello everyone! As my post's title suggests, I am crazy about MILFs and looking for any and all of them!

Maybe you’re a married woman, and have been for a while now. You no longer have that spark from the honeymoon phase, whether you’ve been married for ten years or twenty. You used to be very careful about keeping up appearances, going to the gym, shaving your body, and more. But now, things have quieted down on that front.

Or maybe you have never been married. You like to enjoy yourself with as many men that you choose. Tying yourself down to one guy was never in your plan and that is perfectly fine with everyone ;)

Regardless of the type of life you lead, you have somehow found me. I’m young and handsome, and in many ways I am exactly the kind of young guy you've been looking for. Not surprising, I'm instantly turned on by a sexy older woman like you. Maybe you see me at the gym and catch me sneaking glances at your ass. You think it sags a bit, and you know you have cellulite on your thighs, but I still keep on checking you out. Little do you know that I’m sneaking into your locker after you leave and smelling your used gym shorts, the smell of your sweat and natural odor combined with your hairy pussy giving me an instant hardon.

Or perhaps I’m an intern at your firm, and you realize that I keep on coming into your office to get different forms because you have to lean down to grab them from a drawer, giving me an eyeful of your cleavage. Your tits sag after three kids, but you realize that that turns me on.

Maybe your an average looking milf. That means cellulite, sagging tits, an ass that had dropped a little, a wildly hairy pussy, and more. Or maybe your a pornstar-type bimbo, hotter than anyone else in town! I’m open to most kinks so I’ll just put my limits, which are death, scat, gore, and vomit. As to kinks, why don’t you include those in your message, and we can work out a story."
aa5w26,3,2018-12-27,(M4F) Teen girl’s romance with her boss,swimonland,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/aa5w26/m4f_teen_girls_romance_with_her_boss/,"Lets get the disclaimer out of the way. I’m over 18, you should also be over 18. All ages under that are just roleplay. 

Now then

I’m looking for a roleplay with some build up to be more than just sex and smut (although naturally sex and smut will happen in due time) and go long term. The basic premise? You work for me, you have for a while now, maybe it’s just a part time job you picked up in high school or maybe it’s part of an internship program through your middle school to help get a leg up on real world work experience while earning coursework credits, or some combination of the two. The details of how can be worked out later, but the point is you’ve been working for me for a while now, we’ve developed a bit of a friendship with maybe the occasional harmless flirt here or there.  However as time has gone on I’ve started to notice your developed body more and more, and you’ve started to pick up on how much more enjoyable it is to catch the eye of an older man checking you out.

Things haven’t progressed beyond harmless looking and the occasional wink or comment but aside from that I’ve been like a mentor to you as well as a boss. This year however you’ve seen me under a mountain of stress dealing with running a business and managing a messy divorce. Now that I’m over worked, stressed, and newly single it may be time to go from harmless flirting to something a little more risky.

How do we get to that next level? Do you tease me till I break and take you after hours? Are you shy and reserved until I make my move and seduce you? I’m up for discussion on how things play out but what’s important to me is that we have some kind of a build up to that point and play this out as more than a one night fling.

As far as kinks go my interests are pretty varied but right now my top kinks for this are ageplay (duh) Dom/sub roles (also into role reversal if you prefer to play a young femdom) bdsm, rough sex, dub con/noncon (provided it transitions into consensual as the story progresses) 

Hard limits are toilet play, gore/vore, snuff, feet, your typical “gross stuff” list 


If this is something you are into and you can write more than a couple lines for a reply shoot me a message with the name of you want to play as, your age you are playing,  description of what you look like and what kind of way you want to go about this as far as our relationship changing.  (Pictures are okay for a reference but I do still like something written as a preview into how detailed a writer you are)

If I don’t get to you I’m sorry, sometimes prompts lead to my inbox being flooded 

I look forward to hearing from you!"

I posted here a couple months ago if it would be worth it for me to try the actuarial route since my gpa is legitimate garbage (as in I can't put it on my resume) and I spent my first 2 years in pre-med and dropped it this past summer. I really am thankful for the honest but somehow still positive advice :)

I managed to get a predictive analysis internship at a local company for during the semesters by networking a lot and talking to everyone at a career fair. I was able to explain my situation and how my medical research background gave me transferable skills, went from one referral to the next and through 2 interviews got the position. Never asked for my gpa. 

After putting this on my resume, I actually started getting interviews that weren't just to get to know me, but also asked questions testing my math skills and working with data. The people from this company in particular clicked really well with me and the scheduled 30 minute interviews turned into 45min-1hour long conversations that flowed really well, and two weeks later I got my offer.

Just wanted to post this for other people who have doubts, that if I can do it you probably can too :)"
aa7e0y,1,2018-12-28,I [23f] am sabotaging my life over my breakup with my ex [21f] and her criticisms of me,throwmeawaytbh1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aa7e0y/i_23f_am_sabotaging_my_life_over_my_breakup_with/,"Almost two years ago (shit) I got in a 6-month relationship  (and a 3 month period where we still hung out and hooked up after) with a girl i should have never dated. I got red flag vibes and I was still getting over my first, 3 year long relationship. 

She used to lovebomb me and give me excessive attention. When she dumped me, essentially because she got bored of me, I was still not completely attached to her. I was trying to be careful because I was heartbroken from my first relationship. But I fucked up and kept seeing her for 3 months, probably because her lovebombing made me feel really empty when it was gone, during which I got extremely attached to her. During this time she also kept telling me the reasons she was broke with me. My anxiety, because I'm not assertive, and because I was high strung were 3 key reasons which are also the hardest part of my personality to change. 

I did something good, which was to finally cut her out (I don't think she really wanted me in her life anyway, but kept me in it for the attention and because she was lonely, while she actively looked for other girls). I immersed myself in building a career and school. I actually felt like I was getting over her and it seemed like I was handling the breakup well. 

The next 8-months I worked full time. The first place I interned at, I was totally neglected by my coworkers. They didn't give me enough work to do and they didn't like me. I have extreme social anxiety and have a hard time talking in groups; when I tried to talk they were cold to me, so I ended spending hours and hours alone with my thoughts and nothing to do, analyzing my relationship, feeling hurt by her lies, and also obsessing over her criticism. The way the internship went seemed to validate all her criticism - my lack of assertiveness was why I didn't fit in socially and wasn't getting enough work, my high strung nature was the reason I was stressed, my anxiety was the reason I froze up around others.

My second internship was better, but I still had long blocks of time to analyze. Because I was so anxious from the first, I rarely engaged with my coworkers even thought they were very nice and approachable. 

To make things worse, I started using apps to date and had no luck. I got matches but not a lot of messages and even fewer meetups. None led to anything.

I really think if I got in a relationship in the summer, I would've healed better. I got over my first relationship by getting into the second. But all the time alone I have spent compulsively ruminated over my flaws. I no longer see myself as a likable person. All I do around my friends, even the ones I was confident about, is talk about my flaws and how I feel ashamed to be single. I'm pushing away the friendships that brought me comfort and confidence when I am generally very uncomfortable and not confident, enforcing the traits that my ex hated about me and that stop me from meeting new people. It seems like an endless loop I can't break. I've been spending more and more time alone. 

And my ex, as far as I can tell, is doing great. She's dating, meeting new people, involved in the queer scene which I've been trying and failing to connect to since I came out. She lives near me and I bump into her often, and I'll usually have such a bad breakdown that I can't think about anything positive for a week and I beat myself up and don't talk to anyone.

I'm bitter and I feel used, because I wasn't even ready to date when I met her - she was the one interested in me and pursued me so actively - and now i'm here, losing everything, even my closest friends. It's almost like I'm addicted to finding my flaws and mistakes and criticizing myself. I can't stop. I think I tell someone ""I'm so disappointed in myself"" several times every single day.

I don't know what advice I want. Sometimes I wish I could take back all the negative criticism I said about myself from my friends minds (because now they see flaws about me they never saw before) and somehow like myself. But all the evidence seems to be that I suck - I'm single, didn't do well at my internships and keep showing behaviour that proves why my ex dumped me was valid.

**tl;dr** ex initiated relationship and lovebombed me, then dumped me and told me all my flaws, i spent a lot of time alone and have started fixating on my flaws and pushing my friends alone, making me feel even worse, and I can't break the cycle

aa7puf,74,2018-12-28,My first experience with a daddy,daddysintern,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/aa7puf/my_first_experience_with_a_daddy/,"So this happened a couple of weeks ago.

One day when I was off from school (college) I was bored and a little bit horny and decided to check Grindr. After browsing for a couple of minutes I received a message from a man who was in my vicinity. His profile said that he was 45 years old and his pic was only of his body (and not his face) but he looked pretty muscular and had some hair on his chest and over his abs. The only other thing I noticed was his bulge in the gym shorts he was wearing in the picture. I am 20 years old but I have always had a thing for older men so this was a pleasant surprise. In his message he sent a picture of his face and it took me couple of seconds to figure out where I recognized him from…

For context: a couple of weeks before this I was interviewed for an internship at a company. The interview went very well even though I was very nervous. The interviewer was a bald man with a grey beard and if I would have to guess I would say that he was in his 40s. At the time of the interview I did not focus so much on him as I was more focused on answering his questions. Well, I guess you can figure out the rest by now. 

The day before I got the Grindr message, I had received the news that I had gotten this internship which I will be starting in January. ”Do you recognize me?” he messaged me after sending his face pic. He was obviously recognizing me from my profile pic. Although I was a bit embarrassed at first we messaged each other back and forth for a little while. However, since I will be working at the same place as him in a couple of weeks, I thought that we would just message each other a little bit and then that would be the end of it.

That was until he messaged me: ”So, are you looking?” and ”Can you travel?”. Without even thinking I answered yes to both questions. We agreed on a time and place (his apartment). I then decided to shower and clean myself before snaping some pics and sending to him. He responded with a pic of him completely naked with him holding his thick cock in his hand. I was so excited by this time that I could barely wait.

When I got to his apartment we exchanged pleasantries and spoke briefly about my internship and the job. He was wearing a black suit and tie since he had just gotten home from work and he quickly excused himself to go to the bathroom after we had spoken. I remained seated on the sofa in his living room and looked around a little bit. When he came out of the bathroom he had his dick hanging out of his suit pants. He walked slowly towards me and I put my hand on his cut dick and started stroking it slowly. I could feel it throbbing and growing in my hand as I was stroking it. He took off his suit jacket and his tie and began unbuttoning his white shirt. I looked up into his eyes before I grabbed his balls and put his dick into my mouth.

As I was sucking him off he started to breathe more heavily which eventually turned into moaning. I continued to suck as he eventually started to thrust his entire body back and forth. He then grabbed my head and started to fuck my mouth with his dick until I was almost gagging on it. He eventually stopped to let me catch my breath. I then got back to it at the same time as I was running my hands over his abs and his hairy chest. At this point I was harder than a rock and I started to touch myself over my jeans as I started to taste some of his precum. I paused for a moment to unzip my pants and take my own dick out from my underwear when he suddenly grabbed me by my head again and shoved his dick into my mouth. He started to fuck my mouth faster and faster until I eventually heard him moan loudly and I felt this warmth in my mouth from his cum. I was so unprepared that I immediately swallowed almost all of it without barely thinking. I opened my mouth and showed him some of it and then I cleaned his dick with my tongue. I was kind of disappointed as I had been hoping for more to happen that night and as he had not even taken off his pants yet. He grabbed a small towel and cleaned himself up a bit and then he wiped off some cum that was on my chin. He then threw the towel on the floor and grabbed his dick and started stroking it. I was still sitting on the couch and was about to start getting dressed when he asks me: ”Do you want more?”

I answered him by quickly nodding my head. ”Follow me”, he said and lead me to his bedroom. ”Take off your clothes!” he almost yelled to me as I was about to sit on the bed’s duvet cover. He left the room as I hurriedly took off my shirt and my already zipped down pants and underwear. I laid down on my back on the bed just as he comes back into the room completely naked. He put a bottle of lube on his nightstand and some condoms as well. He then grabbed my dick and started stroking it while I was almost shaking from nervousness but mostly from excitement. He started to lick the head slowly before he completely shoved my dick into his mouth. My pubes met his grey beard as his tongue was working its way around my shaft. I started moaning louder and I had to concentrate so that I would not cum. 

He must have noticed as he then told me to climb further up on the bed. Still laying on my back he grabbed me under my knees and lifted my legs up so that he could see my ass. He dripped some lube on his fingers and gently worked his way into my hole with first one finger and then two. At this point I was edging hard but I managed to concentrate as I felt his fingers work inside of me. ”You like that, huh? You like daddy’s fingers in your tight hole?” I moaned YES! at him while he kept lubing up my ass. 

He quickly slipped a condom on his dick and got it lubed up. He started by teasing me by putting the head in the hole until he slowly pushed it all in. I felt this sensation in my entire body as he started to fuck me quicker. He put one of his hands on my shoulder and leaned in to kiss me as I felt him pulsating inside of me. By now I was moaning louder and louder for every thrust.

”Stand on your knees and lean forward!” I obeyed and quickly got on my knees and leaned forward so that he could now fuck me from behind. He put some more lube on his dick before once again fucking me in my tight ass. I felt him fondling his hands all over my upper body before he grabbed me by my sides and pushed his dick further and harder into my hole. We kept going in this position for a long time while I continuously tried to not cum. Everytime that I asked him to slow down he only did so for a couple of seconds before going back to the same speed (but I can’t complain can I!). After a while he decided to pull out and he laid down on his back on the bed. 

I grabbed the bottle of lube and put some on his dick and stroked it for a couple of seconds. ”Sit on it!” I obeyed, once again, and positioned his dick into my hole as I sat down on it. I moved my body up and down on his dick and felt this stinging sensation in my hole that seemed to grow stronger. It was clear that this was his favorite position both from his moans and the smile on his face. Although after a while I felt like I would not be able to hold it in anymore and I told him that I was about to cum.

He signaled to me to get off and so I did. He got down on his knees and started caressing my legs with his hands as I was stroking my hard dick over his stretched out tongue. It did not take long before I blew one of the biggest loads I ever have into his mouth as he had started to suck my dick. I stood there and continued to breathe heavily as I watched this man, more than double my age swallow my cum. He quickly got up on his feet and then laid on his back on the bed and began stroking his dick quickly. Only a couple of seconds later his load was all over his abs. I grabbed his dick and started sucking it just like I had done it earlier. I then licked him over his abs and tasted his cum (a taste that I by this time had become used to). 

He went back into the living room and came back with a towel for me. I swiftly got myself cleaned up and put all of my clothes back on and once again exchanged pleasantries with him before leaving. When I got outside I noticed for the first time that it had already gotten dark out. I made my way home as quickly as possible and took a long shower while jerking off thinking about this experience. I almost completely forgot that this man is not just some man from Grindr, but also my future co-worker! I am now more excited than ever to being my internship in his office! And hopefully this was not the last time I get to taste his cum ;)

aa9913,0,2018-12-28,Student (intern) trying to get a room in Dublin,OuterMe,Dublin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dublin/comments/aa9913/student_intern_trying_to_get_a_room_in_dublin/,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

First a bit of background:

I recently got offered an internship at a known tech company in Dublin. My start date will most probably be in March 2019.

My income with all the benefits should be \~45k € per year, although my internship only lasts for 6 months. However, there is an option to extend it or possibly get an additional internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a look on [daft.ie](https://daft.ie) ... WOW.

For perspective, I come from a EU country where we pay 150€ for a single room in a dorm (with shared kitchen, bathroom).

&amp;#x200B;

So, here are my questions:

* Are there better alternatives to regular renting, for example a dorm or something (I will still have student status till 2020)? I've searched a bit and only found dorms where there's a 40+ week stay limit which sucks for me. :/
* I've read about the landlord auctions on viewings. Is this still a thing? If so I would pretty much have to get an AirBnb for a month in order to be able to secure a place when I'm actually in Dublin, right (no chance to settle this remotely)?
* How far in advance should I actively start looking for a place (emailing, calling, etc.)?
* Is there good chance to get a decent private room relatively near (&lt;20 min bus ride) the Docks for under 1.5k?
* Any other advice (except for not coming to Dublin in the first place 😂)?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Found some interesting alternatives to daft:

* [https://erasmusu.com](https://erasmusu.com) (for students)
* [https://www.spotahome.com/](https://www.spotahome.com/) (allows to settle a contract remotely)
* [https://hostingpower.ie/](https://hostingpower.ie/) (for students)

Does anybody have any experience/thoughts on them and their prices?"
aa9bxo,27,2018-12-28,Any input on what I should do regarding my career is appreciated.,mkonu,bangalore,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/aa9bxo/any_input_on_what_i_should_do_regarding_my_career/,"I am 25, living in Bangalore, unemployed and sort of unskilled. So I graduated from a UK university with a very low percentage (49%) in IT management(BSc. Honors degree), tried getting job in UK but was out of luck. 

Came to Bangalore searched for a job for 6 month and finally was able to get into an internship for 6 months. In that internship, I had no work to do. Time went by quick and I was worried because there was no work so there was no way they would make me permanent. They had opening for a QA intern and hastily I took it up. Work was minimal this time but in the end they let me go. After this, I got a job immediately as a Project coordinator in a start up. The work was okay but the hours were really bad for me. It was a start up of 7-8 people and everyone used to come at 9-10am and stayed until 8-9pm. They had work but not me. I wasn't in any way helpful to them. I mostly worked with clients and let developers know the changes clients want. I communicated between client and developer for two minor projects. Decided that I couldn't stay 10-12 hours everyday for this kind of work. I quit after 5 months thinking perhaps management is not something I see myself doing. After 3-4 months, I interviewed for another role which I was accepted into. While the title says 'Project coordinator', the work was coordinating with employees regarding their accesses and the team that assigns the access. I kept track of who had access to what and managed two tools which manages the reports in the company. I resigned because of my manager who was a prick, all I could think was when I could just get out of there.

In all of my jobs, I spoke well but apart from that didn't gain any valuable skill. I guess the second job was where I could have gained some good project management skills but the hours were too much. And now, It's been 6 months since my last job and I am hopeless, unmotivated. I didn't choose my degree, my dad did. I never had interest in any specific course. Passionlessly, I just went with things thinking I might like something but I am still neutral about things. Don't know where my passion lies. Will going to a career counselor help? Does anybody know if it works?

Been thinking of getting into Data science field(only because I have to do something to earn and also it would be a clean slate probably).  

What do you think I should do? 
1. Go with Data science and see how things will pan out? I have been looking into an institute called 'Great learning', does anybody know how good the institute is? Or is there a better one?

2. Should I try to do masters?  That is of course presuming that universities take me. Thinking of doing a MS in Data science since it is kind of hot right now or some kind of MBA.

3.  Business is an option but I have no idea what I would do business in.

4. I have always been interested in PC games, should I pursue something like game development?

5. If you can, what would you suggest?

If you have any questions, please feel free."

I was a pretty happy child until the age of about 11. I liked to take care of people, was well respected (called ""mum"" by fellow kids at kindergarden), and over-achieving at school effortlessly. My parents have been seperated since I was 3 years old. Because both of them were constantly there for me, I didn't really care or feel like something was off with my fam or anything.
Things changed when my parents decided to lice in a shared flat together despite being seperated for financial reasons (my dad is broke and in debt) - great idea, I know! Conflicts came up, I started noticing things weren't going great with them etc. My father eventually left to go to a monastery, not to become a monk but to find spiritual healing or whatever. He was an atheist before converting to catholicism. I would only see him about 2-3 years from then on, but one of the biggest problems in my family has always been that my parents are incredibly bad at both having conflicts and dealing with or expressing their emotions, so that wasn't really talked about. So I felt depressed for the following years, but I didn't realize why. I lost all of my friends and wasn't interested in them anymore, because I felt like they were stupid. I developed a huge deal of social anxiety as a consequence and would barely go out, distracting myself with the computer, movies, music and books mostly. I also ate a lot and moved little, so I put on some weight. I was never really overweight, but because I was also tall I would always feel massive compared to the girls around me. Also where I am from (Europe) people are generally pretty thin. My mum didn't make any serious attempts at stopping these obviously destructive behaviors. I became sick of it eventually and managed to make a couple of friends in high school, but I still never felt like I was fitting in. I fought a lot with my mum and moved out when I was 18 even though I was still in school. My escape from all of this was being good at school. I didn't like school, but it was something I was good at that got me at least some self-esteem.

I don't remember any guy my age ever being interested in me, but I wasn't either. I matured early, so I fell in ""love"" with a teacher of mine at some point, and that was it.

My self-esteem regarding guys was extremely low. I always wanted a relationship, I still believe it's the key to a happy and fulfilled life. I left my home town when I was 19 and worked in the cultural sector as a project manager. I met a lot of new people and had a few crushes on a couple of guys my age, but they never liked me back. I don't really know why, I was probably too much in my shell, my self-hatred was shining through and I am also not the prettiest of women. Whatever the real reason for this was, it was now ingrained in me that no one would ever be interested in me.

My life got chaotic. I didn't have any goals because I had too many possibilities (no guidance from family or family tradition, no desire to follow my parents path in any way, a lot of possibilities because of a diverse skill set and good grades in pretty much everything). I worked and did internships for a couple of years to figure myself out. During that time, I met my first boyfriend. I was 22 and he was 20. He came from an extremely privileged background (his parents are a school leader and a university professor), he skipped two class levels, thus he was getting his bachelor's at 20 while I was still trying to figure out what to even study. He was highly intelligent - but he also had pretty low emotional intelligence and is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. So pretty much the opposite of what I needed. At the time I felt happy, but looking back, it wasn't a good relationship because he couldn't give me what I would have needed at the time - some emotional support. He dumped me after 6 months without warning and refused to keep up contact altogether. And that was pretty much when I cracked. All the negative emotions that had built up in me just came out and I had a breakdown. I woke up one day and just didn't know what to do, how to get through the day. I went to the doctor on my own. I went to treatment to a psychiatric clinic for 8 weeks on a daily basis and was diagnosed with depression. While I am not sure how much this has helped, it has definitely helped me in realizing that the way I had been suffering for the last ten years wasn't normal, or puberty, or a part of growing up. That I was not wrong for wishing someone would take care of me.

Things could have gone uphill from here, but unfortunately, I met another guy. I have a history of falling for people I can't have and he was another one of them. He was also younger than me, good looking, taken at the time, but, most importantly to me at that point, he was a people's person. We met in a context where I had some authority over him and he saw me as his mentor, while I, well, didn't see myself as such lol. I crushed on him in an extremely unhealthy way, so much so that I was unable to talk like I normally would around him. It was the kind of crush little teenaged girls have, but it's not really the same kind of adorable when you are 23. We were somewhat close, but we mostly got drunk together. He was left by his girlfriend at some point. I don't know the details, but I sure do know that he has suffered a lot. This crush was a pretty long one. When I confessed to him he reacted on a pretty angry and unconstructive way to push me away. It was pretty classic actually. He said he liked me as a friend and we discussed it in a civil way a couple of months later. He told me that he was annoyed by me not expressing my emotions, my needs or anything really. He also implied that I am not his type physically and I dealt with that. I didn't fully let him now why I am the way that I am because from how he has reacted and how he sees the world in certain aspects I am quite certain that he wouldn't understand. Our relationship has started as a shipwreck anyways. The problem was that I gained quite a lot of confidence back when I finally started going to college last year. We didn't see each other regularly anymore, but when we met at parties he would always seek me out and talk one on one with me for hours. I didn't have the heart to shut off in that kind of situations because after all, I still like him more than any guy I have met before, even though I know it is never going to happen. He has a new girlfriend now anyways, and since I know that I try to avoid contact with him all together. The last time I saw him was about half a year ago or something. I know that this shouldn't be relevant to my current situation anymore, but I just needed to provide some context into why I feel the way I feel all the time: ugly, unloved, not worthy of love, broken.

I had a bunch of purely sexual encounters in the last year, probably to compensate. It is quite funny really, while I am sure that no one will ever want to date me, I have no problems initiating sex with guys when I am interested, even when I am convinced they are a lot more attractive than I am. I had a fling with a guy from my school for a couple of months, but he recently informed me that he got out of a shitty relationship and isn't interested in one, so there is that.

So yeah, I am 26 now and feel pretty bad. I do want to date and I am quite sure that I am able to be in a relationship. Because of my past I am pretty empathetic. I care about people (sometimes too much obviously). I will be getting through college but my academic achievements are nowhere near what they used to be, because I get distracted a lot. I feel so lonely that sometimes it is all I can think about. I have quite a lot of friends, both male and female,but that doesn't really help.

Right now, I am wondering what to do next. There is no one in my life right now I am seriously interested in and there is no one I know of who is interested in me. Most of the people at my school are a lot younger than I am and I am not really looking to ever trying that again lol. I don't know if I should just focus on school and try to kick ass (which feels like compensation, yet again) and look for love once I have settled in the professional world. I will be pushing 30 then though and I don't really want to be alone for another four years. Right now, I just don't know what to do. I am thinking about getting therapy again. I thought an outside perspective might help. Thank you if you have made it through this. "
aaa5px,1,2018-12-28,"Still feeling guilty over how my ex-best friend and I ended things, because maybe I could have done better",amarillodbverde,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aaa5px/still_feeling_guilty_over_how_my_exbest_friend/,"We'll call her Sally.

Sally \[24F\] and I \[24F\] went to the same high school and we were inseparable, then we went to the same uni, but different courses. We got super busy over the years and when third year of uni hit (2014), we didn't talk as much anymore, with thesis and internships in line.

*Some backstory and info, because it's kinda important before I proceed what happened 2014 onward:*

* Sally has attachment issues. Since high school, she has been repeatedly telling our friends and I (mostly me) never to leave her and such. Maybe I missed out on the signs, being just 16 and naive, but she was possessive. By our fourth year in high school, I gained friends outside of our circle and she got pissed. Sally didn't talk to me until we graduated and we were back to normal. In my four years in high school, only in my senior year that I actually had other friends-- hell, other people that liked talking to me.
* She has this slight issue of being kinda, obsessive, with the people she likes. It was just something to laugh about in high school, but it became a little worrisome in uni. We'll get to that later.
* She has a tough home life. Verbally abusive and un-supportive mom and all. She's... well, she has been the type to self-diagnose herself. Since high school she's told me she has agoraphobia and depression. This also carried on until uni.
* Sally has gotten upset when we wouldn't throw a surprise party for her on her birthday (we were poor high school kids, she lived far away and transportation to her house was hard, and her birthday is in the summer). She also has this thing of buying roses for herself to make her feel better, and she'd ask us to get her roses too for that reason.

*Now,* around 2015, we tried talking again and hanging out. It just... really didn't feel the same anymore. She was clearly not happy with her life. She kept saying she's depressed, and I told her that  she should consider therapy because the more I tried staying and listening to her, the more it felt I couldn't help her and she was spiraling. I was worried. I tried to be there for her, got her roses when we would talk, hell, even bought the shoes she liked.

She also developed quite a crush on a guy in uni, and she's been stalking him. She follows him the way home, she knows where he lives, she knows his class schedules and she follows him into the library. It's kind of alarming, I told her, and maybe it's not healthy. Sally didn't like my response.

Over the months she leaned in on me to support, it's been affecting me more negatively than expected. I still had uni and I had my own share of family problems, so I became less there for her to focus on my own health and problems. We drifted apart again, and she began to be dependent on one of our mutual friends. Eventually, this mutual friend also started to emotionally and mentally collapse with Sally's dependency that she sought me for help because she didn't know what to tell Sally.

This continued with the rest of our friends until no one really stayed in to listen to her anymore. We tried telling her to get therapy, seek medications, etc. But no. She was firm that she could fix it on her own and all she needed were her Asian dramas and began to obsessively crush on a new guy she met online. Eventually she believed that none of us understood her and that we left her, the one thing she has been telling us not to do.

I know she's toxic. And when I decided to cut her off completely from my life in 2017 (she had been badmouthing *me* in particular to other people saying I wasn't a good friend, learned that she was shitting on me to other people because I had good uni friends and she did not, and deleted me from her social media connections), I believed that it was the right thing to do. Because, why would you want someone who refuses help to get better? Why try to keep someone who is obviously dragging you and your life down because they don't want to get help? So there's no contact since 2017 (she has also ignored me when we had that one single gathering for our friend's baby shower), and life has... considerably gotten healthier.

However, I still feel guilty that maybe if I had done better, maybe if I was a better listener, maybe she would have gotten better? I still feel guilty that she lost friends at the time she seemed to need company the most, but she was draining everyone else. I'm not sure. Am I the bad guy after all for lack of consideration? Should I go and apologize to her after all these years?

*TL;DR:* Ex-bff was depressed, lonely and kinda toxic and even though I know this and already cut ties with her, I still feel guilty because I might have done better to help her, or at least become more considerate and patient. Not sure if I should feel rightfully guilty or not. Am I the bad guy after all? Should I go and apologize?

https://i.redd.it/6j4tvkyrw0721.jpg

You’ve chosen your co-founders &amp; partners and even your first intern so carefully that you’ve even spent nights thinking about them (we’re not judging)!

And yes indeed, [if you’re a Startup or an SME, hiring the right people is as IMPORTANT as your Cash Flow!](https://www.reddit.com/user/Studaro_Blogs/comments/aaafbk/if_youre_a_startup_or_an_sme_hiring_the_right/)

But what’s next?

You’ve spare bean-bags to fill in your office and people to take care of matters you don’t have enough time for or are not that much adept in. You need a steady supply of the right people to do the right job so that you can focus on broader aspects of your business. In other words, you need a proper plan for effective Human Resource Management.

But how can you decide who’s the right person for the job? You know your requirements and you know the type of people you are looking for, but how do you know how to choose the right candidates for your company? If you don’t exert enough importance on this, there might come a time you might regret accepting the wrong person or rejecting the right one.

And trust us, nothing can be more regretful than letting the right person go. You really don’t want to be in a position where you feel like – *“I should have hired that person!”*; or worse *“I should NOT have…”*

So, let us assume the following:

* You have a new position in your company, let’s say, a Jr. Business Developer.
* You are mainly looking for a young potential for the job – a young graduate, who has at least a first experience in Sales / Business Development (B2B / B2C).
* You are not too picky about the person’s work experiences but what you care about the most is the right attitude.

Now that you’ve figured out exactly what you need from this vacancy, you would want to start the hunt, right? You wouldn’t want to lay behind in the War for Talent out there!

But where would you go?

Maybe to one of the most trusted recruitment platforms that are out there? LinkedIn?

You would want to advertise this vacancy on LinkedIn and maybe tap all other recruitment platforms out there as well, which are relevant to your business, right?

But are you aware of the sad truth of recruiting?

https://i.redd.it/gbzyowu5x0721.png

# 

# The sad truth of Recruiting: It’s expensive!

&amp;#x200B;

If you have ever posted a vacancy on LinkedIn you would know the pain. If you don’t have a specified pre-allocated budget for recruiting for a specific vacancy in your company, you can expect to lose quite some money for futile endeavours. And sadly, job posting on LinkedIn is not that much of a comprehensible science when compared to any other digital platform, like Google, Bing or Facebook.

So, if you don’t know what we are talking about, here’s a quick peek at the process of posting a job on LinkedIn:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/v668swpdx0721.png

* **The Job Post:** You write your Job Title, Job Description and information about your company; mention the Job Poster (optional); add and In-Apply Button (optional) where applicants directly send their CV’s with a few clicks, and add the company logo. But you’re not done yet.
* **The Budget:** Once you are done with the above, you have to provide a budget for LinkedIn to show this Job Post to potential candidates across its network. And it’s here that it gets painful.

LinkedIn Job Posts function on a CPC (Cost Per Click) basis, where you (the job-poster) pay every time someone clicks on your post. You decide the Daily/Lifetime Budget for displaying your job post across LinkedIn and it assesses all the bids (from other job posters) to charge you a certain amount per click.

And although you can set a Bid Cap (the maximum amount you would want to spend for a click) on your post, honestly, being a new user it’s difficult to be aware of the right amount.

And although other ad-serving platforms are somewhat transparent on their algorithms for assessing the CPC, LinkedIn does not do so satisfactorily. As a result, you are in a *gray area* when it comes to critically analysing the cost for your job post.

So, coming back to our example of the Jr. Business Developer vacancy, there are two major concerns regarding posting this job on LinkedIn:

1. If you would want to keep showing the job post for, let’s say, 2 weeks and if you would want to spend around EUR 50 per day (believe us it’s pretty hard to have a budget less than that), you can expect to spend around EUR 700 in just two weeks! And that is only for people clicking on your post.
2. Moreover, those who click might not always be relevant for your business/vacancy and of those who might be relevant, many may not always apply. So, you end up with some number of CV’s (from great to average to trashy) amidst which you have to find the right candidate. It’s one big of a burden and it might be the case that you end up spending EUR 700 for this vacancy and still didn’t get the right candidate or worse, you have to reluctantly choose one amidst the available candidates just to honor the massive expenditure.

And apart from LinkedIn, should you consider posting the vacancy on any other platform? Absolutely yes!

But where?

If you wish, you can post the vacancy on other job portals simultaneously. But in any case, the portals will either charge you with similar bills like LinkedIn or will be too commonplace to provide you with good talent options.

So, are there no free platforms for posting vacancies? Yes, but like all things in life, they do come with their own challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

# The disadvantages of Online Recruitment: Too much for too little!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **It’s hard to get the Right Talent:** It’s not an exaggeration to say that there is a War for Talent out there, in such a booming economy like Belgium. Every organization out there is doing its best with Employer Branding, Candidate Entertainment, Informal Networking and every other luring tool imaginable (and unimaginable) in order to seduce the best talent the market has to offer. In such a scenario, a simple online job post might be too expensive for too little value.
2. **It’s pretty Expensive**: Just as we mentioned earlier, if you don’t have a specified budget for recruiting for a particular vacancy and are not strategic enough about utilizing that budget across different platforms, you can expect to lose the entire amount and still bear the risk of not getting the right candidate for the job. And depending on the online platform you use, there might be other costs involved like subscription fee or membership fee or charges for extra services like application tracking or analytics.
3. **It’s quite hard to target the Right Audience**: Again, as we mentioned earlier, although it’s not a rocket science to target the right audience for the job post, it’s not a small ordeal either. The visual impressions for the job post may not always come from the right candidates but might still end up paying for them.
4. **It’s difficult to Measure Effectiveness**: If you are not subscribed to any membership plan, it’s unlikely that you will have access to a lot of relevant and important data regarding the effectiveness of your job post itself and its performance. And without data, it will be a blind game to say the least.
5. **It’s not easy to surf through the pile of CV’s**: You must know that in the majority of job platforms, the application itself doesn’t cost any money. So indeed, there is no harm in applying from a candidate’s perspective. But from your end? You end up paying for candidates who might not be relevant for your vacancy and to make things even worse you will have to surf through piles and piles of submitted CV’s to pick up the right one. It’s one hell of a burden, to be honest!
6. **Free Platforms aren’t free; just like everything else in life**: You might be feeling pretty good of yourself after posting a vacancy on an online recruitment platform which is free, but bear in mind other job posters are feeling the same as well! When it comes to free job portals, there is such oversaturation of job posts that candidates are almost pampered with choices and you might end up with nothing at the end of the day for all the time that you invested in it. And time is money!
7. **You might need extra hands on the desk**: Being a startup or an SME, you already have quite a lot on your table to finish off by the end of the day. And given the complexity of online recruitment or simply the attention that it demands for effectiveness, you might be better with an extra pair of hands taking care of it. But then again, it’s an extra pair of hands!
8. **The possibility of Fraudulent Applications**: As you make your job post public, there are always possibilities of people applying for the vacancy just to gather information regarding your company in order to target you some other proposals. And the worse thing is, you end up paying for such applications.

So, given all these disadvantages, is it completely devoid of value to take up online job posting for recruiting your next team member?

Obviously not!

With proper attention and a dedicated team and budget allocated for extensive Employer Branding, online recruitment can do marvels for any organization, given the fact that almost every candidate today is a digital native.

But that said, to be honest, a dedicated team and extensive spending for Human Resource Management is not always an option for the majority of startups and SME’s. Given all the challenges and obstacles the startup ecosystem in Belgium offers, doing so can even be considered optimistic to the level of foolishness.

So, now you are back to square one and here’s the scenario:

* Online recruiting is too expensive to be taken lightly and you don’t have enough time to invest in it.
* You still need great potentials to boost up your organizational growth.
* But you don’t have enough budget or expertise for finding the right candidate for the job.
* And as a cherry on top, you have no idea how to win the war for talent with such constraints.

To make you feel comfortable, you’re not the only person facing these challenges. Almost every startup or SME in the Benelux in particular and the world at large is facing the same set of difficulties today.

So, would you like to feel more dominant in today’s War for Talent?

Are you looking for a secret weapon for your hiring needs?

Would you like to be future-proof and give your business and extra-edge over the competition and a fresh perspective?

Hello,
I need some help and advice from you all.

I finished my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering and I worked as a statistical analyst for 3 year. Then as I wanted to do a transition into data science, I learned Python programming language and did an internship in it for 6 months.
Now I’m planning to apply for masters in data science in Europe, especially Germany.

I read in some forums that German universities won’t accept someone from mechanical background for their data science program. Now I’m confused if I should really apply and see. I emailed the university for help but they might take some time to reply. 😩 I don’t know if they’ll be detailed about it or not.

I want to know if there are any good universities in Europe where my profile is compatible with their data science programs. 

Please let me know. Thanks a lot.

Rough, dark, corruption, and so much more.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/aaaxli/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood morning DPP. As the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"

I can't stay long enough in one job to be considered a ""known quantity"" that can be recalled upon to vouch for good work. And cannot transition from one job to another before losing the current one. And I believe I'm shooting my career in the foot for it. 

I never get jobs through recommendations. It's always been some sort of blind job application, and I'm tired of the rat race. Incidentally I have a non-CS degree and don't know if it matters or not.

Since starting my career, I mostly take on contract jobs. Although usually these aren't the kind of contracts they pay you good money to recognize the value- they're the kind of contracts that pay low because they're too cheap to pay employer taxes, or they simply don't have that much work to go around. These are mostly all very small companies/startups, and I just pick up the 'scraps' of available work. So being small, also leads to few people to network with. My contractor jobs are very isolated from the rest of the company.

Here's a brief collection of my work history as a programmer:

* Junior part-time job, 3 months. Reason for leaving: fired for under-performing. Followed by 3 months job searching
* Jr. contractor, 18 months. Reason for leaving: not enough work, and I was the least experienced in the company. 6 months job searching
* Jr. PT job. Reason for leaving: came in late too many times (long-ass commute). 2 months job searching
* Contractor, PT, 3 months. Reason for leaving: Not enough available work. 4 months job searching
* Contractor consultant, PT, 20 months. Reason for leaving: Not enough available work, and took new job
* Contractor, 18 months. Reason for leaving: Company layoffs. *20+ months* job searching
* Contractor, PT, 3 months. Reason for leaving: Contract finished, no more work. 8 months job searching
* Contractor, PT, 6 months. Ongoing till today

Out of all these jobs, I made connections more from the 2nd job, 5th job, and current job. But they usually don't know anyone that is hiring when I contact them, nor do they really contact me first about work.

So I am at a standstill on how to build up my reputation after so much time spent not building it. I can see myself with two options:

1. Return to college and complete a CS degree whether as a BS or MS. Use the resources in college to network with people. Talk to professors, join career-oriented clubs, go to job fairs and take internships.

2. Apply to larger companies for full-time roles, and interview prep. I don't know of any good reliable sources for interview prep. I signed up for Interviewing.io in the spring when it was in beta and still am on the waiting list. I'm talking to local developers through a Slack channel to see if anyone has time to interview me, but opening up time is hard.

I am open to other options besides these two. What do you think I should do to build that network and get more used to being recommended/vouched for so I don't have to stay in this rat race forever?"

I'm a recent college graduate and I need some advice, I am in serious trouble and I do not know what to do. I graduated recently in May, and I got a temporary job for the recent political cycle at a large media consulting firm in the dc area. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before this job was just for the political cycle so it ended in November, being aware of this I saved up my money to survive in the dc area while I applied for other jobs. I saved about 3,000 for two months of rent, with my rent being 1,100 I figured I would be okay (high rent I know I am trying to move to a different place with more roommates so I can save more in the future, right now I have one roommate and this is still the price of rent\_. Unfortunately, calamity has struck my family and I had to help my family out with medical bills and this drained my bank account. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, my rent is due the first of the month and I have no money. My bank account is almost 1,000 in overdraft this is because I have needed to survive and take care of myself. In the meantime, I have been interviewing and applying for other jobs since November. I am in the third round of interviews for 4 good government jobs with good pay, so I'm confident I will land a job. I have a great resume with good internship experience so I'm confident I will land something by the end of the month. If I don't get these ones I will just apply to a restaurant or back at the firm I used to work at so I can make some money in the meantime.  Anyways, I am reaching out on this forum for advice for now and the future, I am not sure what to do and I am very scared. My credit score is about 690 which isn't amazing, but it's due to the fact I am a recent grad and haven't had the chance to build my credit score.

&amp;#x200B;

My question for this forum is how do you guys suggest I pay my rent and/or correct my bank account as it currently is? do you suggest a payday loan or another measure, I seriously do not know what to do and I am at my wits end. I currently have one roommate who I would ask to help but he is also a recent graduate and does not have a tremendous amount of money. I would ask my family, but as mentioned before I cannot because of the recent medical emergency.

&amp;#x200B;

Please if anyone has any advice let me know . I just would like some help and guidance to get out of this situation.

Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

A few things:

Be literate please! No text talk/bad grammar. I only rp in 3rd so please do 3rd person! I DO NOT TF! I am looking for a tfer, so please be okay doing that. You should also be okay with me playing as original characters. If you are not, this post isn't for you. Be an active rper. I understand life comes up, just please try to reply as much as humanly possible. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

aacdth,4,2018-12-28,19 A4A a brave new world ... without orgasm,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/aacdth/19_a4a_a_brave_new_world_without_orgasm/,"
I also want to include trans men’s and women and gay and lesbian relationships in this , like a real society 

(Sorry this is a bit long but if you’re kinky I promise it’s worth it)

In this brave new world there are different classes 1.) public and private slaves, 2,) Nullos, 3.) normal people 4.) the elite 5.) breeders

This whole society is based on your need for pleasure.  The elites are essentially working in a pseudo government organization which controls who and when people are allowed to get pleasure or even cum.  This may sound like a hard job which it is but they make it work.  

Imagine if in a quasi free use society all public works, all construction work, jobs like cashiers, servers, waiters, basically anything you didn’t need a masters or doctorate degree to do was done by people who either could not orgasm or have a dulled sense of pleasure.  Higher jobs in society like managers, nurses, accountants, more important jobs where done by people who could experience limited pleasure but where not allowed to cum.  There drive for pleasure is what drove their work.  Above all of them where the elite.  The lived in large mansions across different cities.  Often lower class and higher class people would work directly for elites.

In this society everyone goes to boarding schools where they get to go home on weekends.  Around a younger age when they might start to hit puberty.  The teachers (orders by the elites) put everyone in a chastity device, to ensure they don’t orgasm.  After years of education and testing and job training by the time they’re of age  you are either nulled and destined to either become a public or private slave, or a Nullo who works in society.  You may continue as a normal person, maybe people choose to stay in chastity finding it a great comfort or have a medical procedure which only allows them to orgasm when an elite allows them too.  And the lucky few will become elites.  Those who become elites are usually related by blood or have been in internships with elites or have the very highest test scores.  After they are assigned their class they will spend the next two years at special schools to perfect your role in that class of society. 

More information on each class
1.) public and private slaves:  
They are exactly what they sound like. Public slaves are owned by the state and distributed like telephone booths across the city to be used and private slaves can be owned bought and sold. Both of these are treated like property and can under go a series of different mental and body modifications 

2.) the nullos:
These are the next class up in society , think lower and part of the middle class.  (This process can be different depending on who I rp with and what you want things to be like). With in the nullo class there are different types semi or full. This usually depends on if you’re a lower class citizen or middle class.  For females this either means having your clit and nipples pierced and desensitized so they provide little to no pleasure.  Then the clit will eventually be removed.  This is usually for the middle class the lower class will have the same thing done except their vaginas will be completely removed in a procedure where their cervix and reproductive system is crushed and the opening is sewn shut and after it heals it looks like a smooth patch of skin.  For males (I’m willing to modify how this looks)  it can be anywhere from complete removal of the cock and balls resulting in a very feminine body due to the lack of testosterone almost a femboy ish appearance,  or just the removal of their festivals still resulting in a slightly feminine body  and no increase in cock size once they’re removed ( that’s not a huge issue because by the time they get the procedure most cocks are a minimum of 8 or 9 inches,  as opposed to elite cocks which can be around 1 and a half to 2 feet).  Males also have their nipples pierced.  Although nullos have this procedure they can still get pleasure but whenever they feel like they get close to orgasm it fades which can be infuriating and which is why they devote themselves to their working hoping one day an elite may reverse the procedure and allow them orgasm ... needless to say they’re anal addicts.

3.) “ normal people “:
These are middle class- upper middle class people who live out their lives normally.  Although they live their lives either in chastity which is what most females prefer and many males, although some males opt for a procedure that stops the flow of semen and essentially makes them unable to orgasm.  This class can still have sex and do whatever they wish but they cannot orgasm.

4.) the elites:
This is the highest part of society.  This contains both men and woman they have extremely high libidos and intelligences.  They have the perfect bodies( often through several modifications) and rule over society.  They will hear requests of people who have done extordinary things in their work or have just been doing good for a very long time who went to orgasm. It is up to the elite to decide if and how they get to orgasm.  They are also the head of society and have free use powers over anyone and are the only class who can really afford the private slaves.  Many elites will hold speeches in town squares and will hold a line fucking the first 50 or 100 people in line due to the amazing properties of their huge loaded of cum which includes : happiness, youthful appearance. A clear mind, addiction, higher libido, and cure of diseases 

5,) breeders:
I didn’t mention this class earlier because at any point because any class can become a breeder.  It is seen as a great self sacrifice and honorable thing to do in society to become a breeder and anyone (except slaves) can become breeders.  It means spending the rest of your life in a facility where people who are granted permission to have children by elite can go and have their fertilized egg either implanted into you or for lucky individuals they might get to actually fuck you.

So this only contains men and women but I’d love to include futanari and trans women and trans men "

My girlfriend has been going through med school as I've been working, the entirety of our relationship. So her = broke student, me = reasonably financially stable adult. That's kind of been an unsaid dynamic in our relationship so far. I pay for more things, and I'm ok with that. I've never really thought of it in a misogynist way, more just like a ""this is what I have and you don't have as much of this and I remember what it was like being a student, so I'm happy to do more"". 

I've realised though that now she's finished school and about to wrap up her internship, her income is about to be about double of mine.  I'm genuinely happy for her but if I'm honest I'm a bit worried. I feel like a lot of the value I brought to this was that I was picking up for her and showing her things she'd never experienced before, and now I worry that I'm just going to hold her back. 

TL;DR - used to be the breadwinner, now feeling like I might become obsolete and not sure how to go forward with it."

I'm sharing this story as a warning to others. **Don't let this happen to you!** In early December I got an email from a company requesting an interview for an internship I applied to. They said (among other things) ""...I had previously sent an email requesting some times for you to come in and interview, but wasn't sure if you received that message. If you are still interested..."" At the time I shrugged this off as a glitch and continued the conversation.

Just yesterday I was purging my Outlook when I found their initial email, from a *month* before the one I saw, buried in my ""Junk Email"" folder. That's right - Outlook flagged an internship interview offer as *junk mail* and yanked it from my Inbox. I have never been this pissed off at Microsoft. The vast majority of companies would have hired somebody else within that time span instead of following up. I immediately purged every single automatic email filter that Outlook had enabled.

Obviously you could avoid this problem by habitually checking the ""Junk Email"" and ""Clutter"" folders on the web app, but if you're like me and primarily check email on mobile, this isn't a satisfying answer. I figured out how to disable both of these features through the Outlook Web App, and since it was a pain in the ass to figure out, I wanted to share the steps with all of you.

To disable Junk Email filtering: Click Settings (Gear Icon) &gt; Search ""Block or allow"" &gt; Select ""Don't move email to my Junk Email folder""

To disable Clutter filtering: Click Settings &gt; Search ""Clutter"" &gt; Uncheck ""Separate items identified as clutter""

Regardless of how you choose to deal with this, make sure you don't let Microsoft's idiot AIs lose you a job opportunity.

I have a Bachelor's degree in IT.

I have worked as a tech support but I hated it.

I'm in my early 30s and now I'm living off of my savings. I want to get a job related to python programming asap.

I've started learning to code 8 months ago with freecodecamp, I've learned html, CSS, sass, jQuery,bootstarp and some JavaScript. But the fact that I had to learn so many new frameworks just made me stop and apparently there is a new frame work every 6 months and I felt that I can't keep up with that.

the best part of that learning was that i learned how to set up my portfolio website and how to work with github.

3 months ago, I started a bootcamp in mobile dev, unsure on what I wanted to do, then I realized I hate java and swift and didn't want to get a job as a mobile dev. so basically, I wasted 3 months on a tech that I hate now.

But this taught me that i don't have to restrict myself to programming languages that i don't like.

With the introduction of Flutter and Dart, it's pointless to learn 2 different languages for native development and restrict yourself to java for android and swift for ios. you can write once with Dart and run anywhere and the fact that you can choose a code editor like  VS Code is amazing and faster than android studio and Xcode.

during the bootcamp I did finish some very basic projects like a calculator, we were rushed to learn so many things in 3 months and basically for those apps I copied and pasted the code, mostly not understanding what I was doing and I feel like a fraud.

after these experiences now, I know I don't like JavaScript and I hate Java and Swift and the slow and pathetic android studio and XCode which I had to suffer these three months.

recently i was so sad on why I can't choose a programming language and stick to it, till i saw a video of this guy.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)

He is talking about artificial intelligence, machine learning and some amazing stuff and I realized I had to learn python to enter this world.

So now I'm learning the basics of python with this course:

[https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036)

and plan to do this course to build some projects:

[https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-course/](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-course/)

Right now, I’m enjoying learning python. I think compared to java, JavaScript and swift, this is a sweet language.

But I want to get a job as fast as possible.

this is one of the internships that I’m interested in:

**Candidates must have:**

**·competency in at least one of the following languages: Python, Java, C#, C++**

**·knowledge of fundamental computer science concepts such as data structures and algorithms**

**·knowledge of software design, architecture and patterns**

**·comfortable working extensively with version control systems like Git**

But the problem is I don't know anything about data structures and algorithms. they didn't teach that in bootcamp and i really want to apply for this internship.

how can I do that even I'm a newbie in python and I have very noob projects in java and swift, which I didn't understand the building process and just copied and pasted the code.

I don't want to include those projects in my portfolio because I can't explain them if someone asks.

My goal is to work in artificial intelligence and machine learning field.Since I’m new I don't even know the difference but I’m trying to learn everyday and the idea excites me.

I can also learn Django with some tutorials. 

If you have any other advice on how to get a job or internship as a newbie python programmer, please share.

If you have any ideas about best python courses to build a great project, let me know."
aae33a,45,2018-12-28,My ~10 year retrospective,mythr0waway,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/aae33a/my_10_year_retrospective/,"I wanted to share part of my journey to FI, possibly RE. I'm not there yet, but I liked reading about your lives and journeys. Hope that this helps out some of you starting out. Anyway, happy to answer questions, but won't go into specifics since I want to keep some privacy. 

TL;DR - doing well in the Bay Area, renting. Did not go to a prestigious university nor am I a software engineer. I feel grateful and lucky.

Background:

I started University at age 18, but didn’t graduate until I was 24 (and a half). Before graduation, I took 1 year off, accumulated credit card debt from traveling and wanted to GTFO so I graduated. I was fortunate to be able to live at home, but I paid for my in state University education. As background I was a Computer Science major, but in my 4th year I took time off and switched to Humanities, mostly to just be done with school. I paid my way through school. Worked all 5.5 years of it with part time jobs. I was lucky to get a relativity high paying job as a student as an intern, then a research intern, then an IT job on campus. I should note that I was fortunate to also have parents that allowed me to stay at home rent free. That was huge. If not for that I would definitely have been in more  debt.
After graduation I was lucky enough to be converted to permanent, full time  in my IT job in the Government. This was approximately 2005 and I was making $45,000 per year with full Government benefits. I worked there for almost 2 years between my last couple quarters of University and when I left to another for a position as a Systems Analyst (Another Government position) at a rate of $65,000 per year. At this point I have been out on my own for a couple years in an apartment, first a studio then a 2 bedroom with a roommate. I didn’t have a 401k (or 403b for public employees) set up as I was focused on buying my new car (which I financed). It was during this time I read furiously about personal finance - I read blogs after I was done with work everyday and tried to get myself familiar with what I should do - I read books and planned what I should do. I did start a Roth IRA at this point with ~$2,000. I was definitely living paycheck to paycheck and probably in debt.

I applied for a job in the Northern California Bay Area at one of the prestigious tech companies (FANG) and to my shock, I was actually offered an entry level help desk type job - base salary was a $20,000 pay cut - $45,000 per year, but this included a 15% bonus and stock grants. This was the end of 2006. I accepted the offer in early 2007 and negotiated the start date to be in a few months later so I could pack up my life. Luck, networking, friends - they all contributed to helping me land something amazing.

The next decade - I worked like crazy, saved well, started to live a little and actually got married. I think I’ve done well so far. I’ve gotten promoted a bunch. I’m solidly in the mid-level, mid-career point. I’m the working class in the Valley. Doing well enough to afford things if I wanted or save, but probably not both. In early 2018 we decided to sell the condo I purchased when I thought I was going to live alone forever (things change and it’s a small 2 bed /  1 bath). We got super lucky and doubled our purchase price. We purchased in Southern California where my family lives. It’s in a good school district and we upgraded to a 4 bed / 2 bath home that’s more than double the square footage. I make more money now than I ever thought possible. Silicon Valley is a crazy place (and crazy expensive). Yes, I’m one of those tech people, but I’m probably on the average here or just below. I know people that have done far better. Friends and coworkers that I know made out like bandits. I’m happy with what I’ve done realive to where I came from. I didn’t go to a prestigious school like many of my coworkers. I don’t have a list of patents, nor am I a software engineer. I’m in one of the PM tracks. Oh and it helped to catch the wave of one of the longest bull runs in history as well as catch the peak of the housing boom here in the Bay Area.

aaenwt,2,2018-12-28,Give Up On Your Dreams,bsteckler,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/aaenwt/give_up_on_your_dreams/,"Seven months ago I finished grad school with a masters degree in urban planning. Since I was 14 I've known I wanted to do this. I wanted to go into planning because I saw it as my way to make the world a better place. While in grad school, I had several public sector internships and everyone spoke very highly of me. I thought that life after grad school would be smooth sailing, and that I would finally be able to start improving myself after ten years of struggling with mental health. 

Not so

Just with the same government agencies that I interned with, I have applied to 15 jobs. Not once have I even been interviewed. Nor have I been interviewed for the dozens of other jobs with nonprofits, local, state, and federal governments, or companies that I've applied for. My degree isn't worth shit, and I've spent $70,000 on it. If the economy tanks next year like everyone is anticipating, I may never get a job in my field, or even advance from my current position, working part time at a construction site. 

The results of my employment search have not given me any reason to suggest anything will improve. I guess I'm not good enough, and never have been. I don't even know why I'm still trying at this point. We do not live in a society that places value on ambition. "

Every company is chock-full of PhD's. It feels like a PhD is the new masters degree. I've been an unpaid intern for 6 months coding bleeding-edge models in Theano for a pharmaceutical startup, and learned TensorFlow and PyTorch on the side. Callback rates for applications is maybe 1 / 20. Of those, maybe 1 / 5 turns into an in-person interview. Every in-person interview has been with a team where I'd be the first non-PhD hire. These are not top-tier firms either. It's entirely possible that New York City is just extremely competitive in this regard. So, I've been seeking Houston jobs lately, but fairing no better."

Hope you all are having a wonderful holidays. Today is my 90th day, and I am extremely excited to share this day and my past three months experiences with you all. I hope that the experiences and advice I have helps you achieve your goal as well. Keep in mind, however, this is purely anecdotal and things I say may not be exactly the same for you. Also, to be honest, I never had a true problem with pornography (for example, going to Pornhub to watch porn as I never understood the enticement to watch random people have sex). I would instead use Instagram and or past experiences while fapping, which honestly in hindsight is just as destructive if not *more*. However, my goal was to stop fapping. I fapped daily. I was constantly drained of energy, could not think clearly, and just overall felt useless. I also did not quite fit in even though I knew I did, if that makes sense? Anyways, now that I have prefaced where I started, hopefully this will give you a picture of where I started. I have tried my best to keep note of how I feel as well. This will be broken up into three sections: experiences -&gt; lessons -&gt; advice. So lets start!

**Experiences**

I will just jump into my current streak, and go over how I got to my current streak in the lessons section. A short preface, I had been trying to do NoFap for almost two years. In late September, I made a deep, conscious decision to stop. It was not a grand event. I did not make a post on NoFap saying ""I'm gonna do it/I'm done fapping"" type of post. It came from within and was actually sort of quiet. Something changed in me. When I first started, I took each day one step at a time. Around day 10 is where it got interesting. I knew this girl from home, but we had never met before. It was one of those ""I know of you but I've never met you"" sort of relationships. I had noticed that she had liked a good amount of my tweets on Twitter. However, I felt she was *way* out of my league. Like, there was absolutely no shot she would be in my league (later did I figure out, I was just selling myself short. I had no self confidence!). Eventually, I slid in her DM's, and long story short, we hit it off *fast*. I got her snap, and it went from there. We talked every single day, whether it was snap, texting, FaceTime, sharing tweets, etc. The attraction was building, and I believe we were both feeling it. 

I want to digress here for a bit, however. During these times, it would've been very easy to fall into constantly texting her and giving her all of my attention. During NoFap, I focused on myself. I was in the midst of an 18 credit semester; sometimes I would not respond to her for a few hours. My bed time was 9:30PM and getting up at 6AM, where her going to sleep was around 2AM and I would sometimes fall asleep on her. What I'm trying to say here is: yes, I was excited to be talking to this girl. There were times where I would wake up and think ""todays the day she loses interest and we stop talking"". However, I focused on myself and my surroundings. I talked to her when I could. This helped me balance my emotions, which I think is what NoFap is really good at. Before, I know that I would've been so caught up on the possibility of sex that the relationship would have faltered eventually. I was keeping my emotions in line -- not letting them get unbalanced and getting caught up with her. The biggest thing here was keeping my emotions in check and focusing on bettering myself in all aspects of life. Continue. 

There were times during this, however, that I SO badly wanted to relapse. I mean, think about it, she's unbelievably attractive, giving me attention as well, sending less-than-modest snapchats -- the temptation to relapse was insanely bad. However, every time I would want to fap or even edge, I would tell myself, ""No. You know this is bad for you, first off. You are genuinely enjoying this girl and building a relationship. Why in hell would you risk changing anything? 5 seconds of fapping pales in comparison to how much joy and happiness this has brought you so far"". So I didn't. From days 10-35, it was one of the most exhilarating times I've had in my life in a while. My self confidence was off the charts. Here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen: when I talk to a girl over text for a while, I get bored. I have to do something eventually or I will get bored. One night, she told me that I could trust her and that I could tell her anything. Well, I told her yes, I believe that the way the relationship is going, that that would eventually happen, but we NEEDED to hangout. Anyways, she did. She invited me to her apartment the following weekend (Veterans day weekend. Here's that post -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9vk5wi/going_to_a_girls_apartment_this_weekend/ ). We got that scheduled, however keep in mind we never met. We had only facetimed/snapchat/texted. Around Day 35, I hit a flatline. I flatlined, and I would not say that I lost the ""superpowers"", but I just felt calm -- almost hollow. I didn't feel drained; I was just scaled back. I didn't have nearly the same amount of erections that I had before that. Instead of feeling super depressed, I took this time to relax and get in touch with my softer side. There are ebbs and flows to life -- this was the ebb and I addressed the quieter side of my soul that had been sort of neglected for the first month. However, the Monday before I was supposed to go to her apartment, she asked me if I wanted to get dinner in her hometown (my flatline broke literally the day before. I had energy and everything came flowing back. It was amazing!). I agreed, and we had a great night. It was purely emotional. We hugged and held hands, but there was nothing sexual and I was completely okay with that. It was perfect to break the ice, and I really need that emotional connection before being sexual. After that date, everything seemed perfect. However, when I went over that weekend, it was absolutely terrible. For sake of me not having to re-type it, I posted this comment on u/whitetrihard 's post on self worth: 

&gt; Self appreciation and self worth become very strong and deep. For example -- I went over to a female's apartment for a weekend (she was two hours away at a university that was completely foreign to me -- she was also the most attractive girl I've ever been emotionally invested in). We went clubbing both nights, and the second night we went to her teammate's 21st birthday party and then to the club. That night, she left me to fend for myself. She basically left me by myself and did not introduce me to anyone or check up on me. Of course, I was able to have conversations with random ass people. But you know what I did? After feeling so worthless (because to me it felt like she did not give a fuck what happened to me that night), I left early the following morning without saying a word. She apologized insanely once she realized I was gone and called me 7x, but I just kept going. I'm worth more than that, and I won't suck up to a woman no matter how attractive she is. Value yourself first and foremost.

I was actually really upset after that. I had no closure from the situation, and when you go from talking to someone everyday to not speaking to them, that takes a toll on your emotions (even if it is was only for a month). This was a trying time. I had rooted my streak in this relationship. Now that it was over, the future was unknown (ended around day 47). I no longer had the weight of the relationship to give me purpose to my streak. I had a choice here -- would I allow this situation to bring me down and relapse, or take it for what it was worth, appreciate it, and continue to better myself? My logic was this -- if I can attract one of the most beautiful girls that I've ever spoken to, then the who knows what the future holds. I continued the streak, working every single damn day on myself. I have an unbelievable amount of self-worth and confidence (another post on that here -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/a924uc/day_85_im_the_shit/ )

To get away from the relationship, since I am coming near the end of my college education, moving into industry is coming up. I am a Computer Science major and have an area of concentration in Cybersecurity Engineering. I'll be honest, I never understood in the past how my friends got internships and I never did. Not to sound condescending, but I had friends who I felt that I had more knowledge than getting internships and I wasn't -- why? I believe it was because without NoFap, I wasn't sure of my skill set. I was not confident when I spoke. Brain fog affected my ability to think clearly; when an interviewer would ask me to explain an algorithm or create one, I would just stammer and could not get through it which would bomb the interview. In the past fifteen days, I put out my first round of job applications in the field for the first time in a year and revamped my resume. I got one interview (I cannot disclose what company or where). Before I had that interview, I got two more e-mails from hiring managers, they were also impressed with my resume, and also wanted interviews. I had one interview last week, and the conversation was free-flowing. I got grilled on algorithms/networking/software design -- yet I believe my anxiety was so low due to NoFap that I was able to effectively not only answer, but be a *normal person*. Subsequently, I got a job offer from them the following day doing exactly what I want in my field. They will also be flying me up at the end of January. I put this completely on NoFap and the ability to be rooted in my own self-confidence and worth.

I will admit this though: Throughout the streak, I still have yet for anyone to say that they've noticed a change (albeit, some might be nervous to say something or just dont care to). But the thing is, it does not matter in the slightest. If I know there's changes and I see them before my eyes, that's the proof I need.  



**Learning Experiences**

I just want to take time to express how *hard* it was. Ladies and gentlemen, it took me almost two years to finally reach 90 days. You can see here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6otlde/blue_balls_and_how_to_relieve_them_without_sexual/

that that was the first post I ever made in the NoFap community. It has been a very long and hard road. There were highs -- and of course lows. One of the biggest struggles I had when I first started was that I could never make it past 14 days. For some reason, any time 14 days would roll around, I would relapse. It could have been mental, I'm not sure. However, that was the first roadblock. I must've failed at 14 days probably at least five times. I would relapse, and then binge. There were times where I'd get a 14 day streak, relapse, and then relapse again, and then not try again for a few weeks. Eventually, the way I got over this, was on that fourteenth day, I would keep myself out of my apartment. The first time I broke through 14 days, I made it to 18 days. Although I relapsed, I did not discourage. I had proven to myself I was capable of this. After getting over that obstacle, I could only get to about 20 day streaks, and then relapse for a week, then try again. I was still on Tinder, Instagram etc. which I knew I should delete, but I just could not bring myself to it. I also suffered from edging really bad. This was something that I had convinced myself that was *not that bad* since I was not ejaculating. However, it was just as bad and had me feeling just as terrible as a full blown relapse the following day. However, I am not sure what changed, but after a few months of that cycle, I busted out a 45 day streak. During this streak I edged and did not build many new habits. I did experience the typical pluses, like less brain fog, increased awareness/wit, less social anxiety etc. but they were still inhibited by edging and just a lack of new habits. 

Once I relapsed after the 45 day streak, I binged for a few more weeks and barely could get passed a few days. It just seemed hopeless and the pluses just did not seem that great. I was trying to stick to NoFap, but only half-heartedly. After this past summer, I decided to try it again. I am going into my fourth and final year of college, and I was really quite ashamed that I had not rid myself of this. I had seen posts on r/NoFap about people who would give anything to have their youth back, and this really helped put it in perspective. I learned to stay out of my room. I learned to push myself out of my comfort zone. I worked out in the gym long before NoFap. I also learned that the days where I would have urges or I felt a surge in energy were the days where I would go the hardest, knowing that if I exhausted myself that I would have less of a chance to fap later. The biggest thing I learned was to take each day one step at a time and to never get complacent. I learned throughout the 90 days that NoFap is simply not about the superpowers or impressing other people -- it is about improving yourself and realizing your own self-worth.

**Advice**

First off, temptations do not have one specific attack vector; there are many many ways they can creep in and you must be on guard at all time. Every single day, you must wake up and realize that it is a new battle. I deleted Tinder, as I realized that it was a trigger and that I can meet females in person. You must figure out your big triggers and work your way down to specific triggers. Another thing I would say is to go to sleep early. I am going to sleep at 9:30PM and waking up at 6AM. The first three weeks sucked, I'm not going to sugarcoat. I would wake up and try so hard to convince myself to get back in bed. Instead, I got up and *meditated* for 45 minutes everyday. I am Catholic, and I would go in before the Blessed Sacrament and simply just find myself and speak with Christ. If you are not religious, then I would simply say to meditate, but simply find peace and quiet. To me, this is where I made leaps and bounds of progress in self-worth. Becoming in tune with myself and starting the day early doing this allowed me to set the tone for the rest of the day. I believe meditation in general is the most important part of NoFap. I never did cold showers, sorry I just enjoy warm showers too much. Another big thing is keeping your emotions in check. There were a few times where I had mood swings and would have to apologize to people. Chalk this up to personal development -- you learned how to be humble. Humility was something I would also express to you all to have at the forefront of your development. As you become less socially anxious and have more self-confidence, you must balance that with being humble. You're excited about your new found self; and thats great! But you must balance it with humility.

**Conclusion**

All in all, it's been a hell of a ride so far and I absolutely will continue living this lifestyle. This is a way of life, not just reaching 90 days and being done with it. Throughout life, we must always continue working on ourselves and learning. 

TL;DR: Read the post. If you're serious about NoFap, stop taking shortcuts and take time to learn from those who have found the key to success.

There isn't a climbing gym in my college town, so I climbed for 3 months over summer '17 and 3 months over summer '18 while on internships, as well as for these past two weeks while home for the holidays. I make fairly quick progress while training over the summers, but I've often been limited by issues with tendinitis, particularly in my elbows.

Any suggestions for ways to train while I'm not climbing to help prevent those kinds of issues? Doing a ton of push-ups and pull-ups with a bar I have in my apartment has helped a lot, and I do a bit of power lifting training as well. I'll be moving elsewhere for grad school in the upcoming year which will hopefully allow for more dedicated climbing training. Wearing a compression sleeve at times during summer '18 also helped significantly, and I've also noticed that doing some top-rope climbing before bouldering (which is where I usually train) has helped to warm up my arms well before sessions these past few weeks. It's been slowly improving as I get stronger, but the pain that comes with the tendinitis issues is something I'd definitely like to have behind me as soon as possible. 

This isn't so much of an injury related post, but more of how can I get my tendons and the surrounding muscles stronger in order to perform better while climbing? Have any of you experienced this before, and if so what did you train to help get past it?

Thanks in advance!"
aafrpg,1,2018-12-28,I need help. I'm lost.,oh_well123,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/aafrpg/i_need_help_im_lost/,"hi, i'm currently a senior doing biomedical engineering. I planned to take my MCAT on Jan 24th and do the rest of pre med stuff( personal statement, shadowing, volunteering, etc). but there was no testing center until April 5th. It was my fault; i signed up late. 

Soooo idk what to do. Well here is my current stat:

totalGPA: 3.98 scienceGPA: 4.00

MCAT: ughh. The highest score I got was 509 from NS and it went down from there. That's why I didn't take it in the summer and move it to Jan. 

Volunteer:  Roughly 200 hours ( i think; i'm not too sure); mostly from hospital and club activities

Leadership: President of an engineering honor society( was a secretary), VP of another one (was a treasurer), TA for engineering class and chem lab, workshop leader for biology, and other ambassador stuff

Shadowing: 30 hours from Neurosurgeon and 200 hours from Vascular surgeons( it was the whole summer &amp; and i got to shadow the whole team ( attening, fellow, resident, and intern)- that's why I could stay there for so long. I get to see different stages of medical career, which is pretty dope. I even saw a field engineering working with surgeon and thought about doing that instead of going to med school too.  But, I got over it.  idk We'll see. 

Reserach: 1) Mechanic/tissue lab; Submitted 3 different abstracts and presented a poster at conference:Will be co-author of two papers by the end of school year ( or the end of next year; it's a work in progress). Also, my PI assigned me as a lead in a new stem cell project starting this semester. 

2) I work with vascular surgeons to conduct retrospective study of IVUS (Intravascular ultrasound) and its surgery.   Mostly going through patient's chart and do data analysis. I create something similar to variable sheet  using a RedCap ( a name of a software) that make it easier to analyze the data. 

Work: I work part-time as a server in a restaurant and as a tutor at local company. 

I guess that's it. Not sure what else to put. I'm writing this post  with some sort of anxiety attack. So pls don't judge me. And if i don't make sense or whatever, pls let it go. Ngl nothing make sense anymore. it was suppose to go as plan, but now it doesn't. I'm lost, demotivate, and i feel like somehow things are falling apart. I had everything plan out, but i guess it's life. I know i'm being dramatic yea, i'm probably being dramatic. 

But, nevertheless, I do need help. I plan to improve my EC during my last semester of college. But, I think it will be tough since I have to study for MCAT.  I'm really really worry about my MCAT. Since I'm taking it on April 5th, I will get the score by May and I do want to submit my application by May 1st. Like it's a one shot kind of thing and that scare the shit out of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need someone to tell me what i really need to improve on. Say, volunteering or shadowing or research. When should I write my personal statement?  or should I just focus on my class, my MCAT, and my personal statement instead of increasing my volunteering hour or shadowing hours? I honestly don't know how am I going to spend my last semester of college.  Can someone idk show me the way or slap my face and be like 'yo wake up and get to work ' thing of thing. Again, I might be dramatic. But, I'm doing this alone and I'm scare. so, yea. pls help me"

There is a reason why the words ""nepotism"" and ""cronyism"" exist. Your amazing grades doesn't really matter. 

I am in place of privilege. Maybe it is because I happen to be exceptionally lucky to meet someone senior in the industry who is willing to give me a big helping hand. but when I look around, I get insanely depressed when I found out how the interns didn't work hard and got a position because their parents got them a place. and these invaluable experiences will carry them and me so far. 

You know the sixteen year old who got an internship at a prestigious science lab? They got it via their parents. They are unpaid but just think about the opportunities they have because of their parents. 

i hate this, i hate it so much. "
aahgt2,7,2018-12-28,Best of Hindi Cinema 2018,FamouslyUnknown,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/aahgt2/best_of_hindi_cinema_2018/,"**Raazi**

True story of an Indian woman agrees to marry a Pakistani army officer in order to spy on Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.

It is based on a book named ""Calling Sehmat"" walking us through the real events that unfolded around this young woman. For a spy thriller fan, it's a great read; not to mention the movie does a great job of bringing all the characters to movie screen in a believable fashion.

**Tumbbad**

Set in 1920s - 1940s, Tumbbad follows a journey of three generations through poverty, wealth, and greed as a consequence of building a temple for the first-born of a Goddess, Hastar - he who must not be worshipped.

It's based on a short story from the 1980s giving a moral lesson on greed and the consequences of the same. It's truly a unique cinematic experience, with an impressive production design and remarkable creation of overall atmosphere the film has to offer.

**Andhadhun**

A suspense thriller following a blind pianist whose life changes after ""witnessing"" a crime. It's a great example of a solid script written to tell you a tale full of surprising moments.

Partially inspired from a French short film ""The Piano Tuner"", Andhadhun takes you through a crazy roller coaster ride of emotions as you as audience unfold the truth with the protagonist.

**October**

If there's one movie about grief, one movie that left me speechless for a long period of time after the credits stop rolling, it's October. I remember entire theater just sat there in the movie hall trying to process grief as they let all the emotions going through you settle in.

It's a story of Dan, a 21 years old carefree intern at a hotel and Shiuli, another intern who at times is at the receiving end of Dan's audaciousness. Life goes on until a sudden turn of events smashes Dan's and Shiuli's lives together, into a bond that's unlike any 21 years old. It's not a love story, it's a story about love.

**Manto**

This biographical account of a writer Sadat Hassan Manto is set in 1940s and follows his struggle for the freedom of speech in pre and post independent India.

In Bombay's shiny film world, his stories are widely read and accepted, but when sectarian violence engulfs India during its partition, he makes a difficult decision of leaving Bombay for Lahore, Pak. It's a story two emerging nations, two faltering cities, and one man who tries to make sense of it all.

**Mulk**

The story follows a difficult life story of a father whose son is trapped in a crime of terrorism and how his faith in nation's justice system helps him deal with a society that's almost islamophobic.

As a subject, it's very sensitive to write a script about and the writers have made an honest attempt at showing a mirror to people of all communities. It should be watched purely for its writing and representation of society in its truest form as far as communal perceptions are concerned.

**Badhai Ho**

This romantic comedy follows a story of a middle-aged couple who ends up having an unplanned pregnancy, and how their family of two sons and a mother-in-law deals with the situation.

It's a light hearted commentary on society's cultural bias and hypocrisy against sexuality for couples in their middle age, as the story talks through a young protagonist who finds out his mother is pregnant.

**Padmaavat**

This period drama set in medieval India is based on an epic poem written in 1540, following an account from a life of the queen Padmavati who is described in the poem as the most beautiful woman to ever exist.

The stories of her beauty reaches the court of Allaudin Khilji, ruler in North of India, Mogul Sultanate of Delhi. Padmaavati and her king Ratan Singh's life takes an unfortunate turn when Allaudin Khilji's lust drives him on a quest to conquer Ratan Singh's state to ""win"" Padmaavati.

It's a story of pride, lust and sacrifice, and if you're a fan of epic sized production with colorful sequences and beautifully choreographed dance exploring Indian culture through this story, this movie is for you."

If you care to read please tell me your thoughts &lt;3

I decided to get my MBA straight out of college and it might have been the worst decision ever for me - well, professionally it’s been great but it’s completely deteriorating my relationships with my parents and my boyfriend and fucking up my life.

I’m doing great in the program, i just got a 4.0 for the past semester. Going back to school allowed me to get an internship this past semester at my DREAM company in NYC, I have a ton of contacts there and I was told by HR that when i graduate in May i’m at the top of the list for full time employment consideration.

Despite this, since I don’t have a full time job now, it’s really been fucking up my relationship. Me and my boyfriend have been in a long term relationship for a while now (live like 1.5 hr drive away from each other). Over the summer we were on a pretty good schedule of seeing each other at least every other week, and things were fine until recently. He really wants to move into the city together and everyday we fight about how lonely he is and how I’m a fucking loser and lazy, how my decision to go to school is fucking up his life, how i’m holding him back and etc.

I live at home, and even though i’m 23 my mom still kind of treats me like a teenager. I want to respect her rules partly bc i’m living in her house but also because she views me going to my boyfriends house as “partying and eating” and gives me the similar “you’re a fucking loser” treatment that my boyfriend is giving me. I overhear her conversations with my dad and they always talk about how they “failed as parents” because I don’t have a job.

Between my boyfriend and my mom constantly telling me how shitty i am for not having a job is just absolutely breaking me. I wish i could just get a job AND do my MBA but the company said they wont hire me because i have to go to school in CT and they are located in NYC. On top of doing my MBA full time i do have a small online business so I do have SOME kind of income. I have one semester left until I’m free but I just can’t take this shit any longer. "

I wasn't going to let my senior year in college rush by me. I needed to make the most of it, at least that's what all of my family and friends would tell me. Some might consider joining a club, going to more events, getting internship. I had more exciting things in mind. With my sights set on a female friend of mine, I was ready to create my new slave. She had a bright future ahead of her, always studying and ensuring she would have the best opportunities when she graduated. 

So how would I change this dedicated college girl into a slave for my use? Needless to say, you can find almost anything on the internet. Without complete confidence in its ability, I get my hands on a drug that fosters an addiction to cum. Such an unhealthy and constant addiction is going to ruin my friend's future, but also ensure I have a loving slave who will do anything for a single drop of my seed. In addition to this addiction, her mental capacity may be affected as well. What better combination than a cum-addicted bimbo...

I'd love to play this out with someone! You'd be playing as a female character that I have references for, and we can discuss more details when you reach out. I love the slow burn of someone changing and becoming a cum addicted slave. If you're interested, kik me at HelloMySlave

P.S. if you wanted to do a celebrity variant of this plot, I'm completely okay with that. Just include that in your first message if you do!"
aaht5d,1,2018-12-28,I (M19) have had a crush (F19) for 5 years that led me to leave my now ex-gf (F17). This is my long story with a very short question: what should I do?,shantih19,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aaht5d/i_m19_have_had_a_crush_f19_for_5_years_that_led/,"It's been months since I first considered coming here to tell my story and hopefully get some advice.

Brace yourself, it's gonna be a very long journey.

I premise that I have always been kinda socially awkward and anxious at best but acting in a theater laboratory (for 6 years now) has helped me a lot.

Flashback 5 years ago, I met this girl at the aforementioned theater lab. I was a very awkward and shy guy, almost no friends and kissless, only had a weird distance relationship with someone I never met in person.

Anyway, we met by doing an exercise together (something many would find weird but it's the norm for me): standing in front of one another, looking at each other's eyes, trying to get their story. I was instantly caught by those beautiful eyes.

From that moment, I did everything I could to spend even a little time with her.

I couldn't do theater anymore because of bad marks at school, so I gave everything I could just to continue to see her. 

I started going to English courses (that I would have attended anyway) just because she was there.

For 3-4 years it mostly was uninterested conversations and not much, but everytime I saw her (and it keeps happening to this day) I felt like she was the only thing that meant something in my life.

Then, I met my ex, on September 2016. I was really, really down because of another failed long distance relationship, but I met her just by pure chance.

We kinda clicked talking about things we liked both and shared. We awkwardly kept chatting on WhatsApp and managed to see each other with friends. (Here in Italy we don't have the ""dating"" thing, things work very differently I guess).

Anyway, we could see each other rarely, as friends, but I really felt that that was the good time. I tried asking her out, failing. It was yet another kick in the guts.

We continued going out, she became part of my group of friends and everyone pushed for the two of us to get together. We started awkwardly confessing mutual feelings, but nothing came out of it.

We were both inexperienced, but I really wanted to be with her. It wasn't really the perfect girl for me, but I liked being with her.

The problem is that I kept pushing her for 7 months, not giving up. She kept giving me obvious clues that she wanted to become my gf but never did anything.

I finally decided to try to make my move and finally gave my first kiss, on the first of April 2017, everyone cheering for us finally becoming a couple. That was great. It was something new and that I had never experienced before.

Then, problem started to come. She pushed me to abandon my group of friends (that actually become kinda toxic when also everyone else started coupling with others) so we were left on our own and found our small group of friends.

We could only see each other on Tuesdays, she living kinda far from my town and me being very very busy every other day. Most of the time we were in her house, because mine was always full w/ my parents and my little sisters, while she is an only child and her mother worked those hours (her father passed away many years ago).

Most of the time she would randomly invite her friends without telling me anything, in the only day I had free to see her (while she had a lot of time on her hands to see them). I didn't mind at first, but then it became a recurring thing. Anyway, I accepted it and tried to find time with her.

We spent most of the time alone watching films and making out, mostly because of me being an horny curious teenager. 

From the beginning she came out to me as bi (but she never had any relationship, she said she was also interested in girls but that's fine to me, being kinda fluid as well). She was very, very open about sexuality, something I really liked about her.

But she didn't wanted to get physical with me. She always had some excuse, but finally we got closer and closer and I started ""pleasing"" her. She really liked it, after a while she pushed me to masturbate her, also giving her oral sex. I was the one who proposed things (without forcing of course, I always had fear of losing her because of that) and she gladly accepted.

But the downside is: she always found an excuse when it was her turn to ""please"" me. I tried talking to her about it (always fearful because I'm really anxious) but nothing changed.

Something happened when I spent 3 days on a theatrical meeting with my group. I spent 3 wonderful days with that girl from the beginning, my ""long term crush"" and I noticed that I wasn't really happy with my gf. Our relationship was only me trying to be with her and her trying to get me to be another person. She would always try to get me into her interests, without trying to appreciate mine. I noticed she was very very toxic.

So I fell very badly for my crush, but this time we got closer and closer. She was herself in a very toxic relationship, so I helped her (and she helped me) by sharing each other stories.

When I came back from that meeting, my gf noticed I was very distant. I felt really guilty.

I forgot all about those toxic things and promised myself to be more close to her. My crush got really close to her toxic boyfriend too, so we just kept things that way.

Then I discovered that I would have spent 3 months in Ireland for an internship organized by my school, while my crush was going to go to Krakow, in Poland.

I was really excited, but my gf didn't took that very well. She became obsessed and very jealous with me. She tried to get me to not go many times, never supporting me. I was also very anxious because I was going to have my high school final exams, two days before leaving Italy. 

She tried to keep me close to her by becoming very physical, something I wanted for a really long time, but I felt something was off.

We saw each other's naked body for the first time almost 1 and an half year after getting together, but we didn't pop the cherry, luckily.

I say luckily because for 2 months of very stressful internship, where I lost almost 20 kilos, she never supported me. We almost never had time to talk and she made me feel bad about it, while she was on holiday doing nothing a the time, always hanging out with her friends (that were my ""replacement"" for my old beloved group of friends). 

One day, she asked me if there was something off. I was at work, at the first of September 2018, two weeks to go before coming back home. I replied that I wasn't feeling very good, that I hadn't had much time for her. She then asked me if I wanted to cut it.

I was shocked. I knew that I was leaving her behind, but I was working my ass out for an unpaid internship while she spent all of her time with her friends.

I replied that I didn't want to leave her, but she just said that she was tired. So I let her go. I begged her to at least wait and talk about it when I would come back home, but she said that she ""couldn't make it"" and that she didn't want to talk to me never again. I went to the bathroom in my small office and I cried there for a solid 15 minutes, during what should have been my lunch break.

She instantly deleted all of our photos from everywhere, like it was the most important thing to do, writing her status as ""single/bi""

Fast forward to now. I haven't seen her since. She now and then make Instagram stories about how she is ""better than ever"" and ""how I missed on her"" and ""I'll never find someone like her"".

I really hope it will be like this.

Now, after all my long ass story, let's go back to my crush.

I have always felt something great for her and after this bad experience I feel more strongly that she I the person I want in my life. She left her toxic bf, I was ready to try out once and for all. I tried making the ground by writing to her, trying to get all those suspended feelings back to life.

But when she came back to Italy, she had found another guy, a 39 years old Italian guy who was in Poland for work.

I wanted to disappear. Out of despair I wrote her a drunk text telling her my feelings.

She never took continued the conversation and I thought I dodged a bullet. I wasn't seeing her much, from me starting uni to her always going to visit that guy.

Then, one day, she texted me. She told me that she always liked me and I was one of the most important persons in her life, but she never saw me that way. I didn't care because I was in a very, very bad mood in that period, so it was just another drop in a sea of shit. She started evading me and I was feeling really bad.

Then, she thought that it could never work out and left him. It was painful for her, but I was angry like I never was with her, because she took all my feelings and just threw them away.






All until two days ago. I was hanging out with the guy that I could now consider my best friend and I felt really good for the first time in a while, expect for the good mood for the holidays (I'm a very festive guy). Then, my crush called me, asking if she could join out, out of nowhere.

I was reluctant at first, but told myself ""why not, better friends than nothing"". She reached us, we got booze, we had one of the greatest nights of my life, there was no awkwardness between us.

The other guy left and I was alone with my crush. We started talking in English (it's an weird habit) and when I saw her smile, I felt like I was alive again. Then, she hugged me. She said that she was sorry for ignoring me, that I really one of the most important persons in her life, that she doesn't want to be with me because she is afraid of hurting and losing me like it happened with all of his other exes. She always got along with abusive pieces of shit and I really really can understand what she means.

I hugged her and I told her that I loved her so much, that as long as I am with her I am happy. It really is this way. I think I found with her a love so big that I don't give a fuck, as long as she is with me. 

It may be senseless, but we talked endlessly and we hugged for almost an hour straight. I love her and knowing that I am so important for her makes me even more happy.

I still have hope that one day I will be able to get her heart, just by how she looked at me when we had to say goodbye, but if that's not the case, she will always be my crush and my love.


So here's (finally) the advice that I wanted from you.

Do you think I am sane?

But also:

I'll spend with her and another two friends of mine the New Year's Eve, partying like animals at my place. What should I do?

I'm fine really keeping things like this and see where they evolve, as long as I can spend as much time with her as I can, but maybe you have better ideas.

Sorry for the long ass story and thank you for reading all the way to this. This is a very important piece of me."

I'm not sure if I can ask this here, but I was hoping to hear some advice for those who had a really bad GPA in college. I am on my Lower Senior year of college, with a current GPA of 2.8... its really bad, I know. 

I was wondering if anyone had something similar to me and was able to obtain a job or a position in a forensic accounting career. Also wondering whether or not taking a CPA exam would be worth it since i'm going to the forensic route. But i know it doesn't hurt to have and that it beats the other tests like the CFA and the CFE. 

But I wanted to know if taking the CFA and CFE would be enough for a forensic accountant, and i know companies wont take me as a intern with such a low GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted some thoughts on whether or not getting a internship is still possible."

aan7e2,16,2018-12-29,Positive Elective Surgical Abortion at 17 Weeks,QueasyZone1,abortion,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/aan7e2/positive_elective_surgical_abortion_at_17_weeks/,"I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I hope it can be used to encourage other women in similar situations. I found so much inspiration in this sub during the most terrifying month of my life and wanted to give back.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background information: My SO and I are in our mid-20s, both currently in graduate school. I graduate this May and am currently applying for paid internships this fall. We met in college and both agreed that we had plans beyond the typical marriage+family route. We have been together for 7 years and it was a complete shock when I found out I was pregnant in early December. I had been on the pill, but had missed a couple weeks due to a vacation. We thought we were careful (condoms), but the pregnancy test said otherwise. My breasts were swollen (but not painful) and I felt very fatigued, but I thought it was due to gaining some holiday weight, lack of exercise, and being in grad school. Aside from that, I had no symptoms of pregnancy. I even had a period in early November.

&amp;#x200B;

I found out (at Planned Parenthood) that I was actually in the second trimester when I thought I was 7 weeks. It turns out that my last “period” was actually just spotting, which is common during pregnancy. As I had mentally prepared for a medical abortion, I was devastated and terrified. The PP I went to did not perform surgical abortions, but referred me to a different local clinic. 

&amp;#x200B;

My SO and I arrived at the clinic a week later for the first phase of the procedure. We checked in with security, showed our IDs, handed in the paperwork they sent me in advance (my state requires a 24 hour consent form to be signed), and waited a few minutes to be called up. The estimated cost was $1950, but we ended up paying $1550 in the end; I do not have insurance currently and we did not qualify for financial assistance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was taken separately into a different side of the clinic (my SO was not allowed past the waiting room for any part of the visit) and given a hospital gown and robe to wear. I was allowed to keep my possessions with me, including my cell phone, in a bag they provided. I first met with a social worker for consultation. She explained the procedure, answered my questions, and asked some state-mandated questions. After, I waited in a different waiting room by myself for a few more minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

A medical assistant then took my vitals, did a finger prick to see if I needed a rhogam shot, and prepared me for the ultrasound. Since I was so far along, the physician was able to do this through my abdomen. I decided against seeing the images or hearing the heartbeat for this appointment as I had just seen the images at PP the week before. She told me I was at 17 weeks, 1 day, a pleasant surprise; the nurse at PP had estimated 18-19.5 weeks, which was terrifying. In my state, surgical procedures can only be done up to 21 weeks, 6 days, so there was additional anxiety about the time frame. After I met the doctor, I had to wait 30 minutes before she could place the osmotic dilator sticks (another state law). I was given a Valium, two antibiotic pills, and some ibuprofen while I waited in the recovery room. I texted my boyfriend and tried to read the book I brought with me while I waited. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt very calm for this part of the procedure, thanks to the Valium. I was taken back into the same room, laid back, and a nurse held my hand while the physician inserted the laminaria sticks into my cervix. I felt a little pressure, but it was never painful. They distracted me by discussing every day things, my grad school, etc. It took just a few minutes for her to insert the sticks and something to hold them in place (she referred to this as a special type of tampon that was shaped to fit against my cervix). I was given three prescriptions to fill that evening: ibuprofen, a narcotic for pain, and an anti-nausea medication. She told me that since I haven’t experienced any nausea with the pregnancy that this one did not need to be filled, but it was just a precaution in case I felt ill during the evening. 

&amp;#x200B;

My SO and I then left the clinic (we were there for only 2.5 hours the first day) and went to fill the prescriptions and get food for the evening in our hotel. My Valium wore off and I began to feel some mild cramping and abdominal discomfort. I waited a couple more hours before taking more ibuprofen (800 mg) and tried to get comfortable. I ended up not taking anything else for pain and fell asleep fairly early. I slept through the night and woke up to my alarm feeling pretty normal. I didn’t have any bleeding with the laminaria sticks. We ate our rather disappointing continental breakfast and checked out of the hotel.  

&amp;#x200B;

On the second day, we arrived at 8 a.m., and I was immediately taken into the other building to change into a gown and robe again. I was given two misoprostol tablets to place between my cheeks and gums, a blanket, small cup of water for sipping, and a heating pad. I had to allow the pills to get “chalky” before I could swallow. The nurse said this would take about 10 minutes, but in reality I kept them in for 40 minutes to dissolve. There was no taste, but swallowing them was odd due to the texture; I chugged and swished water to get through it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two hours went by very slowly. Although I didn’t start bleeding, I had some mild to moderate cramping and was uncomfortable in the recovery chair. I texted my boyfriend, looked through Instagram, and tried to read. It was hard to focus as the pain got slightly worse, but I found my Sudoku app was the most effective distraction for me. The heating pad was a life-saver and the cramps actually dissipated the longer I waited. The clinic was significantly busier on this day and I sat for almost 3 hours before being walked into the operating room. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I walked in, a volunteer arranged me on the bed, took my blood pressure, placed an oxygen tube in my nose, and gave me a finger heart rate monitor. She explained why she volunteered for this clinic and was very comforting for me while I waited. She held my hand while they doctor inserted an IV. (Earlier, they had attempted to give me an IV in both arms, but were unable to due to the length of the catheters and the way my veins run. The physician opted instead to do a butterfly IV in the operating room.) Once this was inserted, I was given meds for twilight sedation. I immediately felt the fentanyl and watched the lights shimmering on the ceiling. It felt warm and I was extremely relaxed, but awake. The physician immediately got to work, but this part of the procedure is now a blur in my memory. I do, unfortunately, remember the pressure of the suction machine later. It was uncomfortable and slightly painful, but I just squeezed the volunteer’s hand and it was over quickly. The absolute worst part was after this, when the doctor placed a lot of pressure on my uterus; she explained what she was doing at the time, but I can’t remember now. I think she was ensuring there weren’t any clots. Regardless, my eyes welled up in pain and I cried for a couple minutes until this part was over. I don’t remember the pain now, just the experience. The doctor inserted more misoprostol (this time into my rectum) and I was given a shot of something in my arm. She said this was to ensure my uterus would remain contracted and to help with the bleeding. After this, the volunteer and nurse cleaned me up, put my underwear on, and guided me back to recovery. I don’t recall when the procedure began, but I know that I was in the operating room for less than thirty minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

The IV medication wore off very quickly; I was alert while walking back to my chair. Again, I sat with a blanket and heating pad. I asked for water and was told I would be monitored for about an hour before I could leave. After a couple glasses of water, I felt great; there was minimal cramping and I could feel some bleeding, but nothing heavier than a period. The nurses who checked on me observed that I was recovering well. However, after almost an hour, I felt a huge gush and had to inform the nurse that I had bled through the pad, my gown, the robe, and on the chair. I went to the bathroom to clean up and found a small mound of clots. I expelled a little more, changed gowns, and went back to my chair. The doctor came over about ten minutes later to check on me. She told me the clots I passed are normal, but to call if I bled through two thick maxi pads in an hour for two or more hours or if I passed clots that could fill both of my hands in volume. I was able to leave with my follow-up instructions and checked out with the front desk. She asked me to call them with any concerns and to let them know the results of the over the counter pregnancy test I have to take in a few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

My SO drove me home and I relaxed the rest of the day. I took an ibuprofen when I got home to avoid cramps and ate normally. I only felt a couple more gushes and had to change my pad one more time before bed. I took precautions and slept on a couple towels, but this was unnecessary. I didn’t bleed over night and bled like a normal period the next day. I returned to my normal activities immediately, working on my house, and even walked on the treadmill for a little while. I had minimal cramping, but still took ibuprofen as directed every 8 hours during the day for a couple days following the procedure. I ended up not using the narcotic medicine at all. The doctor told me to restart my birth control that Sunday, but that I could not have sex or insert tampons for two weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I had a great experience with this clinic and have not regretted my decision for a second. I know that my SO and I made the right choice, as this is not the opportune time for us to start a family. While we might choose to in 5 or 6 years when we are more established in our careers and emotionally and financially ready, I am relieved that we did not have to become parents in these circumstances. I feel incredibly grateful towards my physician and her staff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please do not hesitate to ask me any questions if you are considering this path. This is obviously a throwaway account, but I will do my best to check it periodically.

I went back to school ( this was after Christmas break ) and everything was fine. I even scored a internship at a Ivy League in BME.
Fast forward, this internship gave a pretty good stipend, so I used that money to buy my first car. 
I bought a “cash car” so that I could avoid payments.
Not even 6 days later, the car broke down on me &amp; now it is completely undriveable. 
Went on to lose one of my scholarships.
Then I lost my wallet with all of my important shit in there, &amp; someone was swiping my shit at gas stations and making hell of minuscule purchases. 
I had to cancel all of my shit &amp; file a police report.
I few weeks later, I had to go on a trip to Indiana, and the night before, my bank alerted me of potential fraud.. I’m like wtf? So I check my wallet &amp; low and behold , my debit card is still in there. How tf does somebody make a purchase at footlocker with MY car when it’s still in my possession? I have no idea!
Fat forward a month later. I finally save up more Monet &amp; I decide to buy another car. This time with payments. I’ve only had that car for THREE WEEKS before I somebody hit me in a car accident. I was ticketed! So now I’m without a car AGAIN and all that money I saved this year to get BOTH cars are down the fucking drain. Oh yeah, i lost my wallet AGAIN , but this time it had a Sephora gift card in there that my sis gave me for my birthday. Didn’t even get the chance to use it. 

On the bright side, I met the love of my life this year &amp; he asked me to be his girlfriend 2 days ago. 

It’s safe to say that I would go through this all over again if that means I get him in the end. 

Hope 2k19 is better. 

Thanks for reading loves! "

bout a year ago i rescued a stray cat (Phoebe) near the house I was staying in. She was around 4-6 months old and very shy but after she got used to me the sweetest cat I had ever met. Begs for more pets and scratches and follows me anywhere. Got her her shots and had her fixed and she has been great ever since, until another animal comes into the mix. Her immediate reaction to my girlfriends dog is hissing over and over again until she scares the dog out of the room. After a few weeks she has gotten to a point where she can tolerate a dog in the same room, but if they get too close, more hissing.

I may have to leave my cat with my parents this next semester and Phoebe HATES their two cats. Its worse than with the dog. More hissing, and running and hiding. I can't take her to my internship and she really needs to stay with my parents.

What can I do to help her get accustomed to other cats/animals? Even past this semester I would like to get more pets eventually and with my girlfriend and her dog, I would like to live with her at some point without pet issues. Any advice?

Been working there about 4 years now, alongside the best co-workers you can imagine! So we go out alot and socialize in private - Guess listening to peoples heartship and suicidalthoughts 8 hours a day, really brings you together as a group ... 

So theres me(35F), I just got out of a 6 ½ years long, very intense, relationship, my decicion btw. Started getting mentally ill myself because of his blame and guiltrippin my personality on the daily - while he is working as an assistent to drugdealers, lying his ass homeless to the socialservices - just to collect a wellfare check, to spend on various kinds of weed. 6 ½ years supportin him, mentally and financially, 6½ years. 

So theres him(30M), my coworker - started working alongside him about 4 years ago, where he started in an internship as a nurses assistent student. And since then got employed at the unit after graduation. I swear he looks like a friendly bear, not very pretty, but reeeealy tall, and wide ... And really well liked for his friendliness and sense of humor. Works a communicative deescalator between units - trying to secure less fixations of patients and forced mediciation. 

And then theres her(27F) ... His Girlfriend. My close coworker in the ER, we often works shifts together - I wouldn't say that we are friends, we don't socialize alone outside of work, but in some way she trusts me. Alot.

Then there was the christmas party,  a couple of weeks ago. I got drunk in snaps - like really, really drunk - remember half a conversation with my male co-worker mentioned, where he is pouring his heart out about how rough his relationship with his girlfriend is, how she is always putting him down and not letting him be himself. 

In kindness of my heart I promise him that he can rent a room in my 2 bedroom appartment, I'm moving in to iin a couple of weeks. Or so I find out the day after, when I wake up after 5 hours of sleep, still drunk, going in a double shift at the ER. I wake yp to a text message saying 'thanks for the chat beautyfull' cant wait to move in, smoke joints and watch movies with you' and all those kissing emojies hearts and such ... I remember no such promise! But I do in glimpses remember his hand on my thigh under the table at the christmasparty.

Then it kindda stopped, he avoided me at work, rushed to his part of the unit so that we wouldn't bump in to eachother. 

She didn't suspect a thing.

Then 2 nights ago, we whent out for drinks, a couple of people from other units to, he was there, she was there. 

To make a long story short, the bar closes and we end up at the appartment where they live. She wants a baby so bad! and she is sitting there showing me a calender and a book from a vaccation they we on with his niece and nephew - and it's so obvious she whants a baby so bad. 

I'm starting to get really drunk, cause they are serving rum, straight up. 

Suddenly it's just the three of us in the appartment, and shes getting really tired, and got work the next day. So shes getting ready for bed, and tells me I can stay there and sleep if I want, beeing real nice. And he and I are welcome to stay up and drink and chat if we feel like it, but she is going to bed - and so the does. 

Then it starts to get real touchy touchy. He moves closer - slides his hand down my sweater and compliments my breast. Then ofcourse, starts kissing me. And shes right there in the next room sleeping, and he don't care... He talks again about moving in my spare bedroom. And I say but we all work there, I have to work along side her to. He just replies 'well so do I'. Hes talking about how he had been interested in me since he was a student, and then continued to get more and more attracted to me - so now that I was single, you know ...

When I left for work early in the morning, he kissed me goodbye intensely.

Today they came in early to work overlapping me, she came in my part of the unit just to keep me company, she still didn't suspect a thing. He rushed to his part of the unit, so that he wouldn't bump into me.

I'm kindda confused right now ...

What on earth should I do? This could get really dramatic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a college student playing poker online. I started learning about poker about a year and a half ago, but really got into it last summer. I've started playing online (0.02/0.05 zone on ignition), but I keep getting super tilted and i'm not sure how to continue. I know there are definitely things I can improve (my post flop game needs a lot of work), but it's so tilting playing at 0.02/0.05. I've watched a lot of poker videos, from vloggers to Doug Polk, and I feel like I have the fundamentals down. It's so titling playing what I feel like is solid poker and having my AA get cracked by the likes of 82 suited and QT off in the same session. I know that in the long run i'll be fine, but I get super tilted by things like this. Or when I flop top pair, and slowly just get called down by some random two pair that should be folding pre. I've heard a lot of people say the micros are super tilting, and I feel like I'm experiencing this in full.

&amp;#x200B;

This tilting caused me to move up in stakes, which I know I should never be doing, but I played 0.10/0.25 zone and was actually profitable for a few sessions. It was just easier playing against opponents that weren't so random with their styles of play, even though there were still some weird moments (getting my 4bet called by T5 off, which rivered a two pair against my AA). Eventually I lost my roll because I was playing 0.10/0.25 with a 0.02/0.05 roll. It's not the money I'm worried about, I'm fine financially as I've had a bunch of internships over the years, I'm just annoyed. I know it's a mixture of luck and skill, probably mostly skill, that's my problem, but I just get so tilted. I've thought about getting a subscription to the Upswing Lab, but I can't justify the price of it given the stakes I play at.

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing is that I can't put in long sessions because I'm a busy college students. My longest sessions are usually 2 hours right before I go to bed. This causes me to rage quit when I get a bad beat and is probably contributing to the tilt.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's hard for any of you to offer any help given that you don't really know anything about my game, but that being said, any advice?"

I am currently in my first programming internship position, and have quickly been getting familiar with webdev/angular.  Since I have reached a point where I am comfortable with angular and our project, my mentor has tasked me to get our project international-ready.  He would like me to take ownership of it as it would make a great thing to list on my resume.  I wanted to do a quick preliminary search to make sure I have a plan going in.

Our project is built with Angular 4 without use of the Angular CLI, opting instead for a more custom webpack approach.  I was also told that i18n is not the correct approach for us, and it seems that since we do not use the CLI, we cannot take advantage of it anyway.  

I currently have our project set up to do a restful call before anything is bootstrapped, and the idea is to fetch the necessary translation file from the back end when the site is first visited.  I was planning on playing around with .resx files, and set up a single page to take advantage of it.

Am I making any incorrect assumptions here?  Do you forsee anything not playing well with Angular?  Do you have any project/tutorial recommendations that you think would be helpful?

Thank you!"

aaq54p,11,2018-12-29,Another New Victim of Panic Attacks,vishky12,PanicAttack,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/aaq54p/another_new_victim_of_panic_attacks/,"Hey guys,

Its 1:40am and the 30th of December. One more day until this year ends. It's been a shitty time for me these past few months. I started getting my panic attacks last year when I used to live alone and it was terrible like any of you. You know the regular, heart racing, chest pains, dizziness, detached from reality and most important FEAR... I was scared that I'm going to die alone. I was even more scared of going crazy. Like any of you, I went to the doctor, got tests done and yes everything was normal. He told me it's panic attack and I had to cut caffeine and alcohol, start some physical activity and do relaxation exercise. But I lived alone as a 3rd year student, I didn't have time to make my own meal so who has time for relaxation, am I right?

 After about few months, and 2018 had begun, I came back home. I started my internship and everything was fine. I started going to the gym because I had put on a lot of weight from all the fast food I ate last year. I didn't have an episodes for few months. Yes but I did have certain time when I couldn't breathe and I felt as if I was claustrophobic. I generally ran outside and drank juice or water until I could relax and breathe again. I had this many times when I was at the gym. It wasn't anything I couldn't handle because I had worse when I was living alone. 

Fast forward, September 2018. My assignments and final year uni work were piling up. I was procrastinating as usual and decided to quit gym. My trainer was furious but I explained to her how uni work is important and I gotta submit on time. Time was running. I had a major submission in October. It was my Research Proposal for my Dissertation. One day before the submission, I was overworking for about 4 days without sleep and less food. My mom was obviously worried. But yes one day before, that night I decided I would sleep for an hour (4am to 5am) and wake up to work again. However when my alarm went off at 5am I got up so sudden. My head was pounding and it felt as if someone was drowning me in a pool of water. I didn't know what was happening. Everything was so blurry and my heart was beating so fast. The first thing that came to my mind was, I am dying. This is a heart attack. This is it. This is how I'm going to die. I ran to my parents room and woke up my mom. Yelled and told her something is happening. I'm not feeling good. I can't breathe. I can't think. I feel like someone is choking me and my heart isn't calming down. This is the worst way to go, that was my feeling. I still want to live. My mom knew that I had overworked myself and she tired to calm me down but I couldn't sit at one place. Everything is so foggy and I felt like I'm gonna faint. I told my parents to call emergency as soon as possible. They did and once the ambulance arrived, I got a bit calm and everything was checked. My blood pressure was above the roof along with my pulse rate. But it was normalizing. My parents were terrified. It was almost 6am I think. I still have submission at 12pm that day. I didn't sleep after that. My dad helped me to submit my research proposal that noon and I was exhausted more than I have ever been. I napped for an hour or so. 

That happened in October, ever since then I have had called the emergency twice (including the first time) thinking I was gonna die. Both the time it was different. The 2nd time was when I felt my brain was being squeezed by someone. I felt I'm having a brain tumour or something and someome is squeezing it. I again thought I'm gonna die. But then they checked everything (BP, ECG, Blood sugar) everything was normal. The third time however, my parents rushed me to a clinic and we met the doctor, he interviewed me and asked me what's happening. I told him everything, he said it's Panic Attacks. Nothing else. The previous doctor told it was my high blood pressure and gave me meds for it (I'm 22 years old) lmao and the day I took the BP meds I again got another panic attack. So the first thing he did was stop my meds, told my parents it's panic attacks and that I'm young and do not need any BP meds until I'm tested fully. I did some kidney scans, Blood tests and all were normal. He told me that I needed to lose weight the most important and start therapy if I want to. So, I have changed my diet a lot. Completely stopped eating outside and I started walking everyday for about an hour. The doc suggested me not to lift a lot of weights for now. But even now my brain gets fogged or I start having some body pain, I go intently to a panic mode. My parents are hesitant about my starting therapy because they don't want me to take meds and honestly even I don't either. But I really want to start conseling because I heard from multiple people that their symptoms got a lot better than before.

The thing is ever since I get these episodes, most of the time at least, it's in the night when I'm sleeping. So my mom started sleeping with me and I would get another panic attack in the night but she helps me to get rid of them. They would last about 10-20 mins and then I would relax and go to sleep. I have become so dependent on my mom, that I feel scared if she isn't around. She told me I need to start sleeping alone and she can't always sleep with me. So now, I'm in bed, wide awake scared to my life about it I get another panic attack when I sleep. And this time mom isn't next to me. 

I just wanted to share this. I know that someone is going through this the same as I am. And that I'm not alone even tho I feel very alone right now.

aaq78r,3,2018-12-29,I (24f) need help deciding where to go jext with my best friend/roommate (22f),raeboepo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aaq78r/i_24f_need_help_deciding_where_to_go_jext_with_my/,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Forgive me if my formatting is anything is wrong. I'm typing this on my phone. I'll also do my best to include every point of view.

Early January of this year, I moved to a different state to start an internship. I matched with two other girls  (22f, 24f) doing the internship so we could live together in the housing the program provides for us. Everything was really great until the 24f decided she didn't like me anymore. She didn't like me because I often didnt have enough money to go out and do things, and often made fun of me behind my back. In the end, me and 22f (I'll call her Sarah) decided that she tried to ruin the friendship between us and I didn't respect her for judging me for trying to be financially responsible, so we stopped hanging out with her.

 Our internship just ended, and I didn't want to find a job within the company because I became miserable with the company. Sarah, however, did find a job after her internship, and the both of us decided months ago that we wanted to stay in the city the company is based out of. She never saved any money for a down payment on an apartment because she often went and did fun things with our other roommate. I was just making sure my bills were paid, and I ended up not saving anything either I was never upset that she went out and did fun things instead of saving money, I tried to stay focused on what I needed to do more than anythinf. But one of my co-workers had a room open in her apartment, and I told Sarah about it. Rent would be ridiculously cheap and we'd be able to save up for our next place easily. We decided we'd be okay sharing a room for few months and moved in about a month ago.

Sarah does mean the world to me. she has been here for a lot of ups and downs that I have had. This includes a nasty break up I had with my ex of four years. The ex, in the end of our relationship, became toxic. He would often say things that would make me cry of feel emotionally broken, and then he'd refuse to talk to me. He also liked making me feel stupid by questioning my intelligence. I still have problems because of the end of our relationship, I'm often anxious when it comes to expressing my feelings but I'm working towards fixing that. She was there through it all.

Here comes the tricky part. 

Sarah has told me that she wishes I was more clingy with her. I'm not a clingy person, in general. I don't like depending on people and Im uncomfortable when people depend on me for certain things. I had been on tinder for awhile, and I finally met this amazing guy, Michael (24m) who treats me as an equal and I love our relationship. However, I noticed a change with Sarah when I started seeing him more often. When we first moved in, I asked her if she's be cool with me hanging out with him another night and asked if she needed anything, and she told me that she was fine and to go have fun. She later posts on her Snapchat that everyone (me) abandons her. I told her that it wasn't cool for her to do that and that I gave her plenty of opportunity to tell me that she wanted to spend time with me and such. She apologized. Other times, she's gotten wasted and texted me that she'd ""rather die than feel this way"" while I've been on dates with Michael. Again, I told her that wasnt cool. She cried and apologized. 

I want to add that I'm not clingy or dependent on my boyfriend. I love him very much and we've btalked about potential futures  with him, but we are still two people. We bonded easily because we've both experienced devastating loses. Michael had one of his siblings pass away when he was younger and lives in our city completely by himself. His sibling's birthday was a few days before Christmas and he didn't want to spend it or Christmas alone. The death of his sibling still hurts him, and I told her that  that I'd be spending this time with him, and she was seemingly cool with it and she totally understood that he needed someone with him. but for the past week and a half, she's been leaving me on read. I've tried reaching out to her and seeing her whenever I go to the apartment for something, and she's never there. Whenever I have felt like I have upset her, I have always been the first to reach out and ask her what's going on and I'm usually the first one to apologise. I reached out to her multiple times throughout the past nearly two weeks and she has either told me that were find or left me on read. But recently, I could tell something has been up. Finally, I sent her a text asking if she's been mad at me and apologizing for my absence, and she said ""it's okay, our friendship isn't where it needs to be and I'll work on that in time, because I'm pretty hurt."" And I was like ""I totally get that, I've been hurt by you as well. Until your ready, do you want me to stay with Michael?""

I was left on read. And I'm honestly so tired of it, I'm tired of trying to communicate with her and her ignoring me. I texted her again and said ""hey, I'm guessing that's a yes on you wanting me to just stay here."" She replied with ""oh, sorry, I was busy cleaning. Whatever you think is best is fine.""

Y'all, this girl wasn't cleaning. I know because she was active on Facebook, sharing stuff and talking to people. It's why I sent her the last message in the first place because on top of not liking being ignored, I hate being lied to. She knows this . So I asked if I could be honest with her about something and she said yes. I sent her a text that said ""whether or not you realize it, but Im not a fucking idiot. You've been leaving me on read and ignoring my existence while being active on every social media account you have.""

Her reply was ""wow. Okay. Glad you got that off of your chest. I'm done here. Good night.""

I tried to call her, because I know she said that to make me upset. She knows I hate passive comments like that because it was the same way my ex would under my skin. It makes my anxiety flare up. She then texted ""what makes you think I'd consider talking to you? Don't call me.""

She has a habit of saying things she knows will hurt me, or others, and then running away. In the past, she has locked me out of our shared room, she has gotten in her car and leftme, she has thrown things at my door while I was sleeping. I told her, for our friendship, she needed to call me right away because that was not okay. She hasn't called. Part of me just wants to cut her out of my life and keep going, but I do have so much love for her. I know I've done wrong in this situation but I have no idea what to do from here. Help me, Reddit. 

Tl;Dr : my best friend is mad at me, I've tried to communicate, and she is kind of ghosting me. I want to save the friendship, but she has hurt me. I don't know how to fix this or where to go from here."

Truthfully though as I am sure many here can relate, I have never really been able to stop on my own. I am a college student at an arts/design school and use weed way too frequently in many aspects of life (eating, sleeping, creative work, socially). I can clearly see why I shouldn't, but I keep coming back to it for ""inspiration"" as it is often a great boost for my workflow. 

Long story short, I have been on vacation with my family for the past week without weed. I have been having a very hard time sleeping, bad headaches and just been pretty irritable in general. This is the longest time in a while I have gone this long without smoking for more than a day. I return home tomorrow and also move back into my college house (which I have been away from for the past 6 months working an internship) and all I want to do is immediately get high as fuck and relax in the comfort of my lovely, empty home and get in my own bed for the first time in 6 months. 

Last night I slept for 2 hours tops and as the sun finally came up I told myself that I needed to seriously go back and start a new chapter of not smoking/smoking way less. I have dealt with a lot of depression and anxiety in the past 4 years and weed is the only thing that ever ""helps"". I had a long look at myself and downloaded a sober clock app and swore to myself I would stop at least for a couple more weeks as school begins again. I had my friend hide my stash and pipes in her closet and gave her the rest of my weed. I know deep down in my heart that I need to stop this pattern, but everything inside me just wants to smoke a tiny bit and finally have a good night sleep. 

Like the title says, I am just really struggling right now and am scared to go home.

Tyler would often make his interns do menial tasks, like cleaning his pool, to make sure that they really wanted the position. 

Tyler had brought RSD Derek, Papa, and Jeffy over. They were playing cards by the pool. After cleaning the pool, Julien went for a swim. After he had splashed around for a bit his Tyler asked' Julien, I need some more ice and I think Derek needs another soda, do you mind?'

'Sure, no problem', Julien said leaping out of the pool and coming over to grab his Tyler's glass.

On the surface these four instructors appeared to give him little heed. But hidden behind their sunglasses all of the instructors took the opportunity to look over, and appraise the young man. 

'Hi Julien. Thanks for the ice'

'Sorry it took so long, and here is your soda.' Julien liked it when the other instructors came over. They were all very smart. And they were always gave good tips to him.

Tyler chided him, 'I was just telling them about your physical' (The year was 2012 and RSD wasn't doing well financially, so Tyler did all the required company physicals himself)

'Tyler!' Julien fumed, quite exasperated, as he started to turn red.

'They didn't believe me, when I said told them that you were so developed, and were so large!'

'TYLER!' he was about to die from this embarrasment.

'In fact young man', Tyler ordered, 'why don't you just drop that speedo so they can see that your boss isn't a liar.

Tyler's friends couldn't believe he said that, nor could poor Julien. 

'What?'

'You heard me, off with it!' A few seconds went by as he stared him down. Finally his resolve broke, and his hands went to the waist of his swimsuit.

There were gasps as he whipped the speedo down. His cock sprang free.

'Ooh My' 'Jeez' 'Wow' 'Oohh, my, yes you are developed.'

Derek lifted up his sunglasses, his eyes clearly fastened on his penis and said,' Julien you have nothing to be ashamed of. My assistant would kill to be hung like you.'

Sitting up in his chair to get a better look, Papa chimed in,'Wow Julien. Ya know your already alot bigger then some porn star men are'

Those kinds of comments continued and under their gaze his member started hardening.

'Ooh Look,' exclaimed Jeffy,'He's getting an erection!'

Julien had shrinkage from the pool, but their eyes which focused on his penis were like invisble hands stroking his cock. It was like someone filling up a water balloon. It just started to swell and swell.

The instructors were shocked into silence as they watched Julien grow a massive erection.

Finally Tyler broke the silence. 'See fellas, I do not lie. I told you he was fully large!', Mercifully he said, 'Okay, thank you Julien, you can go now.'

Julien pulled up the speedo. Although it was difficult to get it back in now that it had lengthened.

Julien retreated to the bathroom where he played it all back in his head. He masturbated furiously. He couldn't believe how all the RSD instructors, who he admired for many many years, all looked at him and his exposed member. He was hooked.

From then on Julien always made a point of hanging out by the pool when they came by for bridge.

Usually it was uneventful. However, each month after they would always ask for a 'status check.'

It would usually start with some quick comment about how his development was going.

Julien was eager to show them. And they were eager to see. But that's all it ever was. Just taking off the speedo so they could see it. Then he would start getting hard, but then Tyler would make him put it back on.

However, one time things were a little different. It was one whole year since he started. It was the usually bridge club over. They asked him how he was, etc. They asked if his penis had finally stopped growing. They were all amazed at how it got a little bigger each year.

'Geez I don't know, what do you all think?'

Julien wiggled completely out of his speedo.

His balls dangled low and his shaft was a thick wrinkled 4 inches or so.

'So ahh, Tyler said that you just turned 22?'

'Yup'

'Ahh legal....tender' as Derek said tender he reached out and cupped his balls.

Julien felt violated. He looked at Tyler for help but he just sat there and smiled at him.

As Derek fondled his heavy balls he looked to Tyler and said,'Your not gonna make him cover up so soon like you always do, are you?'

Tyler responded, 'He's 22 now, he's a big boy. He can handle himself'

They all smiled. Papa asked Julien, 'You don't mind if we all have a little look do ya?'

They didn't wait for him to answer. The hands were everywhere running up and down his body. They were all laughing having fun. They worked him to a full erection. A solid 9 inches. Giggling they took turns stroking him. It looked so funny with him naked outside with the RSD Instructors wanking him.

'Tyler? Do you mind if we have a taste?

'Derek!' Tyler feigned being shocked, 'It may be too much for Julien at this point. Hhm but , maybe he wouldn't be mad if you just gave it a little kiss.'

They all giggled. Julien almost jumped out of his skin as the first set of lips kissed the head of his cock. They all took turns. The first kiss was quick. They got successfully longer though. Infact they were now letting the tip of his cock to just barely penetrated there lips now. 

Tyler, sat back and watched the other instructors amuse themselves with his assistant's massive cock. he was so proud of him. Meanwhile the instructors would take turns wanking him or kissing him. Or one would hold it while the other would kiss it etc. 

Julien was shocked when Derek went to kiss it but as he puckered to kiss the head he let the head slide past his wet lips until the whole swollen penis head was in his mouth. 

Julien looked down to see his cheeks dimpled as he sucked hard on the head. to either side of him was Papa and Jeffy. 

'Hey save some of that for us!' Jeffy complained.

Derek let the massive cock head slide from his mouth with an audible plop. He held on the base of the cock and fed it to the others. They both crowded in to suck it. They all took turns. 'Hey can you deep throat him.? 'cried Papa.

It was that moment that Tyler realized that Julien was instructor material. "
aaruan,21,2018-12-29,AITA for thinking my boyfriend is shit at art and for wanting to discourage him from doing a career in animation?,ta153487,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aaruan/aita_for_thinking_my_boyfriend_is_shit_at_art_and/,"AITA for thinking my boyfriend is shit at art?

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has been pursing a career in art and animation for practically the entirety of our relationship (6+years) and has gotten nowhere. He went to a fancy art school where he worked his ass off for his degree (went to community college first, worked the entire time he was at school, went to food closets, was homeless on and off living out of his car, ect). After we both graduated, we moved in together and I went to get my masters and he went to work in food service. He's been stuck on the idea that he HAS to do animation and hes just waiting for his big break.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is. He sucks at it.

He hasn't even made an animation!

Yeah his school sucked so much, they didn't even have students make a demo reel. His story ideas are terrible, his artwork is terrible, and it feels like he's done nothing since graduating. I feel terrible for thinking this way and feel like a total asshole for trying to persuade him to seek another career path.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Side:** He won't tell me why he wants to do animation specifically (not even the generic, ""I want to make an impact on the world"" kind of thing) and complains that the world is out to get him (often saying he suffers from ""bad luck"" or ""god hates me"" when I feel like it's his life choices hes making). He complains that the animation industry is cutthroat and works you to the bone and how awful it is. He also complains that art is so hard for him and his hand physically hurts when he even thinks about doing something creative. This all prompts me to say, ""If its so terrible and you complain about it so much.... well then why do you want to do it?"" and he goes on and on about how he wants to create a cartoon series and that he wants to put his degree to use. Or he comes up with a different disingenuous answer every time I ask.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, he started working part time so that he could work on his art more... but he hasn't really done much. He thought he could open commissions up to make some money on the side... but no one has even messaged him about it and its been months. He has no online following and complains about that too. I'm having to pay for a lot of things because he only makes enough to pay his bills and rent (I buy food, pay for any kind of date, pay for getting his car fixed, pay him for gas to get to work, ect). I honestly don't mind if he was happy but he hates this job too, and it sounds like it's not the right fit. He will not seek another job or pick up more hours because he thinks he is not qualified for anything outside food service and retail (not true), he doesn't want to do any more schooling or training for another career path, and he wants his next job to be an animation job and that's that.

&amp;#x200B;

He is also dead set on moving in with his former roommate that lives in LA (I really dislike him and think hes super sexist and a general man-child) so they can make their own TV show and pitch it to studios. Problem is, I think this friend is just as depressed and hasn't done shit either so I don't know how moving in with him would help. But he claims they have brilliant ideas (that I think are bad) and he needs to be in the same room to ""bounce ideas off each other."" (Skype is out of the question apparently??)

&amp;#x200B;

This is stressful for me because he won't say when he is going to move, wont make any plans for it, has no savings for it, and doesn't even know how long he will live out there (six months?? a year??? indefinitely????). I'm trying to find my own way in the world as well and it just feels like his ideas are just outlandish based on his skill. It's making it hard to move forward in life and make plans for the future together. We are close to our thirties now and while we are both the definition of late bloomers, I'm kind of tired of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am by no means a saint. I have had to change my career path and tried many different jobs out. I'm not doing a job that matches my degree. I've volunteered at a lot of different places and come at my career goals in non conventional ways. I've learned a lot from all of these experiences about what I want to do with my life. When he looks at jobs, if they aren't animation he wont even both applying. He's worked food service, retail, and that's it and only because he needed a paycheck. Never had an internship, never volunteered anywhere, nothing. I asked him if he would like to volunteer someplace now he's working part time and he said, ""no that will just take time away that I could be spending drawing.""

&amp;#x200B;

He gets very angry and stubborn with me if I mention pursuing a different career path, no matter how gently I say it, and it has been the basis for almost all of our fights.

&amp;#x200B;

**His side:** He often feels like I dislike his art and am not supportive of him. He says that these things take time and he is working on artwork and has made lots of progress. He also says he is applying for lots of jobs and he goes to (expensive!) animation conventions to network with people and recruiters for jobs. He spent $500 on an online skype tutoring course with a well known animator and really hit it off with the guy. He thinks that I just really don't get along with his old roommate and wishes that I did because then we could all move in together. LA is the place to be if you want to do animation and no other city would provide him as many opportunities. Me not supporting him is making things worse in his eyes and he wants me to be a supportive partner.  He blames the world around him and says his lack of money makes it hard to do anything. His computer is 4+years old now and makes it hard to even run photoshop on and that's why he doesn't like to animate or do art as much. He also says it takes him a long time to get his creativity flowing and it takes him too long to draw anything. If he just had more talent, he would have a job already (exact wording from him). He gets distracted while drawing and loses track of time (especially in the morning) making it hard to find time in the day to do anything productive.

&amp;#x200B;

He does suffer from depression and has since childhood. I had to push\* him to go to therapy. He had a lot of negative experiences in the past and was on a crap load of medications that really messed with his affect. Since in therapy he's moved forward a bit, but his therapist is mostly about dealing with his stress and teaching meditation techniques. I also recently pushed him to get medical insurance and see a psychiatrist (and a doctor for the first time since dating). He got diagnosed with ADHD and is somewhat interested in pursuing medication, but is still hesitant because he ""doesn't want to become dependent on a pill."" and, ""I've made it this far without medication, I don't want to lose the coping mechanisms I've learned to deal with it.""

\*By push I mean looking up therapists/medical plans and basically laying it out for him or giving him a script of what to say on the phone when he chooses who to call. As with most things regarding his self care, it's a struggle to get him to do it but once he does he appreciates it and is thankful. I know you can't make anyone get help if they really don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently looking into doing couples therapy with him.

\------------------------------------------------------

He has many redeeming qualities (like being a wonderful supportive partner to me) and is such a smart brilliant person with so many skills. He's great at math, science, and all kinds of other subjects! But his determination and constant failure to get into the animation field have been a strain on our relationship. I feel like a huge asshole because instead of being supportive, I want to discourage him! When he draws me things or asks me to look at his latest work, I just feel upset because it's terrible and he won't get a job with his skills the way they are now.  I understand he is going through some heavy depression, but he's just so stubborn. AITA?

aarxfn,0,2018-12-29,Identity crisis Surface pro 3,jobdone01,Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/aarxfn/identity_crisis_surface_pro_3/,"okay so back in 2014 I bought this Surface pro 3, wiht I7, 256 gb and plenty ram. My stupid ass completely overlooked buying a keyboard. for university!!! it ook me 4 years to realize this...I dropped out of university. 
some years later, I interned at an investment firm an noticed that thye all had a surface pro 3 or 4 or later. all black keyboards. I suspect the reason for this is company policy. they need to be able to control their employees and programmers should not focus both on microsoft and IOS. 
still, all the other fellow young interns used macbook Pro's - the newest ones!. 

my sfp3 is old, scratched back and screen. Since I experienced difficulty with the touch screen I disabled the HID interface for it. and my old pen bugs out so I no longer use it. the Surface Modern mouse that I bought.. it's scroll wheel broke off so it's now only a button. 

I did actualyl buy a black surface keyboard type cover. I had to buy it in danish.
Frankly I am very dissappointed in the complexities of the keyboard. I use both alt+f4 and print screen a lot. and having to toggle the fn key is a mess. also, I hate that the keyboard does not have any kind of ASCII or other for typign international characters. and no, chanign keyboard lay out is not at all a solution. it is more buttons pressed and doesn't even support capital versions of the letters I need. I put the character map on the start screen but It's cumbersome to have to open a sepearate program, locate the individual character each time and in a special language font thingy. sigh.


I originally bought this because I thought I'd need to draw formulas in Organic chemistry. newsflash, everyone uses paper, or learns a LateX mod for typing double bonds and hexagon rings. Anyway, I dropped out, so no more chemistry for me.  For now. 

I am trying to branch into investment - at age 27. I might fail. But I also wonder if I do have a shot. 

my father offered to help me buy a new computer. he thinks my pc is ugly. 

and here in denmark, the market share for apple is huge. especially when it comes to students and university students. mobile operators won't change the screen fora surface pro 3. so I had to do it myself. Meanwhile there are a plethora of shops that will fix your macbook. 

my education as a financial investor starts in under a 5 weeks. I have never owned a macbook before. but I could probably learn to type on it and it's interafce in a week or so. but I'd have to relearn word and excel again. I think.

shoudl I buy a macbook, or a new surface pro something? or just fix up my surface pro 3 with a new screen, pen, mouse and back decal? 

I could also just spray paint the back, and keep using what I have. I likely won't need the pen anyway. and a scratchy screen is kind of to be expected of a tablet.

I wasn't going to let my senior year in college rush by me. I needed to make the most of it, at least that's what all of my family and friends would tell me. Some might consider joining a club, going to more events, getting internship. I had more exciting things in mind. With my sights set on a celebrity (preferably, Hailee Steinfeld), I was ready to create my new slave. It may take awhile to finally meet her in person, but the end result will be worth it. 

So how would I change this famous, head-strong celebrity into a slave for my use? Needless to say, you can find almost anything on the internet. Without complete confidence in its ability, I get my hands on a drug that fosters an addiction to cum. Such an unhealthy and constant addiction is going to ruin Hailee's image and career, but also ensure I have a loving slave who will do anything for a single drop of my seed...

I'd love to play this out with someone and I'd love for you to play as Hailee Steinfeld, but I'm open to a lot of other celebrities as well. We can discuss more details when you reach out. I love the slow burn of someone changing and becoming a cum addicted slave. If you're interested, kik me at HelloMySlave"
aas5c8,1087,2018-12-29,Met my favorite customer on my last day,AdamN17,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/aas5c8/met_my_favorite_customer_on_my_last_day/,"A few months ago I was working my last day at a men's clothing store as I was moving out-of-state the following week. There was one girl I worked with that had good good days, and bad bad days. There seemingly was no in-between. Today was a bad day.

Enter the customer with his friend. My co-worker welcomes the men into the store and asks what they need help with. Customer asks a question and co-worker gives a snarky sarcastic response, but generally points him in the right direction.

At this store, we work on commission and are generally meant to stay with customers and help them pick out appropriate attire. Once the customer walked away, she was complaining about him and everything else that was wrong with that day. I, however, was having a fabulous last day. Since we are on commission I asked if she cared if I helped them out, and not surprisingly she said she didn't care.

Turns out the customer was picking up rental tux's for his wedding that weekend. I congratulate him on the wedding, the usual stuff. Since he rented his tux's through our store, he also has a cash voucher for just about any items in the store. Me, being the jolly fellow I am, got right to work in figuring out what he was looking for. He ends up needed practically his entire outfit for his wedding other than his suit.


While talking I learn he's from San Francisco (we're in Ohio) and I tell him that my GF is doing an internship out there. Turns out they live in the same neighborhood, a ten minute walk from each others' apartments. He decided to give me crap about being 3 years younger than my GF, and we just kept messing with each other the ~2 hours he was there. I was throwing ties at him, we called each other names, I facetimed his soon-to-be bride and they even invited me to the wedding and said I was welcome any time I was in SF again.

He eventually got what he was looking for, and after checking him out I congratulated him again and wished him good luck. Looking back, I really wish I would have gone to his wedding or called him when I travelled out to SF the next time. Never have seen him again, but he'll be a customer I remember for a lifetime. Just goes to show that you never know what customers are going to be the fun ones.

aasbtx,4406,2018-12-29,"Update to MIL sent a bill, or The Accountant and the Audacity of This Bitch",LeCirqueDuNope,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/aasbtx/update_to_mil_sent_a_bill_or_the_accountant_and/,"ETA: I've been informed that one of those clickbait sites has picked up my story. That's ironic seeing as how one of those articles is what inspired this whole shitshow in the first place. (More on that in a second.) I'll be deleting the original post and creating a new burner account as a result but I'll do this update first. Fair warning: this is going to be long because I'm not leaving anything out.

Everyone was begging for an update. The 24 hours are up so here I am. I'm on mobile so SIA for typos and formatting errors. Thanks to whoever suggested the name for MIL. She shall now be referred to as The Accountant. She used to work at a bank so it works. 

I mentioned in a previous post that MIL comes over once a week to watch TV with her sonsband. She was supposed to come over last night but she wasn't here when I got home from work. When I asked where she was, SO said ""I cancelled. I'm not stupid. She doesn't know it yet but she's not welcome in this house anymore."" My heart swelled. He had grabbed takeout from my favorite place and had stopped.by The Body Shop and the liquor store for goodies to help me relax in the tub. We ate, I took a delicious bath and then we sat down to figure things out. By that time it had been about 12 hours since I recieved the card and SO had started to put all the puzzle pieces together. Most of it has been confirmed by a cousin and AIL. His exwife had also heard some of it. 

Before I go on, you'll need some background. Like a lot of the DHs on this sub, SO and MIL haven't always been so close. His siblings are at least 14 years older than him and he was an oopsie baby. He wasn't even the SG, he was basically just forgotten altogether and treated like an afterthought most of the time. His dad died when he was in his first year of grad school and MIL turned her attention to her other 2 kids. SIL has cycled through abusive marriage after abusive marriage and BIL was an alcoholic and a pill head. BIL and MILs relationship was horrific. Everything you'd imagine from a Jocasta and her codependent addict son. Once their dad was dead, BIL basically became her worthless husband. She enabled everything and was very clingy. We didn't know it then, but MIL was the reason BIL couldn't keep a decent girlfriend. She even ran off a wife because the wife wanted BIL in rehab and MIL somehow overrode that decision to keep him closer to her. She pretty much never saw SO except for holidays during this time. Tragically, BIL's choice to move in with mommy over going to rehab killed him. He ODd on his 47th birthday. It was during the funeral when someone had to remind her ""you do realize you still have a son, don't you?"" that MIL realized she had completely dropped the ball on being a mom to SO. That's when they rekindled a relationship. Not long after, SO and his exwife divorced and that's when MIL really latched on. They would see each other for dinner and Netflix several times a week, went on outings and vacations together and he was tasked with all her household chores. I came along a few years ago and promptly put my foot down. I didn't want to cut her off completely so I got him to bring it down to one TV night a week and the occasional ballgame or what have you. If you read my posts from 2 months ago, you'll see that we've been having problems with MIL accepting that my moving in means I'm not going anywhere. We're holding off on an engagement until I finish grad school but everyone knows it's coming. SOs ex is a delight. It's MIL who is the crazy ex-girlfriend I have to fight off. Her main issue is that he takes me to all.his fun activities instead of her now. Someone suggested that this drama is because she thinks I'm after his money and I think that suggestion is spot on. We had recently started putting boundaries and consequences in place and I haven't had to share my man hardly at all. Turns out this nonsense was the beginning of MILs extinction burst. 

So that's the backstory. Now on to what we've managed to piece together so far. This entire thing is MILs doing from start to finish. This is some Machiavellian shit because literally no one in the family was left unmanipulated. Even though I've been around for a few years, SO and I hadn't done the holidays with each other's families so I didn't know this, but SO and MIL had been giving people joint gifts the last several years. Yep. Just like a married couple. Gross, I know, but MIL said it was because she's broke and SO was dufus enough to go along with it. This recent nonsense all started when she realized her temper tantrums about him choosing me over her weren't going to work. Thanks to AIL not being able to keep her mouth shut, we've pieced a lot of this together because MIL told her sister alllll about it since she thinks she's so smart. Here's what we know.

MIl expected that I would once again skip her family's Christmas and that she and SO would be doing joint gifts again (which he would pay for, of course.) When she found out I was attending and we'd be giving joint gifts like a normal couple, she set to scheming. I guess it probably solidified that this marriage is happening and she's permanently second place.(Let's be adults and tell the truth here. She's a distant 9th.) She saw one of those clickbait articles about obnoxious people making ridiculous requests. One of the stories on there was about an office secret Santa with a set spending limit. A woman was upset that the gift she got was under the limit and requested her coworker give her something else to make up the difference. When MIL read this a little cartoon lightbulb went off in her head. 

First, she got to work on the extended family. She told them all about how I'm a rich girl from the city working on a master's degree. She talked about how much I like nice things and the fact that I carry a very nice handbag. (It was a gift from my parents for pulling off a 4.0 while working 2 jobs and doing an internship but whatever.) Basically she made it sound like I was an insufferable snob. She told them how high my standards are and how offended I'd be if they gave me cheap gifts. She put a ton of pressure on them to spoil me and that's why I was gifted so many beautiful and expensive things. 

Then she got to work on SO. She went on and on about how insulted the family was to have not met me yet. She went on and on and made him feel horribly guilty for ""letting me hide from them this long."" He wanted to protect me from this and begged her to help him figure out how I could fix things. She said the only thing she could think of was if I gave nice gifts as atonement. She said it would make up for the fact I hadn't gotten them anything all those other years. That's what SO meant when he was telling me I needed to make a good first impression. He was so worked up by that point that all he could think was we needed to do.this to protext.me from having a bad relationship with his family. 

(Oh, and about SO pressuring me to spend so much on gifts... You guys know that moment in Arrested Development when Lucille says ""it's a banana, Michael. What could it cost, 10 dollars?"" That's my SO. He makes a lot of money and cost of living here is low so he honestly doesn't realize what things cost because just about everything is affordable for him. He knew I had bought gifts but he didn't realize how generous they were. For example, he thought the Tarte gift set was only maybe $8 instead of $22. When he saw the spreadsheet he said, ""Is this right? You spent almost $500 on my family?"" Then he asked how I afforded that and I told him I maxed out my card. He said ""but that's still only $300."" I told him the rest came from my grandpa's money and he burst into tears saying ""no, no, no"" over and over. He's paying me back for the gifts and the money from my grandpa. He's heartbroken that I did this because he knows how hard I worked to pay off this credit card so I could use it to buy books next semester. He's horrified to realize I probably wouldn't have had money for school supplies less month unless I asked my parents for help. And listen, that particular poor decision is 100% on me because SO did offer to pay for all this. That doesn't make it right and we still have to address the fact that he pressured me into this, but we'll cover that in couples therapy. which we've been going to in preparation of our engagement.) 

So back to the story. So basically MIL pressured everyone into buying me expensive gifts and then pressured SO into making me buy them expensive things. I'm sure she felt so smart. We think she didn't expect that I'd be able to do it without SOs help, and that her next plan was probably to get in his ear about how I'm a gold digger and irresponsible and unable to take care of myself. Well TADA, bitch! I'm full of surprises! When SO and I showed up.with 50 freaking gifts she must have realized she might be over her head. That's when she started keeping a tally. We know she asked at least a few family members how much they spent on me ""to make sure it wasn't too much."" She knows the scarf was $45 because she asked and then tried to hand AIL $20 to pay her back. All of this was done to reinforce the idea that I'm a selfish snob who asked for too much. Then she went home and looked up the prices for things and estimated others and sent out her ridiculous spreadsheet and nastygram. Jokes on her cause I'm not ashamed of a damn thing. 

We're still debating what we're going to do. SO and I read all 900+ comments and the general consensus was that we should send a copy of the letter and spreadsheet along with our thank you notes and offer to return the gifts. We agree with that but I'm not 100% on sending the spreadsheet. I'm worried it could backfire and besides, I don't really think it's appropriate for everybody to know how much people spent on everyone because call me crazy but IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS! I was thinking about maybe blacking out everything but that person's specific entry on the spreadsheet. I feel like it's a crazy enough story that I need to provide some kind of proof. Plus I can swing it as ""just making sure this is the right amount I owe you"" if I have to. Feel free to give me your thoughts on this part. As for MIL, we're officially NC. I told SO from the beginning of our relationship that if she couldn't get her act together we were going to have to go LC but this behavior has pushed us past that firmly into NC territory. So in addition to sending the extended family letters with their thank yous. MILs ""thank you"" will contain a letter as well. It will be from SO informing her this was the last straw and she is no longer welcome in our home. She was barely in his life for 15 years and another 15 won't be a big deal to him because he's already done it. As far as he's concerned, this is no different from when she chose to enable his brother at the expense of everyone else except this time she enabled her own delusions at the expense of being in his life. It's going to be hard at first and we're slightly worried about FMs but SO is mostly confident that the family will side with us once this gets out. He also wants to tell his coworkers and exILs since this is a smaller town and word will get around quickly. This is less to shame MIL and more to correct any rumors and misinformation she's spread about me.  I've been on this sub enough to know that won't be the end of it, so we'll be doing all we can to prep for the inevitable extinction burst. The bright side to all this is that I probably get the dog I've been begging for now since MIL is terrified of them. Yay!

As always, advice and feedback are welcome. Hopefully this Nine.com.au doesn't broadcast this update for the entire world to see, too. As a former journalism student, I'm horribly offended at their lazy ass idea of reporting. 🙄

aaskdg,1,2018-12-29,AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend before a series of important job interviews?,Throwaway3362222,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aaskdg/aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_girlfriend_before_a/,"Throwaway. 

Background: My (now ex) girlfriend and I are both studying to be clinical psychologists. The final year of our program requires us to do a year-long internship. Most people apply to sites around the country. This is an extremely stressful time, as you’re essentially competing with other doctoral candidates across the US for a handful of positions. 

More Background: Prior to the breakup, my ex and I had been dating for about 9 months. She was very up front at the beginning of our relationship, telling me she has trust issues due to being cheated on in the past. I was willing to work through these insecurities with her. Throughout our relationship, she accused me of cheating with my coworkers, members of my cohort, friends etc. I want to be explicitly clear that I never cheated on her while we were together. At the beginning of the relationship, I was willing to deal with the accusations and assured her that I wasn’t being unfaithful. My thought process was she’d see that I was trustworthy and realize I wasn’t the type to cheat. But as time went on, the accusations didn’t stop or even lessen, and I began to become increasingly resentful which leads to the current situation...

During one of my internship interviews, I was chatting with another interviewee. She told me that she has an upcoming interview where I live. I offered to meet up for lunch when she came to my city and talk more about the site she’s applying to (I had previously worked there). I told my gf and she was furious. She called me a piece of shit and said she knew I would eventually “act like all the rest”. I broke up with her and told her not to contact me anymore. This was a few days ago.  I’ve been getting messages from her friends essentially telling me what a terrible person I am for “cheating”, breaking up with her right before her series of internship interviews, and that I was intentionally trying to throw her off her game. My own friend group is split on the issue. None think I’m the asshole for breaking up with her, but the majority think it was a dick move to do it before interviews and think I should’ve waited until after (mid to late January) to leave the relationship. 

So now I want Reddit’s unbiased opinion. AITA? And if so, how should I go about apologizing?

aatnqe,1,2018-12-30,"I think i’m ‘in love’ with someone, i barely know and I probably will never see her again any time soon. How can I get over her?",onetimeuseonly21838,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aatnqe/i_think_im_in_love_with_someone_i_barely_know_and/,"

Hey reddit please help me, i feel super miserable right now and I don’t know what to do. 

TL:DR: I met a girl on a house party and cannot stop thing about her. She goes to a different university and I will probably not see her again soon. My body is like in love with her and I cannot stop thinking about her. What can I do to forget her?

It is quite a long story, english is not my native tong, so bare with me. Hope you guys can understand the situation I’m in. Here is the background story, but first some information about myself
I’m a 21 year old male, 4 year student. Decent popular, okay with girls (few hook ups every now and then), but never had a girlfriend before. Friends told me that I’m ready to have a girlfriend and that I should go look for one.


This summer I was a guide in the introduction week of my university. I met this amazing girl (lets name her ‘T’) in my guidance group, we had a great introduction week, the week after I asked her out and she said yes. About 2 weeks had passed, we had been texting each other a lot and 1 day before the date she sent me the “lets be friends” text. I was really upset, felt really sick and couldn’t sleep for weeks. I really liked her, but she liked an another guy more and now it’s her boyfriend

3 weeks after that ‘friend zone’ text, I went to a house party of a friend of mine, she is in a sorority. I played a game of beer pong with a few of her friends. After that game one of them (call her ‘N’) walked up to me and we started talking. After an hour she asked me if I wanted to be her date for her sorority’s ball (5 weeks later). I said yes and I spend the rest of the evening talking to her. Then she asked me if I could bring her home that night, I did, we exchanged numbers and we made out nothing more.

The entire night I felt like she was more into me, than I into her. For example, she walked up to me first, she asked me to bring her home and she actually made the first move to kiss me. But the next morning I texted her, she was like yea lets to the ball together, but that was it. She was not into texting, she only gave like really short answers. Which was weird but okay I don’t like texting either.

But here comes the problem. I was still into T at that time, so every time I thought of T I said to myself: no, put your energy and thought in N because you are going to the ball with her etc. So did that and I got over T.  I was really excited for the ball, but unfortunately 2 days before the ball, N texted me that her close friends couldn’t find a date (confirmed) and she was not sure if she wanted to go alone with me without her close friends. I said, if you would like to go, then I would love to go with you. 1 day later she texted me back, saying that she really enjoyed the house party with me, but when her friends are not going to the ball, she does not want to go either. She even said that it was all her fault and that It had nothing to do with me. Then I asked her if she wanted to do something else then together and she said no, she said that she was not into dating me. Going to the ball was fun and stuff, but dating no. 

This all happened like 2 months ago, but I still think of N every day. I just cannot forget her, I went to parties reaching out to many girls, but when I talked to these girls I felt nothing. I don’t feel the same connection with these girls compared to what I had with N. And I know it’s silly and stupid to think that N is ‘perfect’. I cannot get rid of that thought, I deleted facebook, instagram of my phone, so I had no urge to ‘stalk’ her on social media and I blocked everything related to her sorority too.

But one time I was so obsessed with her that I went to a party thinking that N would be there too, cause I saw that all her friends were going. But she was not there, because she is doing a full time internship right now (until February), so she is not going out. Then I realized I am obsessed with her, this is a toxic feeling and it needs to stop. 

I keep saying to myself, N is not the one, just go out and meet new girls. But somehow my brains cannot let N go, I talked to many friends, but non can help me. 
There’s a small chance that I will see N again in the near future and therefor I don’t give my hopes up yet, who knows that future could bring (even though I know it’s BS and she probably never thought of me again after that party).

I thought of a few reasons why I cannot get over N. One, i liked T so much, but I could not get her, so I put feelings I have for T into N. Therefor the feelings I have for N may be because I still like T. Second, a girl had never asked me to go with her to a ball or something like that, N was the first person to do so, so in my mind she is special.
Third, I truly felt like we had a great connection, 
I have never spoken to a girl before like N, we had such similar interests and we had a similar way of thinking.
Fourth, maybe I am too desperate to find a girl friend, that’s why I would love to be with N just for having a girl friend.


Pff reddit help me, what can I do. I want to her the cold hard truth, tell me what I can do to forget her and move on with my life.

Thanks in advance"
aause3,6,2018-12-30,Repair old pc (380$+mild risk+ugly) OR buy Macbook (2800$ to 1000$+learning curve),jobdone01,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/aause3/repair_old_pc_380mild_riskugly_or_buy_macbook/,"TLDR:
SF Pro 3:
disabled touch, broken pen, broken mouse scroll, type cover has no ASCII/Unicode for special characters. has bad signal value, but was seen used when interning at a small investment firm. 

OR 

Macbook: Air OR Pro, 12-15"".
Uncertainty abotu what to buy. lack of portability. lack of screen tilting far back enough for my height. But sleek as hell and has signal value. evry big youtuber, and every student I have seen at university, has some form of mac. usually a macbook airwitha glowing back logo. at the investment firm the other interns all had macbook pros.

Don't get me wrong, part of me freaking loves my Surface pro 3.  I really like how light it is. That said, it has become very very hard to keep loving it. my first charcger broke within two months so I didn't use it for 3 years. the pen works such that I have to ""activate it on the lower half of the screen, and the back tip malfunctions in  a way that it both opens onenote app and screen clipping tool in one. I installed onenote2010 and hate the onenote app.  I have come to never use the pen. also the batteries are mildly cumbersome. So I need a new pen which is easily 200$ here in Denmark. I don't want a knockoff. But at the same time, who needs a tablet anyway? idk. maybe me for reading. but I don't care to pay adobe to be able to write in pdf's.The ""Surface Modern Mouse"" is really sleek and easy to use, except the scroll function broke off. failed to fix it so it's only a middle button now. I'll need a new one but am not sure if I want the mobile mouse.another choise to make. I don't want my stuff stolen and has before experienced people stealing my expensive ergonomic Logitech mouse. The screen is scratched and got a veyr very mild dent in. apparently it is enough to make the touch think I hit one spot many times per second. sometimes I can correct it but I decided to disable the touch interface (HID interface, device manager). The computer is in and off itself more silent than anything I owned before. But likely not silent compared to anything apple  makes. Did I manetion that I had to reset the tablet to 8.1 to fix some major startup bugs? I'll need to reset it again, and try to install windows 10 with firmware updates, with no guarantees whatsoever it won't bug out again the same day I start school. The cahrger also is a bit cumbersome. I get that Microsoft had to work around a plethora of patents form competitors. but come on. I feel like I am toying with a piece of liquorice, turning it just right. it's nice that the pen can magnetically clip to hte side when it's not charging. but its also bad for the pen battery. 
what I do love about it is how easy it seems to me to have a pc with me. I can have the charger, pen and mouse in jacket, and just bring the tablet with me. no bag or cover or sleeve. I even plucked on an ugly black pop socket on the back to use the tablet mode better. before the screen got scratched and broke mildly. also the keyborad, type cover. I had to buy it expensively in danish. And i got both very sad and furious t olearn that there is no form of ASCII or Unicode one it. I can no longer press alt+135 or 138 to get big or small c-cedille. Everyone either suggests ""switching layout"" or some keyboard program Where I have to learn to code just to make it work. wtf.  I also tried the windows charactermap. noen of theese are solutions of comparable user-frinedlyness. 

Then there is ""the mac""
I don't know what I want. I never owned a mac before. 
They all look sleek as hell. But at the same time I noticed that none of them ben far back enough for my height. I will ALWAYS have to hunch down. I am 6'3"" and ergonomics matter a bit  to me. I get that I in class won't be able to bring an external monitor, but come on, at least let it tilt 30 degrees more for my eyes.
Getting a new pc means getting a pc with a newer battery. The sfpro3 doens't have abad battery. I didn't use it for 3 years. still it might last longer. 

I am tempted to go for the 15"" this is simply to get some bad compromise against the bad tilting and my height. I already work fine on the 12"" surface pro. However, this means less portability. much less portability. and buying a new macbook pro means buying new accessories (cables), and other unknown stuff. 
Secondly, I will have to learn a new way to use a pc. I am not used to the mac. I don't knwo the multiple tuch gestures. I don't know where the files are located, how to close the browser or alt+tab between programs. I can't for the life of me remember how to type ""@"" on a mac.


If surface, I aim to use the surplus of money on investments. I'll still have to deal with microsoft updates, unless i disable it completely.
If mac, my father may be able to help me out financially. But only maybe.
15"" is a larger screen to work on for sure, but I feel like it is a bad comrpomise from workign on three screens or any kind of Imac. 

If I am honest, I'd rather spend the money elsewhere  than on a pc. but I also know thatclassmates will judge, and it WILL affect my grades. I am already 6 years older than them. I can't afford to slack off on my image.

aav7k5,6,2018-12-30,start by developing myself vertically or horizontally?,clone290595,BusinessIntelligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessIntelligence/comments/aav7k5/start_by_developing_myself_vertically_or/,"Hello everyone, i already say thanks because i'm learning a lot reading here on this sub.

I'm graduating in Italy in IT Engineer and i want to make some experience as a BI/DW consultant.

I have two options for the internship and then subsequent hiring:

Option A: company using only Microsoft Stack (plus some Python, R and SQL)

Option B: company using several stacks (IBM, Microsoft, Sap, Oracle and others)

Both A and B are strong in Italy and Europe and there are no big other differences for the choice. Also, the career perspective is similar.

For the B option they explicitly said that i'll work with several stacks.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you choose, taking into account that i'm a fresh grad and i'm quick to learn and voraciously curious?

Is the microsoft market large enough (and will it be in the future) to justify a vertical choice on it? How much will my skills be transferable to other tools? Or is it better to see as many tools as possible from the beginning?

Vertical skills (option A) or horizontal skills (option B)?

Thanks a lot in advance, your judgement is the most precious to me, and sorry for my poor english."

aavihb,5,2018-12-30,Can you explain this trend for me,chocolatefrog33,lawofattraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/aavihb/can_you_explain_this_trend_for_me/,"Hello everyone,

I have noticed a trend that I have been experiencing ever since I was young. At first I didn’t give it much thought but now I’m really curious about it and would like to have some perspective from you guys as I feel like it has something to do with the law of attraction.

I’m an introvert and I was a shy kid back in the day, therefor making friendships has always been a struggle for me. What I noticed though was that whenever I started being friends with someone and get really comfortable I’d get separated from them for random reasons. Let me mention some examples from the top of my head:

1- From first to third grade I became really tight with these two girls and then in forth grade (students go to different classes in my school after third grade) all of us went to different classes and our friendship ended after that.

2- In seventh grade I became really close with another girl and she moved to another school next year.

3- Eighth grade (which was the best year of my teenage life) I was friends with a group of girls and by the next year some of them befriended other “more popular” girls and our friendship ended right there.

4- Ninth grade I became best friends with this girl who I’m still in contact with and we hang out occasionally. But back at the time after ninth grade we went to different high schools in tenth grade (even though she was supposed to be originally in my high school but she had to move due to moving to a different house)

5- In one of my internships once I got used to one of the girls who worked with me she quitted after a short while.

6- In my other internship the other intern who was really cool compared to the other employees I worked with, and who I became close with right from the beginning ended up quitting after only one month from joining.

7- Now at my current job, I’m not too fond of my coworkers as they are older then I am and I just can’t connect with them. A new girl around my age joined and she is so nice and we became friends right from the beginning. However just a couple of days ago she told me she needs to change jobs as this job really stresses her out.

After typing all of this it feels like it’s all in my head and I might be exaggerating but am I crazy to thing that there is a pattern here? Do I give off some weird energy that pushes people away lmao?

I’d appreciate any insight on this matter. "
aavs6e,1,2018-12-30,I [M21] have a gf [F20] since 2013 (almost 6 years),lioto2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aavs6e/i_m21_have_a_gf_f20_since_2013_almost_6_years/,"Well as the title say, she is mine first and only gf till now, we started dating when we were at the same class but back then she wasn't able to catch up it science disciplines (math, physics, chemistry) and this is important cuz im really shy (not used to have female friends) and our class had an other girl(Girl A) that i used to study/have fun with, but that make she feel inferior and jealous what leeds me to pick between mine GF and a friend. 
3 years later me and mine friends  groups met an other girl (girl B) that used to play computer with us quickly we started to know more from each other and found out that we had a lot in common, but once more she started to get really jealous till the point she warning the other girl too move away from me (at this time girl B was starting to flirting a close friend mine)
At this time i started to feel depressed/angry cuz i had constantly to choose between she and news/olds friends (the olds i don't like to ""bleme"" her cuz i probably would make the sames choices without her) and i was summer working so we started to get distant and i ended up breaking everything trough texts, with that she was broke inside but during that month i was feeling well till the moment  someone told me she was dating an other guy (1 month later) i got so pissed off with that, that i called her telling that i would destroy every single thing that reminded me of her, at the end of the call we plan to hangout next day and to try making the things work out between us
After this summer that was mine last year on that school the things ware really good but i had to move to an other city to keep studying (here in mine country exist a school lvl between university and high school that u can choose or not to do), at the start she helped me a lot i was living alone for the first time and she came visit me a couple times, but the things started to go wrong because i wasn't working yet and mine mom was the only resource of money for me and mine sister so u couldn't go home that much cuz the travel was expensive she started to miss me, a year ago she quit our old high school (cuz math physics chemistry) and move to a new one starting from 0 a different course, at the end of mine also last year i got internal in a company on the city she was living now, so we started to live together the internship end i the company hired me and i also joined university to get a engineering degree but that absorve all my time the things between us a couple weeks ago almost ended cuz she was angry ""i wasn't giving her the value she deserves"", (i have really low free time, and the one i had only more/less 30% was for her)
A days before christmas we go to our hometown i had only four days to be there (22 i was home with mom helping her, 23 i did go dinner with friends i didn't saw a long time ago (she was mad/sad cuz i don't invite her to go with us), 24 i was with mine family and she with hers but the every year they (big family) ask for me and she feels bad cuz im not there with her 25 i was supposed to be with her before come back (had to work 26) but then she texted me telling she will be with her family again on their place i though that tha was ok for drive back to our house (north) without pass where she was (south) while i was driving she called me i told her i was going back she got sad/mad again, then on this week she got mad/sad again cuz we are talking almost nothing and she was able to see that had been online on Facebook/Instagram and didn't text back, 27 i had go out with a friend to play football when i was coming home she called mad/sad again for the fourth time cuz i wasn't texting back i told that i was out playing football and we can talk in a while, when i arrived home i text her back and she didn't reply next day i fell a sleep and had to make extra hours at work when i was finally home she called we almost broke up through phone call i got flashbacks from how bad she was last time, and told her we need to talk when she come back home, 
today im home alone till 2nd/3rd January i already found a new place to live but dont now what to do next, should i move on or keep trying work on our relationship?

TL;DR almost 6 years young couple started to live together the things are not working well should we break up or try make it work out? "

Have your own F4F prompt that you'd like to pitch to me? Please do! Spot anything in my post history that we could amend to an F4F scenario? Let me know!***

-------------------------

Hi!

So, here's my first ever F4F prompt, and it's going to be a bit bumbling at first, but hopefully it makes sense by the end!

If you've read any of my past prompts, this one will very much take the same sort of shape - no specific, pre-written prompt, but instead a discussion of certain themes or elements I'd like to explore, to better facilitate a sort of.. brainstorming session, to come up with something better suited to both of us.

So! Without further ado, here's what I'm feeling today.

-----------------------------------------

***Lost, damaged, troubled girls.***

I just love some drama, inner-conflict, and some grittier themes. What I'm really looking for today is for one of us to play a girl that's lost in life, a bit damaged from previous experiences, or has troubled habits. 

* You know the type. Those lost girls that are in college or just out of it and have no idea what to do, who can't speak for themselves with any shred of confidence, who haven't quite grown up into confident, self-sufficient adults (but still legal adults!).

* Or those damaged girls, reeling from past experiences. Not growing up with a mother and having a bevy of mommy-issues, or terrible romantic or sexual experiences (I can't get any deeper than this without trigger warnings, which I don't want to issue in a prompt. Interested in this point, ask about it in PM). 

* And lastly, even those troubled girls - the ones that party way too much, that abuse drugs or alcohol, that shoplift or commit other petty crime, that can't hold onto any sort of stability in their lives.

***And the uniting theme here? They're going to be played opposite of a successful, confident, stable woman who is going to guide them along the right path, you could say. Of course, plenty of sexual care goes into that, too.***

------------------------------

***What're my preferences here?***

Ideally, ***I would prefer to play the older, successful, guiding, more dominant woman.*** I could play the other role, but this is indeed my preference. I'll write the rest of the prompt with that sort of assumption, that I'll be playing that character and that you, lovely potential partner, will be playing the lost, damaged, or troubled girl.

Other preferences? Age gaps! Secondary characters! World-building! Realistic pacing and development! Surprising twists and turns! Triumph and tragedy!

-------------------------------

***Possible scenarios?***

There are some that are immediately obvious, of course. 

* Perhaps this troubled girl has managed to land an entry-level job or internship at some sort of marketing or law firm. Things start off decent enough in the first week or so, but her issues deep down are starting to surface - work quality is suffering, other little behavioral hints. My character would be a far more established partner or member who takes a professional mentoring role towards the girl, and then eventually notices her odd behavior, and becomes the strict influence the girl needs in her life. 

* Similar kind of setup fundamentally, but with a different surface - a coach and her college athlete. Or a professor and her college student. I'm far more interested in the development of their taboo, secret relationship than I am in just random kinky sex (although, there can be plenty of that, but I want development with it, too).

* Incest? I'm into it, and it could work under certain circumstances. Perhaps a young girl who was given up for adoption as a baby searches for her biological mother as an adult - she finds her, reaches her, and attempts to reconnect. And, naturally, the girl has had a difficult life. 

* Another incest possibility would be between sisters with a bit of an age gap. Perhaps the younger one was still living with their parents and their parents died in a tragic accident, leaving the young adult (18-21) more or less on her own, and so her older sister takes her in for a while.

* Lastly, any of your ideas or suggestions! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling here and I'm really, really receptive to any and all of your own ideas, thoughts and suggestions! I want this to be a team effort.

***So, really, I'm looking for a cute, likely romantic tale between a younger, troubled/lost/damaged girl and an older woman with a spark missing in her life. There'll be struggles, difficulties, some life-coaching, rules, and plenty of D/s themed kinky sex.***

----------------------------------------

***Lastly, let's talk about kinks.***

* **Kinks:** I am a switch, with more dominant tendencies. I'm into things like roughness, hair pulling, light choking, spanking, light bondage, collars, gags, blindfolds, anal play (fingering, eating ass, toys, strap-ons, giving and receiving), orgasm control (forcing, edging, denying), toys, oral both ways, fingering, dry-humping/outercourse, age gaps, incest, sweat/musk (a big favorite), casual sex, informality, semi-public/risky, spontaneous sex, mutual masturbation, romance, affection, face sitting, dirty talk, sweet pet names, and so many more!

*Of course, none of those are required at all.*

* **Limits:** Scat, vomit, blood, extreme pain, bestiality, lactation, death.

------------------------------------------

***Some final notes!***

* I only write here on Reddit, through the PM's. Not chat. Don't send me chat invites.

* Yes, this is F4F. Guys, respect that. Today isn't your day.

* My message length varies, but you'll never get anything less than 4 lines out of me.

* I can write in first or third person, with a slight preference for third."
aax7wj,0,2018-12-30,How Valve ruin Counter Strike and the next generation of players,swEd_,GlobalOffensive,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/aax7wj/how_valve_ruin_counter_strike_and_the_next/,"Never posted about it and never think that was so much necessary to do, but, nowadays and rlly exclusive because of Valve that's a post who I need to do. This is about my Counter Strike ""carreer"" in the game and how Valve completely fucks the entire game and next generations of CS players. 

**Counter Strike Grind**

I play Counter Strike since 2008, surpassing the CS 1.6 and the CS:S , that was something fun to me because I was really competitive and it gave me the ways to compete and become a good player (not think and never dream that have a competitive scenario). For me Counter Strike was since the start a way to chill, was able to play with my friends and a lot of surf / kz maps. In december of 2012 (who was released in August) I bought Counter Strike: Global Offensive and spent more than 14.000 hours since I started play the game. As many of people who get into pro scene, I grinded this game as fuck, like my whole life depends on it, tryharding all the way and trying to become good. Into July of 2013 I reached Global Elite rank and that was the high point who I never dream before, I become at the highest level of the game and that was satisfyng as f\*%#, I  win 16 matches in a row and ranks up. In that moment I was 16 yo, as a player and with my parents not supporting me and bringing me down, I got to work and study and I leave CS on second plan. In this moment I played only to become good, because I haven't time to grind CS, have invited to more than 15 teams but have to decline all because I haven't time to dedicate for training and grinding in the competitive scene.  Between 2013 and 2018 I played only Regional LANs who paid like R$ 1500 - R$ 7000 (Something between 400 USD - 1800USD ) for the first places, win 8 of 10 disputed and unfortunately never reached been a ""PRO"", like be a ""PRO for me is get paid by a sallary, but know that I have  the level for that (On Brazil we haven't so much organisations who paid but btw). Nowadays I study on Law College, are Internship on public ministry and help on a Faceit Hub who integrate  the Brazilian Divisions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The central question of cheaters and how it's killing the game:**

\*Valve made CS:GO Free to Play to atract new players and released the ""Prime Account"" to be bought at higher price. 

Thats was the most ridiculous thing I ever experienced in this game, since I started play in 2013 I got tons of cheaters in different ways, never care so much about it, but never seen this before. Valve, please got my line of thinking: We have a new player who never touched Counter Strike before, right, let's play some casuals and get to to the competitive matchmaking! This player who get the Counter Strike for free made the Best of 10 and got 8 matches with cheaters spinbotting and wallhacking the whole map will never play this shit before! Doesn't interest the level of his gameplay or whatever. 

For confirm my case I created a free account for test this and make a experiment, played tryharding as fuck and killing as much I can. I simply complete the Best of 10 and got GOLD NOVA II, with more than 20 losses. I feel Valve NEEDS to rethink some decisions until the game is completely dead and the next generations stop in time. Think with me how much potential s1mple's, dev1ce's, coldzera's are leaving the game because of this shit. Valve fuck the players who went to tryhard and the players who went for fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Considerations:

VACNET and CS:GO Prime are a BAD JOKE.

Sorry for bad english.

When I was in Boston for my internship, I heard about a bar called The Harp in downtown that was apparently home to a Bills Backers chapter. _""Bills fans in Boston?""_ I had to check it out. Turns out it was an awesome place to watch the Bills deep in Pats territory with fellow Bills fans and WNY transplants. I interacted with Big Charles a couple times, but he seemed like a really cool guy with a wicked sense of humor. As a worker at the Harp, Big Charles was a big part of the bar and game days, eventually converting to the Bills Mafia himself from what I've heard. 

I was only in Boston for a few months, but coming to the Harp helped me feel welcome in the city. I donated to this fundraiser, and I think additional support would mean a lot to this Bills Backers chapter and to Big Charles' family. They've already raised $5000 but recently upped the goal to $7500

aaxj58,2,2018-12-30,(M4F) Teen romance with an older man,swimonland,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/aaxj58/m4f_teen_romance_with_an_older_man/,"Lets get the disclaimer out of the way. I’m over 18, you should also be over 18. All ages under that are just roleplay. 

Now then

I’m looking for a roleplay with some build up to be more than just sex and smut (although naturally sex and smut will happen in due time) and go long term. I have an idea for a scene but if you’d like to suggest any changes I’m open to hear what you think.

You work for me, you have for a while now, maybe it’s just a part time job you picked up in high school or maybe it’s part of an internship program through your middle school to help get a leg up on real world work experience while earning coursework credits, or some combination of the two. The details of how can be worked out later, but the point is you’ve been working for me for a while now, we’ve developed a bit of a friendship with maybe the occasional harmless flirt here or there.  However as time has gone on I’ve started to notice your developed body more and more, and you’ve started to pick up on how much more enjoyable it is to catch the eye of an older man checking you out.

Things haven’t progressed beyond harmless looking and the occasional wink or comment but aside from that I’ve been like a mentor to you as well as a boss. This year however you’ve seen me under a mountain of stress dealing with running a business and managing a messy divorce. Now that I’m over worked, stressed, and newly single it may be time to go from harmless flirting to something a little more risky.

How do we get to that next level? Do you tease me till I break and take you after hours? Are you shy and reserved until I make my move and seduce you? I’m up for discussion on how things play out but what’s important to me is that we have some kind of a build up to that point and play this out as more than a one night fling.

As far as kinks go my interests are pretty varied but right now my top kinks for this are ageplay (duh) Dom/sub roles (also into role reversal if you prefer to play a young femdom) bdsm, rough sex, dub con/noncon (provided it transitions into consensual as the story progresses) 

Hard limits are toilet play, gore/vore, snuff, feet, your typical “gross stuff” list 


If this is something you are into and you can write more than a couple lines for a reply shoot me a message with the name of you want to play as, your age you are playing,  description of what you look like and what kind of way you want to go about this as far as our relationship changing.  (Pictures are okay for a reference but I do still like something written as a preview into how detailed a writer you are)

If I don’t get to you I’m sorry, sometimes prompts lead to my inbox being flooded 

I look forward to hearing from you!"
aaxkkp,1,2018-12-30,"Me [20s M] with my sister [30s F] and abusive parents [60s M/F], should I contact a lawyer for legal advice on financial issues?",StroopWafelsLord,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aaxkkp/me_20s_m_with_my_sister_30s_f_and_abusive_parents/,"I will preface this saying I live in a rural area of Southern Europe and my close family is very conservative, and well off money wise.

My sister has always been my parents' favourite. She could go out, drink and drive, graduate later than normal, not do anything with her life but I was always in her shadow. 

She started working part time as soon as she was 18 and has always faked being independent. She always threw shade at me saying I was doing nothing all day while she bought her own car (bought by parents). 

We have a 7 year difference and while she was at uni she wasted two years on alcohol and going out and my parents didn't bat an eye. 

Now that she's out she's working in the small family business. She often plays the ""independence"" card on me saying I should be working (I study in  an objectively much more demanding field speaking about time used per day on internships and all that.) and everytime I bite my tongue trying not to to talk back saying she graduated two years late.

Last year, she finally got a DUI after countless times of driving under the influence of alcohol, and my parents still didn't bat an eye. The one time I got really drunk was at friend's party, knowing I didn't have to drive, and I still get shit on for that.

Fast forward to this year when my parents suddenly decide to buy her a bloody HOUSE in the middle six-digits because ""we don't know where else to ""invest""!""

Now I would be totally fine if this happened to her and then my parents had a plan for me and my future, but they're costantly berating me for ""being useless"" and ""not working"" and they said I'll get their house so we're ""50/50"" about the inheritance but then my mom starts saying ""oh StroopWafelsLady you can get the house when I get old and you have kids"". 

Should I just slam the door and run away? I don't think I can rekindle anything about our relationship, but I feel like my sister doesn't deserve to be treated like this while I get shit on costantly. 

I'm considering contacting a lawyer for legal advice on what to do next, but I feel also immature and spoiled.

**TL;DR:** Family costantly treats me like a derelict, expects me to love them and support them, but then buys house to my sister and it seems like I'll be forgotten in the inheritance."

24-year old that recently finished school and looking for advice to help me get on track with being financially responsible, such how I should divide up my paychecks and my best options for my loans. Gave the 18-25 wiki a read and will continue to dive deeper into it. 

**Stats:** Checking account with Chase has 2k. Credit score is 748. Need to open a savings account, ally bank was recommended a while back not sure if still a viable option. No retirement savings as of yet, but I've been doing research on starting a Roth IRA once I develop a plan. Currently, have a car that is paid off but will need to purchase a new one in the next 3-4 months. My rent is $500 a month. Maintaining a Discover It and Chase Freedom Unlimited credit cards, that are paid off each month and carry no debt.

**Loans:** All loans are in grace period until April, but want to start on them as soon as possible

* Sallie Mae Loan: $21,290 @ 9.875% (Will be my main focus)
* Nelnet Loans: $31,940 = 8 loans ranging from 3.4-4.45%

**Job:** Starting the second week of January I will begin my nursing intern program that lasts 8-12 weeks and pays $20/hr. Upon successful completion of the residency, I will transition into a staff position that will start at $30/hr without taking differentials into consideration. 


I started playing around with YNAB since it provided a free year for students and will continue to work on developing a solid budget to follow and chunk down these loans. I'm sure I'm missing a lot of information but would appreciate any advice on starting down the right path with paying loans and starting to save."
aaz10r,4,2018-12-30,Keep swimming,aznmary,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/aaz10r/keep_swimming/,"Just want to write down my feelings hoping that it’ll make me feel a bit better and maybe someone can relate.

Long story (not so) short, I moved to the states six years ago when I was 19 y.o. Was awarded a full scholarship to attend college in FL - I could write a 20 space essay describing how I got lucky but that would be for another post/time. To this day, it is still my biggest accomplishment (which happens to be one of my goals in life / living in the U.S.) in life even though I rarely speak about it now. Before the move, I was relatively popular not because I was athletic, handsome, or rich; People found me to be funny and fun to be around with. Similar to a lot of teenagers, I didn’t take school seriously back then knowing that I didn’t have the means to send myself to college. However, English was my favorite class all throughout middle and high schools. I got called to the principals office numerous times because I couldn’t stop making jokes in class. Heck, financially I was a struggling teenager lol. Sometimes my close friends would take a pity on me and buy me lunch at school. Even after all that, life was still beautiful. 


However, it all changed once I stepped foot in the land of the free. Something shifted; suddenly I wasn’t my cheerful and funny self. Finding friends and connecting with people wasn’t as easy as I thought it would be. I kept telling myself “give it time, you’ll find them.” I could barely understood what people were talking about let alone contribute to any conversations I forced myself to be part of. To add more complexity, I grew more and more self-conscious about my English, which made it even harder to make friends. Days turned into weeks; weeks turned into months; months turned into what felt like an eternity. A year passed, and I still had no friends. I cried so much my first year; I don’t think I am capable of shedding a tear if I want to right now. I’m all cried out lol.  I was figuratively stripped of my identity; I didn’t even know myself anymore. I was frustrated, lonely and pretty much in limbo. There were many days where I was so close to throwing the towels. I began to question whether my moving to U.S. was worth the emotional pain and isolation I was going through. To cope, I focused all my attention on school. I spent literally every waking moment studying and doing HW. I started making the deans list and maintained a 4.0 virtually every semester all the way to graduation. I got an internship, which led to a full-time offer, with one of the biggest consulting firms in the country during my junior year. I began to try to learn about myself, I found out that I am an INFJ, which explained why I feel more comfortable taking to people in one-on-one setting. I altered they way I interact with people. If I think I like or want to befriend someone, I will try to talk to that person one on one. Most of the time, it works. I began to cultivate friendship with people on campus this way. I even became close friends with a girl in my program, that we sat next to each other in virtually every class we had together. I’m still friends, and we catch up whenever our schedules allow. When I entered a corporate America, I was fortunate enough to finally find my best friend. We connected instantly. Our work schedules are crazy but whenever we hang it’s like we were never apart. Even when I moved to DC, we would visit each other whenever we can. Same thing happened in the new city where I live now, I was lonely again but then one of my co workers came along; I vibe with him really well, and we start to hang out outside of work. The point is, especially for international students, as you grow older you’ll soon realize that you don’t need to have a million friends to be happy - you just have to find your tribe and know that you ARE enough. To steal Dori’s line - keep swimming until you find your tribe. Keep your head up kiddos!! "

So I just graduated as an MLS (and passed my ASCP!), and accepted a job from one of my rotations last month. I'm working as an evening shift tech in micro/chemistry/and hematology. While I'm still learning a bit, I'm finding the job to be incredibly repetitive and boring (I probably didn't notice as much in school as I was always studying). My coworkers also seem to be boring older moms, with whom I can barely relate. I know work is work, but I didn't realize how mind-numbing this job was going to be. In college, a lot of my friends are nurses, and I still find myself hanging around the phlebs and RNs. My coworkers seem very unsociable and stodgy. Is this the norm (I've rotated through 4 labs and it seems the same everywhere).

I'm planning to do this for a year or so and try for PA school (or MBA if that doesn't work out). This field definitely isn't for me. I like being around people, getting to use my brain, and staying in shape. This doesn't seem to be the case for the lab. A lot of coworkers are borderline anti-social, hate any kind of change/thinking, and are in poor health (no I don't want the cheap cake/donuts you keep bringing!) I'm also finding that working holidays absolutely sucks. How do you people do it?

Was wondering if anyone is in the same boat/feels the same?

I’ve been in this field for 13 years and have worked with all ages and types. I can’t think of anyone I haven’t been able to find at least something good in and something I could relate to and there have been very few people I haven’t outright liked.

I find your blanket statement that everyone is boring and stodgy more a testament to your unwillingness to be open minded than a testament to them. It’s not your coworkers job to entertain you.

Good points. I have a similar mentality to you; someone would have to really push my buttons to get me to dislike them. From what OP wrote, it doesn't seem like their coworkers did anything to antagonize them, except having the gall to offer them sweets, and not having the same interests!

Some people are very quick to find qualities they don't like about others. OP came off as very judgmental by writing their coworkers (and other techs) off as anti-social bores, and only after a month working there!

Not sure what you were expecting. Yes a lot of us are introverts. That's one reason why we're drawn to the lab. It's not a club or the fashion industry after all. We're nerdy.

Jobs are what you make of them. I enjoy being a tech. I'm 27 and I thought the same thing about my coworkers when I started. But guess what? As you grow and learn each other's personality you will get along more. My best friend at work is 55. You don't have to partake in the doughnuts or cake that they bring in. Just be greatful that someone was trying to be friendly and share something with you.

These ""problems"" are in each job that works as a team. It's not limited to the lab. I guarantee that PAs and Nurses have boring days and share cake too.

One lab I worked at held a party every year on lab week. Night shift, without fail, got 1 slice of stale veggie pizza and diet coke. Even though, every year, night shift was promised a small budget for their own party, and promised to be able to listen to music. We were told every time, when we got in, no music because 1st and 2nd shift got rowdy. By rowdy they mean some of the music had bad words that offended a tech.

This. Exactly. It takes a bit to warm up to techs but in my first lab I had a “work mother” who was 55 and pretty much took me under her wing. Also all these people taught me so much knowledge in the Micro world.

I think it’s sad that people feel you don’t use your brain at all for anything in this job. I love being a Micro tech and deciphering stuff and watching Micro resistance develop.

And RNs have boring days and repetitive days too. Even in the ICUs. Yeah sure, occasional codes and stuff. But my friends who are nurses know the routines. Wait on patients hand and foot, meds, vitals, charting, etc.

Only reason lab doesn’t get paid more is because we don’t have an organization to back us up like the nursing peeps do.

I don’t mind talking with coworkers about work stuff but have you found that people in labs you’ve worked at who don’t talk a whole lot socially are sort of ostracized?

I don’t even mind small talk but I’m tired of working at places where you are basically treated like something is wrong with you if you don’t join in when people are laughing and talking or just don’t talk a whole lot socially.

I'm very much a ""gloves on, mouth shut"" tech. It's frustrating sometimes because I get labeled as being anti-social, when really I just don't like socializing when I am on the bench and actively working.

Not really, but I also make an effort to socialize on breaks, during the shift when it's appropriate, and outside of work sometimes. You just have to establish clear boundaries of when to work and when to have fun. When everyone knows that patient care is the reason, it makes a difference.

I mean you'll find a similar thing in most fields. Some labs are better than others. At least they aren't vindictive, catty, back stabbing and such. Maybe try for first shift eventually or try for blood bank or plate reading. They do get repetitive but are more stimulating in my opinion. It just seems pretty drastic to consider changing your entire field from only one less than ideal job experience. That being said, you got yourself into a field with high turnover. My advice would be stick it out and if it's really bad find another lab. Sounds like a lab with a higher ratio of younger people would be good for you.

I only worked for a year but I liked everyone I worked with. Even the really anxious workers that aren't good at there job. You just have to learn how to talk to all sorts of people. Some people are harder to get to open up than others. But most people don't mind talking about there hobbies or things they like. I learned some crazy things about horoscopes, and crystal balls etc, also what it's like to run a record store. Also how to cook various foreign dish.

Even though my post sounds pretty negative, I do actually like working as an MLS. I'm not actively looking into changing careers, but I do daydream about it sometimes. The reasons why I feel it would be very difficult to switch careers are mainly financial and logistical ones. I need my full-time MLS job to pay the bills and keep a roof over my head. It's not really possible for me to give this up and go back to school; I wouldn't be able to support myself. So, this would limit my career choices to something that could be achieved by going to school in the evenings only. Even then, most career programs require some type of internship somewhere that would probably take place during the daytime. So, I don't feel like this is really attainable for me. It seems like I just have to make do with what I have.

We're pretty social and we get along pretty good, but at the end of the day work is work. it also takes a while to build up a good friendly relationship with coworkers.

Although it varies from lab to lab, I find that usually the evening shift people are less likely to be the “social type”. Usually supervisors and managers aren’t there, there are less people and usually the people who work that shift like to get on with their work because there’s typically not a lot of time to chat. I’m an extremely social person and have not had a problem with anti social behavior in any of the labs I’ve worked in.

The job is what you make it; I love going in every day. I enjoy socializing with my peers, and while many simply wont accept an invitation to do anything, others are absolutely great people to hang out with. A majority of my coworkers keep in good physical condition as well.

It just seems you've gotten a snapshot of one lab and are expanding that to all labs, which is far from reality. If/when you find yourself searching for a job you should consider more than just hours and pay scale; sometimes the offer(s) that seem the best on paper are really the worst choices if you really take a look at the day-to-day of the facility.

I'm not an MLT/MLS, but I work in the ""pre-analytical"" part of our hospital lab. I work with mostly either older adults, people with associates, or people with bachelors who need experience. A lot of people ended up at this job because it's the only one that would hire them, but a few are working towards becoming a med tech.

Even though my experience may be different, I find the same to be true. I agree with [/u/Miss\_Sarah](https://www.reddit.com/u/Miss_Sarah); you will get to know them better and get along better. However... most people working in a lab are probably introverts. This means that, even if they're actually really interesting, they probably won't talk much.

I'm planning on going into nursing now (end game psych mental/health nurse practitioner). I need more stimulation than I would get even if I *did* work back in autolab/chem/hem/urines/whatever (instead of printing labels/sorting all day lol).

I work in a molecular laboratory and we're constantly implementing our own LDT's and trying new platforms. We just got a sequencer last week and I will be doing the validation. It's never boring for me...just have to find a lab willing to grow and have a sweet research budget.

I think it truly depends on the lab and the “office culture.” Every work environment will have the toxic people, and every environment will have some people you connect with more. I’ve worked in hospitals, private labs, and now pharma/biotech. Each place has a different vibe. I personally enjoy biotech more than the other two, but it took a little while to figure it out. Don’t base career changes off one less than stellar environment. Maybe look into being a travel tech, or move to a new city! Try different types of labs and give it a real genuine shot. I’ve hung out at work happy hours with people ranging from ages 21-60. I’ve also avoided them because I’m more introverted and sometimes we don’t feel like conversing after 8 hours of it. Don’t write off an entire career just yet, give it a fair chance :)

Totally the norm, and yes, mostly mind numbing. If you like going through the motions and waiting to clock out, this may be the field for you! It is incredibly repetitive by the very nature of it. The people are probably more varied, but it is hard to argue with you as my coworkers sound just like yours.

The people in my rotations were awesome and outgoing. A big part of that is my charm which always brings out the best in those around me. Maybe they sense your negative vibes. Regardless, like you I'll be moving on to nursing or PA because I'm drawn to people. I would have (and should have) bailed on this long ago. I stuck with it because I'm not a quitter.

We had a lot in common, we didn’t fight much and when we did we always did our best to resolve it peacefully.I noticed toward the end of it I was feeling much more comfortable with the relationship. I think that comfort may have pushed her away but I didn’t realize it at first. I got myself an internship, while going full time to school, and my free time got smaller and smaller. While we were both in school I was seeing her once a week, which was all the free time I could really afford without breaking work or school commitments. Over time the relationship got more and more strained. I’m totally not perfect. I made her a lot of promises, to see her more and to take her out more and to make her feel more loved. Some of which, though try as I might, I did not completely fulfill. We had a big fight and through a lot of tears I asked her for one last chance to show her that I could change for her for the better. And I really wanted too and thought I could. I was willing to give up everything to keep her in my life. She agreed, and I was so determined to make our relationship stronger.  Then two days later she ended it with me. For these last two months, especially the holidays, I’ve just found no enjoyment in anything. It has definitely the worst two months of my entire life. My other half cut out of my life. She had promised me after the breakup that when she felt ready too she would reach out to me. She said she needed time. She now ignores me, and I saw her on tinder. Was the person I thought I knew not who she really was? Is this some sort of sick payback for not keeping good on my promises? If that’s the case then that’s fucked since at least I had the balls to call myself out on it and make an effort to do better. Now I’m left broken, miserable and without a clear path on how to move on. Any advice would be really appreciated."

Engineers at HAL however, have decided to begin working on the next upgrade for this new plane, with the release date planned for 4 years down the road. This new upgrade will be designated with an M and all HF-17's can undergo this upgrade. In conjunction with this upgrade, India will develop their own jet engines, hopefully with aid from our foreign allies.

I texted my best friend begging her to date me, and then when I was turned down by her I turned to my other friend (who I have a complicated history with) and tried hooking up with her.

I woke up to the familiar dread of having to make the rounds of multiple apology texts and just sitting in bed feeling shame and embarrassment. This was a regular thing in college, but I graduated last year and have been pretty good.

But I need to accept the fact that I can not responsibly drink. I drink to get drunk, and it constantly turns into terrible choices. 

I don’t wake up craving alcohol, but as soon as I have that first sip I can’t stop. My brother turns 21 tomorrow, so I’m gonna take him out for a single beer. 2019 is the year I get sober. I can’t keep making a fool of myself and pushing people away. I can’t deny that I am an alcoholic anymore. "

Unfortunately for me, that's about to change.

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. My shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood floor.

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn""

I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a meeting about a possible merger this morning and a new group of interns arriving later that day.

__

Put my in my place. Make me your bitch.

Who you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous standards I construct for the annual review? My secretary, tired of being thrown the most menial tasks? The merger negotiator, who finds it much easier to close advantageous deals after she's added another CEO to her harem of sluts? A young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me?

Other ideas or some combination of the above are always welcome. 

My ultimate fate is up to you - will you demote me to your ""Secretary"", dressing like a slut and obeying your every command without question? Maybe I'll just be a whore, lent out at your convenience to sweeten deals with other executives. Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings and verbally abused.

Bondage, foot worship, petplay, and forced tattooing/piercing/branding are all things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!

ab0lg1,2,2018-12-30,Grad School - Debt or No Debt,Reddit_WhoKnew,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ab0lg1/grad_school_debt_or_no_debt/,"Hello everyone. Happy almost New Year!

Grad school admission decisions have started rolling in for 2019 and with it comes the financial component that is making my decision difficult. Allow me to explain.

My fiancee (high school teacher) and I currently live in Boston and want to move back to Michigan, where we're both from and almost our entire families live. I have gotten into 2 MBA programs (University of Michigan and Michigan State) that both start in the summer/fall but comparing them isn't exactly 1:1 as there are many variables.

Michigan is top 10 nationally, has better resources, and is located around where my fiancee and I want to end up. Problem is, it's 2X more expensive than MSU. It's a part-time program, but it still completes in 2 years. Tuition is $64,000/year.

Michigan State is top 40 nationally, smaller, and where my parents live, but not where we want to be long term. It's a full-Time program that completes in 2 years. $32,000/year minus an $8000 scholarship I was awarded leaves tuition at $24,000/year.

Between my savings account, investment account my parent's started for me (to be used for grad school or a house), and checking account, I have roughly $100k that could go towards grad school and living expenses. Give or take depending on the taxes incurred from the gains on the investment (gains which I ballpark to be around $15k come time if the stock market gets out of the recent funk - if not closer to $12k probably). I have around another $60k in an IRA as well but don't want to touch that and my fiancee (who already has her masters) has around $20k in savings and some more in an investment account but I don't know much on that and would again, leave that alone.

Michigan would allow me to work and between that income and my fiancee's income we could cover cost of living and possibly grad school depending on how things shake out. Working and school could be a bit of a slog though. Anyways, COL around Michigan would be 10-20% higher than MSU because it's a metro area but we could live with family for a bit to get our bearings and then find something not terribly expensive. It is a much better area with a lot more to do and better quality of life.

MSU would lock me into school and only school for 2 years minus an internship for a summer. COL being lower would be great and we could live with my parents, rent free as my fiancee probably wouldn't be able to afford COL for us both with just her salary (Michigan doesn't pay teachers all that well). My fiancee would probably have to drive to where she wants to work however because she doesn't want to get into a school district for 2 years and then relocate later on.

Employment data (self-reported) shows Michigan grads earning ~20k/year more than MSU in the Midwest (not including bonuses). Michigan's degree really widens the gap when you start looking at East/West coast data where MSU doesn't travel as well. We want to stay in Michigan so the vast difference won't be seen, most likely.

So the question really comes down to is it advisable to take on debt, possibly upwards of $30k (accounting for capitalized interest) in student loans (6.6% currently) for a more ""valuable"" degree? And if so, would it be wise to use cash on hand upfront to push off the loan until later and avoid some of the capitalized interest/keep the loan as small as possible? Or, take the loan up front, keep the investment running and use it 2 years down the road to pay off part the loan?

I've asked MBA subs as well but when it comes to the degree, a lot of it has to do with the name and connections. I've found people in that area tend to ignore everything else. Much like if you ask Harvard or a non-Ivy school, everyone says Harvard without taking a look at the other factors.

Thank you all!"

Every year we have a company holiday party between Christmas and New Years at our office building. I’ve never been able to attend one of these until this year, I normally travel around this time of year. I wasn’t even sure if I was gonna be able to attend this one till last minute. I really had no idea how to dress for the party so I wore a tight fitting dress that accentuated my curves. When I got there I was definitely overdressed but I really didn’t care. My boss greeted me with a big tight hug that lasted a bit longer than the normal hug, then commented how gorgeous I looked. 

I then went to go talk to my co workers and they commented how close my boss got to me, they said he normally drinks a bit to much at these parties and it brings a different side of him out. Im normally not a person who drinks either, I get very horny after a couple drinks, but my co workers wanted to share a few drinks so I did. A bit later my boss came up to me once again and was raving how great my body looked. He then asked if I wanted to have a quick dance with him, I of course said yes. A quick description of my boss, he’s in very good shape for his age and is a pretty tall guy at around 6’5”. When we were dancing he took me by surprise and started feeling up my body, specifically my butt and whispered in my ear “I’ve always wanted to get a feel of this rocking body ever since I hired you.” I was horny but my better judgment took over and I separated my self from my boss, who is married and has 3 kids. About an hour later I was dancing with another coworker when my boss came over and slapped my ass and said “now here’s the gorgeous broad I was looking for” I’m not gonna lie this turned me on and I went to go dance with him some more.

You could tell he had some drinks but not to a point where he couldn’t control him self anymore. As we were dancing he just started to stare at my chest for about a minute straight, I finally said something to him and he responded by saying “I’m sorry but I just can’t help my self from staring at that rack, it’s hard enough to stop my self when I see you at work. My big dick would look fantastic between them.” Wow that caught me by surprise, I was turned on already but the fact that he said that turned me on even more. I didn’t care that he was my boss or that he was married. We kept dancing, he kept grabbing my ass occasionally and whispering in my ear how gorgeous I was or what he wanted to do with me. After about another half hour of this I had enough and after one of his corny phrases I asked “well you keep saying what you wanna do, when are you gonna do it?” This was all he needed to hear and he dragged me to his office.

His office wasn’t too far from the party but it was far enough. We walk in and he commands me to pull my dress off, I did that exactly. His jaw dropped when he saw me naked, before he could even say anything I dropped to my knees right in front of him and grabbed his crotch. From first feel he definitely wasn’t lying about saying he had a “big dick”. I slowly unzipped his jeans and pulled out his dick. Yeah it was definitely big, much bigger than I thought. He just grinned at me once he saw my reaction to his size and said “I told you I wasn’t lying”. I started to suck his dick and this went on for about 10 minutes.  After this he sat on his desk and told me to get in front of him so he could tit fuck me. That’s exactly what he did, some girls don’t enjoy it but I definitely do and guys love to tit fuck me. Shortly after he picked me up and threw me on his desk and he started to destroy me In the missionary position. He was soooo big and it felt amazing, he knew how to use it. After that he flipped me over and started pounding me doggy style. Then a wrench was thrown into things. 

We heard his office door open and one of our newer co workers walked in and saw me on our bosses desk as he fucked me doggy style. He was probably more shocked than us and just stood there for 5 seconds and just turned around and left. Once the door closed my boss said “good I wasn’t done” and continued to take me to pound town. This continued for a while, then he just out of no where said “I’m gonna nut inside you, you gorgeous girl” I couldn’t even react and he absolutely exploded inside me. He had no condom on and I’m not on birth control, I had my period last week but still. I left the party after that and he went back to the party.

It’s gonna be interesting when we all go back to work next week, especially with us getting caught by a co worker. If you wanna see the dress I wore feel free to pm me! I’ll try to respond to all

ab1l6c,158,2018-12-30,Vestige theory: from All might to Izuku,Aejis29,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/ab1l6c/vestige_theory_from_all_might_to_izuku/,"This'll probably get lost in the shitstorm of hellweek but fuck it. I'm sure this is just bullshit but maybe the reason that Nana and Izuku are able to see the vestiges and all might isn't, is because of emotional strife or being in tune with one's emotions, not to say that all might hasn't had his share of grief, we have no way to compare his experiences to any other user not counting nana (atleast every user barring the first has seen their predecessor killed by AFO or die in some way...maybe) nana had to give up her entire family, which led to her (in my mind atleast) creating the credo of always smiling even when she was hurt and developing it into the way of life we know today.

Now we know how all might deals with emotional stress and turmoil and he does it in a super healthy way...he pushes it down and pretends like it isn't there (ignoring his injury, pushing himself even after transferring OFA, telling izuku about dying soon and by extension ignoring Sir's prophecy) now I know he has his reasons and he can probably afford to considering that...well there's no other way to say this other than he's the OFA golden boy. He can do no wrong, he's the perfect specimen of physicality and his use of the power is so instinctual off the bat it's like breathing and he's the only user we know of able to beat AFO...twice but it's still unhealthy, I think the reason he didn't have the dreams like Izuku is because he was denying how he really felt or  something along those lines. The first user stated ""We've **long** since **past** the point of **singularity**"" now I know this is subjective and open for debate because it's a VERY vague statement that could mean anything about anything, but I choose to believe that he was talking about the vestiges and I mean you don't say that a couple of months is a long time do you? I think he was referring to that at some point when all might had it, it evolved but all might couldn't interact with them because of the reasons stated previously, and he was putting an unconscious mental shield up or something thus not allowing the vestiges to interact with him.

Obviously I can't prove it but we know Nana had more visions than all might ever had and all might only ever saw the shadows to the extent that izuku did during the sports festival, but why would it just skip a generation? could just be as simple as a case of affinity, All might was naturally attuned to the physical side but totally out of sync on the meta-physical side, but personally I really do think I'm somewhat right in this case. OFA's whole schtick is, in the words of all might himself ""FEELING!"" it's an integral part of controlling it and both sides go hand in hand, you have to be in control of your emotions to control and regulate it properly just like when izuku accidentally goes above his safe percentage during the stain fight and the bakugo fight and by extension the opposite when he goes to punch shigaraki (unconsciously restrains himself cause he doesn't want to kill him), emotion is everything when it comes to OFA and I'm repeating myself but All might is a very troubled man who's only now coming to terms with everything that he's dealt with over his life (after he's already lost his powers, aww all might sorry buddy) and his main source of dealing with things is to ignore them a direct antithesis of nana and izuku, Yeah nana had her smile credo but she openly talked about things that bothered her to gran torino and all might himself when she was teaching him, all might had almost no one after nana died, he completely cut Sir out of his life after the AFO fight, had evidently not talked to gran torino in a long time until he contacted him during the internship, tsukauchi is (maybe) only a work friend  (david is in a weird state of limbo in that he's canon but not canon at the same time, movie has a weird disconnect between the series but I personally consider it canon) and not to mention living a lie Every. Single. Day for five years trying to pretend nothing was wrong and pushing himself further and further.

Now on to Izuku, okay for all the shit he gets about crying all the time the one thing you can say about him for certain is that he's very self aware as in he knows himself very well, he talks about his problems and accepts his own limits, not to say he's dealt with more tragedy than all might, cause he hasn't but he's certainly had to deal with a lot in a short time frame of under a year. although he can be self destructive at times it's not to the same stubborn extent that all might is (also debatable, he's called ""the madman"" for a reason) and when he needs help he admits that he does unlike...yep, you guessed it all might and what is it that the vestiges keep saying to him (good ol' hellboy lookalike) ""you are not alone"". The first time he seen the vestiges was during the shinsou fight, originally I thought it was shinsou's quirk that was the catalyst and it was the will of OFA responding to a foreign element kind of like the immune system or whatnot but the first time he ever saw them was the first time he actually felt the momentous weight of becoming the next symbol of peace and he was REALLY struggling during the festival (yeah thanks all might) and that's really what allowed the vestiges to take control interact with him. Plus, just think of this right in the span of only a two to three months of the in-universe timeline Izuku's had to deal with a lot of shit that made him question his own self worth and his worth of being the new holder of OFA, (Bakugo and the kamino incident, damaging his arm's, All might's retirement and the fallout that came with it, fucking up with Eri the first time around, Sir's death, Mirio losing his quirk, possibly guilty about Gentle) so much so that he tries to give OFA to mirio, speaking of which I really hope they highlight that scene more in season 4 cause it was my only gripe with the whole Overhaul arc, I think that's why the vestiges are so active lately, because he's dealing with so much shit internally, anyway that's all of it sorry for the word vomit and bear in mind that this is all genuinely just conjecture."

I originally was using it as a stepping stone to medical school which is no longer plausible do to health issues. I'm 1.5 semesters into college and have take $21,000 out in student loans. Due to the aforementioned health issues it is also much harder to do anything such as research on top of full time student status and I have been unable to do internships since every break so far I have had to schedule a surgery. I've gone from feeling very confident in what I wanted in life to pretty lost over the last year (I took medical leave for 1 years to receive some infusions and surgeries) and I don't even know if engineering is for me at this point. However, if I don't return in 2 weeks I lose all scholarships and will absolutely have to choose a different major in order to transfer home and continue at a state school.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I screwed? Should I switch? 

&amp;#x200B;

If I absolutely should switch, what are good options to switch to that will accept some credits so I didn't waste $21,000 in student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Credits I have (From AP's or university credits)

* Calc 1 and 2 from AP
* Diff. Eq
* Physics Mechanics, Physics Electromag. from AP
* Java 1
* Math Methods BME (focused on Matlab)
* Chem 1 and 2
* BME Instrumentation
* EKG reading and application
* General Bio from AP
* Human biology and lab
* Circuit Analsysis 1
* Digital Systems
* AP Lit, AP micro
* All but 2 of my humanities credits completed

Side note question: Is graduating with $60,000 in student loans with a BME degree manageable or too much?"
ab1zwy,2,2018-12-30,Undergraduate Research Questions!!,djman90,UndergraduateResearch,https://www.reddit.com/r/UndergraduateResearch/comments/ab1zwy/undergraduate_research_questions/,"A little about me. I am an electrical engineering student at Purdue. I plan on completing my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering with my electives gear more toward computer engineering. I really enjoy research and solving problems (especially daunting one) and am a very analytical thinker. I figured research would be an excellent field for me to work in. I recently started working with the campus branch of IEEE and got involved with their autonomous vehicle build team. I am working with ROS, and other members of the team are doing in-depth research into building neural networks for the self-driving vehicles. My experiences are very broad. I have worked as an electrician, started my own web design company (now dissolved), worked as an engineer in an industrial setting designing system automation, and I currently am working as a software engineering intern working with android studio, java, python and shell scripting, and version control software (is a given). My interests in AI, autonomous vehicles, and smart grid technologies have been consistent and would love to contribute and learn in these fields. Below are some questions that I have for anyone with any experience or advice for undergraduate research positions.   


Oh btw, my GPA is 3.96. So I don't think academic performance will be an issue.

I am currently applying for multiple internships at ORNL, here are my questions:

* What do institutions expect from candidates applying for an undergraduate research position?
* Do summer internships turn into full-time positions if I perform well?
* Do they expect you to pursue a graduate degree while working?
* Do they admire people with the intention to pursue a graduate's degree?
* What do they look for in a cover letter, resume, and candidates?"

The only jobs I've ever done were mostly in the food service industry and I've been doing this all throughout my college career.

The position above states that the position is located at the Information Technology Services division. Would this position be a good fit for someone wishing to get their feet into the IT job market? Would they even hire, let alone reach out for an interview to a new grad with no experience?

I'm an incoming college freshman in fall 2019 planning to major in economics in a possibly non-target state school. I'm interested in possibly going towards Wall Street or anywhere in between for a future career and I realize how expansive the jobs are with an economics major and having the right skills such as programming or certain math courses can help me find a job. I also realize the power of networking that can be had on for a future career and how crucial it really is. I realize it's going to take more hustling because I won't be attending an Ivy League. I also realize that there are many other industries that need jobs from economics majors.

Does anyone have any suggestions towards what I should possibly do during the next few months? I'm interested in seeking an internship or something related that could help differentiate me amongst others on my resume and possibly find a direction for where I want to go into for possible careers. I'm open to suggestions or such and I realize that there are many different paths I could go down so I would appreciate any advice. I'm trying to find some direction. Thank you! "

I have been doing my best and enjoying the work along with participating in a sport. So far my GPA is a 3.42 and I am doing my best to hit a 3.5 as my interest is in the oil and gas industry and that seems to be the minimum they take. I applied to 30 internships in my universities area, Texas as well as back home and have heard back from two with the answer being no. I’m wondering what the course of action should be for this summer, ideally it would be an internship and I am using all my connections but it’s not looking great. I was wondering if trying to do research with a professor that is similar to the oil and gas industry would be the next route or continue to pursue other internship opportunities?

ab3erv,3,2018-12-30,Type my debate team,CuteManufacturer2,mbti,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/ab3erv/type_my_debate_team/,"My debate team has so much drama, and I'm genuinely wondering the types of the different guys on the team. 

**The Overachiever**

- He's the 1st member of what everybody jokingly calls the 'Indian Fuckboy Triumvirate', which is basically what it sounds like- popular Indian guys in debate who lots of girls like. Thinking in terms of freudian trios (Id being emotional, Ego being balanced, and Superego being coldly logical), he's definitely the Id: ambitious, overly assertive, prone to emotional outbursts (a lot of times he cries when he loses a debate round), narcissistic, and as some people have described him, 'bitchy'. 

- In middle school he had a reputation for being lazy. Lazy not as in doesn't do homework and gets bad grades, but lazy as in underachieving for his potential. He got good grades, was known as pretty ambitious, and was in drama, but mostly spent his time worrying about popularity. He moved to our state in the middle of 6th grade and made a whole masterplan to become popular, and it mostly succeeded.

- Once high school started he mostly ditched his popular guy friends. They have beef with him now because he never hangs out with them and spends all his time with the debate kids. All the popular girls still love him, and he has actual *fangirls* 

- In his own words, his only focus right now is getting into college, and he's acted accordingly. He's joined so many clubs (debate, youth in government, mock trial). At first he was known as the famous freshman because he won so many tournaments and all that.

- His personality is very assertive, very 'fill up a conversation and talk over other people'

**The 'Athlete'**

- Second member of the Indian Fuckboy Triumvirate. He's the ego- personable, unambitious, chill (he's only in debate because his parents want him to and doesn't give a fuck about it). 

- Was also popular in middle school, but in a different way. He dated a lot, vaped, was known as the Indian kid who acted white, you get the idea 

- He's a national-level cricket player, which people seem impressed by even though America doesn't really play cricket. He's pretty skinny and not very athletic but does like sports

- In high school he's pretty much the same as in middle school

- Has a reputation of being douchey but secretly actually pretty nice if he likes you 

**The Over-Overachiever**

- 3rd member of the Indian Fuckboy Triumvirate, and the last to join. He's definitely the Superego- in many ways he's the opposite of the 1st guy. While the 1st guy is 'I'm the best at everything and want to win everything and you better stay out of my way, bitch', this guy is 'who the fuck knows what he wants?' 1st guy is assertive, this guy is elusive and slippery, if that makes any sense. He also has a habit of analyzing and dissecting people. For example, he says the 1st guy is just a 'spoiled little bitch who wants attention' and points out his temper tantrums when he loses. By contrast, when this guy loses his debates, he calmly dissects what went wrong and makes sure it doesn't happen again. 

- In middle school he was basically a troll. Like, he would literally say shit like 'Hitler did nothing wrong' or 'Communism is the best form of government possible, change my mind' just to piss people off. He was decently well-liked at first because of his humor and confidence, but he revealed another side: arrogant and intellectually superior. He lost any social status he had because he constantly pissed off the 1st guy in political debates he had, by being kind of an asshole, and committing a bunch of social gaffes (for example he was invited to an end-of-year party a popular girl was throwing, he invited his unpopular friend nobody liked and got disinvited)

- He was the last of the three to 'rise' in high school, so to speak. The other 2 basically dived in headfirst- guy 1 became the famous freshman and won a bunch of debate tournaments, the 2nd guy became generally popular. By contrast, he was unknown for most of freshman year since he was experimenting: he was in a school play, joined some volunteer clubs, tried out for basketball and soccer, you get the idea

- He became famous at our school almost overnight. He seemingly learned social skills out of nowhere, joined debate, won two tournaments seemingly easily, and basically conned the 1st guy into liking him again. 

- He says he doesn't really like the other 2, but he just hangs out with them for status

- He continued to rise even further over time: he got an internship with a UChicago econ professor, became a national-level fencer and got really jacked, and even started his own business

ab3ixv,5,2018-12-30,"I could use some help forming a plan on how to get out of this hole I have found myself in. Credit Cards, Student Loans, and now a debt in Collections. Cue breakdown.",poormoneymanagement,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ab3ixv/i_could_use_some_help_forming_a_plan_on_how_to/,"Using a throwaway as this is so embarrassing.  I thought I could crawl out of this hole alone but alas. 
     
     
     
Long story short, my parents weren't great models for responsible spending.  I left their home at 16, and have made it on my own every since.  The day I turned 18 I applied for a credit card in my name and here we are 10 years later and I need help. 
     
     
     
Some background: I am a full time student working on my masters (in counseling so no big bucks there) and I work full time at the university and I am a parent. 
     
     

     
**Current Salary**: $33,000.  After taxes, mandatory 401k 6%, and a loan payment withdrawn ($97 per paycheck), I make $1780 per month. I have $0 in savings, and $13 in my bank account right now. 
     
     
     
**Student Loans**    
I am currently a masters student.  As of right now I have $70,000 in student loans, projecting to graduate in December 2019 with about $90,000. Averaging 6% interest.  I have my undergraduate loans in repayment working on Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Those loans make up $15,000 of the current $70. The payment is income based and I currently pay $18 per month. I have made 20 of the 120 payments thus far.  * Important to note: my masters program requires a 40 hour internship in our last semester.  All internships are unpaid.  I will have to leave my full-time salaried job in August and be unpaid until after graduation. It's fucking stupid and I am scared of losing this income.
     
     
     
     

**Credit Cards** (balance/max balance/minimum payment) APRs on these cards are 18-26%. 


* Chase: $4,873 / $5,000 / $185

* Capital One: $7,504 / $8,000 / $200

* Wells Fargo: $2,762 / $5,500 / $100

* Citi: $566 / $2,000 / $28

* Lowe's: $0 / $6,900

* Kohl's: $0 / $1,500

* Discover: $0 / $2,000  

(this Discover one is new. I applied for this one last month because it had a 0% APR offer for balance transfers) 

     
     

**Car Payment**

I have $4,140 left to pay off my car. I pay $350 per month. 
     

     

**Personal loan** from a previous consolidation loan that was awesome until I got married and had to have a dream honeymoon. Ug
* $1,698 remaining on this.  This is the balance mentioned previously that comes out of my paycheck every month.  I pay $194 monthly on this. 
     

     
     
**Other monthlies**: (this is my half of the cost)

* Rent: $450

* Internet: $25

* Car insurance: $115

* Utility bill: Ranges from $150 - $300 depending on the month.  Last January the bill was $850 for that month ALONE.  The A/C unit in the home I rent was not working properly.  That was a very cold and expensive month. 





My husband makes $35k yearly and pays his half of monthly bills listed here, and our cell phone bill ($100 per month) and child support at $500 per month. He has paid off his car, but received a DUI a few years back and pays almost $300 a month for car insurance. He also pays for our Hulu subscription.  This is our only recurring payment ""nicety""
     

     

     

*I am freaking out today as I received a letter in the mail from a collection agency.*  Last year I had to have a surprise surgery and left with a $3,500 medical bill.  The hospital did not have a way to set up automatic payments, and I forgot to pay since August.  They sold my debt to the agency.  To this date, I have only one missed payment, when I paid off my Lowe's credit card at an awkward time and was charged interest for the month after I paid the bill. It was something like $20 that I didn't know was still on the card and therefore didn't pay for a few months until I noticed it hit my credit score. 

     

     
So, I will receive around $8,000 in student loans in the Spring.  I planned to use these loans to pay off the Chase card ($4,800) and some on the Capital One card (probably $3,000) as they are the two cards with the highest interest and then transfer the remaining balances to:


* Discover (0% APR for transfers.. probably transfer $1800)

* Citi (10% APR.. will transfer $1500)

* and Wells Fargo (4.9% .. transferring $2,000)

     

     
But now with this medical debt in collections... I am not sure what to do.  My husband says to ignore it for a while and let it roll in to collections, pay off what we can of the credit card debt and then start to try and inch our way out with the collections agency. 
     
     
     
If our utility bill is on the lower side, I pay about $1,600 in bills every month, and bring home $1,780.  The other $180 goes to gas and food. I try to throw any extra dollars I have towards the cards at the end of the month if I have any.  My husband buys most of the other groceries and toiletries.  We hardly ever go out for dinner for dinner or movies.  Once a month or so we try to do something fun with the kids.  We have them every other weekend and 2 nights during the  week. 
     

     
Basically, should I ignore the medical debt collectors and continue with my previous plan? 

     
     

We are unable to sell his car and only have one car. We work in opposite directions and have inflexible hours. That was my first thought.  I watch this sub quite a bit and I really thought I had a handle on things until I realized I didn't.

ab4o15,1,2018-12-31,I’m (23M) having doubts about moving far away from my family to be with my long distance girlfriend (23F),TheAbLord,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ab4o15/im_23m_having_doubts_about_moving_far_away_from/,"Let me preface this by saying I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a bit over a year. We met in person and have spent the last year mostly apart, though we have been able to make it work by visiting each other every couple months and lots of FaceTiming. I also found an internship near her which allowed us to spend much of the summer together, a few months, which only further convinced me she’s the right kind of person for me and that I wanted to continue our relationship. I eventually was able to find a full time job near her and plan to move out in a few months. 

The problem? She lives over 3 hours FLIGHT TIME away from where I grew up and my family still lives. This includes my parents and grandparents. Lately I’ve been filled with immeasurable guilt for making the decision to move away from them. 

I know I’ve got to live my own life first but honestly I know I’m gonna be crushed as I see my parents enter old age without being near them to spend this time with them. They won’t be here forever and I didn’t have a close relationship with them my whole life until maybe a year ago. On top of this, my grandparents (who Ive been pretty close to) are old and showing signs of severe decline, like lots of worrying hospital visits and the like. 

One of my worst fears, something I think of constantly, every day now, is how am I going to face myself for moving away from these people who I’ve loved and loved me my whole life, in their last months? I know the regret of not spending that time near them might destroy me one day. Yet here I am setting myself up for it.

On the other hand, not to get gushy, but I’ve dated lots of people and my significant other complements me perfectly in every way. It would also destroy me to have to end things with her over this, especially since we’ve worked so hard to maintain things despite the distance and are so hopeful for the future. Honestly I don’t know how I managed to work myself into this dilemma but I feel like I’m grateful and cursed at the same time. Time is running out to decide and I just don’t know what to do. Sincerely thank you if you’ve read this far.

tl;dr: Im feeling intense guilt over leaving behind my aging parents and declining grandparents to move near my S.O. on the other side of the country and don’t know if it’s the right decision."

I think this was the worst year for me, but I've actually survived it all the way. I can't tell you how much I've been hurt, disappointed, broken , how much I've cried, how desperate I was, all of the negative emotions I've felt them. If anything, I'm amazed and proud of myself how I survived this, it's been an absolute hell for me. I know from the bottom of my heart that 2019 will be the best year of my life. Let me tell why I think that. I got accepted into internship, my dream job, you might have seen the post, it was pretty overwhelming. That means that I will finally be very busy and porn will not even be an issue. I have a good streak right now, but I had a better one this year- 5 months and I had to break it to fix my dick, I had phimosis (tight foreskin) and I had to stretch with porn, unfortunately, but I finally did it. I've learned so much about nofap for the past 2 years and a half and I managed to get a 5 month streak, without being busy and staying all day in my room, so I KNOW i will be perfectly fine. I had problems with my spine earlier this year, I fixed it and I've been getting back in shape. I also have weight to gain back, because I lost so much due to stress and problems. I cut the most closest person of my life and that was the reason I've been feeling so bad all of this year, it fucking breaks my heart and hurts like hell, but I had to do, for my health and for my future. Now I will have to recover from that, but it's only going to get better. I will tell you exactly what kind of person I will be in 2019 - motivated, extremely productive, healthy , RICHER BABY, confident, stronger and most importantly happy. I want to bury that version of myself in 2018 that was created in order for me to survive everything. Today, on the 31st of December I will not drink. I want to enter the year sober, feeling good and start the year the right way. If there is god, he knows how much I struggle with everything right now and how hard it is for me, but I will deal with everything. I just know it, for the first time in my life, that next year will be the best year of my life. I hope you all have the best year of your lives. I will you happiness and porn free life. I love you all!"

I'm 16, I used to be incredibly into gaming, 4th grade-8th grade everyday 100% of my free time went to gaming. From Minecraft to call of duty sniping (omg) to fallout to random PC games like dying light, yknow, cool fun awesome games of like 2014-2016. Well, recently my life has been very busy, yes I'm 16 but I have an IT internship, high school, my hobby/passion (MAKING video games) and then friends etc..

The free time I do have I go to look for a game to play and it's always super exciting, starting up the first level or first ten minutes of a game that I already own that I used to LOVE but then it completely turns stale and I start to feel as if it's a chore to keep playing and I eventually turn it off. I do struggle with a very driven personality (not sure what to call it, I just need to feel productive and do a lot, whatever that is, I also don't believe in capitalism/preservationism so idk what being productive even is..) it makes me feel very empty during entertainment. Movies have been quite cool lately though. Idk anyway:

I want to feel immersed in a game again, I miss the feeling of excitement ALL day waiting to get home to play a game. I want to be able to start a game and finish it and be like ""holy shît that was 7 hours"".. I've been there before and I want it back guys! 

Anyone been through this? Geez I feel like gaming is my girlfriend and we're going through a rough patch. Any game suggestions that helped get you outta this? I play PC and have an Xbox 360.

Thank you all."

ab5i91,2,2018-12-31,Bermudian Triangle,swaineous,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ab5i91/bermudian_triangle/,"I'm 22, guess I shouldn't be this heartbroken over someone because I'm young but this situation has really taken me for a spin. I'm gay and dating is hard in general but being gay and trying to date 10times harder, but that's my opinion. I don't go to clubs, I barely go out to dinner I have a select few of friends all of them cist-gendered persons and apps are not really what they are couped up to be. I am no longer sure of myself or the decisions I make, where I used to pride myself on knowing who I am, and exactly what I want, and the people I trust, I am now lost. 

My fella (28) of 3 months recently broke up with me. Yes three months sounds like nothing but understand I haven't had the best luck with dating I get into many situation where I am used for my body basically, that's apps for ya. I affectionately referred to my fella as my Bermudian Triangle, because when I was with him I'd get lost, a good lost nevertheless, if that makes sense, but now I'm lost in a bad way.  

We met on tinder he's from Bermuda, and was attending school stateside. I did not expect to develop such a deep affection for him but I did. I'm very much dominated by the left side of my brain, before him I maintained a significant disconnect from my feelings and emotions, ultimately, I believe them to be a distraction and my beliefs are being reassured right now. The 3 months we spent together were the best three months of my young adult life, the most time we were a part within the 3 months was 3 days for Thanksgiving. During that time, that disconnect I maintained overwhelmingly diminished and I continued to develop deeper and deeper feelings for him which he seemed to be accepting and reciprocating. At one point I wanted to grow old with him he was the one or so I thought.

Probably prematurely we began fantasing about our lives together, how many kids we wanted, the boy/girl ratio, the names, where we wanted to live, the whole 9. He was a senior in College and myself a grad student getting ready to entering my final semester of grad school, evidently he was going to graduate and had lined up an internship back home in Bermuda. He planned on working the internship, after which employment was likely and he wanted to get transferred back to the States so that we could be together, (his words), he even had plans on taking me back to Bermuda with him for a vacay after my graduation. 

We devised a plan to navigate through our 6 month separation everything seemed great, that is until I found out his ex of 6 years was coming to his graduation which I was not invited to, guess I should have taken the hint there, and subsequently his ex would be going with him and his family to another state to celebrate for a week. He gave a convincing story that the only reason he was here for school in the first place was because of his ex and he felt obligated to invite him. I asked him a week before he left while we were at his place if he still had feelings for him and looked me eyes and told me no and even gave his reason for leaving him. 

I trusted him, two days before his graduation was the last day we could spend together because his family and ex we're coming in, apparently his ex is a bit of a drama queen and would try to fight me. Our last day together felt strange I was the only one down about this being our last day together for 6 month he showed nothing, I eventually chalked that up as his happy go lucky islander attitude little did I know that that day would be our last day together forever. He's an excellent communicator via text, infact he would tell me I needed to do a better job of communicating, in which I promised I would, as I expected his communciation efforts decreased because he's with his family, he left that Saturday for his celebration destination still in the states, from there everything I thought was solid, liquefied and evaporated. 

He ignored me the entire week he was still stateside and what I assume to be his last day in the states sent me a text breaking things off with me, stating that he had too much ""baggage, and ""long distance did not seem attractive,"" and that he was being ""realistic"" Realistic would have been not making false promises I'm an adult could have been realistic from the start. Now I am not much of a crier tbh I hadn't consciously cried since 2008 but that text really hurt, knowing that all my efforts went to waste really hurt. I cried for 2 whole days and every now and then when I'm listening to music and I hear a song play that he introduced me too. 

I learned at a young age that people will enter and exit your life I learned not to develop attachments but I  couldn't help it with this guy. I can't help but wonder what really happened, was I not good enough for him, I just know he went back to his ex, the whole time we were together his ex called, text, even had his kid from another relationship calling remincising about old times and adventures they had. 

Now I'm left feeling like a literal joke, it's like I have a tattoo on my forehead in all caps saying ""PLAY ME"" because that's just what he did I opened up to this guy more than anyone I have ever called myself being in a relationship with. I'm not really sure why I wrote this or what I'm looking for maybe just someone to tell me I'll be alright, maybe I'm hoping he reads this sometime in the distance future and knows how much pain he caused me, all I know is that I am hurtin bad right now. I stayed out of my apartment for 2 weeks because we spent so much time there. Before he left he gave me a crap ton of his stuff, I threw it all away. Before him if the person and I weren't on the same page we were done either they'd stop talking to me or vice versa and I'd feel nothing. I just want to be that way with him but I can't. "

Also have a degree in IT from a top university. Nonetheless, I want a change of scenery,  but not sure how to go about doing so.

I would like to stay in sales, but considering this is my first real big-boy job (straight out of college) I’m not sure how to go about this process. I’ve tried the various job posting websites, along with going to 10-15 company’s websites to apply via their job application portals. I’ve even tried reaching out to a few people on LinkedIn (have an excellent resume and LinkedIn profile), but no luck.

Just curious how anyone has done something like this in the past. I’m making around 95k plus quarterly bonuses, so around 135-150k, and I understand there’s a solid chance I’ll end up having to take a pay cut to move elsewhere,  but I’m definitely willing to do that. Would just prefer to work for another Fortune 500 company, and maybe even switch from a technical sales job role to more of a client rep job role.

I’ve also put a lot of thought into studying for the GMAT so I could potentially get a MBA to enhance the chances of landing a manager type role, too. Just not sure if that’s worth it, considering my education and work experience.

Thus, any advice would be truly helpful!

TL;DR:
Solid work experience as tech sales at top globally recognized Fortune 500 company wanting to change companies. Not sure how to go about doing so.

THEN, I look at the stats for the plates.  Across the board, Ozma's plate feels like last years model.  Lower stat totals, (though better support points), and while the active and live skills are relaxed judgement (compared to HP and score up), the center skill really seals it.

With the Ozma's Center skill, you max out at 20% Total Up- a very solid skill, especially if any of the S-Ranked Total ups have eluded you, (at 5\* maxed, it's 25% for those plates (6\* maxed is 30%))...  The Diva VF-25, however, is 20% Total Up... AND Life (HP) Up.  Just factually better.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are kind of new, this is your chance to get a solid Total-Up 6\* plate, with a bonus of significantly extra HP so you can survive missions that are giving you problems as you get better.  Hopefully, you weren't looking forward to adding Ozma to your squadron though...

Further, I don’t think I have much in the way of my network or maybe I just haven’t looked into leveraging it enough. So I feel like merit is going to be even more important for me in these applications which I feel like I could really be lacking in, in comparison to other applicants. 

What I’m wondering is should I bother applying to entry level positions or should I be looking at internships instead? Bit dejecting to be looking at internships when everyone I know is getting full time jobs but that could be a naive and short term outlook. Maybe I haven’t provided enough context for people to really interpret my situation, but I guess any recruiting advice here is appreciated.

Additionally, I’m taking introductory finance, a second accounting course, a fintech class, and interest theory to try and build up my business side because I could be slightly behind in that compared to business majors.

We've reached the goal! I never imagined it would come even close to it! Thank you thank you so much everyone! I am truly amazed at how wonderful this community is. I'm going to do something extra back for the community at some point. Thank you everyone for the support!**

I'm Guilli, the dev behind Guilli's Planet Modifiers Mod and Guilli's Ship Components. As some of you already know, my computer died hard last week and as a result I’m unable to continue modding or play games for the foreseeable future.  Quite a few of you have managed to convince me to start a gofundme so I can get back on my feet with my modding hobby (and general life).  So I have done so. It has always been really hard for me to ask for help, and I love figuring things out on my own. But sometimes life gives you really sour lemons and you can’t do it alone.    
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
As it stands, with my part-time internship I am just not in a position to save any real money. So buying a new basic pc is pretty much half a year away. I want to keep creating things for you, and stellaris. It brings me the greatest joy to be able to see everyone enjoy my mods (and the occasional bug haha). So I will definitely keep doing that. If not soon, then in half a year. Stellaris is here to stay and so am I. I just hope with your help I can continue doing what I love a little sooner!  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
There’s a lot more said on the gofundme page, and a bit is more personal, but I feel I at least owe you as much for asking this.  
I want to thank everyone for the support so far with my mods. The amount of love and positive feedback I have gotten has made the past two years some of the best of my life so far. I also want to thank the mods for allowing me to post this. And please, don’t feel pressure to give anything if you don’t want to. Its fine if you can’t or don’t want to!

ab91hv,236,2018-12-31,"Guy wanted to buy a toy, and came to me despite saying I wasn't a seller.",userbyreddit,IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/ab91hv/guy_wanted_to_buy_a_toy_and_came_to_me_despite/,"I got my first full-time internship this year as an IT guy at a financial institution, which also owns one of those stores that sell electronics, furniture and toys.

While I have nothing to do with the store, I sometimes go there because a computer needs some fixing or the department needs something.

As both places shares the same uniform (black pants, white dress shirt and tie), we can be easily confused. And it happened more than once, but luckly there were more nice people than assholes.

There are two rules for me: no distraction and be fast. So ignoring people wasn't uncommon for me. 

(You can skip this paragraph) 
The thing is, as a young teen I did the mistake of using my fullname as a Reddit username, so I usually avoided writing. Just reading and voting. After lurking this subreddit for so long, and wanting to both submit some stories and comment, I decided to make a new account for my phone. Just in case, English is not my firsy language)

So this was close to Kids Day, so parents were buying toys. I was sent there as two computers stopped working so then needed a quick fix (one is so old it still has Windows 98).

Shorty after starting on the PC first an old lady came and nicely asked for a price of a toy. I told her that I was fixing the computer and I will call someone to attend her.

Shortly after, an angry man came to me (AM for short)

AM: I'm tired of waiting, and you are doing nothing. What kind of store does that to customers?

ME: I'm sorry but I'm fixing this computer. You can...

AM: I don't care idiot. I am here now so tell me how much is this.

It was an expensive Star Wars toy.

Me: I don't work here. I... 

AM: Do you think I'm dumb? You told me you were fixing that PC

Me: Yes. I don't sell stuff.

Am: Then why are you there? You work here so tell me anyways

Me: I don't. *sign* I work for (company that owns the store). I fix the computers and then I leave. You can ask for a employee there. Good day.

I started to work on the computer while ignoring the guy. He didn't like that and left.

I finished the first computer (it took me 15 minutes to delete a lot of crap software as the employee used it to download YouTube videos).
An huge line was formed, so I went to the back to notify one was done and I was going to work on the other one.

Five minutes later the guy came back and his face was red. He saw me and starting walking my way.

AM: Do you still have it? It was sold out in the others stores

Me: I'm fixing this computer, there is the line.

AM: Can you be less disrespectful and tell me already?

Me: I don't know. I don't sell stuff.

AM: But I left it on your desk

Me: An employee desk. Ask the guy working there.

AM: Fine

I finished the computer, notified the staff and went to the exit.

The guy was on the door talking with someone on the phone, so i decided to look to the other side. To my surprise he wanted to make me fall and I accidentally step on him.

I continued walking trying to not laugh.

I found out the next day it was sold, as an employee thought there were sold out and decided to keep it. Nice. 

TL;DR: Went to fix two pc, a guy came to buy a toy but ignored him after telling I'm not a seller. He left the last one in a desk and came back since it was sold out at other stores. An employee bought it and he tried to make me fall when I left, but I stepped on his foot instead. "

Thanks for the read in advance, this is gonna be a long one so be wary. I have recently been reflecting on my actions a lot and hold myself accountable for things I have done in the past that could be improved in the future so I can be a better person. I am doing this in my professional and academic life already so I thought why not do it for my dating life as well, I just need a little a little help because I am having trouble figuring out what I need to do to improve.

Background of me: I'm 22m, I am finishing up my last year in engineering, have had a job in my field for 3 years while in school. Heavily involved in research, fairly personable have no issues making friends, love playing the guitar, playing video games and working out.

The first girl I have a history with, I met her back in highschool [she's 22 now I think?]. We dated back in highschool for a year but I broke up with her the summer before going to college because of a string of health related issues I had, id rather had not been in a relationship at that time and plus she was going to a different college. Well we had kept in contact here and there, and she transferred to my college 2 years later [2015] . We hung out and hooked up a few times and she would tell me how much she likes me and all that and by this point I had fallen for her too.

 Suddenly she kind of takes a step back, tells me she was having some family issues, I told her she could talk to me about it but she resisted, so I never asked about it and gave her some space for like 2 weeks(her request). She then stopped talking/texting me all of a suddenly but still was fine with all the rest of her friends. Not gonna lie but I got clingy, I would text her asking what's going on, ask her if she wanted to hangout still etc etc, I stopped getting responses from her. 
Even at school she would blatantly avoid me, if she saw me she would walk the other way or pretend I wasn't there. Her friend texted me saying she was going through some stuff and ""needed space"", I didn't contact her for a month or 2, one night I was drunk with friends and texted the friend a cringy monologue of shitty this girl was treating me, the next morning I woke up and saw she texted me back saying to not text her again and that this girl just needed some space.

 After a few weeks of this, I approached her in person and straight up asked her if whatever was between us was done, she said yeah and pretended it was obvious, so I said alright, wished her best of luck and then cut contact with her( deleted her off of everything). About a week later I see her with another dude and learn from mutual friends that she's dating this other dude, this absolutely sucked, it was a small campus so I'd see them together sometimes, or sometimes I would see her by herself it sucked, but I never approached her or tried to contact her, I just did my own thing. Like 6 months later a mutual friend of ours comes to me and tells me that apparently this girl thinks I'm stalking her, I tell him that I am working 30 hours, doing research and going to school, I don't have time to stalk her. He says he knows that but apparently this girl told her boss(she works for the school) that I am some guy that won't take no for an answer and she's afraid that I am stalking her. This freaked me out a little, I hadn't talked to her in over 6 months! The campus is tiny so I'd see her here and there but I'd never make eye contact or say anything. I spoke to a counselor about this and I was told to keep doing what I was doing and not worry about her. So I did, I started seeing other girls having flings here and there and I never got shit from her again.


It had been over a year since I stopped talking to the girl mentioned above. I met a girl [20F] on tinder and went on a date with her and she seemed really cool. I wasn't interested in getting too serious and neither was she, she was also in a STEM major at a different University so we had great convos about science and whatnot because we were both into it. I was casually seeing this girl for about 7 months. We would barely see each other though, we would text like maybe once a day. Sometimes I wouldn't hear from her for a week or so. We would see each other maybe once every 2 weeks, she would also cancel on me a lot, saying she was really busy but would post on social media. But she was a nice girl, great conversation and seemed genuine when we would talk or hangout. 

 After about 6 months I felt like I was catching feelings for her (wtf is wrong with me). So this summer she was having an internship at a different state and I was supposed to go hang out with her for a weekend. While there I told her I though I am having feelings for her to which she kind of asked like ""what did I mean by having feelings?"". I was Confused so I elaborated telling her I think I am sexually and emotionally attracted to her. She then asked ""is it kind of like, I love you and I wanna be with you type thing? Because I don't think I'm ready for that"". I told her no that's not really it I just want to date you. Then she tells me ""I don't know if I ever wanna marry anyone, like I don't think someone should be tied down to one person"". This conversation was boggling my mind, I was so confused so I told her that let's make this simple, do you think about me often? Like do you have feelings for me? She said no, I said ok good that means our feelings aren't mutual. Then I told her that yeah maybe we should stop hooking up, kissing, going on dates and that sort of thing if we aren't really dating and she said ok. Then she said that she really likes me as a person and would like to stay friends, I told her that I never really saw her as just a friend so I think i would need a few months to get over her first and then we could try hanging out and being friends and she agreed. So then I stopped seeing her, we would occasionally Snapchat each other about random stuff, nothing serious but that was about it.

 After about 4 months she texted me saying that we should hangout if it's ok with me and I said yeah sure. The next week I made some time for her and we were going to hangout but the day before we were supposed to meet she tells me she has something to do after so we would only hangout for like an hour or 40 minutes and she needs to be back home. So I told her that's fine, I think we should skip to tomorrow and try to hangout at a different day when we both have time. She suggest the next weekend, so I say ok. Then the next week, the day before we were supposed to meet, she cancelled saying she had something to do so I said alright no worries, and didn't put much thought into it. About a month that or so later i was free one Friday night, so I texted her earlier that day to see if she wanted to grab a bite or something she said she was supposed to do something else that night and asked if I needed anything, I said no and stated that she was the one that said she wanted to hangout last time and I just happened to be free today. To which she replied "" yeah we need to hang out soon!"". To which I sarcastically replied something like Yeah but I'm the only one that actually wants to hangout and added some emojis. She didn't take this well and basically apologized for being busy and that we don't have to hangout. 

When I saw that message I told her she doesn't have to apologize for being busy do whatever she needs to do. Then I apologized for what I said because it kinda seemed like I was butthurt about the situation which wasn't true, I was just being sarcastic, and my text didn't really communicate sarcasm very well. She never responded to those messages and that was 2 months ago, I never reached out to her after that and never heard anything from her. 

So, these are my stories, I admit, with the first girl I was pretty clingy, I think I got too vulnerable with her. 2nd girl I guess just wasn't too interested and my dumbass just didn't get the hint fast enough. I am trying to find out what sort of behavior was wrong and what could've been done a little differently, I understand there is no optimal way to act but I am just trying to better myself and hope you guys can help me out a little bit. Any thoughts, advice or comment is appreciated. Thank you!

Tldr: Stories about my past 2 potential romantic encounters and I just want some feedback from the community about the situations and what I need to watch for in the future in order to be a better person."

I tell it to all my friends to the point where they want me to stop. Anyway to my story...
So I’ve landed an internship at Cold Spring Harbor Labs at the end of this last Winter. Dr. James Watson lives there. If you don’t know who he is, he  discovered the double helix model of DNA. At the summer party for the lab, he was there, and even though I’ve said hello and had a very brief conversation with him, he obviously wouldn’t remember me. I went up to him and quoted Spider-Man (2002).  To initiate a conversation I started with“You know, I’m something of a scientist myself” and then continued with my question to him. I know some may not believe and I have no real way of proving without posting a picture of myself with him but I don’t really want to do that, so I hope all will just trust me. Honestly, I feel that it’s too specific to even make up anyway. I know this isn’t a big deal, but it was one of my favorite moments of they year, and I’ve had a lot of good ones. Happy New Year, and remember,
“With great power comes great responsibility”."

Chronologically, I lost my very close grandfather. I would see my grandparents every day from kindergarten until I graduated high school as they would come every morning to take care of my siblings and me and get us ready for school. I’ve never loved anyone more and never will than my grandparents and it was a devastating blow, to say the least. I still think about him every day. The first day of my internship this summer I totaled my car and haven’t been able to afford or drive one since. I picked up a waiting job and worked 45-60 hour weeks just to earn 6k that would be gone with a click of a button to pay the exorbitant price of living in the dorms for my sophomore fall semester of college. My semester GPA dropped from a 3.85 to a 2.8 because of my lack of satisfaction or motivation to do well in my classes + the increasingly difficult classes the come with being a science major. To distract myself I went absolutely crazy in my marijuana usage that ended up getting me 2 felonies and 2 additional charges. So now the rest of my college funds are being used to pay for a lawyer just so my future isn’t fucked but I honestly feel so low right now that it seems that none of this hardly matters to me. My relationships with my parents are strained as ever and hasn’t gotten better with all the shit I’m burdening them with. Emotionally, I’ve been even more distraught then my bank account which is only in the  double digits. Ive got another 6k I need to find to pay this upcoming semester or I’m going to have to look into being in debt. I’ve contemplated ending the pain many times but the thought of the grief it would bring to my grandma, especially, has prevented me from doing so. However, I’m not convinced nor do I want to label all my problems as depression, but I will be seeing a counselor this upcoming semester. It’s so hard to be happy when I’m constantly seen as a criminal, burden, and fuck-up. I’m going into 2019 with the hopes of a new year, new me, but all this shit nagging on me from 2018 makes me weary of the idea. I’m sure many people reading this have had shittier years so hopefully this can be in some sense, a place of solace for your misfortunate 2018s as well. Thanks for taking time to read my venting, as this is just something I absolutely had to get off my chest but didn’t have anyone to say it to."

Last year's NYE, I was in a bad place with myself. I'd given up on keeping my friendships that I'd had since 9th grade, lost motivation to study at the university and was living with my parents (since university and the internship I was on didn't give me much money or time to work with). So, on NYE, my sister convinced me to go out with my friends to enjoy life for a bit. So, since she cares about me, I did. Even though I was actually just avoiding everyone I knew for that time. I figured it was okay since no one really minded, all my friends had plans with other people and I figured it was okay that no one knew. That night, I found that it worked out well, since my sister was happy with the white lie that I had gone to town and enjoyed myself, I saw a few friends about an hour after midnight just to say hi and even though the moment of midnight was a bit tough, I was happy that I could get through the night without worrying anyone.

This year, I'm doing the same thing. I'm back in my home town for a few days of vacation, and even though I know some friends of mine are going to be in town and indirectly invited me to call when I'm there, I'm probably just going to say hi after 2019 has arrived.

The thing is that on the big moment, it's enjoyed with people you're closest to. And I feel that everyone I know has just moved on from knowing me. And I don't even feel that bad about it tonight. This is just what happens when you distance yourself from people. And this evening, I'm okay with being alone, since I actually am just alone, not lonely.

If you read this far, thank you for listening! I just needed to share, even if it's just with the void of the internet."
abc74f,1,2018-12-31,Relationships suck,hebeach89,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/abc74f/relationships_suck/,"I have known this girl for years. We never really dated but we have had an on again off again friends with benefits thing for years. 

I asked her out in october(it's not the first time I have asked her out), she shot me down saying ""that would be a disaster"". I let it go, we met up a few times after that (always her initiating) to blow of steam. 

Two days ago she tells me she doesn't want to have contact anymore because it's pretty much all about the sex. I called her on that because I had made it clear I was open to exploring a romantic side to the relationship. We decided to go on a date, that date is next week. It is next week because I have made commitments to be a designated driver tonight and that I also have a couple of parties that I need to go to (one is at the invitation of someone in state government who's office I am trying to get an internship with). 

She is mad at me for not wanting to spend time with ""my girl""(her words) on New year's Eve. We haven't been on a single date yet and the idea was to explore a potential relationship there. I felt slightly manipulated due to the ""let's go on a date or never speak again"" way she handled the wanting a change in the relationship. Now I feel like she is being manipulative by trying to get me to cancel plans that I made weeks ago. 

I know that because we have been friends with benefits for a long time complicates the normal progression of starting to date but I feel like she is trying to be instantly in a serious committed relationship when that isn't what we talked about. 

I dislike how she is making me feel about not spending New year's with her, especially since I made it clear that I was unavailable today when we were making plans for our date. 
I don't want to take her to the party at the home of my potential employer because if that goes poorly it can hurt my chances.
Less than fourty eight hours into a potential relationship and she has already turned me off the idea of pursuing the relationship further. 

Honestly I don't know how to feel about how she is acting. 

Btw the friends with benefits arrangement has been like 1-2 times a year usually lasted a week or so and was mostly fighting. We did try dating when we first met but that fell apart when she almost got me fired because she got into a fight with my boss out of jealously."
abcgga,5,2018-12-31,Advice Needed: Younger Brother Anger Problems,lone_observer,autism,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/abcgga/advice_needed_younger_brother_anger_problems/,"Hi all. I have a brother who's 15 years old. He has high functioning autism, and generally he's the sweetest kid. He makes jokes, shows funny youtube videos, cooks, and just shows a ton of love. But it seems like twice or three times a week (and more often lately) something small happens that sets him off. We're really good with routine changes- I can't remember the last time that was the cause of a meltdown. It's more transitioned into us having to tell him (nicely) to stop doing something because he's making a mess, or that something's dangerous, or he's not respecting boundaries with jokes and such. It's really anything where he's told ""no."" Then it quickly escalates into him screaming and cursing at us, throwing and breaking things, and beating people up. He usually tells us ""this is your punishment.""  

We try to stay as calm as possible, since that only makes it worse. Talking to him doesn't work as he only gets more angry. Not talking to him is even worse, he get more violent (I think so we pay attention). These outbursts last for a few hours, and then once he's finally calmed down he apologizes a ton and is really down on himself.  We explain over and over gain that we love him so much, and that'll never change, but that he can't hit us or break things anymore. He says he understands, and that he loves us too. Then we say we're going to forget about it and just have a good day. And we do. But it always happens again, sometimes a few hour later, other times a few days later.

Mom and Dad are at the end of their rope. They've both cried a couple of times just this week. We're really starting to be afraid of him. Has it calmed down a bit from years past? A little. Dad's not constantly scratched up and bandaged anymore from trying to get him away from people. Back then it just seemed like instant blind rage. Now... it seems more intentional. He starts with arguing and then argues the whole way through, and any answer he doesn't like makes him angrier. We're trying to love him as much as possible, not get angry back, and just try to diffuse situations so we can talk to him better later, but it's really becoming dangerous. Unfortunately, he's already been to jail for a night because of it- and it was a huge battle to get him back, and three months of court battles before the judge finally said he's not mentally capable to stand trial. We don't want anything like that to happen ever again. 

I have to leave home for an internship this coming week, and I thought the best way I could help my family would be more information and ideas for resources. 

I really love him, he's so great to be around when he's not raging. He's frustrated with himself and we're scared for him.  And above all, he's NOT a bad kid. He has a play therapy person who helps him out, and the therapist is great, but the violence is still happening. Any advice is HUGELY appreciated. Thank you.

TL;DR My 15 year-old brother is High Functioning Autistic and has anger issues. We love him, but he often gets dangerously violent and we don't know how how else to help him."
abciet,2,2018-12-31,"I (31/F) haven't spoken to my sister (33/F) in 4+ years, and we will probably need to speak soon. Don't know how to approach this rocky situation.",ObviousExcitement,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/abciet/i_31f_havent_spoken_to_my_sister_33f_in_4_years/,"I'll try to be as concise as I can. Feel free to ask for any details.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister and I were raised together until I was 14 and she was 16. She was the ""problem child"" to my ""perfect angel."" I was the quiet bookworm who balked at the idea of trouble, and she was the opposite. At sixteen, after a fight with our step-father, she chose to go live with our father, and I took the opportunity to wash my hands of her.

She'd been physically abusive towards me since a young age (mostly holding her hands over my mouth and nose until I passed out ""because its funny"") and \*everyone\* in the family was sick of her judgemental, self-absorbed, negative attitude that she always seemed to have. I was so happy to have her gone.

When she graduated HS she was apparently told by my father, with whom she'd been living, she needed to ""get out."" I know my Dad, I know his terms. He just wanted her to not be a bum, he wanted her to either get a job and get on her feet, go to college, or something. It wasn't mean, it was a ""tough love"" statement to make sure we stayed productive and didn't become aimless.

She joined the military, and she hated it. However, she'd made a commitment and to her credit she stuck to it! She ended up abroad for all of her time, and she married a man in the military so even when she got out, he was career and so she's been abroad for \~10+ years. 

During this time, though, we were Facebook friends, and she continued to call my mother regularly. And any time she spoke to me it was giving me shit for living at home still. (I was going to university in our home town, there was no reason to pay rent when my parents were happy to have me there for free.) She would imply that I didn't deserve to go to school when she had to join the military, she'd say it ""must be nice to have Mom and Step-dad to pay for things for you"" (they didn't, I went to school on loans, I'm \*envious\* of the fact she ostensibly has no debt!) etc. etc. Just snotty things, day in and day out from her. Years on end, both to me and my mother, talking about how I was a bad person for living at home, they shouldn't let me do that, etc. etc.

I rolled my eyes and ignored it. She'd always been like this. If she was in a good place in life and I wasn't, she wanted to be in my life. If I was in a good place and she wasn't, she wailed and screamed. She's always seen a competition between the two of us. She stopped talking to my mother for months because our parents when to my Bachelor's graduation (in our home town, so on their way home from work) but didn't go to her Associate's graduation ceremony the same week \*in Guam.\* That kind of petty shit.

So here's the thing: One year ago her husband was stationed somewhere she couldn't join him, and she's now living with my mother and step-father (not paying anything) and going to school. She is in literally the exact place I was years ago. I think I technically deserve an apology, but as we're not talking, I really don't expect or care to get one. I think I'm owed one, but see no good coming of trying to collect it, you know?

The problem that's come up is that I'm nearing the end of my graduate education, which includes 4 months of unpaid internship that I \*must\* do next Fall. I can't work at the same time/make any money, so I'm trying to be placed somewhere near one of my parents' houses. I've secured permission from both households to stay if need be.

So there's a chance she and I will both be living at home again. And even if \*that\* isn't what happens, now that she's ""local"" I imagine we'll be visiting parents at the same time in the somewhat near future.

Like I said, I don't intend to demand an apology for how she treated me, and I don't expect her to acknowledge how shitty she's been. But I can't pretend like it never happened. Purely on the principle of the matter, I won't just let someone treat me like that and pretend they didn't. But, of course, I can't just give her the cold shoulder for weeks/months.

 I don't want to be close sisters, I'm not looking to repair our relationship. I'm just trying to make sure that when we do meet again I can keep things from being awkward for the rest of the household.

\*\*TL;DR\*\*: Sister has been a shitty person and hypocrite to me specifically (or to others for reasons relating to her feelings about me) for most of our lives. I've been no contact for years. Odds are that no-contact will go away soon. How can I return to being cordial with her without sacrificing my self-respect and principles and letting her breeze past how shitty she's been?"

I'm a 21-year-old college student who'd be interning in NYC next summer and my office would be in Times Square. Till date, I have only been to NYC as a tourist, so yeah any guidance or help would be appreciated.

Now I have no idea where to start looking for places and what prices to expect since I come from a very low COL area in the midwest. Also, my boyfriend will be living with me over the summer who isn't an intern, so I can't live in the dorms, hence I've been looking at Airbnb's but I'm not sure if that's the best option. Together both of us can afford about $2500 monthly maximum. If anyone could give me any direction as to how to start looking for places, what places to look at and what to look at price-wise it'd be great. I am mostly looking for a pretty happening and fun place, close to good nightlife and easily connected to the subway network so my work commute won't be huge. Other than that, of course, a place in a safe part of town."
