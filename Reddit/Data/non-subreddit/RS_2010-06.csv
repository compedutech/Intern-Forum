Our band Wendy has its first show next Wednesday at the Blockley Pourhouse and our rhythm guitarist, [craigalms](http://www.reddit.com/user/craigalms), is in NY for a summer internship. Any chance one of you wonderful folk could fill in? The parts are simple; Craig isn't a very good guitar player.

Here's our website: http://www.wendyband.com
and the Blockley: http://www.theblockley.com/
and Laura's pug blog: http://pugnacious.tumblr.com/

You'll save some fellow redditors from canceling, and you might make some friends along the way! Heck, I'll even buy you a beer.

Please?

EDIT: Guys, awesome! This is the first time I've reached out to the reddit community for a favor like this, and am so very pleased at the responses. I feel a little weird having to thin the herd, but since there have been so many offers I think it's necessary.

I think the best way to handle things would be to send me a message with a video of you playing something in our style as suggested by plinko. Nothing huge, just to show your basic skills. I'll then show them to the band and send out my number to whoever they feel would be the best fit. Sound good?

Again, THANK YOU!

",bitterpilltoswallow,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cecnr/i_need_to_unload_a_bit_about_my_lonely_life_sorry/,"Dear Reddit, I just need to pour this out anonymously to someone.  I guess I am depressed (?), but I feel like I alternate wildly between being really angry (sometimes) and just defeated, deflated, and sad (often).  I can actually feel a profound heaviness in my chest.  I snap easily at people, but then I also cry at the drop of a hat over the silliest things that I see or hear.  And I do ridiculous stuff like listening to cry-inducing songs on repeat hoping I'll reach catharsis.  Sometimes I don't know how I hold it together.  I almost had a breakdown at a coffeeshop the other day when I must've looked so pitiful that the barista said ""You look sad...is everything okay?""   

I don't think I would ever commit suicide because I do believe that I can make things better for myself somehow (?!)....but I still entertain the idea as a ""fantasy.""  I like to think about how it would give people pause.  And I have to admit that I like thinking about how it would jar and hurt the few people in my life, even though I'm not really that close to anyone.  I thought over time that I would just become numb to the shittiness, but instead, I've become hyper-senstitive and unstable.  I almost feel kind of paranoid.  How fucked up is this:  I like to imagine the ways that I can hurt people's feelings...but then I feel so guilty and terrible and monstrous.  I don't believe I am a good person.

Here's some background on me.  I know it will be kind of long, but I think it will help me to write it out.  (Incidentally, one of the things I find frustrating--whether it's the thought of talking to a therapist or just making small talk in the hope of pursuing friends--is that it takes so long to get people ""caught up."")

I grew up in what was basically a white trash family.  It wasn't physically abusive, but there was an alcoholic stepfather in the picture, the presence of religion, lots of redneck fighting between family members, and their general disgust that I turned out to be gay (I came out as I was graduating from HS in the 90s).  I was always a black sheep for being nerdy and not conventionally masculine.  I lived for school and did well enough to attend a good college on a scholarship.  The future looked bright, but I was also very sheltered, with a really limited worldview.  I did very well in college--on paper--but never found a true passion.  I was just good at getting As in everything, and I focused on the competition rather than the actual learning.  I also struggled with having a different class background from my peers, feeling like I was always backward and culturally ""behind"" no matter what I did.  Anger and resentment occasionally bubbled up, but despite this, I enjoyed a close-knit group of friends in college--a little coterie of about 6 people.  It seemed like we did everything together.  I guess I had mistakenly thought that the rest of life would be like college:  that I'd always have a core group of friends, a default set of people who were like a family to me, considering that I no longer saw my own family.  I've lost that and worry I'll never find it again.

Ever since I graduated from college, going on ten years now, things have slowly crumbled apart.  I had a good job for about two years before quitting, but then I really dicked around, unsure how to proceed.  There was a new plan every couple of months, and it seemed like I never finished anything I started.  This went on for about 7 years.  I began a grad program and quit.  I'd start a job and then leave after six months.  I'd decide I didn't like the city I was in, and then I'd pick up and move.  I think that every time I did this, I was looking for a fresh start, hoping that it would somehow magically be like college and that I'd quickly find a group of friends.  I had a lot of random sex (always protected though I had a lot of different partners).  Sometimes I'd make one good friend for a period, and we'd spend time together constantly in a weird intense platonic friendship way.  But it always ended when someone moved, or there was a falling out, or the friend got a boyfriend.  I never became part of any group...to this day, I only have one friend in my city, and we only hang out together, alone, separate from his other friends who are big partiers.  I guess I was/am kind of like a serial monogamist but with friendships.  And this whole time, I never dated anyone longer than a couple of months.  After I have sex with a guy a couple of times, I find him uninteresting or just annoying.  And if I date someone and begin to care about him emotionally, I lose all sexual attraction to him.  I'm also feeling increasingly unattractive myself and am beginning to put on some weight, though I'm only at 5-10 185 right now when I used to be 5-10 165.  I don't look awful yet, but my friend told me I was ""letting myself go.""

What else...well...I was in terrible debt a few years back (from never keeping a steady job) and had to declare bankruptcy.  While that sucks, it did allow me to get a fresh start, and I am managing my money better.  I was able to start grad school with a smidge of renewed clarity and I think I have a direction for the future (though I've been slow to look for internships and part time work).  I also ended up in a good roommate situation.  So there are upsides to my current situation. 

But I've been in this city (a large one) for several years now, and it still sucks.   I feel so alone and helpless.  Meanwhile, I see all these other people who are happy and active, whether it's straight married couple walking their kids or gaggles of gay guys out for a night on the town.  I don't seem to enjoy the things that others enjoy....I don't like going to bars, and I don't like drinking.  I'm not sportive.  I can't stand theater or even movies.  It's summer, and I don't even like these stupid outdoor festivals that everyone is obsessed with.  I hate dinner parties and other pretentious shit that a lot of the gay guys I encounter are into.  (One of the sub-themes is that I really resent gay culture because of how superficial it feels.)  I sometimes feel like I am defined by what I dislike rather than what I like.

Meanwhile, all of my friends from college are living these absurdly charmed lives.  They're attorneys, consultants, professors, pharmacists, journalists, and so on.  And now they're mostly married and have popped out a kid or two.  They own condos and houses and seem so thrilled by it all.  They've made it look so easy and natural.  I am jealous on one hand, but I also don't want the same things they do...it seems like they've stopped being interesting people. 

A few more things: I'm tremendously impatient with people.  I judge quickly, even though I know I shouldn't.  I have a hard time finding other people who share my values.  I'm an atheist.  I also don't see the appeal of alcohol, and I never use drugs or smoke pot.  I'm not a ladder climber and don't really want to make a lot of money.  I just want to have a job that I enjoy that doesn't make the world any worse and that will pay me enough to live comfortably on (for me that would be $40-45k a year after I'm done with my master's).  

What really gives me the sinking feeling is when I see lonely old people lugging their stuff to the laundry mat or counting change for coffee at McDonald's.  I worry that I will be like that, with no one to care about except a cat or two.

Okay, well....there's obviously more, but I don't want to take up everyone's entire day...this was long enough as-is!  Thanks for letting me dump out all this shit.  I'll take any thoughts or suggestions.  [I suppose I could pursue counseling through my university, but one of the people who works in the counseling center is in my graduate program as a student.  And I can't afford anything private.]"

Female, rather average looking, white, theatre major going to school in Michigan at a private college.
I've been with my boyfriend for almost three years now, we got together in high school and he is the first person I've ever fell in love with. We've dealt with long distance, going first to different high schools and living a good 15-20 minute drive from each other (not too terrible) to going to different colleges 1.5 hours away. Well, he had to wait a year our freshman year to go to college because of surgery so here's a break down.

Year 1: End of High school (different schools), I went to college 2.5 hours away and he stayed home because of surgery
Year 2: Feshman to Sophomore years in college. We both were home for the summer. He went to school and I went back to school and we went down to a 75 minute drive from one another but he didn't have a car so a bus ride to see each other on weekends was 3 hours. It didn't have happen often
In the midst of Year 3: Sophomore year of college and I went to New Jersey for the summer for an amazing theatre internship while he is at home.

I think it's also important to point out that I don't have a car so he does 95% of the driving. He's also a chemical engineering major so it's very different than my theatre major.

So what is my question? I love him, I'm not even thinking of breaking up with him because, to me, it's not an option. He makes my life better, I am happy, and I couldn't ask for anything more. I love him. Yes it may be that first romance love or something but I'm genuinely happy. He's the best guy in the world.

My question is how do I keep this alive? I'm in New Jersey and he's in MIchigan. It's a 15 hour drive from me to him and I don't have a car here and he has a 9-5 job Mon-Fri. I do my best (and usually succeed) in talking to him at least once a day but I want to do something more to let him know that I'm missing him and love him and wish he was here.

Thanks reddit. =) I'm off to work and can't wait to get responses."
cg8dt,10,2010-06-17,I'm tired.,WARTYAWOH,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cg8dt/im_tired/,"I'm tired.


I've been fighting depression and anxiety since I was in middle school (30 now). 


I was in a 5 1/2 year relationship which imploded due to my depression and my inability to get my shit together. That was 1 1/2 years ago. I am still madly in love with my ex and have recurring nightmares about losing her (I've cut off all contact with her).


It took me 9 years to get my BFA in graphic design, a field that I never wanted to be in the first place. I was extremely good at it, to the point where I easily got internships at top design firms. I hated it, but was good at it. That is why I stuck with it.


$5,000 a month allowance from my wealthy parents for the majority of my adult life has fucked me over. I finally cut myself loose because the free money was killing my sense of self worth.


I've been financing my life for the past two years with credit card debt and odd jobs. However my debt is growing, $60,000 and counting. 


I struggle with my work ethic every fucking day. I can barely hold a job for longer than a month, because I'd become depressed, anxious and just drop out. 


My physical health is good. I regularly run and swim, and am rather cut.


I've gone to therapy, been on countless of medication, tried everything I could think of to get better. In a way I am better, but lately (over the past several months) I'm beginning to lose it again. 
 

I'm tired.


I'm fairly good looking and get laid now and then, but I've since become discontented with random and not so random sex. My ex set the bar so high, nothing else compares (and yes I've reminded myself of all bad things that transpired during the relationship, but she gives me an immense satisfaction that I am unable to find in another person).


I struggle with constant ennui (a form of depression), I've had numerous of hobbies and interests but they alway fall to the wayside.  It's extremely frustrating because I know that I'm more than capable of learning new skill and hobbies, but nothing holds my attention for long. So I've become a mediocre jack of all trades, master of none.


I have a respectable number of friends who love me (and vice versa), but sometimes it's a burden to hang out with them. 


I've come far in the past 2 years but I've hit a plateau, and feel like I'm spinning my wheels in a sandy incline. Slowly sliding backwards.


I'm slowly growing more cynical, bitter, and discontented with myself and life in general. I'm tired of fighting so hard all the damn time. 


I promised myself that I won't think about suicide (there were one serious attempt and countless of flirtations). Haven't seriously thought about it for two years, but lately they have been cropping up again.


I'm the kind of person who plays a perfect game and will reload a saved game if I make a mistake. I feel the same thing about my life. Due to a series of bad choices, I'm thirty years old with shitload of debt, no career, no passion and no idea where to head next. I feel like I've fucked up, and my options are restricted.


Life has stopped feeling like an adventure for a long time (since I was a teen, actually). Now I'm just fighting, going through the motions. For what? In a million years, none of this will matter. I'm an atheist and see the world as a largely deterministic place with discrete bits of information smashing into each other giving rise to different variables.


I'm tired of being constantly dispirited. I'm tired of not having something I can look forward to. I'm tired of fighting my mental illness.


Before you guys freak out and track down my IP to call the cops on me. I'm not in danger, nor really desire death.


I just need something... I don't know, something to convince me that all of this is worth it."

tl;dr: what are some arguments for and against adopting an older dog?"
cgvrk,4,2010-06-19,"How long is too long to hold out hope that things will get better?

We had dated in high school, but broke up after a few months. I called her up one day a few years later and we picked up the spark. I was in college and she was still back home, but we made the long distance thing work for several months before she came up and visited me. A few days before the first time seeing her since high school, she told me she had gained a lot of weight and had been cutting herself a year after we broke up. I was extremely pissed about the latter. Why she didn't tell me that I don't really understand, and felt I couldn't forgive. The weight wasn't really an issue as I had gained some since high school myself, but the fact that she had lied about being 100lbs overweight and not 15lbs was disappointing. I had gained about 30lbs since high school and for two months before she came up, worked 20lbs of it off.

When I first saw her, I felt happy, but not as happy as I thought I would feel. She had lied to me about the weight and the cutting, only telling me these things 2 days before the trip up. I loved her, but I was hurt by her dishonesty as I was very open about what had happened since we last saw each other. Still, she was the person I was in love with and I was glad to finally see her again. In our time together during that first visit, she made me very happy, and was wonderful to be around. When she had to leave I was sad because we didn't know how long we would be apart. A few months after the last time she came up to visit me, she told me she had been thinking about cutting herself again though. I was pretty shocked, I guess I thought she was happy, but being back at home made her the opposite. I reacted in a pretty bad way. I wanted to be out of the relationship for what I think are selfish reasons, but didn't want to own up to it and break it off. I worried what would happen if we broke up and if she would hurt herself again. I felt trapped. We started talking less, and I began talking to another girl more. I did something stupid, the other girl and I had phone sex, and then I broke it off because of how wrong it felt. I tried forgetting about it, and focused more on our relationship, but eventually told her out of guilt.

She was pretty devastated, and it took her a long time to forgive me. She started seeing a therapist to work through her issues with self-esteem and cutting and we eventually made it through that rough spot. Our relationship strengthened and we decided to give living together a try while I had my apartment to myself over the summer. I started encouraging her to work out with me and bought healthy groceries and we started living better. It kind of worked. Though I couldn't get her to commit to doing daily exercises with me, we each ended up losing 10 lbs and she was happier than she had ever been. She had to move back in the fall and I was going to do internships for a year. In the spring, I moved to a new city to do another internship, begging her to move in with me.

She agreed and moved up shortly after I started, and we've been together since. I've also moved back to school to finish my degree. Since she's been living with me, I haven't gone out with friends more than twice. My social life was pretty much on hold. This summer, she's been working long hours, leaving me with a lot of time by myself. I've started hanging out with old friends more when she's at work, and I realize how much I missed and needed to be involved with some group of friends. Every time I have suggested doing things with my friends though, it's been an argument to convince her to come, hence why we hadn't done it almost at all. I could list all of the problems I have with her and with the relationship in general, but I think all that really matters is that I'm starting to be unhappy being with her. Her self-esteem issues, I feel, are holding us back from living a full life. We don't go out anymore, I can't get her to stop buying bad foods or quit bad habits, and every time we try to change 'together' I always end up doing it by myself while she doesn't change at all. I feel like I've been delaying this because I've been holding out hope things would get better. Now I'm at a point where I just don't see that really happening. 

tldr: The major things I have a problem with are: lack of confidence and motivation, content with a very sedentary lifestyle, no plans for school or career, very different interests, and no willpower to change. We dated in high school, she has self-esteem issues, and she cut herself before we got back together. I cheated when I found out and felt trapped at the time. She's since been to therapy. Life together has been easy because we haven't done anything at all. We never go out with friends. We have sex maybe twice a week, and I still find her attractive, but not as much as I used to. I find confidence and intelligence attractive and she's been letting her brain rot not studying or doing anything. I worry though that that's just the way it is because we hear about these relationship problems all the time. Is it worth it to try to pull through? How long is too long to wait? I do love her, but the spark is almost gone. I don't get excited to see her anymore and that bothers me."

I recently met a girl through a friend because this girl and my friend are coming to my college next year.  When I first saw her I was very interested from the start.  She came up to visit with my friend at school, and I remember sitting down in the dining hall the first day she was on campus and I saw her RIGHT away. Weird coincidence but I thought that was interesting. We went to see the band State Radio that night and just hung out 
After her visit we started texting a bunch and I ended up having a dream about her where we on this balcony and she walked up next to me and was about to say something but then my dream changed.  I told her about this and said that I should take her out to dinner on a nice balcony sometime so she could tell me what she was gonna say to which she responded ""That sounds perfect! It's a date!""  
We kept talking and I didn't bring that up until like 2 weeks later when I went somewhere and found the perfect spot.  I told her ""I think I found the perfect balcony to take you"" and she says ""That text just made my day :)"" 
We had dinner last week with our mutual friend and she picked me up from the train station (I commute to and from NYC every day for an internship) and we talked the whole way to the place we were meeting for dinner. I found out from our friend that she basically volunteered to pick me up 
She's leaving for 2 weeks to go to Italy and I just sent her a message pretty much saying that even though we've only met twice, I feel like there's something there and that I wanted her to think about it while she was away.  I don't know if this was a wise move, but I know that she called our mutual friend about it because she wrote on her wall and it showed up in my feed on facebook haha.  
My main concern is that I don't know if I scared her off, and I hope I didn't, but at the same time I felt like I needed to say something because I don't wanna put myself in the friend zone and I hate waiting and not knowing.  But I'm usually right about these things.  
I told my last girlfriend how I felt about her within like the first week because idk I just have an instinct about this stuff. Exactly a month later we were dating.  
Normally I don't have trouble reading girls when it comes to stuff like this but I can't tell if she was just a really nice person and I just scared the shit out of her or if she hasn't answered me because she's thinking about it or doesn't want to. 

What does everyone think?

TL;DR Recently met a girl, had what seems like flirty interactions/somewhat romantic shit, but I can't really tell if she's just really nice or actually flirting/into me, told her straight up how I felt and she's gonna be gone for 2 weeks on vacation in Italy.  I decided to do that because I wanted to take myself completely out of the friend zone but now I feel like I might just have ruined any chance I have.  I can't tell if she's not answering because she read it and didn't know what to say or if she just got freaked out and I totally scared her off because of my inability to wait."
chlga,15,2010-06-22,I've lost 30 pounds but seemingly can't lose the pudge,logicalmoron,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/chlga/ive_lost_30_pounds_but_seemingly_cant_lose_the/,"Dear Reddit,

This is actually my first post over here on Fitness, but I have to say that all the lurking paid off. After getting advice from this reddit I went from 181 at the end of October to 150 as of today (I'm 5'11''.) SO, first and foremost, thanks for all the help and suggestions, even though I'm not quite the participator.

But, seriously, I have to ask, how the hell do you get rid of the pudge? after dropping 30 pounds I still have this little bit of a pooch on my stomach, and even though I'm still shedding weight it doesn't seem to be coming off from my stomach. I can't quite figure out where it's coming from.

But seriously, what's the best way to take out that damn stomach pudge?

Edit: WOW, talk about a huge flow of comments. It turns out I snoozed after I posted this due to work the next morning. So, adding a few things:

* I'm a male, and at most recent weighing I'm about ~152-154
* My daily routine consists of around 60 minutes of cardio (usually half running, half cycling, sometimes all running) at ~165-175 bpm heart rate
* Every other day I do 3 sets of 40 crunches, 3 sets of 20 reverse crunches, 3 sets of planks for 35 seconds, 3 sets of 15 push-ups, and 3 sets of walking lunges (usually around 15-20). This has been going up since starting at 10/10/20/7/10, etc. every two or three weeks.
* I don't have the moobs, just a little bit of pooch right above my pelvic area in the front.
* Nope, not a drinker
* My work schedule is insane (lol intern) so I don't have the most time in the world to execute a proper diet
* The ""skinny-fat"" look is probably the most descriptive, but I feel like a douche whenever my weight goes up after being 180ish for a good year, so I don't have that much patience for that.

I think my main problem is that now that I have the basic functionality down, I have no direction and don't know where to go.  I don't want to sit around reading through the entirety of the help directory, as doing that won't enable me to retain anything.  I think what I really need are practice problems and the learning that accompanies that.  Maybe easy problems to start with, and then gradually working my way up to more advanced stuff.  Does anyone have any idea of where I could go to find something like that?"

So I got an internship with a company for the summer and this company is really big into open source stuff.  We use Skype to communicate, and OpenOffice for our spreadsheets/documents, etc.  One of the things I have to do as part of my job involves using a program called Scilab.  I have looked up the basics and found some intro documents on their website and in their wiki.

I have googled Scilab and looked at most of the top 20 links, but was wondering if anyone with experience in Scilab had any personal favorite tutorials."
cj3nc,3,2010-06-25,19 y/o and first time break up what do i do,suprneb,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cj3nc/19_yo_and_first_time_break_up_what_do_i_do/,"heres a bit of background to my situation: im a 19 year old guy and ive been going out with this girl for six months. everything is usually great and we have a lot of fun together, including both intimate and deep/meaningful moments (or at least thats how i felt). also, this was my first ever relationship and she was my first for basically anything relationship related

less than a month ago (at the start of June), she went to sacramento for an internship at a senator's office (im currently located near the Berkeley campus). she came back two weeks ago to visit and we had a lot of fun hanging out again over the weekend because we missed each other (once again, thats how i felt at least). but this past week she hasnt been responding to my texts, emails, or phone calls and the last time i talked to her on Wednesday, she said she would be coming back today and we could talk then (she said she didnt want to talk at the time). so of course naturally i would be worried about whats wrong.

i couldnt sleep i couldnt eat and i couldnt even work because i was so worried - she told me that we could talk on the phone on thursday after she got off work becuase i wouldnt let it go. we finally get in contact and i tell her whats wrong - she says she has a lot on her mind and shes been stressed for work and studying for the LSAT which shes planning to take at the end of the year. she tells me shes coming back tomorrow and shes only a 'maybe' for staying at my place, and i know for sure somethings wrong.

i ask her if shes breaking up with me and after a long pause, she says yes. basically the reasons are that she really needs to study hard and not get distracted during her last year in college and she doesnt see us being together after she graduates (im a year behind her). of course this was heartbreaking and its still hurting like ive never felt before

later on that night, i send her some texts but she wont respond to me so i call her and she says shes just been busy thinking or studying. eventually i ask her if theres someone else involved. and after another long pause, she says yes: all she says is that its someone she met at work, and she says its someone she might like.

tl;dr
thats the story - we've been together for the best 6 months of my life and shes breaking up with me to study and to probably be with someone else. what i need help on now is what am i supposed to do? im completely torn apart. every time i see something we used to do (which is a lot because shes changed me a lot) i cant do anything else but think about that and how much im going to miss doing the stuff we did.

please help."
