3bp9t8,12,2015-06-30,Software Engineer Advice,MisterUnderwood,JobFair,https://www.reddit.com/r/JobFair/comments/3bp9t8/software_engineer_advice/,"Background: I recently graduated with an International Studies degree and have started my 4 year service commitment in the Air Force. After this I would like to go back to school and take the necessary steps towards becoming a software engineer for a good company like Apple or Google. I don't know any coding languages and plan on self teaching myself over the next four years.

Questions:
1. What steps should I take in the meantime to prepare myself for the software world?
2. When I go back to school what should I major in? Would you advise getting another undergraduate degree or go for a Master's?
3. Are there any languages you recommend I learn first?
4. After I finish my degree, what steps should I take to get into companies like Apple or Google? Are there any internships or should I try to work at a smaller company first to gain experience?
5. Are there any other companies you would recommend I look into for software engineering?

Thanks in advance for your replies. I appreciate your time and advice."

Which personal attributes create a successful software developer? I can already sit in front of a computer for hours and hours so I am locked in on that part. I am motivated and a hard worker. Besides that, do I need to have good communication skills - or does it vary from job to job? When should I look for internships?

General advice is also appreciated, thank you. BTW - I am 24 years old."

What I've gathered from rumors around the shop are that the computer and boards that run the servo pack are fried. The computer is gone, apparently with some 3rd party computer repair place so at the moment it's difficult for me to verify that this is the case.

I've found a few companies that retrofit cnc machines with new computers, controllers, servos, etc but before I tell my boss we have to shell out $4-12k to retrofit his machine, I'd really like to try and run the machine with a DIY hobby controller and some open source software. 

I have exactly ZERO concern for accuracy or precision at this point, I just want to be able to basically move the cutting head to demonstrate that the servo pack, motors etc are functional for as cheap as possible.

The servo controllers are SGDA-04VS (x2)

What do you guys think would be the best course of action moving forward?"

I was hired by the company I'm working at as an intern, with their intention of taking me full time after the summer. And of course I would like to get out of my parent's home and into an apartment soon. The one catch is that I don't know how feasible it will be for me.

I'm not comfortable signing a contract for an apartment until I actually get an offer from my company to stay full time (which is highly likely, and would happen in mid-late August).

I'm assuming most people would be looking to sign contracts ASAP when they find someone to live in their place, which means I would have little options if any when it gets down to it.

I'd like to hear any opinions that anyone has, also do you think that there would still be a good amount of people looking for tenants after September 1st?

Also if anyone has a decently priced apartment (900 or less) that they're trying to rent out in September you can PM me if you're comfortable with my situation! I'm working as a Software Engineer so money wouldn't be a problem, I just need the actual offer from my company.

Thanks for any info you can give me!"

Just got my paycheck and immediately threw 75% of it at my bill payments, starting to get a bit demoralized. Here's my situation. 

I graduated from my undergrad in May 2014. After my graduation I took an internship position on campus. I spent that year working to get hired full time with that department, and here I am posting this from work. 

The job pays ~25k annual. I contribute to a 403b, and the University's retirement fund. I would really like to see more in my savings account, but I feel like I'm just cycling money into groceries, bills and a few dates for my girlfriend. 

I guess my big question is if I should be worried about more substantial savings. If I was concerned, I could easily start looking for employment that pays a bit more. The thing is, I really like this job, I like the work I do, it's relevant to my field, and on top of that, working for the University can put me back in school for free. I plan to work through a Computer Science degree. My hesitation is that it will take ~4-5 years, and that seems like a long time to spend without making any substantial savings progress. 

Should I be worried? Should I try to make more? Maybe I'm just new to this whole thing and I'm worrying too much? Thanks for any advice, this sub has been really instrumental in the basic money management stuff I do now. "
3bruik,1,2015-07-01,Her: [18F] Me: [21M] - need some advice,MyUsername1993,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3bruik/her_18f_me_21m_need_some_advice/,"First reddit post! This is a long post, so bare with me (there is a brief TL;DR at the bottom). I feel that a lengthy post is needed in order to draw the full picture.

I [21M] (average male height, slim build) would consider myself quiet but confident in normal social group settings. I sometimes start conversation, but I'm more likely to engage when people ask me questions and in existing conversation, as opposed to starting any conversation. I am the type of person that will sit back, take everything in and provide my own input when asked. People often tell me that I'm a nice person (pretty sure as in good/kind person, as opposed to a 'nice guy™'), considerate, thoughtful and that I have a good sense of humour.

My quietness seems to become more profound when I am around a woman whom I find attractive and may have an interest in, probably because the nerves kick in (though I do, sometimes awkwardly, try and start conversation if the woman of my interest doesn't, even if it's just smalltalk) and I fear that I have missed out on a lot of potential opportunities or have blown the opportunities that do present themselves because of this.

Anyway, the current woman of my interest [18F] and I are involved in a university club together (where I met her) and we often hang out in group settings with other members of the university club, as well as doing club stalls where I'll be with her one-on-one. We also did an internship together. We've known each other since around the start of the year, and she caught my eye almost straight away when we first met. We align solidly as far as our values are concerned and similar political beliefs and the same worldview.

When she first caught my eye, I didn't go straight out and ask her out, as I decided to play it patiently and build a pretty solid friendship with her first to avoid any of the above described awkwardness that I have had with women in the past, and in the process; see if signs of interest begin to show, before deciding whether or not to make a move and ask her out. Like me, she seems to be on the quietly confident side - will mainly talk if talked to; will sometimes start conversation.

I think I am now at the stage where I do want to ask her out on a causal date (lunch on a Saturday or something?) The problem holding me back is the fact that the signs of interest are somewhat mixed? I could be looking too much into it and what I am perceiving as signs of disinterest could indeed actually be subtle (nervousness) signs of interest, and vice versa. 

**A lengthy list of possible signs of interest/disinterest**

*When we're together, one-on-one:*

* She's somewhat 'giggly' and more softly spoken when she talks to me which sometimes abruptly moves to almost loud excitement on occasion. The 'giggly' behaviour often varies to a degree depending on the day.
* Doesn't make eye contact (not sure whether to take that as a sign of nervousness or disinterest to be honest), but still engages in conversation. Usually it will be 50/50 as to who starts the conversation (come to think of it, we're both pretty quiet when we're one-on-one).
* There is often playful teasing exchanges between the both of us.
* On some days, she laughs pretty enthusiastically at the things I do/say. Other days she won't even lift an eyelid.
* Doesn't seem have a problem with me being in her personal space (doesn't step away or pull back moat of the time when I enter it and am almost always the one to pull back). Also doesn't have a problem with me lightly touching her as far as I know (palm of hand softly on the upper back or shoulder, for example. Doesn't purposefully touch me though).
* Accidental touching when doing things that require two people to do (not sure whether the touching was unavoidable, but my gut feeling is telling me it was something more).
* She seems to appreciate the small gestures I do for her (I'm not overbearing as I know she's an independent woman capable of doing things for herself, i.e; I don't go out of my way to open every door for her but if I am walking ahead of her into or out of an entranceway, I'll walk in/out first and will hold the door open for her to walk out/in out of common courtesy. Or if we're seated and I'm pouring myself a glass of water, I'll pour her a glass as well if she asks).

* Also, I was walking with her and we were approached by one of her friends (I never met her until this point), but she didn't introduce me to her (and thus left to stand in the background awkwardly - thus giving her friend reason to label me as 'creepy' - but I'm pretty sure that she refuted her friend's comment and said that I was a ""real nice guy""). Following the encounter, she told me her friend's name, and a couple of things about her that I didn't know, and remarked that she ""probably should have introduced [me] [...] sorry about that"" to which I remarked, jokingly, ""yeah, I was wondering why I wasn't introduced [...]"" to which she laughed. She has no problem introducing her male friends to me, however.

*When in a group setting:*

* Almost always sits next to me even with other seats available, else she'll sit directly across from me, or parallel to me.
* Seems more loud and boisterous towards her friends in a group setting (notably male friends, but also female friends), but is almost nervous(?) and reserved (to the point of almost ignoring me) towards me (fidgeting, playing with the rings on her hand, adjusting clothes, occasional playing with her, not making eye contact, somewhat short responses). She'll talk if I talk to her. Again, not sure whether to take this as a sign of nervousness towards me, or if she's telling me she's not interested.
* Feet are often pointing in my direction when standing, even when other people are in our vicinity. When sitting parallel from me, if her legs are crossed, the top knee is often pointing in my direction (even if a friend of hers is sitting next to her). If sitting across from each other, our feet/shoes sometimes accidentally touch. If sitting next to me, her legs will usually be crossed away from me. (not actually sure if any of this actually means anything).
* She sometimes glances at me when sitting across from me. Our eyes sometimes meet, I think, (I dart my eyes, almost involuntarily, away if I think she catches me).
* If I causally question something she brings up, she'll expand/elaborate on the subject that she was talking about and she'll make eye contact with me in doing so.
* When someone in the group asked if she had a crush on anyone, she paused for a good few seconds before saying ""no one"".

*Phone/Text/social media:*

* I have her phone number, which she gave to me without any prompting because we were working together on a project for the internship as well as doing stall for the university club. She also has my number for the same reason.
* I'm always the first to text/message (I only ever use text/social media for making arrangements) and she seems to respond with lengthy and enthusiastic responses back to me most of the time, like, responses that longer than necessary.
* If she unexpectedly leaves me waiting for a lengthy period of time without me knowing why, she will call or text before she arrives and is genuinely/extremely apologetic.

Brief TL;DR:

**I'm interested in a woman, similar values to me, have been developing a friendship with her and want to progress things further and ask her out. She has shown some signs of interest and others that may indicate disinterest or nervousness (see above).** 

*So, my questions are:*

1. Based on the descriptions above - is this woman possibly interested / should I ask her out?

2. It it possible that she has worked out that I like her, based on the descriptions above? And if so, is it possible that she's waiting for me to make a move (ask her out)?

3. Would it be a good idea for me to ask a mutual female friend to be my 'wingwoman' of sorts?

However, all I end up doing is doing mindless repetitive tasks (cleaning my room 100 times a day, organizing my clothes by colour then by season then by type...) I am fully aware that this is not productive at all, but I can't help it. 

I am completely crippled with constantly feeling overwhelmed. Can't function, can't sleep at night. Last night I got only about two hours of sleep, after forcing myself to sleep with binaural beats.

How could I learn to deal with so much to do? It will honestly get much worse once school starts again, I'd better learn how to manage it before it's too late."

If you meet all of the criteria that I request in this post, then there should be no reason why I don't respond to you.

This is what I'm looking for in your initial message to me. If any of these are not present, I will simply discard your message:

* Effort - seriously, if you don't plan on putting effort into your message, please don't bother messaging me!
* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries. 

That's all I can think of for now. One thing you do not need to do is give me a real life physical description of yourself. I don't care how tall you are, where you're from, your age, the colour of your hair, none of that. We're roleplaying with made up characters, so our real lives are irrelevant in this world we create.

Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...

I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

I really hope that I get some worthwhile responses for this. I'll be back in a bit to see what I get. Thank you!"

I have gotten an internship every summer in my undergraduate at this company in cognitive science. We do various studies and jobs.

Of course, I haven't said anything about this and I'm continuing to do my job but do you think this is bad for me to be part of this project? Is this a sin? Should I feel guilty?

""The ability to generate all cell types of the body has thrust pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into the spotlight as a panacea for regenerative medicine. The ability to generate PSCs from any person by reprogramming (yielding induced pluripotent stem cells, iPSCs) has ushered in an era of personalized medicine allowing “disease in a dish” modeling and ultimately cell replacement strategies. However, despite their potential, reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs, a process triggered by ectopic expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, and Klf4, is limited by its low efficiency. We aim to uncover the temporal sequence of cell state transitions as somatic cells reprogram by identifying the genes that are activated or inactivated during these transitions. Our results will provide fundamental insights into epigenetic reprogramming and help reduce the time needed for reprogramming while increasing its efficiency. Because reprogramming takes place over a period of weeks in densely populated cultures in which only 1% of the cells progress to pluripotency, we cannot use population studies to measure the dynamics in gene expression. Instead, we will apply the recently developed Drop-seq method to measure mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously. We plan to measure expression level of thousands of cells at different time-points during reprogramming, and to develop methods to infer the dynamics of gene activation/inactivation for the cells undergoing faithful reprogramming.

3bswxi,1,2015-07-01,[Due 2015-07-02 11:59 pm PST] 250 words on stem cell reprogramming for a grant!,[deleted],Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/3bswxi/due_20150702_1159_pm_pst_250_words_on_stem_cell/,"See text below: 

""The ability to generate all cell types of the body has thrust pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into the spotlight as a panacea for regenerative medicine. The ability to generate PSCs from any person by reprogramming (yielding induced pluripotent stem cells, iPSCs) has ushered in an era of personalized medicine allowing “disease in a dish” modeling and ultimately cell replacement strategies. However, despite their potential, reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs, a process triggered by ectopic expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, and Klf4, is limited by its low efficiency. We aim to uncover the temporal sequence of cell state transitions as somatic cells reprogram by identifying the genes that are activated or inactivated during these transitions. Our results will provide fundamental insights into epigenetic reprogramming and help reduce the time needed for reprogramming while increasing its efficiency. Because reprogramming takes place over a period of weeks in densely populated cultures in which only 1% of the cells progress to pluripotency, we cannot use population studies to measure the dynamics in gene expression. Instead, we will apply the recently developed Drop-seq method to measure mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously. We plan to measure expression level of thousands of cells at different time-points during reprogramming, and to develop methods to infer the dynamics of gene activation/inactivation for the cells undergoing faithful reprogramming. For my research internship, I am planning either work with Fname Lname at SomeInstitute to expand these computational analyses to lncRNAs in reprogramming, or at the AnotherInstitute, to XYZ.""

3bt211,0,2015-07-01,[Internship] Interested or already working with Node.js/MEAN stack? Have a background or strong interest in programming? We are looking for a couple individuals to grow with us!,MyDollarHelped,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/3bt211/internship_interested_or_already_working_with/,"We are a startup and have a few full time coders and some part time coders. We are all on the pro bono equity ride right now. And every feature we add, gets us closer to getting some VC or Angel funds.

So, yes, unpaid^1. Ramen for all! 

You have to have entrepreneurial spirit to fit in. We are all doing this because we believe in the end goal and the payoff that will come with it.

I am an active mentor for my own charity and for the city I live in. I am familiar in providing guidance and education to people at all different phases of their lives, so this will fully be an educational experience if you want to learn. If you don't... don't message!



Ideal candidate will have many years experience with a computer. We don't mind teaching basics, but NOT THOSE BASICS.

I prefer you are familiar with CLI even if you are a Windows user. If you are a Linux user, that's even better.

You need at least passing knowledge of programmatic structure to be able to work. The more you know about node.js and MEAN, the better.

In exchange for creating small modules of code for us, I can train, educate and mentor you on a very wide array of subjects. From business basics, running, managing, financials and taxes, on up to the very complex, business plan development, USPs and how to pivot and exit. And anything technology and internet related that you are interested in as well.

This internship is well suited to the individual that has thought about learning the MEAN stack but doesn't know where to begin or has begun, but doesn't know how to focus their interest. If you stick with it, you'll be able to start up and run your own business. No college needed.

If you like coding, you WILL NOT BE BORED!

Previous mentees of mine have gone on to work for large companies such as IBM, Paypal/eBay, Raytheon and Google or have created their own successful endeavors. Be one of the next!

Whilst looking at where to apply for my summer internship next year, I wondered if there was anything that I could be doing that would really make my CV stand out. The career help at university aren't really that useful so who better to ask than the collective group of UK redditors who have lots of different jobs!

Background: I'm about to enter my second year of a maths degree at a Russell Group university with some Spanish modules. I play a musical instrument (bassoon, I got to grade 6), have a small part time job at my Student's Union and I'm involved with a few societies. I'm thinking about possibly consultancy or intellectual property but I'm not fixed down to a particular dream job at the moment and I would love to hear from all of your different career paths!

Basically, is there anything you see on a CV that always makes you think 'Oh, they're a good candidate' or make you impressed? Are things like DofE or being in a sports team really that useful? Does extra curricular really matter and all you're after is that 2:1 or 1st? Alternatively, is there anything you hate to see? "
3bt6iz,3,2015-07-01,Me [27M] with my gf [26F] of 1.5 years. Struggling to line up and I feel like we are just on different levels.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bt6iz/me_27m_with_my_gf_26f_of_15_years_struggling_to/,"Long version: 

My girlfriend and I are a very contrasting pair. I am a freshly graduated engineer with an oil and gas job in Canada, and she is a hippy-type, who is working on an organic (biodynamic) farm for her work placement through a horticulture program.


I am the breadwinner, and I have been the entire relationship. when we met, I was on my internship. I finished it, went to shool for my final year, and was offered a job immediately. I have lived on my own or with a room mate since I was 18, I have had a job since I was 13 or so. I have never been unemployed in that time. I did make some mistakes and fail two years of college for computer science, and then went to a trade school for IT. Then decided to pursue engineering where I finally found the right thing and have stuck with it and had terrific results. 


My girlfriend has never left home, emotionally or otherwise. She is still dependent on her mother for money, rides, and even went so far as to suggest we move in to her mother's house or a house in the neighborhood where her mother, grandparents and even her father and stepmother live in. She has a lot of debt (so do I,  in the form of student loans) that she has no way to pay off. Her attitude is ""everything will work out in the end! Don't worry"". Her father is constantly accumulating more debt and is financially irresponsible, she has never been responsible or had to be. 


This is one of the reasons I feel so disconnected from her.


The next reason is her conflict resolution and general self-centered attitude that her way is the best way and she knows more than everyone. She believes her travelling experiences have given her a one-up on anything I or other people she knows have experienced. I don't mean to say they aren't meaningful experiences, just that it hasn't answered every question on earth because she took a working visa in Australia or toured South America for 3 months. 


The conflict resolution part is hard to explain. In every instance that I bring up something that bothers me, she finds a way to blame me or get angry with me. It turns into a he said she said argument that I end up feeling unheard and not understood. I feel bullied constantly and I get called demanding. There is a bit more to it than that. We have broken up several times and got back together. In these instances mean things are said both directions, but I am never allowed to talk about what she said. I have told her to get out of my life, while she belittle and emasculated me regularly. She doesn't hear me out or attempt to understand, just brushes it off and rebuttles that I said other things and so we never actually talk about my issues.


I have a lot of pent up frustration. This girl will interrupt me constantly and it honestly sometimes feels like she is trying to make me mad in order to win fights. If I give up on a fight and say ""you win"" she will literally turn it around on me and say ""fuck you"" several times and tell me to leave. It happens all the time and I still feel bullied. We went to counselling for a month and it never got better. The counselor had to stop her from interrupting me and shutting me down, and had to explain to her that I needed to explain something. I honestly feel like I am dating a 16 year old girl sometimes, or even younger, emotionally.


The second-last issue is that she doesn't recognize or appreciate the contributions I make. I pay all of the rent at the house we live in together, I pay all of the bills and I pay for the food. I also do most(80%+) of the chores and cleaning. I understand that she gets paid very little and cannot afford to pay rent, but I feel completely exhausted. I do expect some contributions aside from money, like cooking or cleaning or just doing nice things. 


I am so angry and frustrated. I do respect the things she wants to do and the path she has chosen. If I ever disagree with her or try to explain that I don't think something works the way she does, I am immediately bullied and belittled until I stop trying. When I was in school and tried to tell her I couldn't talk, she would fight with me for days instead. Like I said it is so complicated and right now I am frustrated and upset. I will try to clarify anything I can.


I want out but I am having trouble believing I will find someone else. I am struggling to understand if it is my fault or if it is out of my control. We live together and as shitty as this sounds, one of the only reasons I hesitate to end it is because I don't want her to take the couch or reclining chair. I know that sounds terrible but I have a lifestyle that I am tired of her interrupting and debilitating.

TL;DR I am in a potentially toxic relationship and I feel like we are on vastly different levels intellectually and emotionally. I feel bullied and unappreciated, and I want out. I need advice with how to move on.

Edit: sorry for any typos/errors. I am on my phone in the airport on my way home from work."
3btasr,19,2015-07-01,"I'm getting tired of feeling like the low person on the totem pole, how do I make others take me more seriously at work?",dvtheall,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/3btasr/im_getting_tired_of_feeling_like_the_low_person/,"To give some backstory:

This is about my second year out of college, I know what you're thinking (There's your problem right there...) and this is my 1 year anniversary coming up working for this marketing company. I was hired as a designer, and after some restructuring, a few firings and hirings, they saw a need for a production artist, to help move the initial concepts to final press files.

So they moved me into that knowing that I have a wide range of skills and knowledge with all of the programs. This was not a demotion from the designer spot, but they said they just needed more structure to their process. Which everyone has agreed that putting me in this new position has really helped move projects along. But now I'm not really doing what I love. I'm not given the opportunity to use all of my skills to their potential. I feel like I'm not growing.  And I feel like they treat me like an intern.

They'll give me odd jobs that interrupt what I'm doing just because they don't want to deal with it themselves. Make me take the trash out, assemble new office chairs, move equipment, etc... And now I hear we may be moving down a few floors into a bigger office space. It seems like everybody will get their own office (which the design staff isn't all that pleased about since we have an open area right now) and of course they want to put me in the far back office, no windows, even more separated from the team.

I'm just starting to feel like I'm not being seen or treated like an important part of the team. Like they don't care what I want. The one light at the end of the tunnel is that my creative director has talked about transitioning me out of production work and doing more in the digital department, but that transition seems excruciatingly slow. I have a lot of web knowledge that they aren't utilizing because I get so bogged down with production work, and we have so many websites to design and build that I could help with.

The one website I started developing for work was going really well, and then I was told to hand it over to my art director so I could finish these other production projects...and then my art director completely ruins the site, and then decides to drop it on our web designers lap to fix, as if he has the time to clean up his mess. It should have just stayed in my hands, my art director doesn't know much about websites, he knows how to make things with tables, and that's it.

I'm probably going a little overboard with this post, a lot of it is ranting, I apologize, I just don't know what to do, I'm just very frustrated. I have high expectations for myself, and because my position seems to be limiting me, I'm not meeting my own expectations. And if they don't expect much from me then how is that supposed to make me feel, that won't improve my work, that won't help me grow.

What should I do to be taken more seriously?"

I am a CS student and feel like coding all day is bad for my BJJ and lifting goals. Even if I get up and stretch every other 15 minutes or so, I just feel it hurts me cardio wise due to the sitting all day. I feel like this sedentary lifestyle just doesn't fit in with my goals. The flexibility lost by sitting all day as well as the overall negative health benefits make me sick. I feel like Google, Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft could definitely be in my future but I don't care about the money if I can get a job which would help me live a better lifestyle. My parents push the CS because I have already had 4 internships. Not sure what to do.

I am considering graduating with a CS degree and Biology minor and then getting a masters in Nursing so I can be up and about during the day. I do enjoy coding, but lifting weights and BJJ is more important to me. 

Though I do second guess myself. If I get a masters in Nursing then I will be up on my feet all day. This may be hard recovery wise if I lift weights in the morning and do BJJ at night. I am truly stuck and looking for other perspectives.

I have tried standing desks and treadmill desks and they still don't do it for me. It is not the same as actually being up and about accomplishing tasks. 

Do you think this plan is unwise? Are desk jobs bad for BJJ? "

I'm relating it to college because it is a required internship that is 12 credits for school. I've been here for 6 weeks and I have 5 left. I'm sure some people would say that's nothing, but to me it feels like an eternity. I miss home so much. If I would have known how miserable I would be out here I would have never taken this job. I cry everyday at work. I miss my family, my friends, my boyfriend, my dog, the list goes on and on. This is really like my first time being away from home for a long period of time.

I get to visit home this weekend, but I have to fly back Monday morning. Knowing I still have 5 months makes me sick. I want to go home for good. I want to see my parents whenever I want. I want to enjoy my summer with my friends and boyfriend. I'm always depressed. I started to get panic and anxiety attacks recently. Its tough because the only thing I look forward to is coming home.

3btoou,10,2015-07-01,Today was exhausting,thesongofmyppl,AnimalShelterStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalShelterStories/comments/3btoou/today_was_exhausting/,"Our shelter is chronically understaffed, and our busiest time of day (3-5 pm) is when we feel it most.

The phones ring off the hook and it seems like all the callers are frustrated because of their neighbor's barking dogs, or roosters, or feral cat colony. 

This was today, no exaggeration:

Our current list of addresses for Animal Control Officers to check on is four pages long. And while I have 3 lines ringing, I also have 2 families waiting to look through the dog kennels, I can't find an employee to escort them through and we close in half an hour. 

I have two adoption applications on my desk that have to be processed right now so the other families waiting can take their puppies home.

And now a lady walked in and wants to look for her lost cat. But there's no one to take her back. Where IS everyone???

And someone needs to use my computer right fucking now because they can't get the other one to work because the guy who knows the password is on vacation.

And I'm almost through processing this adoption and the copier jammed. And there's a guy on the phone who will not shut up about this abandoned dog that we've been getting calls about all day, but our 3 officers haven't had time to get to.

Okay, looks like someone messed up the medical paperwork for these dogs getting adopted and I highly suspect it's our 16-year old summer ""intern"" who spends most of her time rolling her eyes, texting, and refusing to answer the ringing phones. 

So, I'm now inventing paperwork, and seemingly out of nowhere, my coworkers start yelling at each other and our director has to break them up before it gets out of control.

At 5:05, I still had scraps of paper with scribbled addresses of callers we had to follow up on, and one last piece of paperwork to process, but it was time to go. 

It will have to wait for tomorrow.

I'm on an internship out of state, in a small college town, and my girlfriend came with me. We figured it'd be a nice way to spend the summer. We agreed to split everything 50/50. My internship gave me a fairly handsome offer sheet for my time: enough to cover my rent comfortably, and save quite a bit over the course of my tenure.

My girlfriend, however, wasn't as lucky. It's a small town, and with school out of session, lots of small businesses aren't hiring short term because business is already slow without students keeping the economy humming. My girlfriend's been a real go-getter and has applied to more jobs than probably even I know about, and I love her for it more than words can explain. She's been handling a lot of the household stuff since I work long hours, and she's been great at it. During the early parts of the search, I recommended small cafes and restaurants that might have openings, but she turned them down because, due to their tip-based pay, it'd be inconsistent and she wouldn't be able to meet her obligations in the bills. I took issue with this, but she asked me to give her the space to handle it herself, and I did. 

But it's been about 4 weeks now, and she still hasn't had any luck. Due to poor communication on behalf of my employer, my pay got messed up, leaving me broke on payday, and needing to borrow from my parents to make rent and the like. When I finally got paid, it's set to evaporate to cover utilities, rent, bills,  groceries and the like, leaving me almost broke all over again. She's still applying, but she hasn't looked at all options. I was only very recently able to get her to look at waitressing options. 

The most recent battle is over a head shop nearby. My girlfriend doesn't feel comfortable with the idea of working in one, even though it has a sign saying it's hiring. When I asked her to, she said she wasn't going to inquire, and took a very firm stance on the matter. This has left me frustrated, because at this point, I feel like we really can't be picky. I'm paying the minimum on her credit card bill to avoid her default and she's almost maxed out on credit. I feel like the opportunity for money is in our faces, and she just wont take it. What do I do, reddit? I'm feeling frustrated.

I was working as an intern somewhere and I met someone, let's call her Susie. Susie is getting married to a woman in 3 months. We become friends, then we became really good friends and we started hanging out outside of work. I didn't really think of her in a gay way because I knew she was very unavailable. She's been with her fiancee for 10 years and she's the only girl she's been with, she was with guys before that. I considered her a really great friend and I don't have many at the moment. I felt very safe with her. Cut to about a month ago when a conversation about Orange is the New Black got kind of flirtatious and we started sexting. It kind of escalated and we've slept together.

Honestly, I know I'm falling in love with her. I've told her this is a bad idea. I've told her I don't want her to get married. She says that she isn't leaving her fiancee for me, she doesn't want to hurt her, but that she has feelings for me and is mourning the ""what if."" She said if it was meant to be I would have met her 10 years ago.

I am just really confused. I don't really feel too bad about being a ""mistress."" I know her fiancee and she is very nice, but I am not in a relationship. I know that's crap logic, but it's not my responsibility to babysit those who are. All I know is I have feelings for her and I want to be with her and she knows that. She says we are each others' ""person."" We're best friends. But she also wants to fuck me. I just want to be with her. I think it's fun right now but when she gets married in 3 months I know it's gonna kill me, but I am kind of holding on for the 1% chance that something will happen and they'll break up. I just want her to be happy, and she told me that in general she is, but I don't see how you can cheat after 10 years right before your wedding if you're happy... I am just kind of stuck. I know I should get out sooner than later but I've never had feelings for anyone like this before and I just don't want to leave. I am also kind of hurt because she was my friend and knows how I think and my relationship past, so she must know how I really feel about her and she is still letting this continue. This just sucks. She always says she is ""greedy,"" and she is. She gets both of us and I get nothing. She tells me all the time that it can stop whenever I say so and she will understand. But I still don't get why she is letting it happen.

tl;dr: in love with ex-coworker who is getting married in 3 months, she is confusing, I don't know what to do. I am hurt and I don't want to hurt worse, but I also don't want to get out."
3bu4i2,0,2015-07-02,"Me [37M] professor with my current student [20F] together recently after my wife left me. I want it to end, but I'm afraid of what comes after that.",chiefjeffreylewis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bu4i2/me_37m_professor_with_my_current_student_20f/,"Hi, all. I'm a 37 year old art studio art professor at a relatively large private university. Back in the fall of 2014, I found out that my wife was having an affair with one of her coworkers. We honestly tried to work it out for a couple months, but she ultimately left me for the other guy. I was reeling. I had been dating my wife since I was 19, and we got married when I was 25. After 18 years being in love with her and wanting to spend my whole life with her, I was just devastated. One of my students, Daniel, was doing a supervised internship with me that fall semester when I was going through all this. I was struggling at hiding my stress from him, and I trusted him a lot since it was his third year with me. I told him the minimum, that I was going through a divorce. 

In January, the Spring 2015 semester started, and I was teaching 3 different classes, plus a supervised internship again. One of my classes was an upper division class that required department acceptance to get into, meaning, all of my students were incredibly talented. Most of them were seniors graduating that semester, but there was one girl who was only 19, a sophomore. She was quite precocious and took a definite liking to me. I kind of interpreted it as just her wanting to get a recommendation from me/get some good tips from me, since I am pretty respected in the department and have pretty good connections in some museums I knew she was interested in working in. We were talking in my office one day when she drops the bomb and asks me how I was feeling. I was confused and pressed her to why she was asking. Turns out, Daniel had some loose lips and let it slip that I was going through a divorce. I was slightly uncomfortable answering, but I was still at a moderately teary point in the coping process, so I was predictably slightly emotional answering her even though I was trying to remain professional. She ended up giving me a hug, and that was that. A few weeks after that, I felt awkward around her and very embarrassed in class, but she acted like that exchange never even happened. As the semester went on, and I don't know why this happened, but I began looking at her in a different way. I would notice how soft her hair looked or how a dress she wore hug the curves of her body so perfectly. I felt like a scum bag, honestly. I tried to shake those feelings all the time, but I think after that original hug she gave me, I think she took that as her breaking the physical barrier between us. I began flirting with her a bit, and she reciprocated. Soon after that, she asked me out to have coffee with her on the weekend once. I should've said no, I know it, but I went with her anyway. We talked in that shop for three hours about anything that was unacceptable for us to talk about. I talked about my ex-wife and what her leaving me did to my psyche, my self-esteem. I made a remark somewhere that I couldn't even believe that she (my student) could even think an old fart like me was attractive. Flash to later that night when I went back to her apartment and drank some wine with her. She ended up kissing me on the couch and we had sex shortly after. 

Honestly, the couple months following that were great. Unacceptable. Unprofessional. Bad for me. But they felt so good as they were happening. She showed me this sort of raw attraction and dedication to me that my ex-wife had been withholding from me. Of course she's beautiful; she just turned 20. She's young, fresh, and has opened me up to thoughts I didn't think I possessed. 

However. The big however. After looking into my university's policies-after the fact, of course, I'm a fucking idiot-I found out that our relationship is completely against school policies and could get me fired. I want to end it now. I don't want to lose my job, but I'm afraid of what she'll do if I end it. I'm afraid she's become quite enamored with me now. She hasn't said that she loved me, but I think if I prompted her, she might. I'm her sexual fantasy that she finally achieved. I'm still incredibly attracted to her and want to continue to have sex with her, buy her things that she wants, take her out to dinner, and cook meals for her. I love the dynamic we have now. It's extremely satisfying to me. I just can't go on risking someone in the department finding out. But maybe it's already too late for that? 

I'm afraid what will happen if I ask to end things. Her personality is quite...assertive, to put it kindly. She didn't get to where she is in her life at such a young age by being a pushover or not working hard. She's meticulous. She's forceful. She has a hunger. She's everything wild and insaitiable a 20 year old is. But she's also unpredictable and sometimes disturbed, haunted by her own past of sexual abuse. I found this out recently. She suffers from some bouts of manic depression, but she takes meds to regulate herself. I'm just afraid of the situation I've put myself in now. I don't know if it's possible for me to cut things off evenly and perfectly if she decides to take my life down as revenge. 

Everything is so complicated and shitty. I want to blame her for being so intoxicating and pursuing me. I want to blame my ex-wife for leaving me as the mess I was to be able to put myself into this position. I want to blame Daniel for telling her that I had gone through a divorce. I want to blame everyone but myself, but I know I'm the one responsible for all of the pain and suffering I'm sure I will endure. I was not myself coming out of my marriage. I was impulsive and not making good decisions in any aspect of my life (stopped eating, started abusing alcohol as I had once done, neglected regular bathing and exercise). 

I just don't know what to do now. Do I end things against both of our wills in hopes that this will just fizzle and I can retain my job? Do I stay with her and do what we both want, hoping that we can keep it a secret for longer? Do I end it and be proactive within my department and hope they have mercy on me? 



   
**tl;dr**: As a broken man after a divorce, I ended up sleeping with/having a relationship with one of my students that continues now. It is very against our school policy, and I want to end it, but she is known to be impulsive and sort of mean, so I fear the repercussions either way. Do I have a happy ending? "

I'm due to head to Philadelphia on Friday for unrelated reasons, so I may not have much time before I leave to put an outfit together.

The job with one of those young upstart ""free breakfast and beer on Fridays"" companies. Based on my social media stalking, the dress is pretty casual, but put together. It's also a creative position, so.

I know I should step it up a bit, but I don't want to be overdressed. I'm also not from NYC, so I'm feeling slightly...intimidated, I guess? Right now I'm working for a state agency in the south as a designer, and it's a completely different vibe than what I'm going to be walking into (I'm currently the youngest (at 28) person at my job, aside from the interns). 

Some info about me: I'm 5'9, hourglass figure. Wrap dresses and my boobs tend not to agree with one another, just FYI. Also, I have pink hair.

Suggestions, please? My budget is in the $100 range. 

Thank you!

3bucgp,3,2015-07-02,I [21 M] feel like a loser compared to my girlfriend [21 F],SadThrowaway35806,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bucgp/i_21_m_feel_like_a_loser_compared_to_my/,"I hope this is the right place to post this; I wasn't sure if it should go here or in /r/Advice. In any event, I'm using a throwaway because some friends know my username, but I doubt any will see this so I'll be fairly specific.

So as a bit of background, both my girlfriend (I'll call her Rachel in this) and I have been together since our senior year of high school and we both currently attend a pretty prestigious university for Engineering. College, in general, has been kinder to her than it has to me. While we both have had ups and downs with the stress and workload of school, she's had a much better time socially than I have.

Freshmen year despite my best attempts I was honestly unable to make friends. I lived with two of my best friends from high school, but they were pretty antisocial and I used them as a crutch throughout the year. I wanted to go out and meet new people and have the college experience, but I didn't really know where to start and in the past I'd play off friends to make new ones. Rachel and her best friends/other friends of mine didn't have this issue. I would on occasion tag along with them, but it's only so often that a guy can hang out exclusively with girls. I also tried joining clubs, but never really found an in to anything.

Anyway, this inability to find friends and hearing stories of fun times from Rachel and our friends that I wasn't there for sorta gave me these constant feeling of loneliness and of being unwanted even when around people. This led to tension between Rachel and I because we both know that I can't use her as a crutch emotionally for everything and that I need my own friends. 

To summarize the following two years, we both had internships the following summers, though always in the same state as the school and my hometown friends who I was happy to see. My sophomore year I lived in a single dorm which was great for spending time with Rachel, but overall only piled on my feelings of loneliness. Junior year I moved in with a more social friend from high school, but the year had a hellish workload for me and everyone I was friendly with. It was a better year, but hampered by all that.

With that background in mind, Rachel and I have both now taken up internships out of state; I am in Washington D.C. and she's in Portland, Oregon. I was very excited for this summer and was hoping the new city could be a positive fresh start for me. Sadly, that hasn't been the case. There are plenty of fresh-out-of college people at my work, but they all seem to travel every weekend and I haven't been able to really make any good friends there. I had hoped my roommate, another student from my school, would want to do things with me, but that hasn't been the case. When I try to go out and do things I invite him along but he tends to reject the offer and he has friends who live down in the area. It doesn't help the feelings of being unwanted that he doesn't invite me along when he does stuff. We get along well, but I had hoped for a partner in this.

I've tried going to meetups, going out to bars to meet people my age, just being generally my friendly self, but it's hard. Everything is expensive as hell here so I can't sustain doing stuff all the time. The people I've met, though nice and I've had good conversations with, are never really around my age and thus we don't have a ton in common. Most days I just go to work, come home and collapse, workout, eat and go to bed. Then I lay in bed and stay on my phone until really late to talk to Rachel as much as I can in a day. It's been a month and a half and I still haven't made any friends to just do things with and I just feel lonely all the time.

Meanwhile, Rachel has been having the best summer of her life in Portland. I can't help but be jealous when I hear about everything she's doing. She has a good group of young friends from work and was immediately invited to go out and do things by her roommates. She's had tons of firsts and plans to have tons more. Meanwhile, I just feel awful about myself when everything I try doesn't net me anything to write home about. Most days I end up with a pit of sadness in my chest as I wait for her to respond to a text message while she's out at a bar, or at the beach, or just experiencing life. 

It just feels awful to be the shitty half of a relationship. A lot of the time I feel like maybe there's something broken with me. At this point, I'm not really sure what to do. I promised Rachel that we would have amazing adventures to tell each other about, but my half of the bargain isn't being fulfilled. I just feel like a colossal loser who just lucked into having such a great girlfriend and that maybe she'd be better off with somebody else. Not sure what the question I'm specifically asking is, but I'd like some input and some advice on what to do to get over this.



   
**tl;dr**: GIrlfriend's in Portland and I'm in DC for internships. She's having an amazing time and I haven't done anything and feel lonelier by the minute. Any advice on what to do to get over this is welcomed."
3buimm,1,2015-07-02,Falling for my straight roommate.. Advice needed!,brian0525,Relationship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Relationship/comments/3buimm/falling_for_my_straight_roommate_advice_needed/,"I have never been the type of guy to express how I feel towards someone just because I think its embarrassing and I don't like to look or feel stupid. I also built walls that I can't even break myself.. Because of these reasons, I have lost so many great people in my life. But this is something that I need to get off my chest. 

This summer I relocated to a different state for my internship. I was able to find housing through an organization that I am past of so I was randomly assigned roommates by then. I am not used to sharing an apartment with anyone. I used to be an RA at my school &amp; the only time I had the need to share a room with someone, he was pretty cool and he is now one of my close friends.

To continue with the story.. When I was moving in to my new apartment, my landlord left the keys with my roommate since I was going to arrive later than expected.. Fine.. Well, I have successfully arrived to my new place for the summer. I rang the bell and there he was... My new roommate for the summer; I could not help it but notice how unbelievably attractive he is. He was very friendly to me &amp; welcomed me home with a smile on.

We are both 21 years old, rising seniors, and working as Finance interns. We are both very ambitious and share the same level of accomplishments. We have a very bright future ahead of us. 

We also share the apartment with two other guys. However, we are the closest ones in the house. We used to go for dinner almost every night during the first month since we were too lazy to go food shopping. We are the only 2 who smokes in the house so we smoke together every night before bed, we now cook together (usually I do the cooking and he just waits around). He also encouraged me to sign up to the gym so I did.. Because I would like to get more fit &amp; it is also another opportunity to spend more time with him. 
When I'm around him, I get this crazy amazing feeling inside, I'm stress free &amp; just want to smile. Each day, I wait anxiously until he comes home from work. My face lit up when he walks into the apartment and says hello. I can't help it but to replay our conversations. I miss him every second of the day; especially on the weekends since we do not see each other. 

Sometimes I feel down and upset from long days at work, and he is the only one from my other 3 roommates who actually notices when I am not myself because he takes the time to ask me if I am alright.

I am a huge fan of sharing everything on my snapchat story and he is always top 5 to watch my stories.. It makes my day. 

However, my roommate is very into woman. There is no doubt about that. He talks about them all the time with my other straight roommate who is also obsessed with women. I believe my roommate (my crush) finally figured out that I am not attracted to woman so he does not longer talks about woman with me as much as he does with our other roommate.

I am not 100% sure what I want to get out of this. I have a pretty good instinct so I have this feeling inside that at the right moment, it might finally happen.. He will grab my face &amp; kiss me. This of course will not make him gay or interested in being with other guys, but I can see him making that one time exception.. But then again, what do I know? I just need to get myself back on track. I have not crushed or liked anyone in over 2 years. I have been very successful in my college career &amp; I am working for a very prestigious &amp; Fortune 100 company, but unfortunately, my biggest nightmare is coming to a reality.. My work &amp; performance is getting affected because of a guy.. Never saw this one coming, but I guess it is part of life, huh? 

Anyways, Thank you for reading.. I'm just tired of keeping everything to myself so I had the need to share this with someone."

3bunv2,237,2015-07-02,Ein paar Worte zur App vom Entwickler,Brommhommler,rocketbeans,https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketbeans/comments/3bunv2/ein_paar_worte_zur_app_vom_entwickler/,"Hallo, ich wünsch euch allen einen guten Morgen und ein fettes Dankeschön für das konstruktive Feedback.

Kurz zu mir: Ich bin der Entwickler der Android-App und versuche schnellstmöglich die Bugs aus der App zu entfernen.

Zuerst hoffe ich, dass euch die App im Allgemeinen gefällt. Auf manche Fehler gehe ich gleich detailliert ein. Bei Android ist das mit den Geräten immer so eine Sache. Momentan wird die App von ca. 8000 Geräten unterstützt. Da konnten wir leider nicht alle testen.

1.: Kein Sendeplan / Keine BeansCast's / Abstimmungen 
Das Problem liegt hier bei der Authentifizierung, welche für den Erhalt der Daten benötigt wird. Um Daten zu erhalten senden wir einen Schlüssel an den Server, welcher Max eingerichtet hat. Anscheinend wird bei einigen genau dieser Schlüssel nicht richtig, oder gleich gar nicht generiert. Wenn dies der Fall ist, dann sieht man weder den Sendeplan, die BeansCast's noch irgendwelche Abstimmungen. Ich versuche diesen Bug heute zu beheben, da er meiner Ansicht nach (mit dem automatischen Start des Streams) der schlimmste ist.

2.: Der automatische Start des Streams / allgemeines zum Stream 
Das ist mir momentan noch ein absolutes Rätsel. Normalerweise wird der Stream erst initialisiert, sobald der User auf das Play-Image drückt. Besonders häufig kommt der Fehler wohl auf dem Samsung S3, S4 und S3 mini vor. Ich kümmer mich um dieses Problem und hoffe es auch noch heute zu beheben.

Allgemeines zum Stream: 
Den Stream, den wir benutzen ist leider der embedded HTML5-Stream von Twitch. D.h., dass der Stream in einer WebView abgespielt wird. Wir mussten leider auf den WebStream zurückgreifen, da Twitch nicht erlaubt die direkte Stream-URL in einem eigenen Player abzuspielen. In einer anfänglichen Version hatten wir die direkte URL in einem eigenen Player abgespielt. Nach Absprache mussten wir dann aber auf den WebStream zugreifen. Der Stream in der WebView skaliert sich bei der Bildqualität automatisch. Wir haben über diesen Stream leider überhaupt keine Kontrolle mehr.

Wenn ihr den Stream abspielt und durch die App navigiert, oder aus der App heraus, dann behalten wir den Stream am laufen (außer ihr habt auf Pause geklickt). Der Stream läuft dann auf Audio-Only. Würden wir den Stream immer stoppen, sobald der User durch die App navigiert, oder Twittern möchte etc. dann müsste man den Player immer neu starten. Wenn das für viele von euch unangenehm ist, können wir eine Option in den Einstellungen einbauen, bei der ihr dann einstellen könnt, ob der Stream auch im Hintergrund abgespielt wird.

3.: Absturz von BeansCast / Speichern von BeansCast / Notification 
Wie in Punkt 1 erwähnt, hängt der Absturz mit der Authentifizierung zusammen. Da keine BeansCast's geladen werden können, stürzt die App dementsprechend ab, wenn man dann auf Play drückt. Ich fange heute den Fehler ab, sodass die App nicht mehr Abstürzt, sollte man auf Play drücken wenn keine BeansCast's vorhanden sind.

Speichern: 
Die Bohnen möchten, dass der Stream App-Exklusiv ist. Dementsprechend wird der BeansCast bei einem Download intern gepseicht und somit vor Zugriffen geschützt. Vielleicht ändert sich das auch mal mit der Zeit, aber da müsst ihr mit den Bohnen schreiben :)

Notification: 
Die Notification wird noch überarbeitet, war aber am Ende nicht mehr an oberster Priorität. Play und Pause Buttons werden aber demnächst folgen (sobald sich die App stabilisiert hat) . Allgemein zum BeansCast: Ihr könnt den BeansCast komplett beenden, indem ihr auf eurem Smartphone die Zurück-Taste drückt wenn ihr auf der BeansCast Seite seid. Es wird aber per Update bald auch die Möglichkeit geben den BeansCast direkt aus der Notification und auf der Seite zu beenden.

4.: Abstimmungen 
Bei den Abstimmungen wird ziemlich oft stehen, dass aktuell keine vorhanden sind. Auf der Abstimmungs-Seite wird für ein gewisses Zeitfenster die Abstimmung angezeigt, die verfügbar ist. Solltet ihr die Notifications für Abstimmungen nicht ausgeschalten haben, erhaltet ihr bei jeder neuen Abstimmung eine Nachricht. Ihr werdet das hoffentlich morgen Abend testen können :)

5.: Sendeplan
 Ein Paar von euch möchten gerne sehen, welche Sendung aktuell läuft. Die Sache ist die, dass die App das sogar kann. Wenn euch langweilig ist, startet die App, drückt den Home-Button, verändert manuell eure Zeit im Smartphone und geht zurück in die App. Ihr werdet sehen, dass die Sendung im Sendeplan dementsprechend markiert ist. Das Problem ist aktuell, dass die API die Sendung bei Sendestart einfach entfernt. Max ist aber soweit ich weiß dran und wird das wieder ändern.

Dauerhaftes Abonnieren von Sendungen: 
War uns aktuell mit der Sendeplan-API so noch nicht möglich. Wird sich aber in der nächsten Zeit auch erweitern. Wir implementieren es, sobald es uns möglich ist :)

6.: YouTube Darstellung: 
Normalerweise solltet ihr oben rechts zwischen zwei Ansichten hin und her wechseln können. Außerdem könnt ihr mit der Suchen-Funktion jederzeit nach der gewünschten Show suchen. Falls es viele von euch zu unübersichtlich finden, werden wir weitere Ansichten einbauen :)

7.: Unterstützen 
Uns war es leider in der restlich verbliebenen Zeit nicht mehr möglich das PayPal SDK zu verwenden. Wird aber auch kommen. Deswegen werdet ihr momentan zur Webseite weitergeleitet, auf der ihr dann über Umwege auf PayPal gelangt. Zusätzlich wurden keine In-App Käufe implementiert, da Google 30% der Einnahmen davon für sich behält.

8.: Tablet-Layout: Wird kommen :)

9.: Widget für den Sendeplan Kommt auch.

So, das war's erst Mal von meiner Seite. Haut hier einfach eure Fehler rein, wir versuchen sie so schnell wie möglich zu verbessern.

Ansonsten viel Spaß mit der App :) 
Viele Grüße

I really want a T450, but I'm not sure if I'm able to get the version with the 940M in the US. I'm currently in Taiwan, and they're selling the model with the i5-5200U + 940M for 39,990 NTD which comes out to roughly 1292 USD. 

Not sure if the price is reasonable or not, if it's a bit overpriced I may just go with the E440 or something.

It wasnt just because the film is produced by David Camerons one time roommate and fellow Etonian Peter Czernin, though youd think that didnt help. Dame Judi Dench has disclosed that she receives begging letters from kids who cant afford the cost of drama school training. Horrified, they panic and bar the door, despite the landlord being seriously hurt. In this sense, acting is a microcosm of Britain, one of the worlds most sclerotic, class bound societies. Their president, James, who is about to leave university, is falling out of love with the club and promises the suspicious landlord Chris and his waitress daughter Rachel that he will keep things under control. Inspired by his godfather Jeremy, a former Riot Club member and now a Tory, Guy tries to impress the boys with a ten bird roast.

One way of addressing it would be if we stopped making films about posh people starring posh people and produced by posh people. But what made Posh bad drama for Billington made it good politics certainly if youre of a socialist persuasion why dramatise the decency of the posh when we, if only figuratively, should be strangling George Osborne with Boris Johnsons entrails? As the members get more drunk and rowdy their bullying of each other and of Chris and Rachel gets worse. The play, at least, was timely: it was staged just as that elite was about to become the government and put its collective foot more firmly on the throat of the poor than previous administrations.

3bvggw,7,2015-07-02,Are they all seriously this immature?,Asari_Lover,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/3bvggw/are_they_all_seriously_this_immature/,"I apologize in advance if this thread seems to lack anything contributing to MGTOW. I have very few guy friends these days and few others to discuss this with; I hope you guys are tolerant to my venting and somethings can be gleaned from this.

For the past few months I've been talking to a few female friends on the side for entertainment and to delve into the female psyche (a horrible place). They are remarkably easy to probe once you've staunchly told them you have no desire to sleep with them. Most especially so if they see you already have someone, and more so if the woman you are with is prettier than them; they seem willing to reveal anything you ask in order to capture your attention. Well after these few months I can almost certainly say the modern woman is the most unapologetic group of people on the planet. Here are the highlights of my most dishonorable encounters.

The four that stood out the greatest recently are an 18yr old college student from Cali, a 24yr old businesswoman from Spain, a 25yr old assistant manager at a hotel, and a 40yr old building inspector in Wales. I will not mention any girls I encountered who were bellow age since I then bolted immediately (fake ID's are deceiving lads)

The 18yr old, Lizzie, is a young, petite blonde with a noticeably low image of self worth despite being a rather attractive 7. After she learned I was a college graduate and a black guy which was an admitted fetish for her she spilled some of the dirtiest crap I'd heard in years. A foster child, to her own delight she was sexually abused by her foster grandfather at the age of 13 along with her best friend and was apparently shared among his group of buddies for years with video evidence she's offered to show me in exchange for visiting her and receiving oral sex from her. (she and many women swear receiving head isn't cheating) Since she was 14 she's had sex with many of her teachers and groups of school jocks along with her friends up through high school getting into a university with utterly abysmal math skills. She also regularly slept with the family dog at her grandpa's urging while he filmed and she plans to get another. One of her life goals after college is to have a daughter and apparently raise her with the same happiness she'd been given at her age. (she doesn't know who the father would be) Overall, she's a well mannered girl while rather air headed but I pity that she doesn't realize how much she's debased herself.

The 24yr old, Monica, I met from Spain. She's an extremely athletic girl with abs and strong muscles while curvy and tall and is easily a 9 - worse she knows it. I've not spoken to her in half a year now but last we talked she wanted to organize a gangbang with a girlfriend of her's (who's 15, from South Africa and lost her virginity to her single dad at 12) and even asked if I wanted to get them pregnant. To my disgust she gloated of going to a club last we spoke and getting drilled in her arse by 5 bouncers in a row in the men's restroom.

Second up, the 25 yr old, Amanda. When I met Amanda she was working as a maid at a hotel for the past 2 years and utterly loved her job. She's cute, fiesty and made lavish tips by offering extra services to her clients and her boss. Before she made assistant manager last month her last foray was giving a discount to 5 travelling college studs by giving them a challenge: if all 5 of them could make her climax before they did she'd let them have the room half off. Apparently after 30mins in her office and 2 hours after work they got the discount. Disgustingly, she used no condoms (notice a pattern?) and allowed internal discharges as it was purportedly, ""my safe day."" To her aggravation she's not had sex for two months as the managerial position keeps her busy which perturbs her greatly. She's since begged me for dick pics in exchange for nudes she has online and I've warned her of throwing away her reputation and modesty so easily leading her to call me, ""a buzzkill sometimes."" She's not stopped asking for dick pics offering to send me shots of her cunny and offers sex when I refuse.

Lastly, and perhaps the worst, the 40yr old married woman, Isobel. I've known this woman approaching 2 years now but since she's overseas we'll never meet. When I met her she was 39 and dissatisfied with her marriage to a workaholic husband, so much so she admitted without any shame that she's had extra marital sex with no joke, hundreds of guys. She's claims to have 3-5 men a week when possible and tries to have groups whenever she can. On New Years she vowed to double her number and had a man enter her the exact second the ball dropped and for her birthday a man managed to organize 40 men take her in a trailer for 3 days; apparently they filmed it but ""lost"" the digital copies. She is infertile so allows these blokes to take her with no condoms and as far as I know will not say no to anyone. She's gloatingly slept with carnival workers on the rides after closing hours, had sex on trains with multiple commuters, slept with bar goers while on the phone with her mother, screwed half her husband's golf buddies in their home, was bent over by her young intern and his two friends for weeks, got steamrolled by a semi-pro rugby team (20guys I think), and last week was gangraped by 8 thugs for three hours absolutely loving it. She goes very into detail if you ask her too.

My disgust for her peaked when she was masturbating with a man on camera while babysitting her twin 14yr old godsons when he convinced her to call them in and take their virginity while he watched. They stayed over for two days having sex with her any chance they could while her husband was in the bedroom over. She has since then started sexting with them and allows them to call the shots whenever they visit her bedroom. They also took pics of her and the next week invited 9 of their buddies over, all underage, and she obliged each of them as well for as long and as much as they wanted alternating between her and playstation equally. She has no idea how much danger she's putting all these boys and their families in as well as a prison sentence.

This week made me blow my lid with anger in no way I'd ever felt for a woman I wasn't interested in. After 2 years of knowing her she told me she gets tested regularly so that she can sleep with guys using no protection. I asked her how regularly and she said enough. After more probing she told me... brace yourselves... twice a year. Bruvs, I was steaming. She gave me this look as though she could not figure out what had my face looking like I saw someone get executed. I then asked her how in the fuck she could sleep with approaching a thousand men and young boys and not get tested more often than twice a damn year. Her reply was, ""I can't manage to get tested every week."" Yet, she could manage to filled in by half a dozen or more guys every week. I only replied that she get tested as often as she has sex, saying, ""What with your lifestyle."" She replied, ""ok bye."", and the conversation was over.

Gentlemen, bruvs, after meeting these kinds of women of all nationalities, ages, and levels of education I cannot for the life of me ever want to provide for a woman less so than I did when I first came here. Without any hatred for women I can say 90% of modern females in this world are walking petridishes from as young as puberty. If you encourage them you're thirsty, if you lecture them you're a buzzkill, if you're indifferent they will eff your lights out. I think once I'm 30 I'm going to stick to porn and perhaps befriend a high class escort into discounts. If you read this far thanks for letting me vent guys, I need to get more male friends in my life as I'm done with these walking receptacles with pretty faces.

TL;DR A bunch of women I know from across the globe sleep with stadium fulls of men their whole lives, regret none of it, and want seconds and thirds.

EDIT: Thanks all for listening to this rather laughable rant now that I read it again and have significantly resigned that these sorts of women I found are far far from normal and merely from the lowest cesspits imaginable. As an update, I stopped talking to the 40yr old Welsh woman since I can hardly stomach her behavior or disrepect to her husband. The 18yr old and I haven't spoken in 2 weeks and I I believe seeing that video of hers is far far from a good idea considering the horrendous crud she claims to be on it. The only one of those four I still associate with regularly is the 25yr old assistant manager since she's been abstinent for 2 months now though she's rather stale when talking about anything other than sex so that may not last long. Again, a hardy thanks to the MGTOW community for generally giving this thread a chance and giving me a good revelation about the sorts of areas I like to haunt. I've since put in greater effort at the gym nearly hitting my target goal early, studying finances and investments, and looking for positive companionship with both males and females that build personal improvement rather than indulging in muck. Cheers, bruvs."

Some performances literally only happen because the movie needs a flashier way to have people sing at each other. Elsewhere, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins return as Talk apella judges and double down on their over the top banter, trading barbs about Jews and the fact that no one cares about Koreans. Pitch Perfect 2 picks up three years after the first movie. While certainly not a wholesale ripoff, fans of the original know that thats pretty much what happens. Now I need to backtrack and watch the first one. Its bigger, louder, stuffed to the brim with guest stars, and really not as much fun. If you step even a toe outside of the films bubble of absurdity, youll find yourself asking: What am I really getting out of Packers linebacker Clay Matthews singing Bootylicious? Of course, we all know that they will in the end, but the actual getting there is formula by now. The film makes a vague attempt to treat its central characters like human beings, mostly by focusing on what comes next for them in a post Bellas world. Since most of the Bellas are college seniors, theyll all have to face the real world eventually. Pitch Perfect was always absurd, and it reveled in it. With the world championships on the horizon in Copenhagen, Denmark, the women must get their act together for their one and only shot at redemption. Its like the first movie, shocked it became a sleeper hit, basically went, Holy shit, that worked? Key, as a no nonsense, high maintenance producer, is about as real as the film gets, and hes a hilarious breath of fresh air.

I know, its like I broke the law or something. Beca, already on her way to becoming a music producer, starts an internship at a studio headed up by Keegan Michael Key. For instance, Chrissie Fit, who plays new Bella Florencia Fuentes, is turned into one long, terrible joke about about the plight of murdered women in Latin America, a problem her fellow Bellas just sort of nod at. The movie doesnt let the characters dwell on the future for too long, though. If you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please with it instead. If you enjoyed the first one, you will certainly enjoy the sequel. All seems well until a botched Lincoln Center performance for the president leads to a scandal that strips them of their performing duties, causing internal tension and strife. In going big, Pitch Perfect 2 forgets how to be funny. SEE ALSO : So without further ado, here is the Pitch Perfect Two trailer in all its damn fine glory. The Barden Bellas, at the top of their game as Barden Universitys premier all girl a capella group, is giving a special performance for Barack and Michelle Obama at Lincoln Center. Obviously by winning an international a capella competition that no American has ever won before, thats how. Pitch Perfect 2 just isnt very good at pretending its anything more than fan service, and its often not great at even that. Pitch Perfect 2 is a lesson in why too much of a good thing can be bad.

While just a jot less fun than its predecessor, Pitch Perfect 2 is a worthy sequel in tone, even if the story feels padded with a few too many montages.

Fat Amy and the team are back for round two of Pitch Perfect and we cannot wait for it to get down here to Australia. Yes, share my data Please don t share my data. It aint perfect, but its fun the kind of teen movie that wears its love of Top 40 pop and 80s underdog fantasies on its sleeve. No expense has been spared, from wardrobe to talent to the numerous set pieces, but it only serves to dress up the fact that, plot wise, weve been there and done that. Its the kid in chorus who got a standing ovation last year, and decided to pile on the sequins to make a bigger splash at this years big performance, all without actually improving on her voice. I walked out of the theater thinking maybe campy singing underdog movies arent really meant for long running series.

3bvmfw,1,2015-07-02,"Me [21 F] with my internship boss [40's F] of a few weeks, don't know how to bring up various concerns of mine regarding the unpaid internship and me being ""free labor"".",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bvmfw/me_21_f_with_my_internship_boss_40s_f_of_a_few/,"Hi r/relationships. I need help trying to figure out how to approach a situation with my boss at my unpaid internship...Before I can get to the root of the problem, I'm going to give a little background information.

BACKGROUND:
I (21F) am a 4th year undergrad at my state university. I'm a part of the Honor's College there, and prior to graduation, the Honor's College requires that students participate in something called a ""senior project"" which is usually an internship. Around February 2015, while I was looking for internships relating to my major (Biology), I reached out to ""Organization SC"" during my search, as the founder (40's F) expressed that they were searching for an intern at their summer science camp. Our emails went back and forth for a few weeks, I had an interview, and then did not hear back from them for several months. I considered it a lost cause. During that time, I reached out to my advisers at the Honors College, and they told me that if I don't find an internship, I can fulfill the requirement by simply doing an extra semester of research. I was relieved because I found my backup plan. Then, around May, I received another email from them saying that they would like me to come in and meet their directors and staff. I went in, met with them, and then a week later I got the official email with my offer, which I signed and returned to them. 

When I was first emailing the administrator of Organization SC, I expressed my desire to work at a specific location, and they said that the position at that location was available. I wanted to work there because it is only about 10 minutes away from my home, and if I'm doing an full-time unpaid internship, then I'd like to not drive too far. Then, during my phone interview, the other founder (40's M) told me that lunch would be provided to the kids and to staff. Cool, I don't have to worry about packing lunch every day. Finally, I was told that while this was an unpaid internship, I would be eligible for receiving a stipend at the end of the internship for between $500-$1000 *depending on my performance*. Cool.

So before Camp started, we received an email about the location that we would be working at, and to my surprise it was a location about 30 minutes away (Once camp started, I found out that there wasn't a location at that area close to my home). I did NOT want to drive that far, that was not what I had been told. I ranted a bit to my mother, who told me, ""This is only for two months. This is an excellent opportunity for you to make connections. Don't worry about gas. We'll take care of it."" Which is true. My boss (the founder 40's F) built this organization from the ground up, is very intelligent, and has many connections across many different science-related areas. If I expressed a desire to meet someone in a certain field, I am certain that she would help me and do what she could to make that happen. 

So camp is about two weeks in currently, and I'm getting a bit exhausted driving 30 minutes here, working with 25 kids for 8 hours, and then driving 30 minutes back home. I also learned that camp would not be providing lunch to the kids or staff. One more piece of misinformation I was given. So basically, I'm working a full-time job without any compensation at the moment. I'm not a lazy person. I have a good work ethic. In my opinion, I go above and beyond my duties and do more than the other Assistant Counselors. In my head, I wanted to do the best I could so that I would receive the maximum amount of compensation, but at this point, I'm wondering if that is even worth it. The other two Assistant Counselors do less work than I do, but are making $10/hr. Which, at the end of the two-month period, means they will have earned about $3k. Even if I get the maximum amount of the stipend, it means I'm only being paid 1/3 the amount of the Assistant Counselors who have the same responsibilities as I do. For a college student, this is a sizable sum of money. 

I'm extremely frustrated at the moment, and I really want to try to fix this situation, but I can't help but feel that I put myself in this hole. I went into this internship knowing I wouldn't be paid, only finding out later that I might get a stipend. I justified not being paid by thinking I'd only have to drive 10 minutes away to a location close to me and receiving lunch there. I feel like I'm being used as free labor. I feel like my boss justifies this in her head by spending more time with me than with the others. When we're together we talk about my plans for the future, different opportunities, etc. She's advising me and giving me ideas on where I could go after I graduate in a few months, but I feel as if these interactions don't make up for the fact that I'm not being paid appropriately for my time. Not to mention, I don't *need* this internship. I could just continue my work under my research professor next semester.

I'm worried about bringing up the location issue because I don't want her to just compensate me for gas and end the conversation. I want to talk about changing my position entirely, so I'm not an ""intern"" anymore. I don't even think the ""intern"" title matters because I have the same responsibilities as the others! Recently, one of the directors quit, so I know that there is extra money hanging around that would have been her salary. I just don't know how to bring this up because I get really clammy during confrontations. I also don't want to bring tension between us because I know that she would be a good connection to have in my near future...How do I talk to her?

**tl;dr**: I'm working at an unpaid internship with a stipend at the end. I have the same responsibilities as the others, but I am only getting 1/3 of the amount of the money that they get. I have been lied to about the location at which I would be working and receiving lunch there. I want to bring this up to my boss, without raising too much tension because she would be an excellent connection to have in my near future, post-graduation. I don't want to be an ""intern"" anymore if it means I'm getting paid less for the same work. How do I talk to her?"

Backstory:

Right now I'm a 20 y/o college student. After graduating from high school in Puerto Rico, I first went to school at College For Creative Studies in Detroit where I was offered a $24k scholarship to get a degree in ""Entertainment Arts in Video"" but after attending the college for a year I felt I was still overpaying by way too much (almost $25k in loans) for the amount of film classes I was taking (1 film class and 4 art classes and 1 English class), in the 1 film class I had we learned basic terms and editing techniques and did barely 2-3 short films in the whole year. I decided to leave the school and attend a cheaper community college near Washington, DC where I would study all the good ol' basic classes like Math, English, French 101's, etc. The plan was I'd stay there for two years then receive a degree in ""General Studies"", then get a guaranteed transfer into another University where I would spend 2 more years in their film program which would end up costing me around the same price as my first college I went to in Detroit! Having to spend this last year in the community college with absolutely no camera gear, no film geeks, no film projects, and the worse of all, no editing, has made me feel completely out of touch, rusty, and sad. In Detroit I at least had other aspiring film makers I could go out with and explore abandoned buildings, jump on trains, and do crazy stuff for the sake of short films. Now I have no film student friends, no gear, and have replaced the time I used to spend editing/filming with CS:GO and working 5-6 days a week at a restaurant.


I am not an academic student, I am a hands-on learner and rather work and sweat my ass off doing 10-12 hour days 7 days a week in the field or be facing a computer screen full of raw footage for 8 hours instead of having to take an academic aproach to film. Is there a way I can learn filmmaking hands on for way less money? I've looked into other schools/academies that are hand on but they would also cost me damn arm and leg. I feel like I'm wasting my money on film school and even worse I feel like I'm wasting my time. It has taken a major toll on my health not knowing what to do. Most of my family members and in Puerto Rico and they're supporting me emotionally but I cannot turn to them for advice.


I want to dip my foot in the water in the filmmaking world but I have no idea how to which is killing me slowly. I don't want to be a hollywood filmmaker. My one true love is editing but my mistress is filming. I want to shoot documentaries or journalist type short films like the ones on Vice News, just thinking about being able to go out and film something as insane as [this in Nigeria](https://youtu.be/nNIT9Dn_Rjk?t=16) gets me motivated and pumped up, I'd do it for free! I want to capture adventures, put myself in awkward uncomfortable situations, even risk my life for an amazing piece of footage. Don't get me wrong I know this doesn't just fall on my lap, I know I have to work hard for it and I am abosolutely ready to do so. I'm willing to be the assistants assistant or work in a set and do what I have to do before getting to the good stuff but if I can avoid the academic approach and the debt I'm game! I JUST WANT TO LEARN!

_________________________________

**So here are my questions:**


* Are internship programs looking for film school students only? I'd extremely ecstatic to be able work for free with a tiny company even if I was just the coffee boy, I just want to be there, I want to see a crew doing some shoots but is it possible without having any connections? 


* Does an applicant with a Degree outweigh an applicant with good skills/experience but does not have a Degree?


* I'm not sure on where to live. I'm open to moving to Cali, Miami, Colorado, New York, literally anywhere that can help me achieve my goals. I have been a nomad all my life and I'm ready for a challenge. Any suggestions?


* Am I completely wrong? Is a film school or film academy the way to go?



**Also one camera gear question:**

* I have about $2,000.00 saved up + some liquidable things I can get another $1,500.00+ for and I still have another month or two left of 6 days a week workdays to earn money for. I really wanted to go to New Zealand later this summer but I need to get my priorities in check and get camera gear. Should I seperate $500-$600 to build a decent PC and use the rest on a DSLR w/ gear? Right now I have a 13' MacBook Pro which constantly lags and stutters with any 15 minutes+ of footage and the Disk in a constant struggle of being full despite having a 1TB external hard drive.

""Shoot."" I said, blinking out of the Mirror conference I was replaying. Our projects up north were proceeding apace, and Chief Minister Wang was handling the territory well. He might be the North's first premier if he played his cards right. 

""We got nothing. No clandestine drug problem, no sex scandal, no anti-social habits. As far as we can tell, he didn't even smoke weed at uni."" 

""Bullshit."" I said. ""The man was involved in the Bengheli Affair. You mean to tell me we've got nothing on a man whose mates were taking money from the italian mafia and snorting coke off the tits of human trafficked sex slaves.""  Matt shrugged. 

""ICAC dug it up pretty good Ned. Griffiths didn't take any bribes, and while the bastard certainly knew what was happening, we can't prove it. Worse, that shit went public a decade ago Ned. It'll help if we bring up fresh dirt, but until then it's just old news."" 

""Surely there's something from his university days, a facebook or myspace status, blog post, anything."" I said. 

""There's a few crass teenaged comments and quotes in there, but nothing story worthy and nothing inconsistent with his current position on record."" I deflated. 

""Mark, Close the door and move the meeting with Ian Mcallen back by a quarter of an hour.""  I said. ""Sarah, stop hanging back next to Howard's ghastly cricket bats, come up to the desk.""

Sarah was 3 years out of university, came up outside partisan lines. It was part of the reason why I had her in my office, the woman had only ever worked for me. Matt had been in parliament longer than most MPs, and made the best chief of staff I could hope for. 

""Alright then people plan B."" I said with a sigh. 

""I suppose entrapment is out of the question."" Matt ventured.

""Too many moving parts, and too many unknowns."" I said. ""Griffith's been playing the game for the past 22 years. If we can't find him doing something unscrupulous in that period of time, the chances of us baiting him into doing it are slim to none, and the chance of something getting back to the press if we try is too high."" I sighed. 

""What about a Leak then."" Sarah said. I paused. 

""How?"" 

""We've got plenty of damaging material on hand to leak. That Department of Border Protection's Green Paper on revitalising off shore detention due to the expected influx if the Hong Kong situation blows up, surely there's something in the Cabinet minutes."" 

""Leaks are political fire, Sarah."" Matt replied, his voice low. ""Between cabinet solidarity and diffusion of responsibility we'd be just as likely to cop the blame if anything came out. And the last thing we need in the current climate is government weakness, not with the polls so close."" 

""We're talking about removing a minister and defanging a substantial faction within the party, Matt. There's no way to do that without breaking some eggs. Cabinet minutes are out of the question, those things are locked up tight and there's no way we could leak it securely or plausibly, and the Green Paper would be seen to be reflective of the entire government. What else have you got Sarah."" She grasped for a moment. 

""The National Security Committee minutes.""

""Same Problem as the Cabinet-"" I began. 

""Not the closed minutes, the individual policy reports, the hearings, preliminary findings and internal memos. King is on the Committee too, and he's Griffith's creature, we get two birds with one stone."" 

""What do you think Matt."" I said into the resulting silence. 

""I still don't like it. We get one thing wrong and the Media will skin us alive and we'll come out this mess worse off than Griffiths and labour all the better for it."" I nodded. 

""Alright Sarah, this is your op. Get us at least two layers of proxies, find some fresh faced uni intern that will ""accidentally"" stumble upon some choice, carefully curated documents, and see if we can set the stage in the press as much as possible without showing our hand. Matt see if you can give her a hand on the latter."" 

""Finally, this stays in the Black. Period. We can't afford any opsec fuck ups here. Understood?"" Sarah nodded. The show wasn't for Matt, he knew the state of the game. 

""Alright. I want this package as an option on the table within two weeks. Next time Griffiths makes an unpopular statement on refugee or national security policies, i want to be able to knock the son of a bitch over.""

Three years. Three fucking years. He claimed to be my friend. Broke up my previous relationship. Gave me herpes. We went through an abortion. I gave up an internship in Australia because he didn't think long distance was a good idea. I didn't finish my degree with one class to spare because I ran out of money living in an expensive place to be with him. We went through so much together. He pierced his dick for me for fucks sake.

He made me a part of his family. He said I made him happy. That I was everything he looked for in a partner. That I was funny and beautiful and nerdy and fun and independent and confident and amazing in bed. He said he loved me and I was the most important person in his life. We were planning our lives. We made plans ten years in the future. I gave him everything. 

And a few days after an amazing weekend together he texts me to tell me he doesn't love me anymore. That I've gotten too fat and depressed, he's not attracted to me anymore. That he wants to be single so he can do better. He took back every nice thing he ever said to me and then cut me out of his life. He made it very clear that I didn't matter to him at all. 

It's been a month. I can't stop crying. I can't stop screaming into my pillow as I fall asleep. I can't look in a mirror without wanting to vomit. He was my best friend and... I feel like her never loved me. Like everything he said was a lie. And I gave up so much for nothing. I haven't eaten more than 500 calories a day in weeks. 

I wish I could erase these memories. Because before he broke up with me he was so kind and loving. Said he would always find me attractive and that I didn't need to lose the weight when I told him I was worried. Just lie after beautiful lie. It's so painful. Everything he said was bullshit. 

This guy hit on me in a bar last night and I laughed when he said I was hot. I don't think I'll ever trust anything anyone says anymore. 

The worst part was when he said he wasn't attracted to my body... I said ""I'm not attracted to it either."" And then told him I would do anything he wanted to change. I am so fucking pathetic. I hate myself. How did I become this person?

I'm a student that lives in Kentucky. I signed a lease 2 weeks ago that begins on July 15th. I signed it with my girlfriend so both my name and her name are on the lease. 

I was just offered an internship at NASA (my dream job), and I'm now obviously interested in breaking the lease. My girlfriend, however, does not want to break the lease.

The original plan was that I was going to live in the apartment in the fall and then she would live in it in the spring. Now, I won't be there at all for the entire year, but she still wants it in the spring. 

As far as I see it, our options are to either sublet the apartment for the fall and then she'll take it over again in the spring or we can terminate the lease early and pay the associated fees. 

Are landlords ever understanding in situations like this and willing to offer a better deal than the lease demands? (My lease states that I have to pay rent until they find someone else to rent the place). I only just signed the lease 2 weeks ago and neither me nor my girlfriend have any way of living there at all for the fall (the place would be empty for 5 months). I wasn't expecting an offer (I didn't even apply for the fall) but I can't turn down the offer. 

The other option is having me terminate my lease but have her keep her name on it while we find a sublet. I don't want to be financially responsible at all for a place that I won't be living in at all. Would most landlords allow someone to terminate a lease if someone else was still on it?

Thank you. I hope this makes sense. Mostly looking for some advice on how to save the most money (I have very little since I usually rely on a scholarship to pay for housing and won't be getting it since I'll be interning instead). "

After all, hadn t I made a little video of him, chewing up his mouse? The bobkitten had, in fact, been put down. I m an artist and writer who lives in the Appalachian foothills of Ohio. For instance, I ve raised three beautiful brown thrashers to from Day 9 to release this summer, but I didn t blog them, first because, feeding them every half hour, then every hour, I didn t have time to, and second because I was afraid they might not all make it. My fear may seem irrational, but it was very, very real to me, and I grappled with it, pacing in circles as I made phone calls trying to figure out the right thing to do for Bobkit. Take it off the state threatened list, and it s time to hunt it. Everything about it was fun except that little call to the home phone. The would be photographer felt horrible about this, and offered to wait out a 28 day quarantine, but by then, if the kittten were rabid, she could be dead. I m happy to say that the thrashers are healthy and sleek and strong and have been free for over a week and are lighting up our lives, hanging around the yard, still swooping in for handouts. It could so easily have happened to me. At the same time, I knew I had to go through the proper official channels for this state threatened species, so I steeled myself and made the call. It was just a rotten thing all the way around, and I m sure nobody felt and continues to feel worse about it than that poor woman with the bitten hand. And now here I am in Ohio, 22 years later, and I see bobcat sign often enough that I ve added it to the Frequently Encountered list in my mind s encyclopedia. You re going to have to be vewwy, vewwy smart, vewwy, vewwy quiet, and vewwy, vewwy wucky. With this blog, I hope to show what happens when you make room in your life, every day, for the things that bring you joy.

Which I had given him so he d have a meal for the road. I remember when I worked for The Nature Conservancy in Connecticut climbing a rock ledge to look at a bobcat den area. After I got over my initial shock and anguish, I realized that that could well have been me with the horrible dilemma and the holes in my hand. Turn your sound up, so you don t miss the oink of contentment as he lands gently on the tarmac of love. I m starting to lose track of the animals I ve seen. I think in another epoch, I d have been sitting around a fire, telling stories. Let s e last one I saw was December 15, 2014, a small one feeding at a deer carcass, making seven for Ohio, if you count the trailcam female in the driveway in July 2014 as seen. I was so thrilled that everything seemed to be going OK. He lunged and grabbed her hand and he would not let go, because he was a wild bobcat, and he thought she was taking away his food. Heartbreak aside, I am convinced that here in Ohio at least we are in the midst of a bobcat renaissance such as has never been seen. She opened his carrier and reached in to move the mouse, and the bobkitten took exception to that. And nobody should get anywhere near a wild bobcat with bare hands, because bobcats are like honey badgers, whether they re adorable and tiny or big and brawny. Thank you for your kind and empathetic responses to the last bobcat post. Whiplash: a hallmark of my life and, it seems, this blog. So maybe you ll see them here before too long. I cried for most of the rest of that day that I got the call, and still felt like I d been hit by a truck the next morning. Or maybe the world will just keep sweeping me along with new things to write about, and I ll save them for the next book. Parkersburg WV 32101 Phone: Quite the mixed bag lately, from the fun of scamming Scammy straight to bobcat heartbreak. The only way you can test for rabies is to look at brain tissue. Maybe you get that diet wrong, and they don t do well. I ve even seen a black one, a stump tailed summer wonder racing across my. As usual, I m smart, but not smart enough. It is a strange story, and there s more to it than just OOH and AHH. I d keep all those cavepeople coming back night after night for a nice installment of How I Outsmarted the Cave Bear and Lived to Tell the Tale. So many kind thoughts, so many dear people all aching right along with me. To my immense relief, my kind county wildlife officer showed up the next morning to pick up the kitten, then transfer him to an intern who would drive him to a regional ODNR office, from which he d then be taken to Ohio s only qualified bobcat rehabilitator in Lake County, up. It was like being allowed to open the case and handle a Faberge egg. So I went on a 7.6 mile run/lope down Dean s Fork today, and it was all so beautiful and wild and heartening that I was finally OK with having to tell you that the bobkitten I took in will not be coming back to Indigo Hill for release. I have had a lot to process and come to terms with. He was very kind and very sorry to have to tell me that my worst fears had been realized. It s taken me awhile to get to a place from which I can write this post. This is why I sometimes wind up not blogging about some of the best things, because I don t want to have everyone fall in love with some creature, and then be crushed when things don t end so well. The minute I had that cat in my care, I went into a 36 hour panic attack about the possibility that it might be euthanized. A Keystone Cop surround with blaring sirens and kleig lights would have been even nicer, but at least I wasted Scammy s time. "

TRAILER Pitch Perfect runs 115 minutes and is Rated PG 13 for innuendo and language. The as yet untitled Spider Man standalone arrives in theaters July 28, 2017. One of the biggest developments coming our way is the introduction of a new Spider Man, who already has a solo film set for 2017. We felt we havent seen that as much in the movies, and were excited about that. The original, based on author Mickey Rapkins true story tale of three collegiate a cappella groups in Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory, was helmed by Broadway go to director Jason Moore and went on to earn the respect of a cappella fans, critics, and comedy lovers alike. Hana Mae Lees Lilly Onakuramara is back with another set of bizarre one liners whispered under her breath and the jokes land but the same cannot be said of Florencia Flo Fuentes Chrissie Fit. Where the original film blended romantic comedy, musical numbers, and a tale of self discovery, Pitch Perfect 2 isnt as inspired  affording the core Bellas only minor development this round much of which rehashes ideas from its predecessor while relying on cheap laughs to fill time between a cappella performances. Let us know what you thought of the film in the comment section below. Its worth pointing out that Drew Goddard isnt mentioned here, though that doesnt necessarily mean anything since no one has been confirmed. Vincent Jason Moore Pitch Perfect Jared Hess Napoleon Dynamite and John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Asa Butterfield and Tom Hollard are still believed to be the frontrunners for the role. None are particularly known for their action work. The pair offer worthwhile juxtaposition, given that Beca was a reluctant recruit three years back and is now preparing to leave the Barden nest. Levine and Melfi are the favorites, Francis Daley and Goldstein are still in the mix and Cop Car helmer Jon Watts is now in contention. All of the filmmakers are known for comedy or dramedy and quite a few of them have experience with coming of age tales. Brittany Snow, Anna Kendrick, and Rebel Wilson in Pitch Perfect 2. The rest of the cast is a hit or miss mix. Bumper Adam Devine with the Tone Hangers in Pitch Perfect 2 Pitch Perfect 2 will sate its target audience though that audience may have trouble sharing the movie with casual comedy lovers. Certain viewers will be glad to see support characters get more screen time but, instead of centering entirely on Beca, Pitch Perfect 2 sees Anna Kendrick sharing the spotlight with Hailee Steinfeld who plays Emily Junk, a freshman and legacy Bella, eager for a place in the group. Original story follows: reports that Marvel and Sony are moving quickly and could make a decision by mid May. The film was a cross demographic hit resulting in high expectations for its 2015 sequel. Tour stops are given to a rival singing team from Germany: Das Sound Machine. All names, trademarks and images are copyright their respective owners. Banks shows slightly less restraint than her predecessor, especially with regard to Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy. Meanwhile, were still waiting to hear about casting for the new Spider Man as well. Viewers who enjoyed Pitch Perfect for its biting wit, more than its slick musical mash ups, will find the followup offers less cross demographic appeal; instead, Pitcher Perfect 2 aims for a bigger and more outrageous experience with an even better soundtrack for established Bella groupies. Get all the latest on the Spider Man director after the jump. UPDATE : From the above list, which originally ran on May 5, Moore and Hess are now out. Thanks to a downright hilarious performance from Keegan Michael Key playing Becas boss and, by extension, Shawn Carter Peterson  as abused intern Dax. Pitch Perfect 2 will sate its target audience though that audience may have trouble sharing the movie with casual comedy lovers. According to a new report, names on the Spider Man director short list include Jonathan Levine 50/50 Ted Melfi St. Yet, characters, stories, and comedic setup/payoff is not as refined this time individual arcs have only fleeting impact on the overarching story resulting in a movie that simply doesnt have the heart or polished humor of its predecessor. Marking the feature directorial debut of actor turned filmmaker Elizabeth Banks, delivers bigger musical numbers and zanier comedy beats making it a must see for die hard fans of the original. But look for the webslinger to appear in the MCU sometime before that, probably in next years Captain America: Civil War. Nationals, the Barden University Bellas are at the top of their game. Anna Kendrick and Hailee Steinfeld in Pitch Perfect 2. Following three consecutive championship wins at the a cappella U.S. We preview Comic Con 2015, discuss the casting of Tom Holland in the Spider Man reboo. That said, even if Becas character is less defined this round, a side arc that sees the aspiring musician interning at a record label provides some of the films biggest laughs. All of the names fit nicely with Kevin Feiges earlier comments about wanting to play up Spideys famous sense of humor in the upcoming reboot. Led by Beca Mitchell Anna Kendrick now in her senior year, and Chloe Beale Brittany Snow now in her fourth senior year, the Bellas put their lives on hold to travel across the country on a victory tour, with a stop at the Kennedy Center, where the group performs for President Barack Obama along with. Faced with harmonic dissonance and an uncertain future after graduation, the Bellas are given one final chance at redemption: set aside their differences and win at the global a cappella championship where Das Sound Machine is heavily favored to take home the top prize. In particular, the Das Sound Machine crew manages to pull double duty: as a thematic mirror for the Bellas and genuinely entertaining a cappella performers. Still, moviegoers who are invested in the characters will, at the very least, find charming moments in the ongoing adventures of Beca, Chloe, and Fat Amy even if there isnt as much substance. The names listed above are all said to be serious contenders, but they arent necessarily the only ones in the mix. Keys energetic banter is a highlight, especially with Kendrick serving as his comedy straight man, producing several amusing exchanges. Nevertheless, paper thin character arcs hold the core plot back, turning the Pitch Perfect 2 story into a cliff noted drama punctuated by electrifying musical sets. Fortunately, a few more returning faces, Treblemakers Jesse Swanson Skylar Astin and Benji Applebaum Ben Platt new rivals Das Sound Machine led by Pieter Krämer  Flula Borg and Kommissar Birgitte Hjort Srensen as well as cameos from Katey Sagal, David Cross, Snoop Dogg, and members of the redacted, furnish keen instigators for the main Bella cast. That is almost as troublesome to the bad guys hes fighting, as his webs and agility. Asa Butterfield was said to be the frontrunner, but he was just one of several young actors on a list that also included Tom Holland, Timothee Chalamet, and Liam James. "
3bwixw,5,2015-07-02,Alone in another Country,ThunderCake27,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/3bwixw/alone_in_another_country/,"I'm fortunate to have friends, people I can have fun with and laugh, even though I'm always the joke, atleast I get distracted. For an internship I moved to the Netherlands, I could have chosen my home country for it.. But I craved a way out of everyday monotony, maybe a new beginning you know?

I now realise I was being far too optimistic. Now everyone is far away, even my family. I've had a lot of trouble in the past, since I've dealt with social anxienty my entire teenage years. I'm mostly over that, but when that no longer stung.. I was overcome with loneliness. There had always been something missing in my life, I've tried to deal with it many ways, whether it was casual sex or sports, it never filled my emptiness. I just wish, I had someone with whom I can share my heart and my struggles, with someone where I didn't have to think about my every thought and sentence.

I'm now in another country, where my language is not spoken. I got a job, but no friends here. I just work all day and get home to nothing. I couldnt get over my pain at home.. How am I supposed to do it here?"
3bwm6z,10,2015-07-02,How MMOs and Yoga saved my life.,TheRaRaRaGod,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3bwm6z/how_mmos_and_yoga_saved_my_life/,"I've seen this subreddit linked around the internet a lot, and now that I finally got around to checking it out, I realized just how close to home these stories ran.


I thought I'd tell you about two events in my life that helped me cope with my family. I'm still in therapy, and I still have a cycle with my family that I slip back into from time to time, but I am improving. I'm getting stronger. I'm moving out next month. :)


All nit-picking comments that they do aside, my mom withholds food from me. When she sees me eating at the dinner table, she will take food away once I reach for something. She micromanages everything she can find in my life. Not only meals, but she will go as far as to tell me how to talk to people in public, loud enough for them to hear. Things like that are commonplace... I am twenty years old. 


I like to explain my father the way I do a health inspector at work: if he has not found anything to criticize, he is not doing his job. I told him that I had found a possible internship last week, and he proceeded to yell at me because I was not willing to drop the babysitting jobs, current job, and summer plans I had for a 1 month long internship... even though I told him that I had scheduled it for the winter break of school this year so I could dedicate more time to it. 


Anyway. I'm not really here to vent about that. I just want to paint a picture for you before I tell you how I cope with it.


There's a lot of stigma against the gaming community. They can be complicated and overwhelming if you are new to gaming. Most people don't understand them. We even use different acronyms and vocabulary. 


No one really talks about how you can make friends and a support system online. 


Because I was trying to distance myself from my family (I no longer eat meals with them or interact with them on social levels) I started playing games online. The people I became friends with were accessible and kind. I used to internalize everything they told me. I wanted to punish myself when my family told me I was fat. I used to want to punish myself when they told me I was not doing enough or that I was awkward around people. Not only the removal from them on a social level helped-- by playing games online-- but the company was overwhelmingly supportive.


I remember when I first hit top level and was out on my own. I was farming some mobs when other players came up and killed me. They warned me if I came back to that area, they'd kill me again. They meant it. I internalized the event and apologized to them. Meanwhile, my guildmates were wondering why I had just gone very quiet. They asked what was wrong and I apologized to them about the other players killing me. The leader immediately replied, ""What the hell? THEY killed YOU. Why are YOU apologizing?"" to which I stammered, ""I don't know."" He then sent out a raid invite to the entire guild. They moved in swiftly and annihilated the players that had pushed me out of my farming zone. The leader pulled me into a channel after all this died down and said, ""Hey. I didn't just do this because I wanted to make a statement about our guild. Yeah, I don't want people getting the idea that they can push us around, but I also want you to know that YOU shouldn't be pushed around. Stand up for yourself. If this happens again, I want you to tell them off and call us for backup.""


That was the first time that anyone ever offered to have my back. I worked really hard after that to stop internalizing what happened to me-- not only in game but with my family. I became bolder. I began to shut them down and ignore their punishments. I made it clear that if they did not change, they would lose me as their daughter.


To be honest, it has not improved much. But at the same time, I feel better about myself for it.


The other event I want to tell you about is how I got into yoga. I think the hardest thing to do-- especially with gaslighting and internalizing issues-- is to learn how to trust and love yourself. I was beginning to learn that by playing MMOs. MMOs taught me how to pick a fight and when to stand up. Yoga taught me how to relax and come back into my body.


In yoga there is this thing called ahimsa, which means no harm to the body and no harm to the mind. It has to do with your movement. You never want to hurt yourself in yoga. You want to stretch to your limit but never overdo it. This, along with scanning your body-- not your mind-- for things you can fix helped me motivate myself out of depression. By quieting my mind and focusing on my body and not taking yoga as an opportunity to criticize and damage my self esteem, I not only had the spitfire I need to cope, I also gained a reservoir of things I liked about myself to draw from when I needed to remind myself of the good in my life outside of my current situation.


I hope this helps anyone going through a hard time. I just thought I'd tell my story. :)


Peace and love to all of you.

3bwqhd,0,2015-07-02,[Advice] PSA: Please don't kill yourself over Ivy leagues/top tier colleges,Umhipeople,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/3bwqhd/advice_psa_please_dont_kill_yourself_over_ivy/,"Ok, well, get ready, cause this is going to be kind of a long one. So, i'm entering my senior year of high school. And, what really made me make this post was what I heard yesterday while talking to a friend. They told me they were only going to apply to top tier schools, and went on and on about their great test scores, grades, etc, and how they would be incredibly disappointed if they didn't get in. Now, this one person is an extreme, but (in my school at least) I have heard many people talking about top tier schools and how they would be disappointed if they didn't get in. Well, I tried to talk some sense into my friend yesterday, and he didn't take it to well and kinda just brushed it off as nonsense, which is unfortunate because he is just setting himself up for disaster, which is why i'm posting this, so some people here don't to the same. This post may come off as discouraging, but i'm just trying to add some realism into the world of applying to colleges (don't worry, if you read the whole damn thing there will be an uplifting part). If you don't read the whole thing, I understand. It's summer and you're probably having fun not wanting to worry about school anyways. But, nevertheless, hopefully some of you will appreciate what I say, and I encourage you to post your opinions on the matter below. Now, on with the post!

First off, nobody ""deserves"" to get into a top tier school. I don't care how perfect your test scores are, how many activities you are the president of, and how many AP classes you have aced. These give you an edge over some other students for sure, but in the end, it is still quite unlikely you will get in even with all of these, as many other students that apply have the exact same things. Plus, many times kids who aren't necessarily perfect get into these schools. You just never know, and should never expect to know. This is the biggest thing, never expect to get in to an ivy or top tier. You are just going to be disappointed most of the time. Expecting to get in is just an egotistical thing to do that will leave many people depressed after not getting accepted. This leads into my next point.

Top tier schools shouldn't be the only option for you. Don't get me wrong, you should definitely still apply, because there's always a chance for you to get in. However, applying to only top tier schools, or having those be the school you ""MUST"" get into is a huge mistake. Just because they are the best of the best doesn't mean every other option is bad. Depending on your major of course, there will be plenty of other schools that are decent, good, and even great choices. Just because it isn't super exclusive doesn't mean it isn't a great school. At the end of the day, you'll still get the same degree as well. Sure, being in an Ivy may give you an edge when applying for your first jobs or internships, but over time where you went to school will matter less and less, and it's incredibly possible that somebody who is very good at what they do who went to an average school becomes much more successful than a Harvard or Stanford graduate. Sure, top tier schools are great in the short run, but in the long run, it isn't that big of a deal. There are plenty of other fantastic schools out there, and limiting yourself to just top tiers is stupid, and, once again, egotistical. You are just setting yourself up for failure by expecting to get in, or limiting yourself to top tier schools.

Most people do not get into top tiers. I myself plan to apply to Stanford and Caltech, two very prestigious schools. If I don't get in, I won't care much since there are still plenty of other great options for me that aren't incredibly prestigious. I am expecting to be rejected, and that's perfectly OK. Top tier schools should be like bonus prizes. Going to college is a prize itself. Getting into a top tier school is more like a lucky bonus prize. It's great, but it is really just a bonus. You still get a prize so to speak by going to college.

Hopefully this post was helpful and a little encouraging to you, and once again, please do post your opinions and experiences on the matter, even if they differ from mine. Hope you all have a nice day!"

The options I've thought of so far:

1. New 2015 VW Passat LE, essentially ~$25k after all the costs considered

2. CPO 2011 BMW 335i with 23k miles, ~$27k

3. CPO 2011 BMW 335i with 47k miles, ~$23k

I'm mainly looking at manual transmission mid-size sedans for a daily driving, my commute is only 12 minutes though. What would you advise? I've considered a 2012 328i for the BMW but am hesitant getting the first year F30, as E90's have been around and refined for a while. The Passat is also the ""safer"" of these choices, but I do know that I'm making enough money for a single guy to consider a slightly more interesting car. Thanks!"

[My original review is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/34n2uo/comprehensive_tedoh_review/) if any of this intrigues you for a breakdown of the actual ID, but I'm sure you all have seen plenty of those \^.^

[HOLOGRAM SHOT I](http://imgur.com/DFV3PH5)

[HOLOGRAM SHOT II](http://imgur.com/p72qT1y)

Didn't take picture of back - I've compared it to a real OH ID and it is spot on.

_____________________________________________________

Let me lead with this:  I have been in 3 different college towns, a wealthy local area, a lower income area, and an in-state weekend, so my experiences with this usage are just about as varied as they can be.

**COLLEGE TOWNS:**  These are going to be your easiest.  I go to school in the East, so OH is only 2 states over, which makes it a rather commonly used ID.

In regards to clubs, your best bet here is to go with what your older friends have to say about bouncer strictness.  Every once in a while you find a college-town bouncer who really knows how to sniff out underagers; and it's not the ID that is going to be the problem.  It's you - you're not invincible - you need to play the part of a mature 21 year old or attempting to gain entry to the clubs may lose you your prop.  Believe me, this shit happens :(

Beer distributors and liquor stores here are easy as can be, just keep that confidence up.

**WEALTHIER REGIONS:**  Not very hard at all actually.  The only thing here is that almost everyone and their mothers is in-state in these places, so make sure that OH is not cross-country or something like that.  Never have gotten much of a second look at bars or liquor stores - just come across as a young professional adult working an internship for the summer or something.  I doubt you'll be questioned anyway, these people aren't used to even having kids try to buy alcohol underage.

**LOWER-INCOME AREAS:**  You think these would be easy, or so I did, but this is where I find the most trouble.  Some of the most run-down places are a walk in the park, but any type of chain liquor store will be heavily suspicious in this area.  Only time I have ever been *really* questioned on my ID information was using it at one of these places.  Generally avoid if you can, but you should be aye okay.

Again, some places are worse than others, so just use word of mouth here like you do with the college town clubs/bars.

**IN-STATE:** Really lives up to the bolded OH on the VVL.  Not a damned second blink at this ID anywhere throughout all of the western (the large cities in question are blacklisted from posts) regions.  This goes for everything: clubs, beer/liquor, and bars.  I was genuinely impressed after every flawless use.  I brought a duplicate thinking it would be under heavy scrutiny, but I was proven very wrong.  This ID has became one of very few I now recommend for in-state use.

_____________________________________________________

I wish I had some cop stories to share, but so far I've been smart/lucky enough to avoid any of these encounters.  Use your head - every purchase you make could be the one you get caught if you get lazy about it!

Really excited for the unveiling of the Blue OH's soon!  Stay safe and have a phenomenal Fourth of July fam' ;)"
3bww1v,27,2015-07-02,[Advice] PSA: Please don't kill yourself over ivy leagues/top tier schools,AlbatrossNow,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/3bww1v/advice_psa_please_dont_kill_yourself_over_ivy/,"Ok, well, get ready, cause this is going to be kind of a long one. So, i'm entering my senior year of high school. And, what really made me make this post was what I heard yesterday while talking to a friend. They told me they were only going to apply to top tier schools, and went on and on about their great test scores, grades, etc, and how they would be incredibly disappointed if they didn't get in. Now, this one person is an extreme, but (in my school at least) I have heard many people talking about top tier schools and how they would be disappointed if they didn't get in. Well, I tried to talk some sense into my friend yesterday, and he didn't take it to well and kinda just brushed it off as nonsense, which is unfortunate because he is just setting himself up for disaster, which is why i'm posting this, so some people here don't to the same. This post may come off as discouraging, but i'm just trying to add some realism into the world of applying to colleges (don't worry, if you read the whole damn thing there will be an uplifting part). If you don't read the whole thing, I understand. It's summer and you're probably having fun not wanting to worry about school anyways. But, nevertheless, hopefully some of you will appreciate what I say, and I encourage you to post your opinions on the matter below. Now, on with the post!

First off, nobody ""deserves"" to get into a top tier school. I don't care how perfect your test scores are, how many activities you are the president of, and how many AP classes you have aced. These give you an edge over some other students for sure, but in the end, it is still quite unlikely you will get in even with all of these, as many other students that apply have the exact same things. Plus, many times kids who aren't necessarily perfect get into these schools. You just never know, and should never expect to know. This is the biggest thing, never expect to get in to an ivy or top tier. You are just going to be disappointed most of the time. Expecting to get in is just an egotistical thing to do that will leave many people depressed after not getting accepted. This leads into my next point.

Top tier schools shouldn't be the only option for you. Don't get me wrong, you should definitely still apply, because there's always a chance for you to get in. However, applying to only top tier schools, or having those be the school you ""MUST"" get into is a huge mistake. Just because they are the best of the best doesn't mean every other option is bad. Depending on your major of course, there will be plenty of other schools that are decent, good, and even great choices. Just because it isn't super exclusive doesn't mean it isn't a great school. At the end of the day, you'll still get the same degree as well. Sure, being in an Ivy may give you an edge when applying for your first jobs or internships, but over time where you went to school will matter less and less, and it's incredibly possible that somebody who is very good at what they do who went to an average school becomes much more successful than a Harvard or Stanford graduate. Sure, top tier schools are great in the short run, but in the long run, it isn't that big of a deal. There are plenty of other fantastic schools out there, and limiting yourself to just top tiers is stupid, and, once again, egotistical. You are just setting yourself up for failure by expecting to get in, or limiting yourself to top tier schools.

Most people do not get into top tiers. I myself plan to apply to Stanford and Caltech, two very prestigious schools. If I don't get in, I won't care much since there are still plenty of other great options for me that aren't incredibly prestigious. I am expecting to be rejected, and that's perfectly OK. Top tier schools should be like bonus prizes. Going to college is a prize itself. Getting into a top tier school is more like a lucky bonus prize. It's great, but it is really just a bonus. You still get a prize so to speak by going to college.

Hopefully this post was helpful and a little encouraging to you, and once again, please do post your opinions and experiences on the matter, even if they differ from mine. Hope you all have a nice day!"

To start things off, my girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months now. We are both 19 and go to the same university. I have had three sexual partners and the past and she has had none. Among other issues, she has extremely, extremely low self esteem. 


We first had sex about three, three and a half months into the relationship, and it was in her car (kind of important detail I think). It was the only place we really could since we are both commuters. This continued for about a month or so, but not everyday, probably a total of 5/6 times. 


About two months ago, extreme family issues arrived and she ended up living with my family and I for another month. During that time period we did not have sex at all. Or what could be considered sex. For whatever reason I would either not be able to get/hold an erection or not be able to last more than a minute. The not being able to produce an erection occurred much more often than the ""minute man"" occurrences. For whatever reason I had extreme performance anxiety. 
This set her off to even more self esteem problems, and I made the mistake of not talking to her about the issue I was facing, and only said that I don't know why it was happening. She thought that I just didn't want to, and at that point asked if I even wanted to during the times we did in the car. Being awful at explaining myself, I told her that I felt like she expected me to. In reality I did want to, I just also thought she expected us to since it was becoming a regular thing. A side note more than anything, but I realize that was a horrible thing to say, because she took it as ""I only had sex with you because I felt like I had to."" 


Things calmed down between us eventually, but our situation didn't get better, and I had plenty of time to try and fix things. I was too afraid of my performance anxiety from happening that I stopped initiating sex altogether. 
At this point she stopped living with us, not as a response to me, but because she had an internship program. It wasn't until a week or so after she was gone that I tried explaining myself better and at this point brought up the performance anxiety issues. However she still thinks thinks that I just don't want sex with her at all and that I was forcing myself to do it. She said that she can no longer feel comfortable trying to have sex with me. 


Romantically, we are fine, but sexually we are beyond doomed, or that's how it seems to me. She came back two weeks ago, we went on a date, but she then left to another state to visit a friend, again this was already planned. 
A few days ago the issue was brought up again, and I tried explaining that I still want a sex life and I want to find a solution. She says she does not want to try again and that she is completely turned off to the idea of trying that with me but that she still had sexual needs that need to be met. She suggested a ""hall pass"" and I did not take that well. The thought of her with someone else makes me sick. I have expressed that but she says that it will be extremely impersonal and that she still loves me and only wants to be with me. She said that she wouldn't do it if I don't want her to, but she is going to need to have sex with someone eventually. 


I don't know what to do. I want to reach a point where she is comfortable enough to want to try again, but she insists that she has little faith she can reach that point. 


I am not trying to make her out to be the bad guy. I am the source of all of the issues that have happened and do not blame her for wanting this, I just hate the idea of it. Can you guys please share with me similar experiences or advice on what to do in this situation? Anything would be appreciated. "

She just left for an internship this summer, and only a month has gone by. All of a sudden I get a phone call saying that this is too hard  and that she got a full time offer and can't take the pain of long distance. We were 3 days away from seeing each other. Is there anything I can do to fix this? We still had a year of college to be together, but she said it would be too hard to go long distance after that amount of time being together and that it would be easier on both of us if we just broke it off now. We both always talked about how we would try our hardest to make things work. Now it's over. I don't know what to do with myself. I have panic attacks throughout the day and just keep thinking about where things went wrong. This girl was the love of my life. She even told me when she broke it off that there wasn't another guy, that she still loved me, and wanted to be together in the future but that this just wasn't the right time for us.

3bxio9,17,2015-07-02,"22[F] Searching for a partner in crime, a dominant and a best friend - details inside!",shewaits,BDSMpersonals,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/3bxio9/22f_searching_for_a_partner_in_crime_a_dominant/,"Hi there!

First off, for some reason this post didn't stay up and I don't know what I was doing wrong, but if you've seen it before, it was me!

I'm an university student, a very ambitious intern and a yoga enthusiast.

I will start by sharing what got me writing this post. I was browsing one of my favorite Tumblr blogs and came across a text that really spoke to my heart (http://dominantstateofmind.tumblr.com/post/121881252079/fortheloveofasubmissive-the-rewards-of-a). The writer talks about the deep bond a submissive and a dominant can have and the greatness, the fulfillment that comes with that strong connection. I read it all and after that I found myself saying ""Damn it, I need this. I'm craving that kind of intimacy.""

That's why I'm here writing this, giving it a try here because why not!

I've always been sort of submissive in my intimate relationships, though I never really had a partner that was interested in letting me explore or willing to explore together. When I mean submission, I do mean that I love the idea of kneeling in front of you and looking up at you - but apart from that what fascinates me is the mental part in that scene. I want someone that I will look up to with adoration and respect, not only with arousal.

As obvious from the title, I don't like things like pet play, slave/master dynamics and definitely not daddy/little girl (can't turn me off faster)! I don't want to call you sir or master - I know this is pretty much the thing in bdsm for most people but I'm looking for the rare ones that don't like it. It is just way too distant for me and I want us to be equals. If you make me call you that in a heated moment just to, ya know, insert your dominance and play with me, that's fine but only that (I'd totally go for revenge, just for the record).

I want you to be my best friend that I can goof off with (very important, I'm very playful!), I want you to be my partner in crime for all sorts of mischief (equally important, you should swear you're up to no good) and I want you to be my dominant that I can give myself fully to.

I'm disgustingly loyal once I start caring about you and it takes so much to change that. I've been called needy before, my sensitive spot, so yeah, you can run now if you want to.

I'm very old fashioned when it comes to relationships, if you think gender roles are nonsense, we won't get along. That also means no casual stuff (I've never been into that) and I don't find promiscuity attractive at all. Really. 

What I want is to feel safe with you and to make you feel like you're my whole world, my rock and the only man in the world for me.

If you're thinking of messaging me right now, please be 30 at the most. I'm very well educated and I expect you to be the same. No drug or alcohol addictions please. I think I'm attractive for those who like tall brunettes, and I have to find you attractive in order for this to work. And lastly, I'm actually looking for something long term, something that could be... something. If you're not at that point in your life yet, don't waste your time and mine. Oh, and I'm in Europe, so actually people from Europe will be much better suited to what I'm looking for (because I will want to meet you!) but I guess if you can travel, why not the other parts of the world as well.

I know it's very optimistic of me to search for true love on reddit, on a subreddit where everyone is looking for something casual online, but I believe that miracles happen. So yeah, message me. Include a picture, tell me about yourself and hopefully we will hit it off! 

ps. If you also include your Kik in your message, everything will be so much smoother since reddit messaging is terrible.

Here is a list of what I want, what I need them for, and other details:

* If possible they would be for both my IT job (chinos/dress pants, button up, tie) and when I go back to college (again with chinos)

* I like shinier options such as [these](http://www.skoaktiebolaget.se/collections/frontpage/products/edward-green-inverness-in-burgundy) but I understand that shiny = not casual

* I prefer a dark brown sole not the jet black ones most cheaper pairs have.

* Somewhat durable, I walk in Boston on cobblestone every day on the way to work (so no Aldo or anything but this is MFA you guys are good)

* I don't like SUPER pointy ones like the few I found at DSW. I like a more rounded toe

* I'm a size 9-10 if it matters

* I would like the price to be around $100-150. It's asking for a lot but that's my budget. Especially if I only get one pair for work because it's an internship and I will be done in 2 months. If it's a casual AND formal shoe then I'm a little more willing to step up to MAYBE $200 but I would prefer not to. 

So that's it can you guys help me find the perfect pair?"

6 months ago I met this guy. When we  finally had the ""us"" talk and I told him how I wanted to take things very slow because I was in an abusive relationship for a year and he was completely understanding about my situation. 



Around the second month he asked me to be his girlfriend, while drunk. I declined and said that as much as I do want to be his girlfriend eventually, I still felt like it was rushing things and I wasn't ready. A few weeks later he once again asked me while drunk. Again, I declined. 



Around Valentines day I noticed things were beginning to be different with him. I finally asked him if he even wanted to be with me (while drunk) and he dropped this bombshell on me-- He told me that he didn't want to start a relationship when he was going to be leaving for 6 months on an internship. Okay, that's totally understandable. But there was more. He said that he had been in relationships in the past where the girl was extremely controlling and wouldn't let him see his friends and then cheated on him with those friends. I told him that I understood where he was coming from but that I would never cheat on him or be a controlling bitch. 


At the end of the semester we started talking again. Things started feeling like they were gonna go back to normal. However, I felt like I was always his second choice. I told him that I was trying to move on from him and was talking to other guys. He asked me why I was talking to other guys and I told him that it wasn't fair of him to expect me to stay exclusive to him when he barely tries to make an effort to talk or be with me. 



One night we went to a bar and he got wasted. He was all over me and telling me I was his soul mate, that he never wanted to lose me, and that he was really gonna change to be with me. When I left, things were completely different.  He would call me, facetime me, always send me encouraging texts, and his demeanor was just completely different than before. I finally let my guard down with him and everything felt perfect.



Last Monday I went to stay with him for a week. On that day, he asked me to be his girlfriend. He said he didn't care that he was gonna be leaving for six months and that he trusted that I wouldn't cheat while he was away. I told him I was willing to try and make it work if he was. He said that he couldn't stand the thought of losing me and that he's never felt so drawn to a person in his entire life. I thought to myself, finally all the effort I put into being with him is paying off. I new there was a reason I never gave up on him because I really felt like he was the ""one.""



During that week he was gone a lot for class, work, gym, and other stuff. On Thursday he went golfing. He said he was only gonna be gone an hour because he had to come back and finish homework before class. He was gone 4 hours. When he got back I told him I was a little bit upset that he was always hanging out with his friends and ditching me the entire time I've been here and that I was only here for a week and he could always see his friends. Then he started getting distant with me, once again. I left on Saturday without saying goodbye because he was at work and I had a family emergency. 



Later that night I texted him that I felt like things were going back to how they used to be and he said yeah. I asked if he even wanted to be with me anymore and he said no. I was devastated. He told me that his feelings changed when I told him I felt like he was ditching me. It was like all the work we had put in was for nothing. I told him that I don't understand how he could just walk away from this so easily. How do you walk away from someone who you said was your soulmate? He didn't even want to make it work!! This is what he said in one of his texts ""I just realized I didn't want the extra responsibility of trying to please you while I have other things in my life going on.""



I feel so heartbroken. I haven't texted him since last sunday when he ended it with me. Idk what to do now though. I really don't want to give up on him because I feel so drawn to him but if he could just throw me away that easily then why waste my time. I know 6 months is a short time but I honestly felt like I loved him. I was with my ex for a year and never felt this way. He made me feel like there was some calmness among the chaos going on in my life. Sorry for this being so long.



**TL;DR spent 6 months trying to be with someone who made me feel like I was easy to throw away. Finally worked through our problems just for him to end it after a week because he decided I wasn't worth the trouble of fighting for.**"

3bxunu,51,2015-07-02,Leveraging My Experiences in TPP for Personal Gain,sandyxdaydream,twitchplayspokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/3bxunu/leveraging_my_experiences_in_tpp_for_personal_gain/,"**TLDR:** I wanted to share with you my journey having been a part of TwitchPlaysPokemon and how it helped me land an internship in another country, an offer for a research publication opportunity, a study abroad opportunity, and allowed me to be a mentor to someone. 

I became engrossed in the TPP stream at a really low point in my life. It was the end of my freshman year of college, and I had went from being a top-notch student at my high school to being rejected from 5-6 clubs/e-boards in my college as well as getting rejected by 15 unpaid summer internships leaving me unemployed. Since there was nothing else going on in my life, I dedicated a lot of my time to watching the stream and applied and became a live updater during Emerald.

I was acquainted to the other updaters and mods and became super engrossed in updating. I got more involved by beginning keeping track of deadzones and then helping the mods recruit and review updater applications. By TPP Black, I realized that there were a lot of unspoken rules about updating that the updater team just kinda assumed new recruits and other existing updaters would know. I didn't think this was really efficient, so I wrote a comprehensive [Updater Guideline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11cJu31hfvIecflfAtzUnJ8oNDb8ik_IF4g_g6HRwBuc/edit?usp=sharing) to help out the new updaters coming in based off of updating norms. This led to my mod nomination. I can't even begin to tell you how much I have gotten out of being mod for this subreddit.


* I decided to put down being subreddit mod of TPP down on my resume. Here's how it read as of Dec 2014: ""Organized a 70000 member online community with around 800,000 hits in the last month and 90,000 unique views. Recruited and trained over 30 live reporters spanning across several continents including Europe, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia. Oversaw maintenance of detailed online live 24/7 reports to a viewership base of 300 people at any given time and raised total number of updates by 82%."" Suddenly, being mod of TPP didn't seem so silly. 

* At an IT course in my school, we had 2 whole classes about online community management. I spoke to my IT professor more about it after class and he had asked me to send him a link to the subreddit. He eventually told me about his research project on e-mentoring and asked me to be a part of it due to my experiences mentoring some of the updaters. Now, it's important to note that I am very caring towards my updaters and helping them develop their skillset/work on their weaknesses. Just the other night, I stayed up till 3AM helping one of them edit their resumes in preparation for applying for a public policy program. While this may not seem like much, I gain a lot of personal satisfaction from it. They didn't ask me to stay up till 3AM to help them, I did it because I wanted to. 

* When applying for my school's competitive study away opportunity in Silicon Valley, we had to attach a supplement. While my friends were attaching 30-page-business-plans, I took a gamble and submitted a link to the subreddit and the updater guidelines - since that was the closest ""tech"" related thing I have. I ended up being accepted among just 14 others into the program. Finally, TPP was instrumental in me landing my internship at the International Accounting Standards Board in London for the summer. They basically set the guidelines of accounting that the rest of the world have to follow, which closely aligned with my work in creating the updater guide. They're extremely important in accounting, so hopefully my job prospects for the future are secure. 

On the surface, I told people that I basically just write down what actions are happening in a video game, but once I start getting into detail about TPP and what I've done, it's so much more than just that. As a mod, I deal with public relations to resolve issues and conflicts, event managing, communications, human resources, and overall being a leader. Being a business major, I began seeing a lot of what I do as a mod translate into real issues a manager might face. **My lesson to you guys is to not be afraid to showcase your interests and skills, no matter how stupid they seem. Write lore? Great. Motherfucker, put that down as a writing sample. Artist? Shows that you can do graphic design. If you're passionate about something, don't be ashamed to pursue it. You never know where it's going to lead you, not all opportunities are obvious.**"

I've noticed that a lot of these PHP ""Deployment Interfaces"" on GitHub have been a bit sub par in my opinion, so I went ahead and started to create my own for use in the web servers at my internship.

As of right now, it features GitHub secret access token validation, syncs a specified repository with your selected target directory, optionally excludes specified files (It defaults to excluding the .git folder), and optionally produces debugging output aside from the normal surface output for testing.

I am going to be updating and testing this frequently since my internship will be deploying it's web servers with this software, so you can look forward to many more useful features.

Let me know what you guys think! Also, I would be happy to include any well thought contributions with references to the contributor."

3by982,2,2015-07-02,"Bandits, marriage, and flamethrowers. I'd love an interpretation on this one!",CannibalisticZebra87,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/3by982/bandits_marriage_and_flamethrowers_id_love_an/,"Okay, I'd love for an interpretation on this because this is by far the most I've ever remember my dreams and I actually woke up scared and sad from this one. Lets get started! Also sorry for any grammar issues. I typed it up the minute I woke up as to not forget. I tried to go back and fix as much as possible, but im sure it's not all fixed. Feel free to pm me if you catch something thats bothering you and I'll fix it right up!

2 dreams last night. 1) I dont remember how I got there but I ended up marrying this girl, Carly (girl I have a crush on). We were both really happy and I hugged her before we went to go get married. Our marriage reception was in the gym of my old elementary (k-5 year school) school. I never actually got to marry her because something I dont remember happened then I instantly transitioned to my next dream and was really sad.
2) I was in what kind of resembled my middle school (6-8 year school), but in a different location that did not actually exist in that school. Kinda like a big balcony over our theater. I was supposed to be getting pictures with my homeroom class but got lost and ended up finding Carly again and talking to her. We made a few jokes about each others clothes for some reason then she had to leave with her class. As she walked of she was talking to her friend about how she thought I was cute so I got exited and went to go tell my friend Michael. He was in my homeroom class, but now it was in the highschool(9-12 year school) I attend. We joked around a little bit and then just like that I was riding a bus to this whole new area looking out the window at the things we passed. (This is where it gets weird)

I was in this field with two big plane hangers with a bunch of technology in them. No one wanted my help so I beat the shit out of this huge hulk looking guy that was wondering around the area so I could prove my worth. They saw I was good or could be some help so they made me the intern to this group there. Me and one guy from the group decided to go scout out the third abandoned hanger down the road. We went down there and saw (slight game of thrones season 5 spoiler here. Ends at next set of tildes or as I call them, the squiggly hyphens)~~that young blonde Lannicster girl and her dessert boyfriend making out.~~~~~(end of spoiler) We went to go back to report this to HQ, but we were ambushed on our way back. I got up in the bed of the truck to fight the people ambushing us by hitting them with a printer. It worked. I ran off to tell someone when this lady came up to me and said not to tell. I said I needed to and she told me ""okay well you have two options. You can tell and I'll burn you to death."" And pulled out a flamethrower. No other option. Just that...

I ended up running while she chased me but I guess I'm sonic because I out ran her like it was nothing and started crossing a big wooden bridge over a swamp to the little town I saw us pass on the bus earlier. I arrived and these gang members dressed in red kimonos started shooting at me in a baseball field while riding motorcycles and those 3 wheeled motorcycles. Luckily this tall, skinny, black, man(his attributes are sorta important later) yelled ""follow me"" and I started to run behind him. We ran straight threw the middle of the odd motorcycle gang that was after us as they threw boomerangs at us. The boomerangs also had a laser sight on them like some guns do, so there's that. We ran to his house were we got inside quickly. The gang obviously watched us go inside so they knew we where in this small little room.

I asked who the man was and he instead of responding pulled out my dead best friend Cameron(short, slightly built, white guy. Just dead in dream not in real life) who looked as if he had been poisoned and layed him on the bed beside him. I exclaimed the name ""Cameron!"" And then realized the man who saved me was wearing a hoodie. Right as I yelled ""Cameron"" the man laughed and pulled off his hoodie to be none other than... Cameron again. I was still scared about the raiders breaking in that I asked ""shouldn't we hide or something?"" To which he replied ""nah, they're as dumb as animals. Once they left New York they lost their intelligence so they're dumb as animals like an animal"" (exact words). I insisted we should and he insisted they were stupid. What felt like mere seconds later I decided to hide under the bed to see Carly AGAIN. She told me she was scared and I said that they wouldn't be able to find us under this bed and then gave her a bottle cap and my necklace that I always wear. Right as I said that Cameron yelled ""they found us!"" So I closed my eyes as a loud chainsaw noise started up just to instantly wake up to my friend vacuuming around the house.

Tldr: My mind must really be focused on Carly right now. And bandits.... and flame throwers.

When tragedy strikes, Seth Stewart is forced to return home after the death of his beloved father. The unexpected detour forces him to oversee the family’s auto shop and restaurant business, and Seth must kiss the prestigious internship goodbye after his first year at Berkeley Business School. When he collides with his first crush after his arrival, Seth wonders what possibly could have happened to Josefina Anders.
   
Josefina has hidden many secrets she is too ashamed to share with anyone, especially Seth. When they cross paths again, the urge to relive their past lingers in her mind even though she knows he couldn’t accept her sketchy past. Things get even more complicated when her mother returns, as well as her overly possessive ex, who decides to crash into her fragile existence all over again.
   

   
Will Seth’s connection for Josefina be strong enough to see past her secrets, or will he realize he can’t rekindle an old flame?

3byr7z,1,2015-07-03,My best friend [f22] broke up with me[M22] and I still care about her...not necessarily love her.,[deleted],BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/3byr7z/my_best_friend_f22_broke_up_with_mem22_and_i/,"I liked this girl from my class a lot.Since the 9th grade.We used to talk but back then I was very much into studies and sports and never really, for some Godforsaken reason, make a move towards her.I just thought I would give it some time and check if it was just a passing fancy or I did really like her. But life's a bitch. She got into a relationship with another guy from my class,who was a very good friend of mine. well,it killed me from the inside but I just made peace with it after a LOT of effort.I gave myself all kinds of logic and after a few months of depression,it could finally see the two of them together without trying to strangle him inside my head. 

However,they broke up after 9 or 10 months(in the 10th grade) for some reason.He was the one who called it quits.I was overjoyed at first(now was my time to jump in and propose :P ) but then had a sinking feeling.I thought about her and how devastated she would be right now.She had been very committed to him. I did all I could to make her feel right,get her out of depression and support her.I rebuked myself for feeling happy at her break up and thought it would be a sin to let her know of my feelings at this time.She was too vulnerable and also assuming that I had proposed and she's said ""Yes"" , it would have been nothing but a rebound relationship for her and I didn't want that. Rebound relationships never last.and we had become very good friends so I didn't want to sabotage the friendship either.

At this point of time,in comes another villain. A family friend of hers. He got very close to her and maybe she started confiding all her problems to him.Hewas from a different school and rumors started flying that the  two were in a relationship.When I asked her about it,she said there was nothing of the sort and I accepted the answer. What more could I do anyway?She had also formed an opinion that she would not get into a relationship now(that's what she told me) as the first one had been really harsh for her.I understood and just concentrated on my studies while occassionally helping her out when she called or relapsed.I just figured it wouldn't be a good idea to propose as she had told me categorically she didn't want a relationship.Meanwhile, the rumors about her and that guy got crazier and a point came when even my best friend(who knew my whole story) told me to just chuck her out of my life as she was probably lying to me. I didn't do anything about it really and just did what I felt was right.Trust her,taker her word for it and concentrate on my studies.It was a situation over which I had no control. So I just let things be the way they were.I just knew that if I did the right thing,she and I would eventually end up together.And if it wasn't to be then life would be kinder somewhere else. pretty idealist,eh?

We passed out of school and went our separate ways(different colleges,different cities). I loved her all this while but there wasn't any point in proposing her or baring my feelings.Also, every person in her circle was convincd she was in a relationship with the guy and she lying about it.I did not want to get stuck over her so I greatly reduced the contact between us and rarely inititated a conversation.I only replied when she texted. I also had a feeling that she knew what I felt about her and somehow,she never wanted to snap our connection.We did hangout a few times but only in groups.No ""dates"" or ""taking her out"".She avoided it and so did I.This went on for the next 3 years. In my final year at college,I landed an internship in the same city where she studied. I told her about it and she said it was great and that we should hang out.I went there and we had an amazing time together.It was great going out with her and within a month we had visited every nook and corner of the city.Also, when I was with her I realized she couldn't possibly be in a relationship right now.It was a gut feeling. towards the end of my internship I proposed her and she said she was very flattered(i had been a very popular guy in school and had done pretty well in college too) but she didn't think it would work out between us.She cited that we were very different individuals and were incompatible(this word haunts me even today....as you'll see).However, she admitted that she had always had feelings for me but she kept brushing them aside as she did not think a relationship between us would be feasible.I told her to do what she thought was best and left the decision to her.A couple of days later she said YES! (woohoo!!)

The relationship was great for the next 10 months.In between, I tried to talk to her about that guy and all those rumors but she just told me that there was nothing but friendship between them and I should accept her answer and ask no more.I wanted to ask her a lot of questions though.I had seen on Facebook that his friends referred to her as ""bhabhi"" to which she replied that she couldn't really control what others spoke to her.I had also assured her that I wouldn't even mind if she had actually been in a relationship with this guy.It was not a problem for me.But the answer remained that it was friendship and nothing else and that she couldn't keep having the same conversation over and over again.I decided never to bring up the topic again.About 3 months into the relationship), the ""alleged"" boyfriend(her family friend) had messaged her and asked to meet her.She asked me if I had any problem with it and I said No and that she should do as she sees fit and go or not go regardless of what I say....she had that freedom. I suppose this was the right thing to do. 

Four or five months into the relatonship,we got a little intimate and when we were away,resorted to some sexting.She was the one who initiated it.After a month of it,she suddenly switched off and said she wanted no more of it(sexting).I was okay with that.But I asked her what made her change her mind all of a sudden.She just replied that she didn't want to and there was no reason for it.It was worrying for me.I thought I had done something wrong and wanted to correct it.I kept pressing her for an answer but she refused to give me any reasons for it.I lost my temper and spoke rudely to her on a few occasions. The friction continued for about a month after which she said she needed to sort out things and decide if she wanted to continue or not. I asked her if it was over between us to which she replied(via text) that it probably was. I told her to pick up the phone or talk in person but she said she did not have the courage to do it.I tried to reason and explain that it was our first fight and that she was bailing out the moment things were going rough. I apologized but it all fell on deaf ears.She said she didn't know what to do.As a last ditch attempt, I told her to take some time and really think about it.I haven't contacted her since.It's been 2 months now.She texted me once,after 32 days, but again went cold.I also did not persist.She told a mutual friend that it would take time to reconcile and that she was trying but she was stuck on that chat thing.She also deleted my number from her contact list.I did all I could to get her back but she never responded.

6 months later, her best friend, unintentionally, told me she had been in a relationship with this guy(the one we fought over) for about 3 years....right since college had started. They broke up for some reason (that's where I came in) and were back together now. I also noticed she had started interacting with him openly on social media now. something she never did before. I felt as if I had been stabbed. Sucks to have defended someone all your life and in the end they turn out to be exactly what people had said about them. What makes it worse is that she broke up with me saying I don't trust her. seriously? A couple of months back, we met at an alumni. I ignored her completely. I don't even remember seeing her face. But this was not out of spite. This I did for my own good. To get over her. 

I don't whose fault was it? who's to blame? I know I have beaten myself over it too much. Somehow I felt entirely responsible. Sanity has struck me since then but a year on I still find myself caring for her. "

I'm doing an internship at the moment and was planning to leave right after.  I found out that where I'm working is planning to offer me full time employment. 

I still want to go,  but many people are telling me to take the job and get some more experience, although I feel like it's always been a case of ""just do a little more and you're free after"". 

I'm 23 so I still have many years to travel.  I'm also just out of a long term relationship (3 year relationship ended 8 months ago) which makes me feel like it's the perfect time to experience the world and take a year off. 

I'm a little worried that I'll get too comfortable or my situation will change and I won't end up going.  Having money is tempting though and I do like my job.  Has anyone faced a similar decision and how did it work out for you?"

Upcoming week I have 4 internship interviews planned. Now my question is how do I deny their offer correctly if one of the companies decides to take me in whilst I prefer another company over them. Or if they want to tell me on the spot. 

*Would it be okay to say ''Sorry, I can't accept your offer right now because I have more interviews planned later this week''*? 

*And when I chose another company ''Sorry but sadly I took the offer at another company''*? I'm kinda clueless on this one, how to not disappoint the company.

It seems rather rude to say that to a company that is wanting to take you in and giving you the opportunity. 

How would I go about doing this? "

I finally relate to all of the songs on the radio, the infatuation has never waned... I just know that he's the one I want to forever with in wrinkly union. **However**, it has not been an obstacle-less journey. 

.

**Early**: Before we met, I had just gotten out of a relationship that was a daily emotional gangbang. I was rather guarded when Dave* and I were getting to know each other -- a combination of upbringing and recent history had my priorities and expectations thoroughly warped. I didn't really believe in love, found it strange that he wanted to know so much about my past, and was wary of his (perceived) excessive concern over my well-being. Early on he had also told me he couldn't fall in love with someone in anything under a year and a half, and saw those that did to be ungrounded. Him having a strict timeline contributed to me being reluctant to invest fully. I worried that someone with such guidelines about an organic event, might have other specifications for relationship progression that I did not want to fuck up. I should note he is fairly Type A, an immense workaholic, who rarely sleeps more than 4hrs a night, and has an unrealistically high standard for himself/others around him.



**Then**: I told him I loved him around the 1yr mark, as I wanted to gauge if there would ever be reciprocation. I often felt lonely. We would rarely spend much time together, other than him asking me to drive over later at night once or twice a week, only to leave in the morning. I didn't really voice my unhappiness for fear of putting pressure on him to engage in the relationship and figured it would get better eventually. Yes, I *am* a shitty communicator. Fast forward, going on 2 years, and I decide to take an internship in another state (where I asked him to accompany me). I knew if I stayed, despite my nagging, he still would not want to spend weekends out in the world doing things or come over to my apartment for a change. I thought my presence was inconsequential. I had begun to doubt I was anything more than a security blanket for him. So I went. And then problems. 

.

**Next**: I was gone for 3 months, against his wishes. I did an admittedly piss-poor job of communicating while away, but at the time he did not seem to object. Once I returned, fuuuck. I went through a period of depression that really shook our relationship. I pushed him/everyone away. I was not myself. During this time I made the decision to study abroad in a very remote country to build my language skills. I felt like this was something I had to do, and knowing his objection to long distance, broke up with him. I felt like he would be miserable the whole time but would refuse to do it himself. We reconciled and decided to stay together. I missed him horribly and loved him even more for allowing me the opportunity. I got back and we spent two solid months together, rebuilding. Again, my old supervisor called me up and wanted me to come back for another summer. I took it to Dave and he said he supported me. So I accepted. I asked him to come with me again(he works from home). Turns out he was devastated that I hadn't declined, despite his green-light. We went though some back and forth, I felt awful for abandoning him a third time, called my boss and told her I had to stay. Hours later he apologized and TOLD ME TO REACCEPT. So, I went. 

.


**Remodeling**: I am here, away. He is going through the anniversary of the death of a family member. I feel like an absolute shit girlfriend for not meeting his emotional needs, while trying to meet my professional ones. He feels like I am not that serious about us because I continue to leave. I am, I'm just still trying to get through school, we don't live together, we have not concretely set long-term plans, and I don't feel like distance degrades the quality of a relationship. I still love the same. The issue is, he doesn't. Which is valid! I just have no idea how to address it. Ideally, I'll have a job that allows me to travel frequently one day, but I feel like that will kill him. Are we just incompatible? I want this to work. He is all my heart cares for...Has anyone had a similar experience? How do I make him feel more secure?

.


**TL;DR** (understandable): I've been a confused asshole. Boyfriend and I on our third leg of long distance (10months out of 3yrs total). Have different philosophies about long distance/caring for one another...How do I support him remotely? Is it possible? Or do I need to compromise better and bow out of situations/careers that require travel?

3c1gwm,28,2015-07-03,"[Story] Want to hear success stories after failing academically: classes, exams, etc. due to depression",justanotherjobseeker,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/3c1gwm/story_want_to_hear_success_stories_after_failing/,"I wanted to share my personal story and hear if you had any similar stories; just want to hear something uplifting:

Basically I was something like an overachiever student in high school, passionate about learning and life and meeting new people. I'm not ""naturally gifted"" but I worked hard and got decent grades before coming to college. When I started school, I was looking forward to being around people who were enthusiastic and passionate about what they were doing. I had a lot of energy and was excited about what college had to offer. I joined a lot of extracurriculars, did pretty well in my first two years, got into the top program at my school that, I wasn't sure I wanted to do at first but went along with it. I made a few friends. Things looked OK.

But later on, things were not feeling right. My grades were  dropping. I still studied a lot, but just felt like my quality of studying was poor and wasn't in any mood to fix it. I wasn't in love with what I was learning. My friends would only stick around to take advantage of me and didn't share my interest nor passions. They'd hardly show up to class and use me when they needed to stay up to date with notes and homework. I felt like our friendship otherwise revolved entirely around comparing grades and ""one-upping"" eachother.  The students in my class who were overachievers seemed to want to use our major as evidence to show off about how they're the smartest people in the school and would always put down other people in other majors. It felt like to be accepted, you had to suck up to the professors rather than propose new ideas or show that you're interested in something. There was a constant emphasis on professionalism and walking the walk/talking the talk but little on anything else.

I had started to lose my sense of creativity and direction. I didn't know what I was doing or why. I tried to look for an intern job within my field that was expected for students to be doing, but employers kept telling me there weren't ""open spots"" because of the competition in my field. I started to volunteer/participate in organizations outside of my major to maintain my sanity. But even there, I was not enjoying myself. 

I went into a very dark depression/anxiety episode one summer after my third year, but hardly had time to address it once school began again. I tried to look forward to the fact that I was almost graduating, but had little idea of what I truly wanted to do in life.

In my last year, I spent a lot of time doing unpaid internships and there I realized even more that my major was not my primary interest. I would work alongside other professionals and enjoyed what they were doing rather than what I was supposed to do. In my last semester, I was supposed to be studying for an exam to get a certification, but instead, I spent time going to different universities and attending lectures in various subjects that interested me. I started using social media-like Twitter/Reddit-to read articles that fascinated me. This wasn't getting me anywhere in my professional life, but it was at least making up for the lost interest and passion. 

When I graduated, I felt upset and lost about what I was doing. My friends hardly were there with me during graduation, we didn't even end up taking a group picture or anything. I didn't have a job offer upon graduating. I could hardly get myself to study with the amount of depression and apathy I built inside me. I tried to study for my certification exam, which I did spend months trying to study for but ended up failing. This was a huge embarrassment, as it's supposed to be an easy exam with a high pass rate. I just remember showing up for the exam and almost vomiting/passing out. I never felt so nervous about taking an exam in my life. I passed school with a decent GPA, better than most of my friends, despite my lack of interest then too. I took time off due to my mental health/family illness, but now I've neared 100+ applications and still don't know what I'm doing. I have to retake my exam, but I'm reminded about the fact that I failed such an easy test and feel stupid/incompetent. Along with the fact that I'm just bored out of my mind, have a dwindling driving force and no friends, this is turning into a vicious cycle and I just want to hear something motivating. "
3c1xtp,16,2015-07-03,"Set me straight, am i treating CF people poorly?",sweetsaltysavorytart,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3c1xtp/set_me_straight_am_i_treating_cf_people_poorly/,"So, lurking around here a few weeks, i feel like this board has been conflicting on my view on how i treat people who don't want/like kids. This is one of those ""if you smell shit all day, check your shoes"" moments. i have some very specific examples that run through my mind when i go through this board and i'd like the opinion of anonymous CF folk to help me out.


Let me start with a bit of BG. I'm a mother of 2 and i view having kids as my own personal hobby and life style. No, really.

When asked ""why did you have kids?"" the only answer i can come up with is ""because i wanted them"". and do i ever want them. I don't really like sharing my kids. I won't let anyone hold my baby unless they ask and have washed their hands, i'm always reluctant to let anyone have them away from me because...they're my kids. I see it as maybe how a life-long photographer not wanting just anyone to hold their expensive camera, or someone who spent years restoring their grandda's hotrod not wanting just anyone driving their car.


So, onto my query, i'll try to keep this as unbiased as i can- 

1.) i have a friend who was known, in part, for how much she never wanted to have kids.  I was the first one of my group of friends to get pregnant and at a friend's house warming party, everyone is asking me the regular (invasive, embarrassing) questions she approaches and says ""i never want to get pregnant and have kids."" like we've all heard before. i said ""Well then, you don't have to have them."" I thought that's what she'd wanted to hear all her life, especially from someone about to become a parent.... and i was wrong. She was utterly offended and i think that was the end of our already fading friendship. She sent a nice little thoughtful gift for the baby and i thanked her and the next week i took her out to lunch with another friend, i left the baby with the in-laws. Apparently that was another slight because she said she felt i didn't want her around my baby. I thought we were having a social visit, she never asked to see him. I told her that i'd be more than happy to bring the baby by or she could come visit us. She never took me up on the offer.

2.) I have a cousin who was a teen after my first was born who was very ""no babies for me"". His mom asked to hold my baby, then promptly handed him to said cousin. He looked SO uncomfortable and was giving his mom the death glare while they were teasing him about not liking babies but how he better have one some day. He said he doesn't like holding babies. I took the baby back and said ""well, i don't want you to hold him if you don't want to hold him"". I felt it was fucked up to use my son as a pawn to make someone else uncomfortable and, you know, pissing off my cousin like that. Obviously his mommy was so offended i dared say anything against my cousin's paternal instincts or whatever but, my cousin also looked hurt at me.

3.) Not quite a childfree, but my BiL is the type who does not like kids that aren't his.  So, my sister knew that he wouldn't want to hold my daughter when she was born. I don't really spend that much time with him so i didn't know he didn't like babies. We went to a big family dinner with out of town family and i  had gotten up to use the bathroom, leaving my kids in the care of my grandparents and my aunt (my pissed-off cousin from the last story and his family wasn't there). I came back and my BiL is holding my daughter and my sister is laughing and taking pictures, cooing how cute it was. They have two kids of their own at this point but, he's a darker race than my family so, it was pretty contrasting, a mexican man holding my pasty white baby. He asked me directly to ""take this thing"" (not in a mean way) when i got back and my sister pouted and gave me a sly smile. I said ""that's alright. I don't mind you not holding her because i don't want you to hold her if you don't want to."" He scoffed and said ""not like i was going to drop her or anything"" i said ""no, i didn't think you were but, maybe she doesn't want to be held by someone who doesn't want to hold her?"" He let it go from there.



I wanted to add the only time i felt i got it right was, funny enough, hours after i had my second born--
The hospital i had my kids at is a training hospital and some of the nurses had medical professionals-in-training shadowing them who were not going to be in ob/gyn field but were learning hospital policies or something. In recovery, with a baby on my boob, this intern(?) is talking to me about how he's not sure he wants kids and working with babies had him thinking about it. I said ""well, i firmly stand by 'if you don't want kids, don't have them'"" as matter-of-factly as i could and he stopped and nodded his head saying ""you're right. I'm not even seeing anyone right now."" and went on to say how his family pressures him for future generations because he's almost finished with his **education and beginning his career.

And feel so shitty about it, she has abusive boyfriends before me, ones that cheated on her or controlled her, before me she never enjoyed sex, Noone had taken care of her like I had, I wasn't putting her on a throne my any means too as I challenged her and didn't do everything she wanted me to if it was unreasonable. We had a great give and take relationship. But she broke it off like it was nothing. 

When we broke up she said it was distance and if I went back to the same uni (I was possibly transferring) we could try again, when I texted her I was coming back she acted like she didn't care. When she broke up with me she said she wanted me to keep her update on the school situation, ad se said she wished I didn't get accepted into the other uni so I could stay. It just makes no sense how I could mean so much to her then I'm nothing.  We have the same friend group so I'll have to see her again. And it sucks. I just need support"

As a little bit of background, I'll be entering my last year of undergrad in the Fall (public health major, if that matters) and next year I'll also have an internship lined up where I get to volunteer at a health clinic for an underserved area (will this count as HCE?)

After graduation, I'm definitely going to be taking at least a couple years off of school to gain experience and finish up prereqs at my local community college. And I wanted to ask what the best way to go about gaining hours and experience was. This summer in particular, I have a lot of free time. Should I use this summer to get some sort of medical assistant license? How long does those usually take? Should I go for EMT or CNA? does scribing require a license?

What other things can I do this summer to be as productive as possible? I really wanted to work but I'm living back home for the summer and most employers won't hire seasonally. Should I take the GRE if i haven't yet? How important are bls certifications? 

Ideally, i want to be able to find an HCE job right after I graduate next year so I want to ensure I do everything I can to make that transition as smooth as possible while i have this summer wide open.

Thanks in advance everyone, I really appreciate it.

3c1zvq,10,2015-07-03,I just realized at 30 y/o I still have no autonomy,psaeruginosa,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3c1zvq/i_just_realized_at_30_yo_i_still_have_no_autonomy/,"I'm 30 years old. I've been out of Nmom's house since the second I was old enough to sign the lease. I finally bought a house last fall. I thought we were making progress the last few months until today happened.

So aside from the fact that Nmom has totally set the gold standard of how to treat me as an adult to edad, I thought things were getting better. Dad works two jobs and has limited time so he helps with some things around the house when he can. He's recently stopped notifying me of when he is going to show up and just drops by. It doesn't matter if I'm home or at work. He thinks, because of Nmom sending him over and telling him I said it was ok (I said it was okay if he wanted to work on the house; not to just let himself in whenever he wanted to without telling me) that he can just waltz in. I literally  don't know if he's been here until he tells me. He usually comes while I'm at work because I work two jobs and I'm pretty much always at work. Or sometimes I get a text about where something is and that's how I know he's been by.

So today, while I'm in the middle of working 112, yes one-hundred and twelve, days without a day off (covering vacations between the two jobs and a summer internship is how that happened), I talk to her and tell her I got some housewares in the mail I had ordered from a friend's party. ""They are going to look great in the spare room"" I say. She says ""Okay while you're at work tomorrow we will bring over that furniture and get it set up.""

Backstory: ""The furniture"" is mine that my dead grandmother left me twenty years ago that I haven't been allowed to take. She said she would give it to me when I moved into the house. I mentioned it several times last fall and throughout the winter and finally chalked it up to a loss that I would never get that bedroom set. 

So she picks tonight to tell me that she's coming over, which means instead of doing other things I have to do, I now need to clean a room and make sure there's nothing laying out - or even just not well hidden - that isn't her business otherwise I get grilled about why my gas bill is higher than hers, etc. I'm actually participating in direct sales for some extra money in hopes I can quit job #2 (which is stressful and has terrible hours) and I haven't told her. You all have Ns in your life. I don't have to go into what will happen if she ""finds"" my inventory and paperwork about this sales thing without telling her first.

I can't say ""no"" to them bringing over the furniture tomorrow because I can't do it without an emotional breakdown tonight. Whenever I say ""no"" to a selfish offer of help like this, I'm the asshole. I'm the ungrateful bitch. And it will be held against me until one of us winds up in the ground.

I'm so sick of living like this! I know what I have to do but I don't even have time to rest before the battle and I can't go in dog tired or I'll never win but this has to stop! Sane people don't own their own homes and have parents who don't even knock and are at their house more than they are! THIS is the definition of dysfunction. My family should be a case for Dr. Phil!"

Looking for cheaper Hyalis alternative,al_claire,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3c21sn/hyaluronic_acid_moisturizer_recommendations_or/,"Went to derm to have some questions answered only to have the derm, np, two interns, and assistant get up in my face about buying this or that. The one good recommendation I got was for a hyaluronic acid moisturizer called [Hyalis](http://www.neocutis.com/product/detail/12). I didn't buy anything at the derm's office, but I researched Hyalis at home. Looks pretty good! Only thing holding me back is price and that on the ingredients list it has methylparaben, sodium butylparaben, sodium propylparaben, which I just try to stay away from I guess. I have read that the link between parabens and breast cancer (or any other maladies for that matter) in cosmetics is low, but I would rather skip the potential risk.

Here are my options so far:

*  [Home Health Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Cream -- 4 oz](http://www.vitacost.com/home-health-hyaluronic-acid-moisturizing-cream?csrc=GPF-PA-318858120567&amp;ci_gpa=pla&amp;ci_kw=&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=318858120567&amp;gclid=CN7Gq8miwbYCFQ6nnQod00YAPw) Way cheaper and 4 oz instead of 0.5 or 1 oz like Hyalis. Ingredient list gives indication that it probably isn't as potent. Got good reviews though.
* [Pure Hydration by GloProfessional](http://www.gloprofessional.com/pure-hydration-124) Less expensive than Hyalis but more expensive than the one above. Has alcohol.

I was doing okay until I found it. Not great mind you, but okay. Now I'm back to struggling to get out of bed and crying randomly throughout the day. It's been a month and I still miss you every single fucking day. 

I miss talking to you and laughing with you. I miss your voice. I miss the way you smell. I miss teasing you about how seriously you take everything and then kissing you and falling into bed. 

I still don't understand what happened. You dumped me two days before I signed my divorce papers. You begged me to leave them. You begged me to do it quickly. You made me tell them about you and then you acted all weird about it when I did. You gave me herpes. After I got the abortion you said you were uncomfortable with me being so emotional. I gave up my internship. My degree. My family's respect. I did everything for you because you promised me you loved me. That you were committed.

And then you dumped me and told me its because I'm unattractive and you're not in love with me anymore. Out of nowhere.

Three years. Three years of thinking I could trust you. Three years to ruin my life and act like I'm crazy for not taking it like we had been only dating a week. You cut me out of your life so you could fuck other people without feeling guilty. Out of nowhere I was alone and stupid for believing anyone could love me. 

But still I miss you. Fuck. I miss you so much. I just want it to stop hurting. But you'll never call me again. Never want me again. Who would right? Isn't that what you said? 

Why won't this stop... And why did you do this? What the hell happened. I just want to stop hurting. I want to not be in pain. I want to not love you. I really want to not miss you.

But I do. I keep wishing you would call. Im so fucking stupid.

3c29c0,0,2015-07-03,I [19 F] am a lesbian who is developing feelings for a guy [19 M] who I haven't been honest with,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3c29c0/i_19_f_am_a_lesbian_who_is_developing_feelings/,"I've identified as a lesbian since I was about 11 years old, and it's been a huge part of my identity. I am now in Honolulu for a summer internship, and have been having a hard time connecting with the queer community here the way I do in NYC.

Partly out of loneliness and partly out of a desire for validation, I changed my Tinder settings to begin looking for guys. The initial plan was to simply fish for compliments to stroke my ego, but I eventually thought it would be hilarious to go on lots of first dates, get free meals out of these guys, and never contact them again.

I started doing that and it was initially hilarious and great for my ego as expected. I should have seen this coming, but I actually had a really great date with this one guy [19M] and have plans to see him again.

I have never been romantically involved with a man in any capacity, and that ""gold star status"" is a bit of a point of pride for me within my gay community. My friends would almost certainly give me a hard time if they learned my summer fling was with a dude, and having any sort of relationship with this guy would cause me to feel a bit guilty about continuing to staunchly identify as a lesbian.

There's also the concern that he has some issues with substance abuse and potentially with past violence, and I am amazed at how I find myself completely not caring about all of the red flags that have shown up. 

Should I avoid pursuing this guy because of the red flags about drugs and violence, should I appraise my enduring identity as a lesbian above my desire for an ill-fated summer fling, or should I just live completely in the moment and just do what feels right?

I realize I have less than 2 months left before school starts and I was suggesting if anyone could help me with any advice with what I can do to truly boost my application. Note that my GPA is fairly high with a strong amount of AP classes taken, my EC's are mediocre at best, and have few volunteer hours; that is why I ask anyone here with any suggestions to tell me what I can do with my remaining time.

I've had a friend for a year and a half and I fell in love with her. She's dating a guy but right when school was ending they broke up. I figured if I didn't do anything at that point the answer would be no, but I was leaving for an internship for the Summer/Fall and wouldn't be back for 7 months. I drove over, confessed my feelings, got the poor girl confused and she accepted my feelings. My selfishness confused the both of us but at the moment we thought we were going to be okay.

I left and we started texting heavily. Her feelings for me got deep really fast and she started wanting to be in a relationship and to wait for me to return. This was too fast, but optimistic me went with it and happily took on the boyfriend title. We sexted, she confided deep things about her to me, and overall we were feeling good about how we'd be together.

I've been at the internship across the country from her for over a month now. We've both been freaking out but for different reasons. I was freaking out because I assumed too much from her. I confused her then tried to make her commit to me (none of this on purpose of course). I came into the situation a year and a half in love with this girl, so I was being clingy and unfair to her (my words, not hers). She was freaking out because she wanted to be with me but she was scared of how the LDR was turning out. She just broke up with this guy, she hasn't had any time to recollect, do any soul searching, nor figure out what she really wants.

This morning (feels like days ago) she sent me a text saying this wasn't going to work. We weren't in a situation to give ""us"" a fair shot. She was correct, but then she asked if I wanted to just be friends for now. I wanted to but I admitted holding in how I feel would hurt me in the long run, so we said goodbye for now. When I return to school in January she said maybe we can start over and love each other the right way, depending if the situation is right by then. We just can't wait for each other in order for her to really know who she is, and not as an extension of me.

How should I feel? Can I text her in a couple months to see how she's doing? I'm really lost, so thanks for any advice you're able/care to give. I just want to feel better.

TLDR; Started LDR out of nothing, didn't work but it could resume later or maybe not, not sure how to feel at all right now."
3c2j4x,1,2015-07-04,"SIMMONS &amp; LABISSIERE: The 2016 Draft, and Why SEC Basketball Is Back",[deleted],test,https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/3c2j4x/simmons_labissiere_the_2016_draft_and_why_sec/,"*I know it’s been less than a week since the NBA draft, but I’m a draft junkie, and I can’t help myself.*

I should start off by saying that I’m a huge fan of Ben Simmons. I lived in New Orleans as a young kid, I recently graduated from Tulane, and I’ve been a die-hard devotee of LSU athletics for years. One of my fondest memories was watching Tyrus Thomas and Big Baby Davis beat Duke in the NCAA tournament. Fast-forward to my junior year of college, when I studied abroad in Sydney, Australia. We visited Melbourne, where the Australian Institute of Sport is located. For the uninitiated, the AIS is exactly what it sounds like: a government institution that finds and develops Australia’s best amateur athletes. Founded in part due to the “national embarrassment” of not winning a gold medal in the 1976 Olympics, I thought the whole concept was pretty awesome. I thought about what it would be like if the U.S. funneled its athletes into an institution like that, and I started to consider the hypotheticals. What if the United States replaced AAU with a federal program for developing basketball players? Would LeBron be playing goalie for the USMNT right now? Would Portland have been the 4th seed?

***The Man-Child from Down Under***

*SIMMONS:*

*Hometown*: Melbourne, Australia

*School*: LSU

*Age*: 18 (7/20/96)

*Height*: 6’10’

*Weight*: 240 lbs.

*NBA position*: SF/PF

*Wingspan*: 6’11’’

Anyways, my love for LSU sports and my firsthand exposure to Australian basketball led me to Ben Simmons pretty early on. Long story short, I’m sold on the guy. I’ve said this elsewhere in /r/nba, but I think he’s the next big thing to hit the NBA. Comparing amateurs to established stars is always touchy, but if there’s anyone to compare him to, it’s LeBron James. Simmons is 6’10’’, he’s built like a tank, he’s a fluid athlete, and he’s most comfortable with the ball, making plays happen and finding his teammates. It seems like the label “point-forward” is thrown around pretty liberally, but when I think of what a point-forward is – a forward who can literally assume a PG’s responsibilities for a whole game – they seem to be a pretty rare occurrence. Magic and LeBron are the two easiest examples.

Living up to those two is a tall task, but when you watch Simmons play, it’s hard not to be reminded of LeBron. Despite his incredible frame and strength, Simmons’ most impressive skill is his passing ability and court vision. He’s unselfish, and he appears to understand how important it is to get the whole team involved if you want to be successful. He’s got an immaculate basketball pedigree, and maybe most impressively, he seems legitimately down-to-earth. Every blue-blood program in America recruited him, and he ended up choosing LSU – to be near his god-father (assistant coach David Patrick) and to avoid the media frenzy at schools like Kentucky. He chose a football school that – outside of Shaq and Pete Maravich – doesn’t boast much tradition in the way of basketball, because he wants to focus on his game, and nothing else.

It should be obvious that I think Simmons is the total package. I’d be comfortable deeming him the best prospect to enter the draft since Anthony Davis, and one of the top prospects of the past decade. Considering his position as the #1 pick in most 2016 mock drafts, I don’t think my evaluation of him is that outlandish. He should be a no-brainer for whoever lands the top pick. But I’m also not calling the shots for any of next year’s lottery teams, and watching Karl-Anthony Towns dethrone Jahlil Okafor over the past year showed that NBA teams are willing to invest in potential and style-of-play over tangible basketball skill. That brings me to Skal Labissiere, and the reason why Simmons might lose his claim to the #1 pick.

***The Haitian Revolution***

*LABISSIERE:*

*Hometown*: Port-au-Prince, Haiti

*School*: Kentucky

*Age*: 19 (3/18/96)

*Height*: 7’0’’

*Weight*: 216 lbs.

*NBA Position*: PF/C

*Wingspan*: 7’1.5’’

When I started poking around the internet, looking at 2016 mock drafts, I was initially shocked. DraftExpress is my go-to for draft information – they’re typically pretty reasonable and informed – and they currently have Ben Simmons ranked 3rd in next year’s draft. Flabbergasted, I feverishly researched the two players ranked ahead of him. And after my research, I can say these two things confidently:

1. A DX intern must have made a mistake when formatting the mock draft, as no sane man would rank Jaylen Brown ahead of Simmons.

2. Simmons should be ranked #1. But if there’s anyone I can imagine usurping this spot, it’s Skal Labissiere, the lanky Haitian big man.

Labissiere has an amazing story. Born in Port-au-Prince, Skal grew up playing soccer, and he was in Haiti when the earthquake hit in 2010. His house collapsed on top of him, and he was saved by his father after being buried for 3 hours with the rest of his family. The natural disaster provided a humanitarian basis for his migration to the United States. A charity – called “Reach Your Dream” – helped Skal get to Evangelical Christian High School in Memphis, and after being denied a high school transfer he was deemed ineligible to play his senior year. In response, merely days before the season started, Labissiere announced that he’d be playing for Reach Your Dream Prep (RYDP) – a “prep” school created with the sole purpose of allowing Skal to play basketball.

He then committed to Kentucky, and one look at the guy says that he’s a worthy replacement for Karl-Anthony Towns. He’s a legitimate 7’0’’, with a great frame for adding bulk and impressive agility. He’s drawn comparisons to LaMarcus Aldridge, due to his incredibly sweet jumper. Skal has great range for a big man, and he’s shown impressive playmaking skills for a player his size. Not many big men can create their own shot, but Skal is one of them. He’s also got great defensive instincts and potential. Long story short, he has the look of the kind of modern big man that NBA teams fawn over.

***Why You Should Watch The SEC This Year***

After researching Skal, I still think Simmons is a no-brainer for the top pick in next year’s draft, and I think everyone else will realize this once they see him dominate college basketball. However, I’m no longer naïve. I can envision a scenario where a team (probably the Kings) might decide they’d rather have the sweet shooting 7-footer instead of the 6’10 forward with a less-than-reliable jump shot. Do I think this will happen? No. If it does, is that team making a huge mistake? Yes. But considering the amount of over-thinking that seems to go into preparing for the draft, I wouldn’t be totally shocked.

Until next June though, everyone should sit back and enjoy the newly competitive SEC. LSU has Simmons and Antonio Blakeney, Malik Newman made the surprising choice to attend Mississippi State, and Kentucky has another blue-chip class with Labissiere and Isaiah Briscoe. I haven’t been this excited for LSU basketball in years, and I can’t wait to watch Simmons and Labissiere face-off knowing there’s a little more than usual on the line."
3c2nrb,1,2015-07-04,Constantly feel lonely and like a huge loser compared to my girlfriend,SadThrowaway35806,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3c2nrb/constantly_feel_lonely_and_like_a_huge_loser/,"I didn't get much response from /r/relationships about this so I've decided to post it here as well. In any event, I'm using a throwaway because some friends know my username, but I doubt any will see this so I'll be fairly specific.

So as a bit of background, both my girlfriend (I'll call her Rachel in this) and I have been together since our senior year of high school and we both currently attend a pretty prestigious university for Engineering. College, in general, has been kinder to her than it has to me. While we both have had ups and downs with the stress and workload of school, she's had a much better time socially than I have.

Freshmen year despite my best attempts I was honestly unable to make friends. I lived with two of my best friends from high school, but they were pretty antisocial and I used them as a crutch throughout the year. I wanted to go out and meet new people and have the college experience, but I didn't really know where to start and in the past I'd play off friends to make new ones. Rachel and her best friends/other friends of mine didn't have this issue. I would on occasion tag along with them, but it's only so often that a guy can hang out exclusively with girls. I also tried joining clubs, but never really found an in to anything.

Anyway, this inability to find friends and hearing stories of fun times from Rachel and our friends that I wasn't there for sorta gave me these constant feeling of loneliness and of being unwanted even when around people. This led to tension between Rachel and I because we both know that I can't use her as a crutch emotionally for everything and that I need my own friends. 

To summarize the following two years, we both had internships the following summers, though always in the same state as the school and my hometown friends who I was happy to see. My sophomore year I lived in a single dorm which was great for spending time with Rachel, but overall only piled on my feelings of loneliness. Junior year I moved in with a more social friend from high school, but the year had a hellish workload for me and everyone I was friendly with. It was a better year, but hampered by all that.

With that background in mind, Rachel and I have both now taken up internships out of state; I am in Washington D.C. and she's in Portland, Oregon. I was very excited for this summer and was hoping the new city could be a positive fresh start for me. Sadly, that hasn't been the case. There are plenty of fresh-out-of college people at my work, but they all seem to travel every weekend and I haven't been able to really make any good friends there. I had hoped my roommate, another student from my school, would want to do things with me, but that hasn't been the case. When I try to go out and do things I invite him along but he tends to reject the offer and he has friends who live down in the area. It doesn't help the feelings of being unwanted that he doesn't invite me along when he does stuff. We get along well, but I had hoped for a partner in this.

I've tried going to meetups, going out to bars to meet people my age, just being generally my friendly self, but it's hard. Everything is expensive as hell here so I can't sustain doing stuff all the time. The people I've met, though nice and I've had good conversations with, are never really around my age and thus we don't have a ton in common. Most days I just go to work, come home and collapse, workout, eat and go to bed. Then I lay in bed and stay on my phone until really late to talk to Rachel as much as I can in a day. It's been a month and a half and I still haven't made any friends to just do things with and I just feel lonely all the time.

Meanwhile, Rachel has been having the best summer of her life in Portland. I can't help but be jealous when I hear about everything she's doing. She has a good group of young friends from work and was immediately invited to go out and do things by her roommates. She's had tons of firsts and plans to have tons more. Meanwhile, I just feel awful about myself when everything I try doesn't net me anything to write home about. Most days I end up with a pit of sadness in my chest as I wait for her to respond to a text message while she's out at a bar, or at the beach, or just experiencing life. 

It just feels awful to be the shitty half of a relationship. A lot of the time I feel like maybe there's something broken with me. At this point, I'm not really sure what to do. I promised Rachel that we would have amazing adventures to tell each other about, but my half of the bargain isn't being fulfilled. I just feel like a colossal loser who just lucked into having such a great girlfriend and that maybe she'd be better off with somebody else. Not sure what the question I'm specifically asking is, but I'd like some input and some advice on what to do to get over this.



   
**tl;dr**: GIrlfriend's in Portland and I'm in DC for internships. She's having an amazing time and I haven't done anything and feel lonelier by the minute. Any advice on what to do to get over this is welcomed."

So some background: I’m 26M, overweight, and the epitome of self-hating and rock bottom self-esteem. I grew up being bullied for my weight and sensitivity. Then, I’d come home to a father with a scary explosive temper, and a mother who was busy caring for my younger sister and grandmother (Alzheimer’s). As a result I’m a very shy, quiet, and guarded. I usually mumble my opinions, because I’ll do anything to avoid conflict, and I’m distant with my peers so I don’t have to worry about rejection or abandonment. Last year I moved to a new State to attend Law School, and basically start my life over…or so I thought. I had been unemployed for a year after undergrad and then was back working in kitchens and fed up with my fucking life, and my shit-hole town. The resulting depression caused my first and only relationship to end. So, I applied to law school, got accepted, and left, knowing that there was nothing left for me in that place.

Over the last year I’ve dealt with crippling feelings of hopelessness, self-loathing, and sadness. I’m a workaholic, and so my life revolves around my education right now. I spend all of my time at the school or with people from there. I get along with my colleagues, but since I’m also actively competing with them in order to keep the little scholarship that I have, I find it hard to really open up. Second, all my colleagues seem to either be married or in serious relationships, and I get reminded of my single status all the time, and in a new city with few friends outside of school I find it heartbreaking. I’ve tried online dating, but I know that since I’m unattractive it’s basically a worthless prospect, and the two terrible dates, and the series of one-sided conversations I have to show for it prove this. To remedy this I started working out and drastically changing my diet. It’s worked, I’ve lost 30-40lbs… but I’ve to at least 110 to go. I used to lurk fatpeoplehate to motivate myself, and now whenever I look in the mirror I can’t stand it. I’m trying so hard, and I’ve lost one of my major sources of happiness: food. Now it’s the enemy, and I punish myself severely when I fall back on my old favorites. I see myself as the disgusting creature that I am, and I’m stuck looking in the mirror at this body I hate, until I reach that damn goal….

Now to top it all off, I’m basically broke financially, swimming in seemingly impossible and ever increasing debt, and trying to look for a cheaper place to live in the fall before my housing falls through and so I have a little cash saved up to live when I’m taking the BAR and trying to find a job. I can’t go back home, I’d never feel welcomed back, and thinking about trying to live at home, pay off this debt, and find and work the meaningless and thankless the kinds of jobs I tried so hard to avoid after going to school makes me so ashamed. I actually like the kinds of things I’m doing in school. I even paid $8,000 for the luxury of having an internship in another State, just to get some, any work experience to make myself marketable in the field. But, now I’m just depressed as hell. I feel like I’m drowning, and it kind of scares me that drowning sounds pretty good right about now. 

I should be so happy that I’m doing work, and good work (interning for child advocacy agency), still eating, and even improving my health. Then I look around at my peers: in good jobs they didn’t desperately apply for at the last second because they got rejected from all the others; spending money and not breaking a sweat; with loving SOs who support them; and generally just having a good time. And here I am: fat; alone; always checking my bank account; wondering if I should go out when I clearly can’t afford it, or risk that my only friends here might not continue inviting me to social events if I keep turning them down. I’m also really worried about finding a job in the future. I don’t think I could make it through another extend bout of unemployment.

**TL;DR**: Fat, worthless person feels isolated and depressed after moving to a new city, because law school keeps him too busy to really connect with the outside world or others, and has drained all of his financial resources. Feels guilty because he’s losing weight, in law school, not homeless, but still feeling depressed.

The film is mostly a two hander between Binoche and Stewart. The young assistant cant understand it, but Assayas certainly can, so that he made Maria 40 instead of 50 may simply be a consolation to a great stars vanity a playing out of the movies themes from outside the movie, as well as within. Valentine responds, saying that even if the movie is full of simplistic sci fi pop psychology, it is no deeper than a more serious film. That film is set on a spaceship and features characters with neon hairdos and colorful costumes shouting inane dialogue. As news of a re staging of Maloja Snake grips Hollywood, Maria ends up cast in the role of. The duo are on the way to Sils Maria, where the actor will accept an award on behalf of Wilhelm Melchior, a director who gave Maria her first shot at fame and also had a brief, passionate affair with her. For much of the film, Maria prepares to take on the role, while staying with her assistant in a country house in Sils Maria, Switzerland. It was nominated for six Cesar Awards the French equivalent of the Oscar and Stewart won best supporting actress the first American ever to win in that category. Dynamics ensue as Maria and Val s professional/personal worlds merge, and Maria faces the fact that a Hollywood starlet will fill the young role. Meanwhile, Chloë Grace Moretz makes the most of a small role as Jo Ann Ellis, the trashy, spoiled, foul mouthed substance abuser a Miley Cyrus of the cinema who gets the role of Helena in the new stage version. This image released by IFC Films shows Kristen Stewart in a scene from Clouds of Sils Maria. Current rating: based on 4 votes and 1 reviews. There is a scene around two thirds into, the latest film from French filmmaker Olivier Assayas, where forty something actor Maria Enders Juliette Binoche and her twenty something personal assistant Valentine Kristen Stewart go to see a goofy sci fi epic. Discussing the junky blockbuster afterward, Maria snorts at the headache inducing flick. Maria departs with her assistant Val to rehearse in Sils Maria, a remote area of the Alps, home of the real Maloja Snake a menacing weather phenomenon that sends clouds winding through the valley. The Maloja Snake is a long trail of clouds that snake through the peaks of the Sils Maria mountainside, and Assayas returns to this picturesque footage several times during the film. Clouds of Sils Marias most meta delight is watching Stewart, who is no stranger to tabloid fodder, play a character who skewers members of the press for their infatuation in the mundane daily lives of celebrities. Having played the triumphant younger woman, the prospect of playing the abject, groveling older woman distresses her and makes her hard to be around. Similar to Marias trouble sinking into the role of the older, more damaged and destructive woman, Binoche is also too good for this under written character. Binoche plays an international star whose career was launched 20 years earlier, when she acted in a play about a 20 year old woman who becomes the romantic obsession of a 40 year old woman. As Valentine would insist, Assayas latest drama is not a very deep movie underneath its art house clothing. Maria played Sigrid when she was only 18 and the attention she received for her portrayal jumpstarted her film career. Kristen Stewart, a fine actor whose reputation has dampened due to her involvement with the Twilight franchise, eases beautifully into a role of a woman both dazzled and diminished by the state of the movie business and celebrity culture. At 40, people still feel like theyre young, even if they grouse about getting older. Brilliant work by Juliette Binoche and K Stew. Binoche wanders around, trying to find purpose and meaning in the dialogue, just as Maria tries to bring something fresh out of this new reading of Maloja Snake. Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart shine through Clouds. But at 50, something kicks in, a psychological recognition that one is on the clock. Release date: April 10, 2015 Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver. Clouds of Sils Maria never comes close to the lofty heights of titles like All About Eve, Sunset Boulevar. Thats what Clouds of Sils Maria is about, a woman coming to terms with the universal clock. One wishes the Valentine character had been more singular and less of a construct of the screenplay. Now theres a hot new stage director who wants her to play the older woman, and though every instinct tells her not to do it, she agrees. Though a French film, Clouds of Sils Maria is mostly in English. She is always present in the moment and seems unable to fake a scene. The lucrative artistic detour that was Twilight is now behind her, and Stewart is resuming her position as one of our most ambitious and idiosyncratic young actresses. However, its commentary about Hollywood is not very sophisticated and the parallels between fiction and reality so obvious that little of them are clever. Assayas throws us into the middle of it from the first shot: Clouds of Sils Maria begins on a train, vibrating steadily as the actress American assistant juggles calls from various people in her boss complicated business and personal life. At the peak of her career, Maria is asked to perform in a new staging of the play Maloja Snake, whose film adaptation made her famous 20 years ago. When the subtext of Maria, her journey and desires are so obvious it can hardly be called subtext, there is not much room for an actor to cater the role to her own needs. The latest from director Summer Hours is a study in life transition that seems, for most of its running time, just a strangely arresting look into the private world of a European actress. Everything is written to glorify Sigrid and diminish Helena. In the play, Helena is a powerful woman who initiates an affair with a much younger intern, the ravishing Sigrid. The first time around, Maria played the young woman. Stewarts relaxation in front of the camera is something to marvel at. Valentine and Maria gaze at the screen, the former wearing a grin of goofy enjoyment, the latter bored, even taking off her 3D glasses to see if they are worth wearing. On the train, Valentine receives a call that Wilhelm has died. In clips that Maria and the audience watch on her tablet, Jo Anns appearance on talks shows come with a kind of sordid canned laughter, as audience members engage in schadenfreude, giggling at her intoxicated state. And the contrast with Binoche, who is twice Stewarts age and wired at a higher frequency, is simply fun to watch. In any case, Assayas has gracefully pulled off a difficult film, a rather long one made up of lots of conversation, that unfolds with the ease and seeming structurelessness of real life. "
3c3xco,23,2015-07-04,I hate my skin and it's bringing back horrible self esteem issues.,Ihatemyskinnowthrow,AsianBeauty,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3c3xco/i_hate_my_skin_and_its_bringing_back_horrible/,"Last  year,  I had the worst skin of my life.  Thanks to AB, it was nearly perfect. Now, I feel like I'm back where I started. 


Red PIH marks and at least 5 angry pimples not to mention a smattering of dark spots on my forehead. I'm just so frustrated. I'm in a Southeast Asian country  on an Internship and it's really bloody hot. I can't reapply my pasty white sunscreen without people thinking I'm a freak, so that rules out any AHA use for now. My products are half empty in an area where finding deodorant is a rarity ( which I brought a lot of, thank goodness), so I'm barely functioning enough to oil cleanse with Johnson's finest and some Neutrogena oil-free, since I ran out of my glorious pH balanced cleanser. Not to mention this city is polluted. 


Today was the first day I motivated myself to put on my already - oxidized vitamin C serum. I know it can get better, but I'm dreading going back to school in the fall and showing off my gross mug. I just want to throw in the towel and get a face transplant. I don't know how I can stay motivated to actually start using my routine again after seeing  how disgusting I look. 

How did you guys pull yourself out of a rut when you're feeling down about skin?

**EDIT**: Holy (tony) moly this community is wonderful! Thanks so much for your support, guys. Magically, 3/5 of the ""angry pimples"" faded away within a day or two of my making this post. It turns out that most of them were mosquito bites, which explains why they were oddly itchy and very red (I assumed they were cystic). The two remainders are just flat marks on my skin now. My PIH is fading. I've been committing to using my whole product lineup, no matter how tired I feel, for the past 3 days and I feel like my skin is going back to normal dewiness. While I was still applying sunscreen religiously, I found myself some spray on sunscreen that I can touch up throughout the day. All hail snail!"
3c3yw9,16,2015-07-04,Race Report: 5th Season 8k,Mr_New_Booty,AdvancedRunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/3c3yw9/race_report_5th_season_8k/,"I want to preface this by saying that the mile markers were in the right place and the course is USATF certified.

Yours truly is currently in Cedar Rapids, Iowa for an internship. Since I'm currently training for a 10 miler in August (the Crim for those familiar with it), I was looking for a race near me to gauge my fitness. Lo and behold, there's an 8k on the 4th of July that starts about 1.5 miles from my apartment.

**Training**

I've been hovering between 70 and 80 mpw for most of the summer now, with plans to peak at 90 in a few weeks. My legs have been dead tired recently since I've been doubling a lot and I had an 18 mile long run last week, but on Thursday they started to feel a lot better. I skipped my workout Thursday in order to rest up a little bit, and I did about 7 miles Friday. I'm starting to get into the highest volume stage of training, so I figured that with a race in a few days I was better served by getting mileage. My Tuesday workout was a 5 mile SS at 5:55 pace, so I figured worst case scenario I do that again. My goal (determined at the start of the summer) was 28:30, and I felt like I could be happy with that. I don't own racing flats, so I raced in a pair of Hoka Cliftons, some Nike shorts, and a singlet from my home town's track club. 

**Pre-race**

The race started at 8 AM, so I went to bed early, woke up at 5, and had some granola, almond milk, and cereal that's like raisin bran but with dried strawberries instead of raisins. May have had a bit too much of it, but I still felt good enough where I was confident I could run a respectable race. Since I live near the start, I left 40 minutes prior to the race, got in a roughly 2 mile warmup, and did some mechanics and strides.  I started chatting with a guy at the start line, we wished each other luck, and before I knew it the race was on. 

**The race** 

The first mile was relatively flat, and that combined with the fact that I had a lot of people near me led to me going out somewhat faster than planned. I crossed the mile marker in **5:25** with a pack of people who all seemed to know each other.

 We kept the pack together for about  the next half-mile or so, until eventually I started to pull away from them and found myself in as close to no-man's land as there was in this race. The course was now slightly downhill, enough to see it but not enough to really feel it. This mile came in at **5:28** and I felt great still. Overall time was 10:53.

Something important to know about this course is that, like the other race I had a report on, it was a true out and back course. After the 2 mile marker, there was a fairly sizeable downhill that led us in to a parking lot. We did a small loop in the parking lot, ran about 1/4 mile into the woods on a large trail, and hit the halfway point. I don't remember the split at halfway, I think it was around 13:55 or so. I didn't think much of it at the time since I was more focused on racing, but if it was, that was a 3:02 half mile.  I continued on my merry way, passing people, being passed, and being convinced that I hadn't slowed down at all. The big hill was actually really easy to go up, which was a nice surprise. What was not a nice surprise was when I checked my watch at the 3 mile mark and saw that I had just run a **6:02**, overall time 16:56.

So at this point I'm fairly shocked, since I hadn't felt like I had slowed down at all. The 3 mile marker was right where it was supposed to be, almost directly across from the 2 mile marker, and since as I said the course is USATF certified and the marker was where it was supposed to be on the course map I was confident that was the correct split. I was pretty pissed, since I knew this was going to be hard to come back from, if it was possible at all. To make matters worse, my stomach started to rebel. Maybe it was a residual effect from all the wine I drank Thursday night, maybe it was the almond milk, but I was convinced that I was going to puke, to the point where I warned someone passing me that it was about to get ugly. The people passing me were people I recognized, since I had dropped them at about 1.5 miles. That didn't help my confidence much either. I saw a water table, and one of the workers was kind enough to splash me with it. Despite all of this my pace felt fairly even, and when I saw my split was **5:25** all the pain seemed to go away and I got right back up on my horse. My total time was about 22:22.

My confidence back, I decided to set out to catch the people who had passed me during the previous two miles. It didn't take long to hawk down a few of them, but some, such as the woman who wound up 2nd overall, didn't come back all the way. At about 1 km out I could see the finish line, so I picked it up even more and kept on passing people. This was near enough to the finish line where the crowd was fairly thick and people were cheering, so I kept picking it up. At about 400 m to go, I reached my final form and kicked it in hard, passing people left and right. I've never had much of a kick, so now that I've been able to bring it in hard the past few races I'm really excited for cross country in the fall. Having a kick that people need to respect is a nice thing. I finished this part of the race in **5:26** for a total time of **27:48**, a 10 second pr and good for 35th or 36th I think (I just can't remember the number), and I went to cool down with the guy I had chatted with at the start. He ran something like 27:40 I think. He was in my sights for most of the race except the 3rd and a good part of the 4th mile, but I didn't kick hard enough to make up the ground I needed to beat him. The winner ran about 23:30.

After the cool down, I ate some granola bars and fruit snacks, drank some water, and ran home. I gave a quick race report to my dad over the phone and started typing this. I should probably shower now, I smell like ass. "
3c3zju,3,2015-07-04,What should I expect from my Java developer internship interview day? - plus some advise?,final60,learnjava,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/3c3zju/what_should_i_expect_from_my_java_developer/,"A couple of days ago I was approached online by a company that was looking to to hire a Java Developer. 

After explaining that I am about to start my final year of uni. They explained that they would still like to consider me for an intern role. Where I would work just 2 days per week.


So I have a couple of questions.

Firstly, when I spoke to the person that contacted me he came across a bit casual about the role he was suggesting, and I am concerned that I would be leaving a secure job that I have had for 6 years and that could see me to the end of uni. for a job role that may only last a couple of months. Are intern roles generally short term and insecure, or should I expect a minimum fixed term in my employment agreement?

Secondly, what exactly should I expect when I go for the interview? The person I spoke to said we would get to know each other better and they would test me to get an idea of my programming ability. But what specifically should I expect to get tested on? And what else normally happens?

I'm a rising senior in college with a double major in computer engineering and accounting. I've interned at PwC in their Risk Assurance practice and really enjoyed it. I also have an offer to intern at PayPal for a software engineer position this following summer. The latter pays 105k, and the former pays around 60k according to Glassdoor. 

People have warned me that software engineers don't have as regimented a promotional track as do any employee at the Big 4, and I would agree with that. So, do you think in three or four years, I would be making as much as my software engineer friends? 

I'm very curious to know what the 10 year career path looks like, including salary, for someone in the Risk Assurance practice in the Bay Area. 

Thanks for reading, I hope this question will help more people than just myself. "

Cost of attendance for me is about $25/26k/year and I'll be there at least 4 years, maybe 5 if I stay for a Masters. Living off campus might save me a few grand in housing so that's always an option down the road. I'll be staying on campus for sure my freshmen year though. Worst case scenario, I'll have $100k in loans(a little more if 5 years) (more than likely not private loans). Best case, I'll win the lottery. What will probably happen: Dad will sell some land, as much as I don't want him to have to do that, he has in a small town. It's pretty relaxing. Lots of trees and stuff, he likes gardening but with big trees so I don't know if that's still considered gardening. But I don't see it as farming either. Anyway, I don't like the idea of him having to give that up for meas much as much as he says it's cool and his job is to get me an education and all that. He also has some money in savings and retirement but I don't wanna soak it up even though he constantly reassures me he's fine and he can live just fine off of SS. He makes just under $60k/year. He's pretty minimalistic but still. I'll probably be working part time and will definitely be trying to get some internships in the summer which I've heard pay well. So if I can make like 30k in summer internships that would totally help though idk if that's being too optimistic. I'll have some subsidized and unsubsidized loans and my dad the parent plus loan but I definitely want to help pay it off any way that I can. I guess I'm really just looking for any tips or advice. Paying for college is very doable I just want to do it the best way possible. Thanks in advance"
3c558a,1,2015-07-04,Dr. Ronald McNair - Astronaut of the Challenger Mission,caroline199,Heroes_of_Color,https://www.reddit.com/r/Heroes_of_Color/comments/3c558a/dr_ronald_mcnair_astronaut_of_the_challenger/,"Ronald Ervin McNair, Ph.D. (October 21, 1950 – January 28, 1986) was a physicist and NASA astronaut. McNair died during the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger on mission STS-51-L.

Born in Lake City, South Carolina, he was raised by his parents, Pearl M. and Carl C. McNair, and had two brothers, Carl S. and Eric A. McNair.

In the summer of 1959, he refused to leave the segregated Lake City Public Library without being allowed to check out his books. After the police and his mother were called, he was allowed to borrow books from the library, which is now named after him. A child's book, Ron's Big Mission, offers a fictionalized account of this event.

McNair graduated as valedictorian of Carver High School in 1967.

In 1971 he received a bachelor's degree in engineering physics, magna cum laude, from North Carolina A&amp;T State University in Greensboro, North Carolina. McNair was a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. In 1976, he received a Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the guidance of Prof. Michael Feld, becoming nationally recognized for his work in the field of laser physics.

He received three honorary doctorates, a score of fellowships and commendations and achieved a black belt in karate.

After graduation from MIT, he became a staff physicist at the Hughes Research Lab in Malibu, California. McNair was a member of the Bahá'í Faith.

In 1978, Dr. McNair was selected as one of thirty-five applicants from a pool of ten thousand for the NASA astronaut program. He flew on STS-41-B aboard Challenger from 3–11 February 1984, as a mission specialist becoming the second African American and the first Bahá'í to fly in space.

Following this mission, Dr. McNair was selected for STS-51-L, which launched on 28 January 1986, and was subsequently killed when Challenger disintegrated nine miles above the Atlantic Ocean just 73 seconds after liftoff.

McNair was an accomplished saxophonist. Before his fateful last space shuttle mission he had worked with the composer Jean Michel Jarre on a piece of music for Jarre's then-upcoming album Rendez-Vous. It was intended that he would record his saxophone solo on board the Challenger, which would have made McNair's solo the first original piece of music to have been recorded in space (although the song ""Jingle Bells"" had been played on a harmonica during an earlier Gemini 6 spaceflight). However, the recording was never made as the flight ended in disaster and the deaths of its entire crew. The last of the Rendez-Vous pieces, (Last Rendez-Vous) had the additional name ""Ron's Piece"". Ron McNair was supposed to take part in the concert through a live feed.

When Ronald McNair was nine, the police and his mother were called because he wished to check out books from this library, which served only white patrons before he arrived. He said, ""I'll wait,"" to the lady and sat on the counter until the police and his mother arrived, and the officer said, ""Why don't you just give him the books?"" which the lady behind the counter reluctantly did. He said, ""Thank you, Ma'am,"" as he got the books.

Obviously it hasn't been that long since I was a med student myself, but it's been a while since I was a brand new 3rd year.  To be honest I don't really remember what that was like, and I thought this would be a good place to hear from you guys about your concerns and expectations for these first few months of the clinical years.  So tell me (us): what are you hoping to get out of this time?  Is there anything in particular that worries you?  What are some of the areas you feel you are weakest in, and how can we interns help?

Nowadays, I feel like I can't put time into learning anything like I used to. Everything is just like ""gotta get this done, gotta get that done"" and I don't feel like I am learning anything. This is affecting me in the rest of my life too. For example, when I have a 3 day weekend I was planning on having fun, but I'm not. I feel like it has affected my college life too, where I no longer enjoy my classes due to the workload.

Really, I just feel devastated and I can't really seem to get out of this. I am still doing an internship at the same company this summer and I don't really like it. I just feel so bogged down, like I don't want to be there.

I really want to get myself out of this hole but I don't know how I'm going to do it. It's hard to find things I enjoy. I remember in my first semester of college I was eager and excited and could put time into learning things like I wanted to do. Now MOOCs and any learning just seems slow and tedious."
3c5p45,5,2015-07-04,"Have been seriously thinking about emigrating to Nashville for over a year and need some advice please. (Read the wiki, NOT a ""good parts of town"" post)",GazzaON,nashville,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/3c5p45/have_been_seriously_thinking_about_emigrating_to/,"Hi,

I live in Dublin, Ireland. I just finished a degree in commercial modern music in May, and got my results and passed, so I'm officially finished college. I'm a songwriter, and an actor of relative success by Irish standards, but given that Ireland is so small, the acting/music scene isn't great here so I've been thinking about moving further afield. London, New York, and Berlin have always been the big three that take most of the creative Irish who leave, but I've never been able to get Nashville out of the back of my mind.

I'm not a country musician, but it's a genre I've always liked and I'd be interested in honing my skills at. I'm not looking to move to America and become a star or anything close, I just wanted to collaborate with people in the industry and become a better musician and writer. To be able to sing and write as well as people like Jennifer Nettles would be amazing.

The point of this post is just in the hopes that some people in this sub work or know people who work in the industry in Nashville and could tell me what it's like? Are there many places that could offer potential internships, and the likes? I don't mind working in a bar or a store to support myself, but I'd rather work in the industry if possible. Is there a bustling scene of writers and musicians there for collaboration, or is it just a lot of the same old people doing whatever they can to try and ""make it""?

And lastly, is there any kind of screen acting scene in Nashville at all?

This post won't set my mind for me, but if people were able to give me some insight into what life in Nashville would be like for a 23 year old Irish musician and songwriter, I'd certainly appreciate any and all input and advice. It's going to be a culture shock either way, but I'd hate to waste all the money trying to get the visas only to find that Nashville isn't what I thought it was at all.

Thanks so much,

Gazza"

**Species:** Human

**Age:**  24

**Physical Description:** A bit of a broad jaw, thick eyebrows, nose slighty on the more bulbous end, enough that is someone were to hear her last name they might suspect being at least partially Jewish. She's not too tall or short, standing at an even five feet, with broad shoulders and weighing around 130 lbs, a little bit on the heavier side for her height, but she is slightly big boned, and is in miraculous shape for someone who is always snacking on something. Her hair is done back into a ponytail with punk-like frontal fringe and a buzzed a bit on the sides, with lots of piercings in her ear that generally have to be removed at work. Its not uncommon to see her wearing thick safety goggles over her stylish glasses, and a bulletproof vest under her labcoat when at work at Deva Corp. 

[A drawing I sketched up a few weeks back, along with spoiler warnings for future developments](http://img13.deviantart.net/9231/i/2015/157/0/f/anna_weiss_hoffman_by_galihan-d8wbjjd.jpg)

**Personality:** 

She has a very down-to-Earth, yet head-in-the-clouds approach to life, firmly believing that metahuman individuals, despite having their exceptional talents, are no different than any other people and that people's choices are what make anyone ""super."" That said, she is fascinated with metahumans and the supernatural as a matter of personal interest and dedicates most of her time researching the pseudoscientific and dabbling in the occult to better understand people with extraordinary powers. 

While an incredible scientist, having invented a phenomenally advanced Superpower Suppression device at a young age, she did not do so for profit, instead licensing the device to law enforcement agencies for the purposes of maintaining public safety - wishing for the safety of both police and metahumans alike instead of having to encourage lethal force when incidents occur.  Almost always seen habitually drinking tea or nibbling on some sort of sweet snack when she doesn't have to abide by lab procedures. She is conscious of how much she does snack, however, and makes an effort to be active when she can to make up the difference, usually through yoga or practicing the hover board prototype she built in order to not have to own a car.  

She does not make friends that easily, being noticeably introverted and tends to keep to herself, most comfortable while in a lab, or at home while surrounded with scientific equipment or occult trinkets, and with access to snack foods. She enjoys the company of [Verassi,](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3c5ws1/verassi/) the homunculus that her grandfather passed down to her, which highlights that she has odd tastes of what is or isn't repulsive or obnoxious. 

**Backstory:**  

Anna's family emigrated from Austria to Cruxehn in the late 1930s, in an effort to avoid the Nazis, the Weiss-Hoffmans being a known family of alchemists, sorcerers, and philosophers of the occult who had been openly opposed the ideas of the Nazis when they were just a small club of angry antisemites who nobody suspected would grow popular enough to someday take the German chancellery. Ultimately, what Anna's great-grandfather  believed was that the rare, extraordinary  power of the legendary persons of old myths was not something attached to lost Aryan blood, but a hidden gift that could be found through all of humanity, and while he himself was unable to escape being captured by the Germans, he was able to smuggle out his family and his research. 

After the second world war, Anna's grandparents moved to America with their kids and their family's work to live peaceful lives and keep the research into superhumans a secret. Two generations later, Anna and her twin sister were born in Totenburg. Anna's sister happened to be born with superhuman powers, at a time where that city very strongly hated those who did. Anti metahuman riots were frequent, and violent, and cost Anna her sister when they were 8 years old, but this did not make Anna hate the world, instead it inspired her to find a way for people to get along. By the age of 11, while her family had moved to Millennium City, Anna wanted to someday move west where she could be a part of New Cascadia, which ha been rebuilt and was recovering from the total devestation that was a city-leveling earthquake and was a beacon of positive relations between metabeings and the regular populace. In the time being, she had to focus her efforts to make a difference in Millennium.  

When she was only 15, Anna had used her great-grandfather's research and the advice of the homunculus he passed onto her, to invent a device that would help change law enforcement and place her in the eyes of the world: a fifteen year old girl had invented a machine that could temporarily take away a metabeing's superpowers. Anna licensed this Superpower Suppression Device under the strict terms that it be not for profit, and only for the sake of not-harmful law enforcement so that incidents like the ones that killed her sister would not repeat themselves. 

Suffice to say, while she passed the chance to become a billionaire overnight, she had gotten the attention of Deva Corp who offered her many scholarship  and internship deals to pay her way through university at the Cascadia Institute of Technology. Anna accepted these offers and has since been attending school and doing research at Deva Corp's west coast laboratories. 

**Primary Residence:** 

A sizable  flathouse in Promenade, a short  commute to New Cascadia thanks to the train systems. 

**Personal Assets:**

 Lives rather comfortably with a steady income from her paid internship at Deva Corp. Numerous scholarships and government research grants are icing on the cake, but for the money she has, she still needs to work pretty long weeks to get her job done and keep her job. She has access to more of Deva Corp's research facility in New Cascadia than other interns would be expected to have, primarily thanks to her personal research requiring specialized resources and effectively earning her her own small office and personal lab access. She also has her own private lab at her own home where she can secretly research things off the record, as well as practice basic occult exercises. 

 She's published the patents for her Superpower Suppression device under not-for-profit copyleft for law enforcement use, even though she could have made millions if she'd just sold the thing to Deva Corp outright.  

**Equipment:** 

* Her laptop/tablet/PDA are highly advanced pieces of technology that have been designed to help detect and to some limited degree identify supernatural or metahuman powers. 

* She has a small, crystal pendant around her neck that helps serve as a focus to channel magic, but isn't anything especially powerful. More like something you'd pick up at a flea market or ""New Age Wiccan"" store that just actually happens to be vaguely mystical as advertised by coincidence despite the seller assuming it's just a rock. 

* Her primary means of defense is a handheld prototype version of her Superpower Suppressor device, effectively an energy pistol that can stun and neutralize metahuman threats without causing lasting harm except against targets whose health depends on superpowered aid. Still hurts very much for anyone to get shot. Vs endurance 4 to resist the stunning effects, willpower 5 to resist power suppression. Its batteries require recharging after three shoots, which takes an entire day to do so. 

* She is armed with a biometric-locked handgun that requires her fingerprints to fire, low caliber and only for self-defense as a very last resort. Danger 4. 

* For physical protection, Bulletproof vest, just in case, sometimes. Also, a helmet for when she's using her hover board.

* Speaking of which, she also built a hover board. It can cruise around 18 inches off the ground and about 20 mph. It has a battery life of around 2 hours, and takes about ten minutes to recharge its batteries. 

**Special Skills:**

* A talented researcher and scientist focusing on studying and inventing machines that involve metahuman abilities and the effects of supernatural forces on living beings. To this end, she is highly knowledgeable of things both scientific and, to a lesser degree, occult.

* Anna is fairly lingual, thanks to her family, personal interests, or having decided that learning the languages of the ethnic groups who make up a large amount of the population of her home city is useful. 
 * Fluent in German, acceptably literate enough to understand some bits of the common minority languages in New Cascadia and Promenade (Mandarin, Spanish, Japanese, etc.)  
 * Can read some ancient languages to a limited degree such as select phrases of Latin, ancient Greek, and Hebrew. Slightly more learned of Low German and Old Norse texts. She decided to pick these up since most genuinely occult texts tend to predate modern languages. 


**Powers:**

[Superpower Science](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Scientific_Prowess)

* [Superpower Research](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Ability_Intuition)

*  This is not that she can copy powers herself, but rather only used in the sense that she can learn about supowerpowers through research and observation in order to help aid those who are trying to become superheroes or to help find ways to fight supervillainy.  

 * Emphasis on Enhanced Inventing and research into the science of Metahuman powers.  

 * Ultra-limited, highly specific Superpower Manipulation  through controlled plot-developments - sick boy's life is saved through experimental medicine becomes metahuman, supervillain is arrested and has had his powers suppressed for a few weeks so he wont be able to break out right away, etc.

[Magic Empowerment](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Empowerment)

* It's not really that she is any sort of spellcaster, but in the presence of the supernatural and occult she does ever so slightly feel slightly more healthy and physically fit. She believes this to simply being the positive influence of mystical things in general. Any possible magical abilities herself are and on the extreme end of low, from being able to slightly flicker the flame of a candle, or causing the water in a cup to ripple, or an old window to rattle, all after extreme focus and concentration. Subject to improve with time and practice.

I'm a 21 y/o girl going to college, come from a pretty wealthy family, have an amazing boyfriend, and pretty good life. But, I get the waves of sadness that are just maddening. I'm generally happy and between working, being a full-time student, and my two internships I keep pretty busy. Not to sound conceited, but I think I'm a pretty girl, only because people tell me I am. But I just feel like everything is falling apart.

* My father raised me and my sister. My mother was a woman we saw once a year. She is bipolar and an alcoholic, so visits with her were horrifying and scarring. She then moved out of the country a little over three years ago and I haven't seen her since. I talk to her a few times a year.

* People that I've considered my best friends for years are no longer my friends. Three of these friendships ended in extremely dramatic ways, pretty much yelling/fighting then never talking again. I decided not to be friends with these people because they made me feel bad about myself, and it didn't feel like healthy friendships. 

* My father recently remarried a woman he had known for two months. On the second time meeting her, she was blackout drunk, sitting a bathtub full of her own puke. I had to clean this 45 y/o woman up and put her to bed and it just pissed me off having to take care of another alcoholic mother.

* My grades have been slipping and I feel like I have no friends. Sure, there's people I can call and hang out with, but it's not *friends.* I feel like they're just people I hang out with so I don't feel like a complete loser sitting around, doing nothing. I feel like everyone hates me and wants me out of their lives, and that I'm just an embarrassment to everyone who knows me.

* I've been to therapy before, but the woman just told me things I already knew about myself and it was frustrating. I also was on lexapro, and it was AMAZING, but it made me lazy and not as productive in school.

* I know this post is fucking stupid, and I know I don't have anything real to complain about and am probably just looking for an excuse to feel sorry for myself, but I need advice. It's like I'll be happy for weeks and then for a straight week or two I'm just sad and angry and hate myself. I'll be crying on and off and be thinking terrible things about myself and it's just unbearable. It's like I'm lying to myself, telling myself I'm happy for a while, then everything hits me at once and I realize I'm an unlikable, deeply flawed, fucking loser. Does anyone have any advice? Or has anyone experienced something similar? Thanks."
3c6ir4,1,2015-07-05,Dealing with depression and other bad stuff.,Scruffy_kid,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3c6ir4/dealing_with_depression_and_other_bad_stuff/,"Hey everyone, so this is my first post on Reddit, and it's sort of an odd one, being given a combination of ranting, asking for advise and just really needing someone to talk to. 

So I'm going to give you a *little* bit of information about myself and my life, just so that what I'm planning on telling you guys pretty much revolves around my current circumstances. All I'm asking is for you to keep an open mind. 

So I'm a 17 year old guy who has never really fit into the stereotypical ""normal"" life of a teenager. I left school at 15 to go study web development, and I did that for a year or so. During that time I met my current boyfriend, for the purpose of this story let's call him Frank. So Frank and I both lived in a town close to Cape Town in South Africa, where he was in marketing for a very nice five star hotel and I was studying in Cape Town. Now the thing is Frank is much older than me,15 years older to be exact, and while my parents are okay with my sexuality, they wont really agree with me dating a 32 year old. So for that reason I kept him a secret from my parents, spending weekends ""at my friends' house"" and so on. So the months went by like this, and things couldn't really get any better, I spent my time during the week in Cape Town during the day and playing vidya late into the nights, and weekends Frank and I would have amazing adventures across Cape Town and its surroundings. 

Then things changed. One day we were lying on his couch and he just suddenly brought up the fact that he had received a job offer for another hotel in Zanzibar,  and that he was leaving in a month. I was obviously shocked, and immediately started thinking about what would happen to us, because I wasn't prepared to do long distance. I remember him jokingly saying that he's going to fly me over and I'd live with him there. This was November last year. In December (after he had already moved to Zanzibar) he started bringing it up more and more, and eventually told me that he wants me to come.

I of course said I would love to, but there were some obvious obstacles: 1. I'm 17, so moving to Zanzibar would be tricky. 2. My parents will obviously not be all too excited if I told them out of the blue that I want to move to Zanzibar to live with my 32 year old boyfriend. 3. I needed a job in Zanzibar. I won't go into too much details, but in the end I was enrolled at the hotel he works for as an intern, and I moved to Zanzibar in March after my classes finished. 

It was such an impulsive decision that I never thought of the ramifications of moving so far away from home. The first month or so was amazing. It was like something out of a movie. We spent the weeks working together in the office, and every weekend we would go and stay in a different hotel somewhere on the island. Honestly the best time of my life. 

Then things started to change. Again. Frank bacame more and more frustrated with me, as I lack any form of experience in the hospitality industry, and rely on him learning me things as we go along. This is something that I did point out to him well before I came, and he said that he will gladly help me learn. Things escalated in the next few months to the point where he will be verbally abusing me, talking down on everything I do and never pointing out anything I did right. It was a roller coaster ride, going from being treated like a prince at home and then like a worthless nothing at work by the same person.

I have a history of depression, but I was mostly fine when I moved over. However the events described above has caused me to become more depressed than ever, and I am slowly losing my mind. I am detached from everything around me. Every waking moment feels like it's not real. I can't be convinced that what I am experiencing is real, even though it most certainly is. I am beginning to lose focus, and I am unable to do my job, which causes more frustration from Frank, and more abuse. I have been on anti depressants for a month now, but I am running out, and I don't believe there will be any more on the island. I am petrified of what will happen when I run out. 

So, the obvious solution to this is very simple, right? Go home. Well, it's a bit more complicated than that. South Africa has recently put a new law in placed where persons under the age of 18 cannot cross its borders without an unabridged birth certificate. Something which I do not have. I also do not have the money to buy tickets to go home, and Frank refuses to buy them for me. I am losing my grip as every second passes and I am afraid that I will not last much longer. 

If anyone has any advise for me, or anything to say at all, please do let me know. I need to talk to someone other than Frank. 

TL;DR: I'm stuck on an island with no escape and I'm going insane. "

I'm half way through a BSc Maths degree and at the stage where I need to pick options. I started this degree purely to become an actuary, and so I want to choose the options that will be the most useful on graduation, as well as the most appealing to an employer. In addition, I'm working on several skills outside of uni such as excel vba, but would appreciate advice and guidance on other areas I could work on.

Here is my plan for the next 2 years to graduation:

* take and pass the CT1 certificate in financial mathematics (registration opens tomorrow, exam in September);
* develop vba applications around the CT1 topics for practice, and have them on GitHub;
* get involved in many projects in my current job where I can apply mathematical modelling;
* choose modules that give more exposure to topics that will be useful as an actuary;
* contact actuarial companies before next summer, and instead of a normal six week internship offer 2-3 weeks (the most I could get away with in annual leave).
* make and maintain contacts in actuarial firms to increase exposure.

With regards to the options, I have three streams to consider:

* first is statistics heavy, with distribution theory, stochastics and time series etc.
* second is pure mathematics, lots of number theory, groups and finite fields
* third is mostly pure maths but with additional modules on calculus, models and transforms, and computational mathematics.

I'm leaning towards the last option, but some of the stats modules (particularly stochastics) seem interesting. 

I'd appreciate any advice, comments, criticism or otherwise that you are willing to give about my plan!"
3c6qf6,31,2015-07-05,Should I buy an apartment in NYC?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3c6qf6/should_i_buy_an_apartment_in_nyc/,"Okay so I'm meeting with a financial planner soon but I want to get as many different perspectives as possible!

My late father left my brothers and I £250,000 each (I'm from England), I don't have any student debt and I have around £30,000 in my bank account now.

In 2 weeks I'll be starting my 6 month internship in NYC, I'll be living in shared intern housing in manhattan for that time and providing everything goes well I'll have a job offer at the end for $83,000 annually (before tax), this is expected gradually to rise to $116,000 after 5 years.

NYC rent is so high and my father always told me how important it it to invest in property, my older brothers who live in Auckland, Copenhagen and London have all bought freeholds that they are living in. However I know that in NYC I would only be able to buy leaseholds, so it's not as safe an investment.

So I plan on renting during my 6 month internship and 1 year working, and then buying a 2 bed manhattan appartment for around $600,000 with a $375,000 deposit on a 10 year mortgage and renting out the spare room? 

So after tax I'll be spending around 50% of my income on the mortgage but also gaining around $700-$800 per month from the room rent.

Is this a good investment? Would the value depreciate as it's a leasehold?

I'm sorry if I sound really immature! Like I said I'm meeting with a financial planner but I really just wanted to gain some knowledge before I embarrass myself in front of them!

Thanks for all your help!

3c6sxp,154,2015-07-05,[Achievement Unlocked] Positive Net Worth,OntheFIpath,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/3c6sxp/achievement_unlocked_positive_net_worth/,"TLDR: I spent too much as a young professional. It was fun, but my finances started to get stressful. I went to the other extreme, forgoing current consumption and saving everything. That sucked too. Now I'm living a happy medium.


**Background:**

I've been reading /r/financialindependence for a long time now, and after my recent paycheck, I finally ran the numbers to see my current status, and wanted to share my journey with /r/financialindependence. 

I always loved working with my hands and building stuff. After spending most of high school in the machine shop building robots, I decided to go to engineering school. Engineers build cool shit, right? I realized quite quickly on that real engineers spend most of their time in front of a computer, and very little time actually building interesting things. I did a bunch of internships in the engineering field and this was about the time that the financial crisis was happening. Finance suddenly seemed a lot more interesting. I moved into finance as a junior quant and the lifestyle inflation went rampant. 


Over the next three years, I went through a large SUV, three motorcycles, and a shitload of nice, but ultimately useless stuff. It cumulated in my purchase of a brand new condo in the most fashionable district in town. Soon after moving in, things at work took a turn for the worse. I'm from a city where the financial industry is pretty small, so the chances of me finding another job like mine in the city were pretty small. I started interviewing and shortly after, I accepted a new job in New York. My brand new luxury apartment, which I had made into the ultimate bachelor pad? Rented out to a tenant at about even. Basically, I'm cashflow negative but slightly equity positive.


While living in New York, I realized how close to insolvency I was, and how a single or set of liquidity shocks could push me over the edge. I went swung far in the other direction, trying to save every extra dollar and cent. Since groceries cost nearly as much as eating out, I was eating from halal chicken carts or the neighborhood delis nearly every day. It was pretty miserable as I spent most of my time at home, not wanting to go out and spend money. I lasted six months in New York working for a firm that was on the edge of bankruptcy. 


I was overjoyed to accept a job in Hong Kong recently. Taxes are low (The IRS doesn't have a vice grip on my balls), and compensation is relatively high. I'm happy to say that I think I've reached a happy medium in my spending now. My monthly expenses end up being approximately 38% of my aftertax income, leaving me 62% to save and put toward my debt. My mortgage rate is fairly low, so I'm not planning to prepay it. I ran up my line of credit for awhile since I was travelling around Asia and dealing with immigration issues before starting work, so paying that down is my first priority.


I got my first paycheck last week. After breaking everything down and running the numbers, I realized that although I'm nowhere near my goals, at least I have positive net worth. Achievement unlocked.


Note: Numbers may not add up exactly. Lots of (very rough) currency conversions and rounding. Numbers are in USD

**Balance Sheet (July 2015)**

Current Assets:

- Emergency Fund: 9k (3 month expenses)


Illiquid Assets:


- Rental Property: 300 - 350k
- Tax-deferred retirement savings: $45k

Short Term Debt:

- LOC @ 7%: 11k
- Unsecured Loan @ 4%: 25k

Long Term Debt: 

- Mortgage @ 3%: 270k

Liquid Equity: -27k

Equity (minus property &amp; mortgage): 18k

Total Equity: 48k - 98k

**Income Statement:**

Income: 

- After Tax Monthly Salary: 7.3k

Expenses:

- Rent: $1500

- Food: $970

- Cellphone: $48

- Transportation: $48

- Other: $380

Total: $2900

Net: 4.4k

**FI Milestones:**

I'm currently living on about 36k/year, but I expect that lifestyle inflation will pick up, especially with a significant other and/or kids coming into the picture within the next few years. Hopefully, my compensation growth will outpace the lifestyle inflation. My guess is that 80k a year would fund a very comfortable retirement, so that's my current end goal.

I am currently studying in China, My friend was leaving for internship back home and doesn't use his Slim PS3 CECH 2012A so he gave it to me for free. But it's Disc Drive has problem, maybe needs new Lens cause games skips/lags sometimes (could be overheating due to dust also)

I gave it to PS3 repair person to downgrade to 3.55 / Flash to 3.55

1. Can you guys help me what to do next ? Install Roger/Habib 4.70 Update next ? I tried googling and searching around but it was quite confusing.

2. Can I use External HDD I use for PS3 for playing games via MultiMan, Can I use it to store other Stuff too?

3. I read I need to put one original disc at all times to play backup games, but I think Lens might be dying, you think it will create problem to play backup games, maybe eventually I won't be able to start games from MultiMan

I already have SuperSlim PS3 non jailbroken but games are so expensive to buy, That is why I want to have one Jailbroken PS3 also to play games.

Thanks
Have a nice Day"

3c7acq,0,2015-07-05,I basically have three weeks to look as sexy as possible. I have some questions about my diet &amp; exercise plan and would appreciate feedback.,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3c7acq/i_basically_have_three_weeks_to_look_as_sexy_as/,"My best friend is moving back home in nineteen days from today, and I want to look as good as possible when I see her.  I have some questions regarding my diet and exercise plan (starting tomorrow) and would appreciate any feedback or advice you guys might have.

I currently weigh ~150 pounds and stand at just about 5 ft. 9 in.  That’s more body fat than muscle.  I calculated my TDEE [here](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm) and found that my maintenance level is around 2,300 calories.  I’ve decided to eat between 1,800 and 2,000 calories per day.  I’m not interested in bulking and enjoy being skinny already.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My diet is definitely where my fitness as a whole is lacking.  I eat fairly healthily a lot of times and fairly unhealthily more than I’d like to.  Taking summer classes and working two jobs among other commitments means that I often figure out my meals whenever I get hungry and have the time to eat then.  In other words, meal planning is something that I’ve never really done.  My eating-out-to-cooking ratio leans too much towards eating out, though because I am such a busy person there are times when I hardly eat at all for a day.

Using the same link above, I calculated my macro ratios to be 25-40-35.  For a 2,000 calorie diet, that’s about 125g of carbs, 200g of protein, and 77g of fat per day.  That is just the “Low Carb” setting.  I really have no other basis for my macros being what they are.  Is there a more effective macro ratio for what I’m doing?  Starting a sort of flexible Paleo diet seems attractive to me, too.  How would that play into macros, and would they even matter that much if I went Paleo?  Regardless, I’ll be utilizing the MyFitnessPal app for Android to track my eating habits -- something that I have failed to do in the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I already exercise moderately, though certainly not as much as I used to.  Last summer I trained in MMA for ~15 hours per week.  Then I let myself go during the school year by making bad decisions in the dining hall and hardly ever working out.  My planned training schedule starting tomorrow includes Muay Thai on Monday and Wednesday nights, lifting plus running on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings, and an active recovery (likely cycling) on Sunday.  I used to spar on Friday nights but now work on Friday nights, so I’ll have to figure out what to do on Friday.

I began the StrongLifts 5x5 program this summer but haven’t lifted in a few weeks due to picking up an extremely time-intensive internship.  Last lift, my squats were 80 lbs, overhead press 60 lbs, deadlift 125 lbs, bench press 60 lbs, and row 80 lbs.  The squats were feeling easy; bench, row, and deadlift were moderate; and the overhead press was already pushing my limit.  Should I increase the weight load on any of these to start at a higher difficulty?  Is it false that doing this will give me faster results?  Clearly, I’m not a very strong guy to begin with so it’s not like I would be able to increase much.

In addition to the StrongLifts exercises, I am also going to add some sort of bodyweight pull-up and push-up routine and ab exercises (perhaps the 30 Day Abs Challenge).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any feedback and advice is greatly appreciated.  Not only do I want to look good in three weeks, but I want to live a healthier lifestyle overall.  Hopefully I can get into better habits now so that my next two semesters don’t find themselves in physical detriment like my previous two did.  Thanks, Fittit!"
3c7aji,370,2015-07-05,Alice Discovers HAES and Cundishuns,lookingformolle,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/3c7aji/alice_discovers_haes_and_cundishuns/,"**Recap:** I'm molle, shitlord in training for the military. I'm 5'8"" and was at my highest and miserable in college, at about 205 and about 32% bodyfat or so. I'm now 171 and about 24% bodyfat. Not spectacular, but I feel better. Alice and I survived law school together and are studying for the bar and working so we don't see each other a lot. She is 5'2"" and has been miserable about her weight the whole time I've known her. She was 272, lost it during a summer internship. The other day we sat down to catch up.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice and I went to Panera to catch up and the topic invariably turned to weight. ""You know I gained the 25 pounds back,"" Alice said around a mouthful of chocolate croissant, clearing a spot for the waitress to place her serving of tortellini and baguette on the table. ""Oh,"" I replied, arranging my face into an expression of sympathy as I stared at the croissant, my knuckles white as I gripped the cheap formica table. I simultaneously wanted to rip the pastry out of her fat hands and stuff it in my mouth as much as I wanted to light it on fire. ""Yeah,"" she continued, taking a long drink of sweet tea, ""I think my health cundishuns have something to do with it. And my elevated testosterone. You know how hard it is for me to lose weight. And I just don't think for normal people it's this hard.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Mmm...hmmm..."" I replied skeptically, sitting on my hands, hamstrings screaming from my MMA workout at 0600. ""What I mean,"" she continued quickly, obviously registering the look on my face, ""Is that all these doctors I go to for my birth control, y'know the one that makes me eat way more and stuff, they tell me to address my weight. They're all the same. They don't even want to see me until I lose, even though it doesn't help with my irregular periods and hormones. And the thing is, I've done that, and it doesn't work. "" I latch onto this immediately. ""Yeah, didn't you say you lost like 50 pounds in college?""

&amp;nbsp;

She nodded, spearing a few cheesy satchels of tortellini. The melted cheese strung out in slow motion and I took a giant bite of my apple as my stomach growled angrily. ""I did, but I gained it back in three months. Not that it mattered, you know. Nothing changed.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Ah, is three months really enough time to get your hormones back into whack?"" I asked. ""I mean I don't know,"" she replied with a shrug, ""I'm just sick of being told to lose weight, because like...what if it isn't that? And I go through all that and lose all the weight and it doesn't mean anything and then there's some underlying cundishion at the end of the road they refused to treat?""

&amp;nbsp;

At this point Alice is actually starting to get choked up a little. This is a sore subject for her and she was bullied in school for her weight, and lady-part/hormone issues run in her family. ""Well,"" I ventured tentatively, ""Aren't there other reasons you want to lose weight? Didn't you tell me you wanted to do it anyway?"" I watch her face as her brain visibly struggles to process this. I've dropped the hurt on her in the past via text message (at her request for my honest opinion on her weight loss) and she's trying to decide if she wants another session with the Molle who was been called ""as subtle as blunt-force trauma"". She doesn't.

&amp;nbsp;

""I just think that when I get these cundishuns under control and get on better birth control it'll be easier."" Content with this answer, Alice continues stuffing tortellini in her mouth, ""And hubby and I are really busy and stressed right now, so I just think it's not a good time, and I'm sooo sick of hearing doctors telling me I'm not okay at this weight, and that I need to lose for them to treat whatever else is happening. And I know diets don't work...or I don't work, yeah, yeah,"" she says dismissively, paraphrasing my words, ""But I don't want to be miserable all the time.""

&amp;nbsp;


""What's your miserable?""

&amp;nbsp;

""Look, I can't live like you do,"" she responds with a sigh, ""I can't go through my whole life weighing food and counting calories, and being plugged into My Fitness Pal. I just look around and see how easy it is for some people. They just know how much their body needs intrinsically. And I just don't think it's supposed to be this hard.""

&amp;nbsp;

At this point I'm really refraining from ejecting the recycled, profanity-laden rant I've given in the past. She hasn't given any indication that she wants advice, she just wants to talk. This is one of the hardest lessons I had to learn, being around other girls-I'm a ""fixer"", like a lot of the guys I know, not a spectacular shoulder to just cry on. ""Look,"" I said relatively gently, ""Here's how I look at it. This is just my personal philosophy. It's a choice. It's not a choice once. It's a choice every day, every meal. Do I like counting calories? I'm not thrilled with it, but I do it. Because every meal I ask myself if I'm more miserable counting calories and weighing food or if I'm more miserable at the weight I'm at."" Silence. Alice is staring down at her plate, finishing off the last tortellini. I sound like every asshole who's ever tried to train someone on a reality show about losing weight, but I don't care.

&amp;nbsp;

""Hey, you still use your FitBit?"" I ask, trying to change the subject a bit, ""I added you as a buddy on there. We should do the daily showdown challenge, that one looks cool."" She shrugged, picking at her baguette. ""Hm? Yeah I still use it,"" she lied, ""It died a little while ago and I never bothered to recharge it."" The app shows no recent activity and her last badge was earned in February.  I was going to post our entire day's interaction, but part two will have to weight until next time, as this is getting long.

&amp;nbsp;

Believe it or not, it gets worse. "

3c7y2x,3,2015-07-05,Chick who seemed to be into me suddenly evades my advances for a second date: Advice?,DisciplesOfTheWatch,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3c7y2x/chick_who_seemed_to_be_into_me_suddenly_evades_my/,"To give this story some context, I live in India which is a very sexually repressed society. Both men and women have fantasies which they are scared of even talking about.

Long story short, I dated a potential slut for 5 years, most of it was long distance, was deeply in love with her. After reading TRP I realize that she displayed all the signs of being a potential slut. Who knows, she might have even lied about her being a virgin, cheating on me or previous partners (I'd rather not think about that now). She was insecure, needy and clingy too. I was relieved when she broke up with me because I didn't have the time to tell her that she was beautiful and special thrice a day over the phone. I was raised as an insecure beta, and when I was 17, I thought I'd die a virgin, and here came this 7.5/10 who was giving me butterflies and stripping for me on webcam. I had to say yes when she said she wanted a relationship with me. After we broke up, she fucked a lot of alphas and told me how much better they were in bed than I was. She also dated quite a few guys. So, after riding the cock carousel, she married a beta with an MBA from an Ivy League University (poor guy, sometimes I want to send an email about her past to him, her in laws and her parents). Since I was raised as an insecure needy beta, this fucked with my psyche and I went into a 5 year long depression. I still struggle with my demons. I got physical with 2 women after that who I never really connected with emotionally - either they turned me off or I just didn't enjoy whatever we shared.

All I crave for now is a woman who desires and appreciates me - some sexual intimacy with such a woman would be wonderful. Unfortunately, this is India, where every man is considered as Schrodinger's Rapist, so approaching women is hard.

I've read bits of Neil Strauss' book, and the peacocking works. I sing pretty well, so avoiding even looking at women while humming a nice tune has gotten me a LOT of attention. I can be quite charming and witty. Almost got a married coworker into making out with me. I didn't want to force her to. I've gotten sensual touches from cute cashiers, thanks to peacocking. Need to escalate.
 
Along came this intern at work who is 4-5 years younger than I am. Having read bits of Neil Strauss' book, I tried those techniques. I talked about hi-fi career stuff which she probably doesn't even know of. She is visibly impressed. This one time my friend in the cubicle adjacent to hers asked me if I wanted to grab lunch. She says 'I wanna join in too'. Then she doesn't order any food, which makes it clear that she's there to chat with me (most likely). Post lunch, we sit around having tea, and one by one, all the folks get up and go to their respective desks, leaving only the two of us. There is clear cheimistry, eye contact, butterflies, etc. She talks of visiting some touristy places later next month with me. Being the needy insecure beta loser that I am, I ask her if she wants to get dinner with me. She seems flattered and says yes.

I don't explicitly mention that this is a date, but I have severe social anxiety and I was on etizolam (makes you confident + truth setrum types). I insist on taking an UBER instead of the office bus. We end up at the the restaurant, I open doors for her, ask the waiter to serve her first, pull chairs for her. My desperation &amp; betadom showed. Then comes the bill - I insist that I pay, she wants to go dutch. I end up paying. On the way back in the UBER, I ask where she wants to be dropped - she says 'I'll walk from here'. I say 'WTF, just tell me where you want to be dropped?'. Finally she walks back home.

That weekend again, my insecure betadom shows. I'm high on benzos and I call her up asking what she's doing. She says she's out with friends.

Later that week, I'm doing some shit next to her desk not paying her any attention. She asks me if I want to get tea. I go along. The moment we get to the coffee shop, she calls another beta orbiter of hers. I don't pay much attention to her, ignore her and talk to the other beta orbiter who is a good friend of mine.

I have a precious few days left at my current workplace, so I call her out of her office and ask 'When do you get off work today?"" Her: ""Its flexible"" Me: ""Great, we're going out today at 6 PM"". She: ""Where?"" Me: ""Why do you want to know everything? Let it be a mystery."" She: ""I already have plans with friends..."" Me: ""You're lying."" She: ""No, you can check my messages."" Me: ""That's alright, I don't want to see your messages. She: ""OK, where are we going, I'll call my friends too."" Me: ""No friends, Only you and me."" Her: *gets on the phone* ""Oh, sorry there's a movie plan today"". Me: ""Sorry, I'm not into watching movies. Enjoy the evening. Your loss"" Her: *blushing* ""Thanks"". (WTF is that supposed to even mean?)

Since then I have completely ignored her. I was getting tea yesterday and she was behind me, expecting me to say hi. I didn't. I walked past her without even looking or smiling at her near her office. So, in short, I have given her beta style attention as well as been aloof. Fuck these mind games, I hate them.

Now I'm unsure as to what I should make of this. Did she reject a second date on the basis of her experience with the first date? She genuinely seemed to have plans for that day. If she considered me important enough, she could have cancelled her plans with her friends. But that bit about getting her friends along for the 'date' pissed me off, as if she was trying to friendzone me. I've been with women who were much smarter and better looking than her, who really dug my personality. I understand that this is a very subjective thing, but I'm wondering what exactly it is that made this girl reject me (if you consider this as a rejection). After ages did I finally find a girl who seemed to be into me, and I fucked that up too. How can I undo the damage?

Moreover, she is moving back to my city 20 days after I move.

I have 2 options - 
1) Say that I'm leaving the city. Today is my last day at office, wanna say bye? There's some pizza too.
2) Ignore and invite her to parties in my home city a month later.

Which one of the two is a better idea, or should I do both?

Thanks, phew that was a long post.

PS: Yes, some of you might think I have mental issues (which I do). And I am terribly insecure and needy. If you have something that could help me with both these issues, please let me know (no psychiatrists and anti depressants, please)."

There is a tldr but it doesn't do it justice.

Background:

(20M 21F) both in college in our last year. Been together for 4 years. During the academic year she lives with her parents while I stay with family. This is my first LTR, she has had a few. I one hand love her but there is always something left to desire. In a way I guess I am just curious about how other relationships work and I’m not certain that she is the one because I have never had anyone else to compare with. I am left with this curiosity of what’s out there and if it’s better, this curiosity always leads me to be the less interested one in the relationship. I don’t want to hurt her (she’s been hurt enough by her ex’s) but I feel trapped in a way when I say that.

Un-compatibility :

ARGUMENTS
- Arguments are supposed to happen in a healthy relationship right? When we argue it often starts for trivial reasons but she wants to push harder and argue more (almost like she needs an argument to feel like this relationship is working). I am left exhausted and my requests for time alone to think things through are perceived as me not trying to make our relationship work. She often gets upset for all sorts of reasons (me being 5 minutes late) and I stay calm and treat her maturely (find the problem in the first place because she doesn’t make it easy to understand what’s wrong, understand why it’s a problem, proceed to figure out a solution, and lastly make a commitment and actively follow through). She does not reciprocate this and I am left feeling like our relationship in terms of arguments becomes one with two parties (her being the creator of problems and me being the solution finder). My calm and mature personality mitigates a lot of trivial fights but I feel like she has a growing level of expectations for her boyfriend in terms of how a relationship should work.

CAREER
-I don’t want to limit myself and I feel like if I stay in this relationship it will stop me from making decisions such as relocating for work and working in remote locations. I guess you could say I am more career oriented and she is more family oriented.

LIFESTYLE
- Skydiving, paragliding and motorcycle riding.
- She is afraid of anything dangerous, afraid of heights, afraid of planes, and terrified of losing me while I go out and do these activities. In a way I feel guilty when I do these activities but in another way I’m not going to let her stop me(she isn’t stopping me but she always voices her concern about it to a point where it’s no long perceived as a sign of her caring but more of an annoyance)

CONFIDENCE
-I know that even I find myself in situations where I am feeling down once every few months and the relationship we have helps me cope and contributes to making me a better person. She has a lack of self-confidence and often I don’t feel like I am helping her, and instead I feel more like someone carrying her. The point I am trying to make is that I feel like her happiness depends on me. She say’s I’m the best bf she’s ever had and that I’m too good to her and that I deserve better (fairly often, her ex’s being guys who were only interested in sex and cheated on her). At first I took it as a compliment but now it’s just getting annoying and pushing me to think about leaving.

SEX
- I have a high libido that is left unsatisfied often. We are intimate once a week or two (sometimes three when her period comes around). Ideally I want to be intimate a couple times a week. There are other issues in the bed room like her lack of effort and very little interest when we are intimate. I am often left to pleasure myself to relieve myself of leftover horniness.


With all that said she is sexy, intelligent, amazing, loving... the list goes on. I am having trouble validating me leaving her because I do love her, I don’t want to hurt her and I have a fear of being lonely (In the past when I have tried initiating the break up talk I always get to afraid to go on because of the ramifications).


At the moment I work out of town for an internship (work 3 weeks with one week off) but I’m taking the bus home tomorrow night for my week off. She wants to pick me up. The reason why this is important now is because she asked me to think about our future together so we could have a conversation and plan things. I never put any real thought into this because of my laid back attitude, thinking: ow its fine, this stuff will figure its self out eventually, but it hasn’t and we have already had many discussion/arguments about these topics. The only warning she has is yesterday she asked me to go on a trip with her friends and I said no. She got upset and found my explanation of me not wanting to travel while still being in school a bad excuse and it she didn’t want to accept it.

 I am not ready to move forward knowing about all these issues and can’t decide if I should just break it off. 



tl;dr: Gf of 4 years asked me to think about our future together so we could have a conversation about it and plan things. Would it be to much of me to ask you lovely redditors for some feed back and help making sense of all this?

edit: Grammar."

I have always been a leader. In highschool I was the captain of the soccer team. When I was 19 I ran a 6 person business and failed until I finally got leadership right. When that happened I was recognized by the company (It was a franchise I ran) and became the most successful sales trainer in the region. Fast forward many companies and 10 years, and Im back in a 10 person startup.

I am starting to see opportunities for leadership being missed and so I have stepped up to help solve some problems. I made a sales training document for our intern after my manager said he didnt believe in training. When the intern did better, my manager had a change of heart. 
Ultimately, he has not been very responsive to my efforts. He has said things like ""Let me worry about that,"" and has discredited some ideas. He is a young manager without much experience (21 y.o) and I can tell he is really trying to be the leader so I dont want to step on his toes. 

This morning I emailed the core team (First hires) and Founder of the importance of culture.I ended the email asking to meet this week so that we could discuss our culture. Within minutes I received a phone call saying the founder was upset I sent that email out and that next time I should send these types of things to my manager. I was thinking about culture because I thought our new sales hire would be in the office in the morning, and I wanted to give him a clear vision of our values.
How can I effect the culture without 'stepping on toes?' I have always been one to take initiative and am genuinely obsessed with leadership and business. Because this startup is so early I feel I have the opportunity to do more, but I don't want to make anyone look bad in the process. 
Is it sometimes better to be quiet about ideas and just 'do my job?' Personally, I KNOW from experience that if my manager doesn't learn to let go of ego and utilize his teammates, the culture will turn into an ego driven, do as I say not as I do type of place. 

How should I find balance?"
3c9a02,2,2015-07-05,I hate myself for these stupid intrusive thoughts,throwaway0799822,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3c9a02/i_hate_myself_for_these_stupid_intrusive_thoughts/,"July hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm home from my college town and set to move into my first apartment at the beginning of August, but I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. My life has become internship Tuesday-thursday, fast food on the weekends, rinse and repeat. I do nothing else. I have no friends where I am--they're all back in my college town. My boyfriend lives two hours away.

I'm upset, I'm depressed, I'm jealous, and I've started self harming again because I just don't feel right or good enough or really anything. I'm sad and I don't know why. I try to figure it out but I can never put my finger on it. 

I tried to get my parents to go see fireworks with me yesterday for the Fourth but they laughed at me. I got to hear and see all the posts from people on Facebook and hear from my boyfriend about the time he got to spend with his family. I miss that. I miss being with my family back at college who didn't yell at me for wanting a break or a day off from work or to just go see some fucking fireworks.

And the worst part is every time I get an envious or sad thought in my head I think about how stupid or selfish I am or how I'm putting everyone through my stupid sadness and I just need to suck it up because no one wants to deal with a sad me. I want support from my boyfriend but I don't know how to ask for it and I don't know what would make me feel better and I can't figure it out, and I'm worried I'm going to explode and get angry and ruin the only good thing I have going for me right now.

I don't know what I'm looking for. I want these thoughts to go away and I want this month to be over and I want to be part of a family and see my boyfriend. I want to stop hating myself for my thoughts that I can't keep out of my head and I also just want to go to sleep for a long, long time."
3c9d7g,1,2015-07-05,"Girlfriend [25F] wants distance from me [27M] to think, relationship is 4+ years",FreduTrak,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3c9d7g/girlfriend_25f_wants_distance_from_me_27m_to/,"Help, I fucked up. We've been together just over 4 years.

Basically, we come from different countries, cultures etc. And met in another country where she was studying for her degree and I was doing an internship. I lost my mother around the time I first met my girlfriend, we had been friends at first but I always thought of her, constantly every day. When my mother died, it was a huge shock, I didn't know what to do. I had to take leave from the internship to fly home.

When I gave my eulogy, I started to cry but looked up and saw both my mother and my girlfriend smiling (well at the time she was just a close friend, I mean I could see a vision of both of them, not physically there smiling). I have taken to believe this as my mother approves of her and I should chase after her.

I guess I'm quite traditional, I only ever wanted to find the one and never entered into the relationships before meeting my girlfriend. I had a one night stand with a female colleague once when I was 19, both very drunk but I realised it wasn't what I wanted to do.

Girlfriend had a four month relationship a year before meeting with me that she thought she was in love but the guy didn't pay her attention and would go out with his own friends until she split, heart broken. So why she's sometimes reserved.

Anyway, I got back to the same country as my girlfriend and a few days later met with her. We walked through a forest and I kissed her on the cheeks and forehead before kissing her. It was amazing. From that moment on I promised to my heart and soul that I have to do everything to keep her and to marry her.

Well the first two years were amazing, I learned her language and speak with her family. After the first year, I had to fly home to finish my Bachelors but I promised with a ring I would come back for her and find a job. Which is what I did, during our year in long distance, I flew every month for a weekend to see her. 

Then when I started working here, I had to find an apartment for us, it was hard but we took the first thing that we could get. So we've been living in a small studio (30m2). However she was still studying for her Bachelors and I realised that she needed time to focus and study.

I tried to propose places to visit and things to do on the weekends but she works part-time and always on the weekend... I work Monday-Friday and get home about 19hr00 each day. I didn't see any easy way to do things with her. She had to work to support her family at her home country and I supported her here. 

Then about 6 months ago she talks about marriage and I don't why, I was tired from work but I said to wait until she finishes her studies... Because I wasn't thinking straight I fucked up right there.

Then a few months ago she wants distance and stayed with her family, we had a bed bug problem just before this so I assumed it was because of this. Her family moved to this country and try to work here. I would always tell her the negative side of any question to try and prepare her heart and mind for the worst case scenario but actually it made her stressed and she understands this as not supporting her. 

I spoke with her dad and he said I had to do something, I said I can't live without her and would marry her. It was difficult because of the language barrier. I am able to get by and speak quite well but I've never officially studied the language. I showed to my girlfriend that I'm there for her and support her. She moved back but I was very upset that she moved away in the first place.

Things seemed to be going well but then we had bed bugs again (because our neighbour has tonnes of them and tried to hide it from everyone...), I am always calm but my girlfriend gets nervous and cries easily.

We were going well, she had her last exams for Bachelors and I wanted to celebrate and do everything with her but she backed away a bit. Then she organised a special gathering in the church for people from her country. It made me proud. I supported her as much as I could but she did it with her mother mostly.

When we had the gathering, she met people from her background. A day or so later she starts to argue about things that I would never understand or things I don't do etc. Finally two weeks ago she gets angry and moves back to her parents place. I was broken. Since then I try to contact and see her every day to be with her but nope she pushes me away. She wants distance for a few months or year... Like wtf ?

Then last week, she travels to see one guy she met during the gathering. I had mobile tracking app for her phone and noticed she was far away, where only the guy lives. She ignored all my calls so I phoned her parents but they didn't know where she was and neither her sister. Finally I use the app to get a picture and see she's there. I then get the train to go and find her and notice she's on the train back so I grab that train to meet her and surprise her with dinner and flowers.


She was writing on her phone and being distant. I keep trying to get closer to her. I take her home to her parents after she finishes work late. I write her to find out how is she every morning day and night. I didn't really write her before when I was at work because I focused 100% on work. Now I don't care if I'm fired.

But yesterday, I'm at her parents to help with some things. And she tells me to go shopping because I wanted to, but I only wanted to go there with her to find clothes that I need. She said she needs to get ready. I ask what for and she says she will celebrate her diploma with university friends close to the city... I say ok, since I was going to respect her with this distance thing. I went running and after, I just call in the evening around 22:00, but she replies with a text (replying to something I wrote three hours before) and doesn't pick up from my phone calls. I start to think where is she, I write and phone a few times just to try and speak for two minutes to share my run with her because there's no one else I talk to or share things with, she is always the first.

So after waiting an hour, I checked the app and see she's in the other city where the guy is... I try phoning constantly just to hear her say where she is. But nothing, then one text saying everything is nice and she'll be back soon (message sent at 00:00), but she put her phone off and 2 hours later puts it on and I see she didn't take the last train. I went to check and kept texting her sister to find out if she arrived home.

I kept writing and calling until 4am, her phone was off a few minutes after 2am. I finally sleep and see she arrived home about 6.30, so either she was driven home or took the first train. She slept until 14:30 today. Didn't go to church (which she never misses) and tonight we had dinner with her family.


I wrote a letter to her parents explaining why I love her daughter and want to marry her. I used Google translate but changed some of the errors that I recognised. I made a film with pictures from the last 4 years and show it to her. She says it doesn't change anything and still needs a distance and that I should look for someone else. It's not possible for me to do that. I will die before I go with someone else.

Finally when I was leaving, I tried to make her change, I said I would give her one week distance and come back even stronger... I don't know how to get her back. I don't like that after 4 years of waiting for her to finish so we could spend our weekends together, she ends up wanting this distance and even worse she goes to see another guy 1hr30 train ride away.

I trust her that she is not cheating on me but I don't know anymore after she spent the night there... I don't know if she slept on a couch or they shared a bed. And it drives me crazy.

I love her absolutely, she's my best friend and I cannot imagine life without her. I should have proposed a year ago but I fucked up by waiting... Because when you're engaged you get married and then have children and we both don't drive yet. I wanted to at least have driving licence.. Which we started 3 weeks ago (at least first aid part).

Please help, I would never get with anyone else, I would most likely kill myself if I did that... I need to fix this.
I'm not saying that I'm suicidal, I mean that I just can never imagine anyone else in my life, I have only opened my heart for her.

TL;DR;
Girlfriend (25F) of 4 years wants distance but that never means anything good. I (27M) am doing everything to try and get her back but it seems I make it worse each time."
3c9lm8,30,2015-07-06,AITA for parking in front of someone's house.,TheRealFakeSteve,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3c9lm8/aita_for_parking_in_front_of_someones_house/,"[Here's the spot in question.] (http://i.imgur.com/9S7NQbB.jpg) 
I parked between the fire hydrant's curb side yellow paint and the house's stairs. Seems innocent enough, but the catch is that I parked there for the 3-day 4th of July weekend. When I came back, I got this note on my windshield.
&gt;  To [My-License Plate]

&gt; It is NOT okay to park in front of my house and then take the Metro. Your car blocked my lawn, and it made it very difficult for me to mow it. On top of that, when I went grocery shopping, I had to carry my groceries a long way because every parking spot near my house was taken. I shouldn't have to carry my groceries from a block away because you decided to park in front of my house. 

&gt;While you were frolicking away this weekend, I was expecting a shipment of bricks, and because of your car, my project is delayed. The Metro built a huge parking lot for you guys, so USE it. Do NOT park in front of my house, asshole. 

Here's why I parked there: I just moved to that area for a summer internship, and I was going back home for the 4th of July weekend. I put the bus station I was using on my GPS and it lead me there, but it only lead me to a pedestrian walkway to the bus station. The pedestrian walkway starts in a residential area and all parking spots around the residential area are for cars with permit only. I drove around until the parking spots didn't require a permit and I parked in the first spot I found (in front of the house above). Once I got to the bus station, I obviously noticed that there's a huge parking lot, but I didn't have time to go back to my car and move it to the parking lot so I just headed to my bus instead. 

What do y'all think? Am I the Asshole?"

3ca1dg,7,2015-07-06,Mystery photo appeared in camera roll.,-del2phi,iphone,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/3ca1dg/mystery_photo_appeared_in_camera_roll/,"My brother just came to me with a question that has me stumped.  He was looking through his Camera Roll pictures on his iPhone (5s, iOS 8), and found a picture that he did not take.  It was a picture from his previous workplace from his last day of work, timestamped *after* he left and was in the next town over.  

* He always kept his phone on him and never let anyone else use it, so it's not likely that someone took his phone before he left and took the picture, and the timestamp just happened to glitch.

* The photo was in the camera roll, and from what I've read, iCloud pictures don't show up there, so I don't think someone hacked his account and uploaded it remotely.  

* The EXIF data is tagged as being taken with the iPhone 5S camera, but has no location/GPS data, which all his other pictures have.  I don't know if that's relevant or just because there was no GPS signal indoors.

* The place he worked at had lots of Microsoft and T-Mobile interns around, so perhaps some ambitious hacker figured out a way to hack his phone and remotely upload it to his phone (one of my crazier hypotheses...).

I'm not sure what other information might be relevant to figure out how this picture got there.  I advised him to change his Apple ID password just to be safe.  Has anyone else experienced something similar?  Do you have any idea what might be going on?  I and my brother would appreciate your thoughts.  Thanks.

We are each other's firsts (relationship-wise and physically) and we have been together for 4 years now, I love her madly and I know that she really loves me too. I am studying abroad right now, where I can get my degree and pay for it myself, while she is now in an internship. She has been very busy lately and we haven't been speaking much because her job has been taking up much of her time.

Friday she told me that she wants to take a break. She says that she wants to experience single life, but she told me she will want to be back with me eventually. She didn't tell me when, but I suppose when we can end the whole long distance problem. I'm not sure I believe it will happen after this.

Now, I am not naive. I know what she means and I have so many different feelings inside of me that I feel like smashing my head against the wall.

I understand where she comes from. She said she feels like she is missing out on experiences she should have. I have wondered about that too and I really do understand her. I think that maybe it is for the better and we will be able to have a stronger relationship after, more confident in what we really are. We have always been very important to each other, we are more than lovers, we have always been best friends. She knows everything about me, I know everything about her. She told me that during this time she wants to stay friends, but it's so painful, knowing her with someone else, it crushes me inside with sadness, resentment and it would make me feel so humiliated.

Is she right in asking for a break? Is it fair of her to ask me to keep being her friend? I don't want to lose her, I want to be with her and marry her eventually. What can I do?


tldr: first and only girlfriend (first and only boyfriend for her) of 4 years in ldr. She wants to take a break to ""experience single life"" and I don't know how to take it.

3cauky,7,2015-07-06,Who should I talk to at UNO?,lovelesschristine,NewOrleans,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/3cauky/who_should_i_talk_to_at_uno/,"I have no idea who I should talk to at UNO. I have an Associates degree in Networking, but wanting to go back for my BS to be more competitive. I don't know if I should do Computer Science or EE. My end game is network security. I feel like EE would give me more of an edge since I already have an AAS in Networking. 

I have no idea who can help me schedule classes and determine what I need to do for scholarships or internships. I hear they have some good ones for women in STEM. I also hear the CS school has a partnership with GE.

Right now I plan on taking some classes after work. But if I can get an internship that pays close to what I make now I could go to school full time. 

Can someone tell me who I can talk to? Or does anyone here have an opinion. I know I see a lot of you at NolaSec and I was planning about asking around then, but the cut off time for applications is before the next meeting.

Thanks for the help!


EDIT: I should also add I have also thought about doing R&amp;D. "
3cawnx,6,2015-07-06,Am I (21m) being too clingy with my overseas (21f) girlfriend? Or am I just clueless?,ziggy97397,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cawnx/am_i_21m_being_too_clingy_with_my_overseas_21f/,"So the story begins with my girlfriend getting an internship in the Philippines over the summer (we both live in Florida). I think this is a fantastic opportunity for her, and I feel like I projected that I was happy for her. At this point, we were living together, but after discussing it, we decided not to renew our lease together because our relationship was not as great as before we had moved in together. In the last few weeks of living together, I felt like she wasn't trying at all to make our relationship work, and I felt ignored. At this point, we had not had sex for about six months because she got panic attacks whenever we tried to be intimate. There was about two weeks before she left the country when the lease expired, so she went back home to her mom's house in California, and I moved back in with my parents. Before she left Florida, she said she felt bad and didn't want to make me wait for her. I told her that she was worth waiting for and that I would do my best to preserve what we have. Even before she left for the internship, I had to initiate every conversation, and I use the term conversation loosely, because I hardly got anything back from her. Since she has left the country about a month and a half ago, we've only had one good conversation, but only for about twenty minutes. I've sent Facebook or iMessages about every other day trying to get even a little bit of conversation going, to no avail. She either tells me she's at work, which I understand why she can't talk then, or nothing at all. I know she has the ability to communicate, since I see that she's been on other social media, and that's why I feel ignored. From my point of view, which may be skewed, if she has time to do things on Facebook or Tumblr, she has at least a minute to shoot me a quick update or some sort of short message. 

And that's why I'm writing here today. I feel like our relationship has become so one-sided and that she's really not contributing at all. I feel really distant from her, and that I have no idea how she's doing. I don't know what to do or say that would make me feel more confident about us. So I would really appreciate some advice on what to do next. 

tl;dr: My overseas girlfriend doesn't seem to want to talk to me and I need help. 

Update: I told her that we need to talk because I feel like I've been ignored, and she says that she's busy with a work event and we'll talk soon. I'll keep you guys updated. 

Update 2: I just talked to her and, for right now, we're not going to be together. She's not in a place right now where she wants a relationship, which I respect. I'm not really feeling like I'll date anybody else, and she told me she wasn't going to either. We still want to be there for each other, and I feel like we'll end up together again: just not right now. "

Els debats han marcat la vida interna de Podem des del seu origen i ofereixen elements valuosíssims per a millorar el nostre funcionament intern, contribuint a la maduració organitzativa i política de Podem.

A l'esdeveniment polític que marca aquest debat s'expressen les dues ànimes de Podem: tant la que constitueix el veloç vehicle electoral que ha de respondre amb
agilitat a les etapes externes d'aquest cicle polític, com la que configura l'espai social de participació i de nova política. Ambdues són necessàries i, com sempre s'ha sostingut, és necessari cercar un equilibri entre elles.

En aquest sentit, el **Consell Ciutadà Municipal de València** manifesta el següent:

1.- Els temps polítics als quals es deu Podem com a partit obliguen a reconèixer les servituds externes a les que estem sotmesos. La possibilitat latent d'un avançament electoral exigeix un exercici de responsabilitat en la configuració de la candidatura que no té un acomodament fàcil amb els temps polítics de reflexió, debat i cerca de
consensos als quals aspirem. La posició irresponsable del partit en el govern, que està especulant deliberadament amb la convocatòria d'eleccions generals, ens fa haver d'estar preparats i preparades amb suficient antelació per a poder afrontar un possible avançament d'aquestes. Així, agost apareix com un mes crucial. 

2.- Ens sembla convenient insistir, no obstant açò, en què es duguen a terme els esforços polítics necessaris per a trobar la màxima compatibilitat entre les necessitats estratègiques i les demandes de millor i major participació:

&gt;-Per açò, considerem particularment important que el reglament done cabuda a la millor representació territorial possible, bé sota un model de circumscripció múltiple (provincial o autonòmic), bé sota un desenvolupament més ampli i definit dels criteris de correcció territorial que suggereix el propi Reglament.

&gt;-Ens sembla igualment necessari proposar una gestió del temps del procés que permeta, dins dels límits de les necessitats logístiques del cicle electoral, la millor qualitat participativa de tots els membres de Podem. 

Podem ha d'estar desbordan-se constantment per a ser útil als propòsits polítics que es va marcar des del seu naixement. Ha d'obrir-se incessantment a la societat i, al mateix temps, ha de fer tots els esforços per mantenir alta la il·lusió i l'ànim dels activistes. És per açò que demanem al **Consell Ciutadà Estatal** que participe del debat i oferisca respostes per a millorar els processos participatius, tant de cara a aquesta com a les pròximes cites electorals.

En ese sentido, el **Consejo Ciudadano Municipal de Valencia** manifiesta lo siguiente:

1.- Los tiempos políticos a los que se debe Podemos como partido obligan a reconocer las servidumbres externas a las que estamos sometidos.

Also, graduates from the university on average make $75k + and I would be able to work during the summer via internships in Cali/Chicago making 30-35$/hr

Edit: since a lot of people wanted to know the name of the school it's IIT (the chicago one, not the indian school).

3cayje,3,2015-07-06,My BF [24M] of 1 year suggested that I [21F] should find a FWB while he is away for internship...,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cayje/my_bf_24m_of_1_year_suggested_that_i_21f_should/,"My BF had the opportunity to go to an amazing country for his internship. He left in spring (when we were together for more then half a year) and isn't coming back until autumn. 


We haven't had any problems before him leaving, no fights. The only problem for me was his experience with sex, but I was willing to work on that if you know what I mean. 


When he was gone for two weeks I started getting depressed because I missed him so much. We used to see each other almost every other day, or a couple of times a week. Our skype meetings were mostly silent, because I was sad on the inside with him so far away. I suggested I could visit him, but he was holding back because he found it way to expensive for me. He also didn't work with me to think about a way it could be possible.


Eventually he started joking about having a FWB for the lack of physical contact, the thing I got more and more sad about. I'm a hugging person, I need hugs now and then. The moment he suggested it I felt horrified because I immediately started thinking he would want the same favor. He just told that he would be okay with me seeing someone for my physical needs.


Before I met my boyfriend I was dating an older guy. Our sex was amazing. I used to be a much more negative person and nag all the time. Eventually he broke up with me because of the age gap (7 years) and he was thinking too much about what other people were thinking about us. (At least, that's what he told me the reason was).


I always kept feeling a strong physical urge to see or talk to that guy again. I never saw him after we broke up and we didn't really talk since. Eventually we started speaking again (when my bf was already talking about the fwb) and he suggested we should meet.


We met and grabbed some drinks (non alcoholic). It was nice and weird at the same time. After seeing him twice after that (just watching movies at his place/cooking and having dinner), the third time meeting him we kissed. I told my BF about this meeting and he was still okay with it. We talked about making him a FWB because when we kissed I experienced that I didn't have any feelings for the guy anymore.


Talked with the ex about not wanting a relationship, he was thinking on the same level, then told him I had a boyfriend; he was like 'that's nice'. After that we slept together.
The physical tension is so present when we see each other. It's like our bodies are made to touch.


I'm seeing my ex about once a week now, mostly for physical connection time. It's better than last year because I'm in it for the sex and I'm not pushing for emotional bonding/relationship things. We don't text that much, only to agree on a date and time to meet.


My BF however just told me that he is thinking to go away for another half a year. He's coming back home for maybe two months and then he's leaving again. It isn't set in stone yet, but I'm sure he's able to make it happen. I have the feeling that he doesn't care about my feelings and that I really can't do this LDR.

I feel weird to just keep sleeping with my ex, then with my BF when he's back, and then maybe again with my ex because the BF is leaving again?

Don't want to make any rash decisions before he get's back, but it's still another two months. Should I wait and see how things go when we see each other?   

(I'm also seeing a therapist soon about the fact that I can't deal with being alone for so long, physically and emotionally)

**TL;DR BF away on internship, suggests i should find a FWB. I sleep with ex regularly. BF plans to go away another half a year. Should I break it off because he thinks too much about himself and not about us? **"

He flung his shoulder length hair over his shoulder, straightened his wool skirt, and rubbed a little dirt off his high-heeled boot. 

“Here goes,” he said to himself, as he walked up onto the front porch and pressed the doorbell. The house was situated on a nice suburban street in Connecticut, each house having a manicured front lawn, a two-car garage, with most likely having at least one Mercedes in each. A woman’s heels echoed off the hardwood floor as they approached the large oak door, ceasing when the lock was turned. Slowly the massive door creaked open revealing a beautiful late twenties, pony-tailed blond inside.

        “Can I help you?” questioned the attractive female half hidden by the door.

        “Mrs. Johnson? I’m Tina Garrett; I’m here about the position? I called earlier.”

        The door swung wider, revealing the curvaceous woman inside. “Oh yes, please come in, oh, and call me Jill” she answered, stretching out her finely manicured hand to the potential employee. “Did you find the place okay? These streets are kind of confusing if you don’t know where you are going.”

        “No real problem, besides, the cab knew where to go,” she replied, closing the monolithic door behind her as she entered. “Wow, what a beautiful home you have. The neighborhood looks wonderful.”

        “Thank you, and yes, this is a real safe area, real good for our kids. Please, follow me to the living room, we can talk there.”

        Tim carefully studied the graceful steps of his hopefully new employer, paying close attention to her tight derriere, her long legs wrapped in finely tailored tan wool slacks, admiring how the tight brown cashmere sweater gently caressed her perfect breasts. He began to mimic her walk, but did not let Mrs. Johnson see him.

        “Please, have a seat. Now, tell me a little about yourself.”

        Tim placed his bag next to his black leather boots as he sat down on the large couch, slightly angled with his lower legs crossed. He brushed out his skirt and proceeded with a smile, “Well, my name is Tina Garrett, I’m 23 years old, in my 3rd year at State for Child Psychology.”

        “Impressive, but why would you want to be a Nanny? Surely you could get an internship somewhere?”

        “Yes, I probably could,” Tim replied, if it were true that is, “but, I thought working with your kids directly would better prepare me for what lies ahead, since I don’t have any children of my own, not yet anyway.”  As if on queue, two children came running into the spacious living room.

        Tim smiled at the cute little boy, and then at his older sister as she stood next to her mother. Before he could say anything. their mother spoke, “kids, this is Tina, your new nanny.”

Hi, I'd love to play this RP with you! Maybe you could be the MIlF mother, or her gorgeous hard working husband? Maybe the older sister? (I'm afraid the little boy isn't a kink I'd be interested in)."
3cb26u,2,2015-07-06,Small business owner trying to scam employees? Help!,amandap4539,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/3cb26u/small_business_owner_trying_to_scam_employees_help/,"I've got a bit of a moral/ethical/legal dilemma and I need some feedback on it. I'm going to use fake names and fake cities for the people in the actual situation.

Amanda just moved home to Chicago after finishing an out of state internship. Before she moved home, she began looking for a job so she wouldn't be broke right when she got back to Chicago. She found a place that would be opening shortly after her arrival, and the owner gave her a phone interview. The owner, Michael, was very pleased with the interview and agreed to hire her for a salary of $500 a week, plus occasional bonuses.

Once Amanda moved back, she met Michael and talked more about the business that would soon be opening. He said it should only be 2 or 3 more weeks before the business was going to be open. She understood that it may take a few weeks before getting paid. She agreed to help promote the new business by going to events and handing out flyers, posting on social media, etc.

One month later, the business is still not open. Amanda has done a number of things to help Michael, putting in at least 80 hours of work, and has not received any money. Michael has a few other ""employees"" that are in the same situation as Amanda. He tells the employees that if anyone else asks when the business is going to open, they will be written up. The other employees comply, but this upsets Amanda.

Michael then tells Amanda that he will pay her $250 if she went to a specific area in Chicago and handed out flyers. She did so. When she returned, he said he couldn't pay her the money because the business's Facebook page did not generate enough new likes to be worth the $250.

She realizes something fishy is going on and decides this job is not in her best interest. Up to this point, Facebook has been her best means of communication with Michael, so she sends him a Facebook message saying she is no longer interested in working for the company BECAUSE she is not getting paid for the work she has been putting in.

He then begs her to stay and offers her $500 cash to stay with the company. He now says the business WILL be open in three weeks, and since he sees so much potential in Amanda, that she will be the only employee getting paid. She declines the offer, as she does not see it morally right to be paid under the table and that none of the other hardworking employees are getting paid either.
He continues to message her. He offers her now $700, and tells her that she can live with him free of charge, so long as she walks his dogs for him every day. She says no because she already has a place to live. He then messages her again saying he will ""take care of her"" specifically because she has the most potential out of all of the other employees. She, once again, says no. He then becomes angry and says she is on the verge of being no longer welcome with the company and she is not allowed to quit without giving notice.

Amanda has not signed any contracts, papers, licenses, anything. At this point, she has not even received any money for the work she has done, but what can she do about this harassment without the potential hazards to future jobs in which he may try to contact?

TLDR: A girl has been working without pay for a business that is not yet open. She told the owner she no longer wants to work for him. He is aggressively responding by offering her large sums of cash and telling her to live with him. What should she do?"
3cb2mv,4,2015-07-06,How to go about asking for a raise?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3cb2mv/how_to_go_about_asking_for_a_raise/,"First, here's a little background:  

I graduated from a private college in June of 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In June of 2013, I took an internship with a digital marketing agency in their development department. I worked full-time during the summer and part-time during my Senior year in college. 
  
  
The larger development department consists of back-end and front-end developers as well as technical architects, system admins, and QA. My company in general does mostly website work for clients, with a few applications sprinkled in here or there.  

My department is technically a subset of the larger development department but just consists of me and my boss. We're supposed to be working on projects on the cutting edge of technology, but I mostly do internal applications for management as well as some client applications (iOS or Android apps). 

My biggest project to date was a resource allocation database. I tied a third-party web application to a database which allows an executive at my company (and his team) to manage our developers and assign them to different projects in an organized manner. The database ties into a reporting tool (which I do not have to manage) that allows the executive to report financial information to our larger headquarters. This application is a pretty big deal to him as he uses it frequently to view and generate financial reports. It's also self-sustaining (mostly) now which makes things pretty easy on me. 

Recently, I've jumped into working on an iOS app for a client. I had no previous iOS experience (only Android) but I was able to jump right in and learn very quickly completely on the fly, all while doing good work on the project that everyone seems to be impressed with.

Now, here's the kick. I'm only required to work 40-hour weeks but I often work more, especially recently with this client project getting down to crunch time. I make $45,000/year and have been with this company full-time for just over a year (but interned there in college). I was just given a 3% raise around my 1-year anniversary. Based on my research, I'm in the 10th percentile salary-wise for my job and experience level. I couldn't find much data for EXACTLY what I do, as I do a little bit of everything - mobile applications, web applications, back-end services, and database management. 

So, I think I should definitely be making more money, but who doesn't? How should I go about bringing this up to my boss? I fear that he's going to say that I already got my raise for the year and there's nothing he can do. So if that happens then I would look for another job to try to get them to counter-offer. I really do love my job and the people I work with so I really don't want to leave this job (or the city I'm in) but I definitely think I deserve to be making closer to the median salary for my job and experience level (~$60,000/year). Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks!"

We clicked instantly and he brought out the real me that I never show anyone, our relationship was perfect. Since we met I knew he would be leaving for the military for 3 months in September, but then I got an internship and I had to leave in May and I wouldn't have been able to see him until July. Long story short I freaked out and cheated on him out of loneliness, I have no excuses and told him right away. He acted like we were going to be fine for a month and the day he was supposed to come visit me he told me he wasn't coming because he couldn't see past the cheating and cut me off. I'm trying my best to give him time, but I regret this more than anything. I don't want him to be the one that got away, but chasing after him is just going to scare him away. Is cheating unforgiveable? Should I just give him his time and try when I get home? Or should I try to just move on? Is there anything I can do right now?"

I have landed a software engineering job at a company in Seattle and will move in October from France. My girlfriend was looking upon an internship under the J-1 visa. She's an architect and we were told that the market was pretty good in this sector so we were confident that finding an employeer would not be an issue.

But the moving date is getting close now and she has been sending spontaneous applications online to various firms in the city (resume, recommendation letter) without luck.

As it is quite a bargain for the employeer (they have access to a skilled 4 years architect with a different culture, willing to learn everything about how the job is done in the US, and for the price of an intern, so next to nothing...) and nobody seems to give a damn, we must be doing something wrong.

At this point, its quite a message in a bottle, but any help/lead/advice would be greatly appreciated !"

3cbnyq,1,2015-07-06,Just a student looking for career guidance,Yesterdays93,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/3cbnyq/just_a_student_looking_for_career_guidance/,"It seems this is a pretty common topic and I hate to beat a dead horse here but I have had trouble coming up with answers in my own research so I figured I would create a post. 

**About Me:**  In the Fall I will be entering my 4th year of study in computer engineering (3 semesters left to graduate) at a major public University (top 10-15 program in the US). This summer I am interning at a Fortune 200 company in IT (specifically big data - Hadoop dev.). I am really enjoying the internship and could really see myself going down the IT path as opposed to software engineering, chip design, ect. Moreover, I am really interested and passionate about networking.


**What I know:** Presently, not a lot frankly. Last semester I was lucky enough to spend a semester abroad at one of Asia's highly ranked engineering schools where I took my first networking class. It was a good class; top-down approach of the OSI model and a lot of theoretical/mathematical explanations of congestion-avoidance algorithms ect. In search of the next step, when I returned I stated going though study material for the CCENT. It's a lot more practical than my Uni class of course but for the most part none of the topics really give me too much trouble; I probably spend on average 3 hours a night after work either reading or tinkering with a simulator. I plan to take the test in a couple months. 

**The Problem:**  I will of course do the obvious which is recruit very hard for an internship in networking next summer (to any capacity) as well as take any and all networking classes my Uni offers. But beyond that I'm pretty lost. Most of my research for jobs and career paths seems to lead me to positions that require 5+ years experience with specific expertise or the complete converse; entry level positions that an engineering degree highly over qualifies you for.  I am really trying to get a feel for where and what I should look for upon graduation and what I can do in the next 18 months to make myself the best possible candidate going in.  

**tl;dr**
What are some examples of entry level positions / career paths for someone with a 4-year degree in CE? What can I do in the next 18 months to make myself a strong candidate?

I would appreciate any and all feedback. 
Thank you!

3cc7a1,5,2015-07-06,Overcoming guilt from past hypomanic episode,jean_baudrillard,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/3cc7a1/overcoming_guilt_from_past_hypomanic_episode/,"Hi there reddit,

So I'm sort of asking advice, sort of just sharing an experience. I had a long hypomanic period last year. I was in my penultimate year of university, and things suddenly turned sour. I was really resentful about being at that institution, I hated it there, and I guess hypomania was the thing that made me snap. 

I ended up going from a star student to a barely average one. I spent most of my time browsing the internet and drinking alone. I started smoking, I gained 40 pounds (bear in mind before this, I'd suffered from on-and-off anorexia for many years). I'd been an overachiever before, so what I saw as a terrible failure that year was so crushing that I not only felt depressed, but my confidence was totally shattered. I went to my doctor looking for antidepressants and I was diagnosed at the end of that year, but ignored the diagnosis.

It gets worse. After that year of college, I spent the summer at this v. competitive internship I'd managed to get as a sane person, it was the envy of everyone I knew, a really big deal. However the long hours and stress made my unmedicated bipolar even worse. I fucked up the opportunity in a huge way just by being bad at the job, I got very close to attempting suicide, I somehow ended up taking my coworkers to a sex club. It was a disaster. I blew all my earnings on embarrassingly extravagant, mad things, and I don't come from that well off a background, so the guilt of living like that given how my family lives was even worse. I have more to say about what happened that summer but I don't even want to write it I'm so ashamed.

Through all of this, I had no idea what I was doing, and in typical bipolar fashion I kept blaming other people for my problems. I had all these justifications, which whilst were somewhat rooted in reality,  now seem completely non-convincing. I was in denial about so many things - I didn't even realize the weight gain until months later, when I'd reached some level of stability. I wish hypomania was more obviously ""mental illness"": rather than being bizarre madcap irrationality, hypomania is instead an exaggeration of your worst qualities. It was hard to draw the line between where the hypomania ended and my own flaws began.

I've been on medication since January, and I'm emotionally fine now, but some of these past events are just too difficult to look at. I don't think that year I hurt anyone other than myself that much, but I am still filled with guilt and self loathing. I nearly converted to Christianity (I'm an atheist, raised buddhist, and for a long time one of those vehemently anti-religion people) because I desperately wanted some higher authority to tell me I was a good person. I still have the habit of praying for forgiveness, every day. 

Thankfully I've put my life together somewhat now, lost the weight, graduated and have a new job, but now I feel like I don't deserve any of it because of how I've acted. If I make even a slight mistake, I fall into an instant guilt spiral. Exacerbating is that most people who know me not only think I'm fine, but that I'm particularly successful. I don't really know what to do. Actively trying to get rid of guilt feels like pampering I don't deserve, and I don't really know how else to move past it. Perhaps reddit will know..."
3cc8ea,1,2015-07-06,Balrahan - Short Story,QuincedeBoot,shortstory,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/3cc8ea/balrahan_short_story/,"Tuesday Afternoon in Balrahan. 
They’re hanging on his every word again, the fucker. He’s some boyo. Owes me a couple of hundred of course, but look, I won’t go askin’. Not in front of the rest of them. He’s good for it. I also know by the look of him he had one or two last night and it wasn’t here. But I’ll say nothin’. You need lads like him around the place. Full of life, full of stories, keeps the place ticking over. His high stool seems higher than theirs. Huge hands waving, gesturing, engaging them all. They love him. Plenty don’t. The thing about Devlin Mahon is, he doesn’t give a shite what any man in this town has to say about him, and shure isn’t he right too? 
I must’ve heard this one twenty times at this stage. Argentina. 1984. Work trip. Mahon’s just married. Lands himself a spot on some game show. Talks himself into it of course. Talks himself into a ride with the co-hostess too. She’s a big deal seemingly. Married to some soccer player or other. Anyway they’re caught on camera. Pictures all over some rag the next day. In Argen-fuckin-tina of all places. 
Tells them how he had to pull strings to make sure the word didn’t cross the sea. Bla, bla, bla. And then… 
‘I waited to tell that one for fourteen years, until she saw sense and ran off.’ 
Takes a long, indulgent gulp. Glass down hard. 
‘Fuck all she can do about it now.’ 
Roars of approval. Back slaps, attempted handshakes. The new ones love it. Those who’ve already heard it shake their heads and nod approvingly. The craft of the story. How true it is, I don’t know, but I wouldn’t put it past him. Anyway, why let the truth in the way of a good story? 
‘An’ how’s that young one from The Jazz getting’ on Mahon? Lookin’ well when I seen ‘er th’other day, she was. Grand bit of stuff.’ 
The Snert lets it hang there. Leans back. 
No response. Dead right. Mahon’s too cute, the hoor. Should’ve been a politician. Came close by all accounts. Certainly has the tools. Handsome looking man, big presence about him. And Lord knows he’s crooked as an S-hook. 
Mahon sips his pint. His apostles won’t acknowledge The Snert. 
‘I says I seen ‘er down The Jazz the other day.’ 
‘Didn’t know you were a man for the skinny lattes Snert?’ 
Giggles. One-nil Mahon on the counter-attack. 
‘Heard she was goin’ at young Podgie Lavin? He’s a fair talent on the drums.’ 
Nothin’. Mahon doesn’t say a word. Looks forward at the screen. Sniffles. A quick scratch at the side of his mouth. Back to the paper. Pushes it forward to get a better study of it. Back to the screen. 
‘Martin, in your own good time, my very good friend, may I have a score each way on the nag Nina’s on in the 2:05?  
Billy Reilly counts his coppers. It’s now or never. The day’s drinkin’ depends on it. 
‘Eh, one thirty each way for me there too please, Murt.’ 
‘Five win for me there Murt’  
Four more loyal followers come in with their bets. Snert doesn’t budge.  
‘Anyone doin’ a line with your little one anyway, Mahon?’ 
Little. Bad form Snert, ya sneery little bollox.  
‘…and while you’re fulfilling your duties please Martin, I’ll have a celebratory round in advance for my fellow revellers. Guinness all round if I’m not mistaken?’ 
They thank him. 
‘Oh. Young Brian here….’ 
That’s The Snert he’s talking about. 
‘Young Brian will get his own. Making it in plenty he is, it being signing on day and so on. ‘ 
He raises his glass. 
‘To you and yours Brian. The queue didn’t look too bad this morning? Pity about the rain I suppose.’ 
That powerful grin. Ear to ear. Two-nil Mahon. The others sneer. The irony of their laughter lost on them. 
‘Fiver on the favourite.’ No please or thanks. Lacks class, you see. 
There’s been plenty said about Mahon over the years. Some true, some false. The way of this kind of place I suppose. It’s often when he’s goin’ well. Ah, he’s a boyo in fairness. I’m not telling you anything he wouldn’t tell you himself. When the wife ran away that time, it was no real surprise. Ah, they went for it far too young. 
Convenience, lust, money. He’ll say so himself. She was some bit of stuff. She wasn’t simple either. She storms in here one morning of August of 1998 if I’m not mistaken. As tall as himself. Sunglasses and heels. Lipstick. In fucking Balrahan, on a Wednesday morning. 
‘Where is that alcoholic, waste of space, cheating bastard husband of mine?’ 
I keep my head down of course. Never as focused on cleaning a glass.  
‘Sorry who? 
‘Devlin fucking Mahon. You know well who.’ 
‘Jaysus he hasn’t been in here this long time.’ 
I knew well where he was. Saw him hopping into a car outside the pub the night before. Nice little blonde one driving of course. She caught him out a couple of days later and on her way she went. He hasn’t seen sight nor sign of her since and I doubt he’s lost a lot of sleep over it. It’s the young one I’d be feeling sorry for. Young 
Gemma. A grand girl. Never got the looks of the mother God love ‘er. Sort of heavy set. But very bright seemingly. Always seemed a bit odd. Bit different than the other young ones around this place. I suppose not having the mother around will do that to ya.  
Aye, the bould Mahon’s always had a weakness for the fairer sex. Likes a sup, but never goes too far. Ah, he knows the boys will be here of a Tuesday. Extended lunch he’ll call it. Bit of craic. Darts occasionally. Few horses. A pint or two. Shure what harm? Personally I wouldn’t trust a man who doesn’t take a sup. And anyway, isn’t the young one reared and well able to look after herself. More power to him. 
‘G’wan Nina ya daisy.’ 
‘Get up t’fuck’ 
‘Get up on him.’ 
The last few furlongs. Mahon’s as cool as ya like. Snert’s fella is long gone. Pulled up way back. He’s sitting there with a sour puss on him. Looks like he’s been suckin’ lemons all day the little bollox. 
G’wan Nina. G’wan t’fuck…g’wan….Yeeeeeeowwwwwww.’ 
The sweet taste of victory. Adulation. The little joys. 
Take that one Snert, ya little bollox. 
Mahon turns now. He throws a two euro coin onto Snert’s lap.  
‘Here’s two quid for a latte, Brian.’ 
Sneers and cheers. And more orders. There won’t be a whole lot done in Mahon and Cunningham solicitors this Tuesday afternoon. Martin Kirwan’s is the place to be. 
Jackpot. 
 	 
Tuesday Afternoon in Balrahan. 
‘Getting married Katelyn, is the most foolish thing a person can do. I mean think about it. How can you promise your entire future to another person? How can you promise that? How can you know who you’ll be or how you’ll feel in ten, twenty, thirty years? Life is transient. Why can we not just accept that we are close to a person in the present and that’s just how it is? Why make ties, bonds, contracts, you cannot be sure to keep? And who are the victims Katelynn? The likes of you and I. Why? 
Because it’s expected that it’s the norm that our parents, who are married, should stay together. So we feel weird when they don’t. Rejected. If my idiot father and bitch mother didn’t get married, maybe they’d have simply accepted that they both wanted to fuck other people and had at the very least an amicable relationship, you know? Then maybe I wouldn’t have been the disconnected, fuck-up teenager I was.’ 
I stop there. I know I’m ranting again. Katelynn’s heard this all before. All she did was tell me some poor girl she works with is getting married.  
‘Do ya never feel lonely, Gem?’ 
‘The only thing people get right about me Katelynn, is that I’m independent. I’m happy on my own. I live my life. I enjoy my life. Why do I need to live someone else’s too?’ 
‘But you haven’t had a ride in what, two years?’ 
Subtle as a sledgehammer is my Katelynn. But she’s almost accurate. I haven’t been intimate with a man in one year and eleven months. Not a huge deal, but there it is. We differ in this respect. Katelynn needs it. Well, not it as such, but she needs to be held, to be hugged, to be close to someone. Her life seems to be a series of unfortunate semi-relationships. Yet she seems to pity me? I allow her that.  
I used to hate my mother for leaving me. As I’ve matured, this hatred has weakened to a mere dislike. I understand why she left and feel she was another victim of the society’s ridiculous obsession with the institution of marriage. I dislike however, how she left a nine year old little girl on her own, with a man who though loving, caring and wonderful in his own weird way, has always had his ‘weaknesses’. Drink, horses, women and I suspect, on occasion, heavier stuff too. He’s a man of vices. A man of extremes. He loves me. I know it. But I’ve always taken care of myself. And often him too.  
I understand him now. I understand her. I understand the unhappiness they must have felt and I accept it.  
But it showed me the futility of marriage. The sheer pointlessness of it. It made me question relationships. I don’t fall easily. For men, for friends. I don’t have many men and I don’t have many friends. I choose carefully.  
Katelynn, for all her flaws, is a friend. Our friendship arose out of similar circumstance. She was in the class below me in primary school. She used to cry on the bus. A tiny little thing. In those days, a year between kids seemed like a lifetime. I saw myself as the wiser little girl. I was in third class. She told me what happened with her parents one day. I pitied her. Not long after, I was in the same boat. We became friends. 
I enjoy these moments with her. They’ve become less frequent. We’re getting older, working more often. We move in different circles sometimes, I guess. She’s got her own scene. Nowadays I see her Instagrammed face (turned at a convenient angle, glasses, paleskin contrasting with lipstick, moody pout) more days than I see her real face. I prefer her real face. That one obvious dimple, the upward curvature of her eyebrows, the unusual faces she pulls, her occasional flinch. The things that have always been there. She’s pretty, that’s for sure. Not obviously stunning, but ‘cute’ as they say. Petite. Quirky. She likes those words. Braces are her thing these days. Stripy, polka dot, oddly coloured. Holding up denim hotpants to reveal that tattoo on her thigh. We argued about that. Her choice. Not my cup of tea. A flaming sun, I suppose you’d call it. Sizeable. She hates the orange t-shirt she has to wear in this place. It is kind of baggy. Makes her look even smaller. Looks odd with the rolled up tartan leggings she’s wearing today too. Very 90’s. Haven’t seen those on her before.  
‘Kate. Need you in here. Let’s go.’ 
It’s Marcus. Co-worker. She kind of grunts, slumping her shoulders in the process. 
Eyes to heaven, bottom lip out as she grinds her teeth.  
‘Fucking. Asshole.’ 
She whispers it slowly. Every time. 
‘Yeah, I’m coming.’ 
Marcus is a good looking boy. Knows it too. He’s all muscles and beards and combovers and skinny jeans and buttoned up t-shirts and whatever else is cool at any given time. He’s got the IQ of a turkey, but he gets on well here. I think it’s that smile. It’s even caught me off guard once or twice. Katelynn hates him. Says all he does it talk about gym and women. He passes himself with me. Whatever. 
Katelynn wanders off back to work or daydream. I’m not sure which she does most. I’ll see her Friday. I agreed to go and see some local band with her. She knows one of them or something. I’m not a huge music lover, but we’ll get to hang out at least. I leave. My phone beeps. 
‘Gem I need you to look after calls in office for afternoon if poss. Will sort you out with €€€ @ the weekend. Love. Dad x’ 
I know he’s in Kirwan’s. He knows I know too. We’ll both pretend to the contrary. 
Easier that way. I’ll probably never see that money either. He knows I know that too. 
He also knows I don’t work Tuesdays at The Print. I’ve covered five of his last six Tuesday afternoons. It’s usually less regular to be fair. Deep down I know he’s a good man. I know I love him and I know he loves me. And he knows I know. My phone beeps again. An attempt at humour to lessen the weight of his request 
‘Snert Murphy is looking for a good woman to take his hand in marriage. Gr8 prospects. He’s been asking for you. LOL’ 
I shudder at Snert Murphy and at ‘LOL’. 
Sometimes I ask myself why I didn’t just leave when I had the chance. Then I see Katelynn with no family and I see my idiot father with no family and I remember why I made my choice. We can’t all be lucky as I am to be happy on my own.

Wednesday Afternoon in Balrahan 
I am officially an idiot on so many levels. Can my life actually get any worse at the minute? Where do I even start? Work? Keys? Last night? Men? Money? Maybe the fact I’m a whole two weeks late. That’s happened before. Trying not to worry. Maybe that I’m still stuck in this shithole town when I should be travelling the world by now? 
That’s one I thing I know for sure. I need to get out of here. This place suffocates me. 
Suffocates my creativity. Somebody told me last week I was cynical? Me? I’m a dreamer. I’m open-minded. Sometimes I even wish I wish I was just like Gemma. Steady. Solid. Content with how she is. Not a total slut. Why do I do these things to myself? Why can’t I just be where I want to be? You see all over Facebook that everyone is living their lives, travelling, seeing the world, doing cool shit. Why aren’t I? Five years ago I’d have said I’d be in like India or somewhere now, just taking it all in, getting inspiration for my art, so why aren’t I? 
So Monday night, while tucked into bed watching Orange is the New Black, my phone beeps. Something in me knew who and what. 
‘A quick word. Meet you at front of car park in twenty? Nothing dodge. Quick chat needed.’ 
I tell myself not to reply. Nothing dodge. I hate when he tries to sound cool. Within twenty minutes I’m in his Passat, driving to his place. The car has a feint smell of booze. I can’t tell if it’s him or not. He seems sober anyway.  
‘I’ve a new wine. Bill sent it over.’ 
Bill. Fucking sleazy Bill. 
‘Not drinking.’ 
‘Not like you Katelynn?’ 
‘Saving’ 
‘Oh right. Anything special?’ 
‘New tattoo. Getting out of here soon too.’ 
He sniggers a little. I hate that. Then apologises. 
‘Sorry. You’re right. I’ve been all over the world myself. Best thing a body can do. Spread your wings.’ 
‘I know I’m dreaming but I’d love to just like go places, chill out and paint. Find somewhere secluded and laid back and just work to get by in like, a bar or something, y’know?’ Just like, exist. Y’know? I want to be on my own. Away. Nobody but me.’ 
His phone rings. He ignores me. I know he thinks it’s bullshit. 
‘Sorry I really have to take this.’ 
Then that laughter. That pompous laughter. Get me out of here now. He hangs up eventually. 
‘Bill?’ 
‘Yah’ 
‘Ugh’ 
‘Ha. He’s not that bad Katelynn.’ 
‘A complete creep. Everybody knows it too’ 
Silence. He always owns the silences. 
‘What is it anyway?’ 
‘What’s what?’ 
‘Why did you get me out of bed?’ 
‘Nothing terribly worrying.’ 
‘Well what then?’ 
‘Somebody has been passing the odd remark here and there.’ 
‘What? Who?’ 
‘Nobody who’s opinion I particularly care for..’ 
‘You worried?’ 
‘No I was just wondering…’ 
‘…If I said anything?’ 
‘Well yes’ 
‘Are you actually nuts?’ That fucking grin. 
‘Will she find out or not?’ 
‘No. They don’t mix in the same circles.’ 
‘I hope not’ 
‘I hear you have a big night Friday?’ 
‘Yeah’ 
‘Where you staying afterwards?’ 
‘Don’t’ 
‘You’d think a young lady like you would have a sense of humour.’ 
That fucking grin. That stare. He exudes confidence. 
‘As I said anyway. New wine.’ 
‘So?’ 
‘Well..it’s good stuff. Chilean. Bill brought it back.’ 
‘Aren’t you working tomorrow?’ 
‘Tuesdays aren’t hectic.’ 
And so it went from there. 
Yesterday morning I woke. Headache. Late. Shit. 
‘That asshole Marcus is gonna love this’ I think. 
He’s already gone. I let myself out. 
Shit. My keys. In his car surely. I try to call. No answer. Can’t call his workplace obviously. I can’t wear what I’m wearing. Some of his wife’s clothes are in the wardrobe. Boy do I feel bad. Kinda quirky looking though. 
Get to work. More bullshit. I’m slow, groggy , laboured. I drink a lot of coffee. Have to kick that habit. Smoke two rollies at break. Have to kick that too. Christ, I hate that beard.  He’d never have considered it before it was cool. That ridiculous smile. Say cheese. More coffee. Gemma calls in. Weird chat. She’s coming Friday anyway. I sometimes wish I could be such a great friend/ I wonder how she doesn’t get lonely. 
No men. It’s been ages for her. She leaves as Marcus starts to give me grief. Who does he think he is? 
Later on, I still have no keys. I take a chance on the call. He’s not there. She answers. Oh shit. Guilt. I hang up. I have no choice but to ask Marcus. He’s the only one around and it’s pissing outside. I really need to start driving. ‘Yeah, I’ll spin you wherever. No hassle. I’ll be hitting the gym anyway.’ 
‘Spin. Hitting. Oh fuck off.’ Except I don’t say it obviously. 
Should I tell him in the car? Will it give him a greater sense of importance? No need. 
It’s happened before. I need to tell him I don’t have anywhere to go, but he’s gonna think I want something. 
‘Thanks. This is kind of awkward but I don’t actually have anywhere to go right now? Lost my keys.’ 
‘It’s no hassle you can stay in mine for a bit. I’ll hit the gym and you can chill out there’ 
‘I should have them later.’ 
‘It’s no hassle’ 
He plays his own stuff on the way home. It sounds truly awful. Thump thump. Where’s the soul? He flexes where possible, revs the car where possible. I try to look as bored as possible. I look at my nails, realise I’m being cliché, so start scrolling through my phone instead. 
‘Weird pants, man’ 
‘You mean girl?’ 
‘Force of habit. They suit your style though…that whole…’ 
‘What?’ 
‘You know…like artsy thing?’ 
‘I don’t follow trends. I am the way I am’ 
He sniggers. Second time in two nights. Can’t wait to get out of here. 
He goes to the gym and I wallow and think and build things up in my head. What if I am? Course I’m not. I regret. I wonder. I dream. I look around his place. Idiotic posters on his wall. Room is cleaner than last time I was in it. I need those keys, preferably before Marcus gets back. I try calling the mobile but still no answer. 
Doesn’t take a rocket scientist to work out where he is. 
I think about Gemma. I feel a little sorry for her now. 
Asshole walks back in.  
‘Hi’ 
‘Hi sorry. I thought I’d be gone’ 
‘Ha chill. Mind if I skin up?’ He starts to anyway. 
‘Your place. Do whatever’ 
‘You smoke?’ 
‘Have done. On occasion’ 
‘Assumed it’d be your kinda thing’ 
‘What’s that supposed to mean?’ 
‘Y’know?’ He looks me up and down. 
‘How I dress?’ 
‘You’re artsy or whatever…your music. All those badges and shit on your bag?’ 
‘Eh, they’re not shit. I actually collect them?’ 
‘Grand. Whatever. Ya wanna smoke or not?’ 
He skins up with ease. It looks pleasurable to him. The process, the routine. For a second I envy him. He starts to make me laugh a bit. His smile looks more sincere now. The doorbell rings. I look at the time. Half ten. The last hour or two has flown. I panic. He laughs at me. 
‘It’s grand, It’s just my nephew.’ 
‘Is he coming in?’ 
‘Nah, just have to give him something’ 
He grabs a plastic bag from the drawer beneath his wooden coffee table. I don’t ask. I look out and see a boy speeding out of the estate on what looks like a BMX. He looks a little old for it maybe, but it reminds me of the one I had. My Dad got it for me. I was a tomboy. I get sad and cry a little. His arms are big. Cosy and warm. 
There’s a current between us now. That fucking smile… 
I don’t mention what’s really on my mind. Any of it. He too is gone the next morning when I get up. I get a text. 
‘Have your keys. Could do with a cuddle this morning. Big night’ 
I get sick. Maybe I’ll take a test later. I’m sure it’ll be OK. Two men. Two nights. Coworker and best friend’s Dad. Again. Good girl Katelynn. 
 	 
Thursday evening 
I’m never bothered here. That’s why I like it. I ask Martin Kirwan, my loyal publican, for a pint. A pure gent. I owe him a couple of hundred, but he’ll get it eventually. He’s not stuck. He’s shaking his head and muttering something into a glass as he washes. 
‘Are you OK, Martin?’ 
‘Ah those fuckin’ bangers have the dogs gone mad. Same story every year. Guards are useless’ 
‘Is it Halloween tonight, it is?’ 
‘No it’s tomorrow. Sooner the better it’s over for another year.’ 
‘Those days are long gone. Gemma used to love Halloween when she was a little one. Stopped going out once Sheena left. I’m too old now Daddy she’d say. Broke my heart to be honest’ 
‘Some woman had to break your heart at some stage Devlin Mahon’ 
‘Only the two so far’ 
‘She’s a good girl Devlin. Seems to get on about her business. No bullshite.’ 
‘Keeps me going Devlin. Keeps the office going the odd day too. On top of her own stuff. I keep telling her she should go back and do Law. She has a head for it, but she won’t listen.’ 
‘And has she e’er a man Dev?’ 
‘Not that I know of. She probably wouldn’t tell her old man anyway, but I really don’t think she does. Too…independent I suppose you’d call it. I think she’s seen enough of bad relationships.’ 
‘Thought as much’ 
‘Do you know what she did two years ago?’ 
‘Go on’ 
‘She finished up in college. Design or whatever it was. She paid her own way all throughout. I offered on countless occasions, but no. This was her thing. Head strong.’ 
‘Bit of a chip on her shoulder Dev?’ 
‘Maybe…anyway, super talented at this…design or what have you. She gets an offer to go to New York for a year. Internship. Put up in accommodation. Top of the class, she was, y’know? I told her. Go. You have to go.  A chance to climb’ ‘She didn’t stir’ 
‘No’ 
‘Says she was happy here. Plenty of opportunities in the future. She’d get a job handy, which she did in fairness. Stick me on another pint’ 
’I’d say it woulda killed ya though Dev?’ 
‘Ah no…I mean I still have it the way I want it. Plenty of cash in the bank, work is fine. I’m still as handsome as ever and that political career might yet take off’ 
‘You won’t bullshit me with that grin Mahon. Many’s a day she keeps that place going for ya. Will I ever see that couple of hundred since there’s plenty in the bank?’ 
‘Tomorrow evening. You have my word’ 
‘Do you mind if I ask you something Devlin?’ 
I know what’s coming. I’ve seen it in him ever since Snert Murphy opened his idiotic gob on Tuesday. Not the first time either. Of all the sneaky fuckers to see me with her. All I wanted was a pint. Is there nowhere in this town I can go now and just relax? Get away from the stresses, the begrudgery. You do well in this life and what do they do? Hang on every possibility that can take you down. He won’t get that two hundred tomorrow either. There was no need to make a big deal about it. It would have come his way. 
‘What Martin?’ 
‘Ah…I’d say you know…something that was said?’ 
‘Lots of things are said around this town Martin. I’d have thought you above that?’ 
‘Ah look, it’s nothing to do with me’ 
‘Alright. Look. It was a strange situation’ 
‘Was?’ 
‘Is. The odd time’ 
‘A good lookin’ young one…’ 
‘Don’t talk to me’ 
‘Do ya not… 
‘…feel bad?’ 
He has me thinking about it now. Dwelling. The worst thing you can do to a man after a few pints. He, a publican, should know this too. A silence hangs in the air. I usually take control of the silence. The pressure’s on me here. I feel sweaty and uncomfortable. It’ll be a while before I step foot in here again. 
‘When have I ever been able to say no Martin? I was dropping her home there one night. Two years ago now it must be. She was out at some gig with Gemma. She had a few in her. I had one or two earlier myself if truth be told. There was darts on that night. Anyway, she started to get upset and told me about the parents y’know? 
Says I’d understand and all of this. She told me she had a need to be held sometimes. I thought she was looking at me in an unusual way when she said it. I pulled over anyway. Brought her into me. She had her hand on my chest and she was breathing heavily and sighing. She knew well what she was doing too. Not simple. I told her she didn’t have to go back to the apartment. She said she didn’t want to. I turned back. Didn’t leave her at Gemma’s place. We went straight to mine. She got me Martin. It took me back. The shape of her body. Her figure. To die for. This fucking tattoo on her leg. Reminded me of the one on the Argentinian flag funnily enough. I told her that story and she got a good laugh. Told her not to tell 
Gemma. She said she wouldn’t be telling her anything, that she was well able to keep a secret. I left her back in the morning. She was quiet alright, but she seemed contented in herself. Not phased by me at all. I didn’t know what to think myself. Guilt. Danger. Lust. Fear, I suppose? I came straight in here and met your good self if memory serves me right. I was a bit shaken if anything. Not like me. I called into The Jazz a few days later at tea time. She smiled and spoke to me for a minute or two taking the order. I get an e-mail later that same evening. The phone beeps. It says: 
‘Sorry to bother you. I got your e-mail address online. Lost my keys and don’t feel like seeing Gemma yet. Can I call over to yours for a bit? Just maybe have a quick chat about the other night. Nothing dodge.’ 
She calls over. The same again. Better this time. There’s passion involved. 
Familiarity. It carried on a long time, here and there. Not regularly. At different points we both called it quits, y’know? Because of Gemma I suppose. I’ve always been conscious of her age too. I told her to carry on doing what she was doing. Other fellas and that kind of thing. We both knew it couldn’t go anywhere. It was a nothing thing. Something just to take us away from the reality of life y’know?’ 
‘Are you big into her Dev?’ 
Oul’ Dinny Cronin walks in. Conversation over. He probably wouldn’t be able to hear us anyway. I sip away at my pint. Do a bit of thinking. More bangers outside. I start to think about the dogs. Poor dogs. Must be scary. Confusing. It’s satisfying when I realise I’ve been thinking about something else for a few minutes. I know how I’m seen here. In this town. I’m liked. Generally. But there’ll always be the begrudgers. 
You’d hear them the odd time. Snert Murphy had mentioned something before Tuesday, but the jumped up little weasel was giddy on dole day and felt it appropriate to bring it up infront of the whole of Kirwans. I drank heavily that day. Did a lot of thinking. I’d been with Katelynn the night before of course. Gemma covered for me down town. Not the first time. I’ll have to give her a few pound soon. I had to drop Katelynn her keys yesterday. We had a quick chat. Decided to call it quits. She didn’t seem herself. I think she’s seeing another young man who works in the coffee place now. All brawn, no brains. More power to him anyway. I hope he’ll appreciate it. 
‘Give me one more and a chaser Martin’ 
‘No problem Devlin’ Time to move on. 
 	  
Saturday Morning, Balrahan 
‘Well what’s the story? Did you hear what happened last night down in Fagan’s?’ 
‘No were ya out?’ 
‘Yeah it was a mad night. Marcus Daly’s in serious bother now anyway’ 
‘What was he at? Was he caught with stuff? Was he not doin’ DJ?’ 
‘He was yeah, but that’s not it. He’s gonna be a Daddy!’ 
‘Fuck. Off. For who?’ 
‘Ha I’ll give ya three guesses’ 
‘Ah just tell me’ 
‘You’ll never get it’ 
‘Just tell me will ya? I’m dyin’ to know’ 
‘You know that real artsy one that works on the coffee shop with him? Used to be a real nerd in school. A year or two behind us?’ 
‘Yer one with the big stupid tattoo on her leg?’ 
‘Yeah her. I couldn’t believe it’ 
‘No. Way? Delighted for her. She always thought she was a great one anyway. Real stuck up like. Didn’t think she’d be like that though?’ 
‘That’s not even the funniest thing’ 
‘What?’ 
‘So anyway, this gig was on. Some band anyway. I wasn’t lookin’ at them. Turns out she found out she’s pregnant the other day. Like Thursday or something. Told yer one Gemma Mahon…’ 
‘Fuckin’ snobby bitch that one’ 
‘…Yeah and anyway neither of the girls were drinkin’ or whatever. Just watching and the gig and probably talkin’ it over or that. Next thing he comes in goin’ mad’ 
‘Marcus?’ 
‘Yeah like. So anyway, he walks in and he’s completely out of it. Was supposed to be djing down in Rattigan’s but never turned up’ 
‘Did she tell him?’ 
‘She’d told him already like? Him and Gemma. I said that?’ 
‘No ya didn’t?’ 
‘Anyway right, he’s out of it and he walks up to them and he’s freakin’ out. Goin’ mad at yer one’ 
‘Yer one Gemma?’ 
‘No yer one Katelynn or whatever. The artsy one’ 
‘He’s there crying, jaw swinging, telling her he has to talk to her and he’s saying she has to get rid of it and all. 
‘No way? 
‘Yeah so anyway, they walk off and she’s real upset and yer one Gemma is tryin’ to talk to her. Next thing he starts followin’ her and starts shouting. You fuckin tell ‘er or 
I will’ 
‘No way. Psycho shit’ 
‘Yeah that’s exactly what I was sayin’ Anyway, he keeps shouting and roaring and everyone’s looking now like. She’s bawling and yer one is holding her and telling him to calm down. Then eventually the bouncers come over but shure they know him so they don’t really do anything just tell him to relax.’ 
‘Oh my God what was he on about anyway?’ 
‘I’ll let ya guess’ 
‘Ah just tell me I’m mad to know’ 
‘Who’s Gemma’s ould lad?’ 
‘Devlin Mahon?’ 
‘Yep’ 
‘No. Fucking. Way. Hilarious.’ 
‘Yeah. Turns out she’s been ridin’ him behind her best friend’s back for over a year. 
Talk about a bitch’ 
‘Oh my God’ 
‘Yeah, so anyway he’s there freaking out still’ 
‘Marcus?’ 
‘Yeah obviously. Anyway he’s probably there thinking this is his way of getting out of being a Daddy or whatever’ 
‘Shure can ya imagine him with a kid?’ 
‘Hilarious’ 
‘So go on anyway, what happened?’ 
‘So yer one Katelynn is all like, overwhelmed or whatever?’ 
‘I getcha yeah. Did she admit it?’ 
‘Yeah. She full on tells her absolutely everything. She couldn’t help it, needed someone there, she was gonna tell her, tried to stop bla bla bla’ 
‘No way?’ 
‘Yeah and like how she wanted to tell her all this time but that her friendship meant so much and he didn’t wanna ruin that. Even starts goin’ on about like how she wished Gemma wasn’t her daughter loadsa times so she could tell er. She’s bawling all this time and he’s just there… 
‘Marcus?’ 
‘Yeah, like. Obviously. He’s just there with his hands on his head freaking out’ 
‘I always thought he was real fake anyway. Big stupid smile on him’ 
‘I know. Serves him right for being a dickhead. So anyway yer one Mahon. Gemma or whatever. She’s just there shaking non-stop. I suppose in shock or whatever?’ 
‘Yeah, yeah I getcha…Did she not say anything to her?’ 
‘It was mad. I actually thought it was brilliant. Like I don’t like her but fair play to her ya know? I actually did feel a bit sorry for her like?’ 
‘Yeah I suppose’ 
‘You could see her lip quivering and all that and everyone’s kind of copping what’s going on and waiting for her to like slap her or something?’ 
‘Dead right. Did she?’ 
‘No way shure she wouldn’t be like that. She just steps back and like composes herself?’ 
‘Yeah I getcha, yeah.  
‘…And she goes – The two of you were the only people I’ve ever cared about. You were the only person I’ve ever trusted. I hope you and your baby are happy in the future. You’ll never see me again’ 
‘No way? Real dramatic like?’ 
‘I don’t think she meant it to be but it was like that whole thing where someone expects somebody to be angry but then they’re more disappointed and then it’s actually worse?’ 
‘Yeah I getcha. Mad. Did she just fuck off home then?’ 
‘Gemma?’ 
‘Yeah’ 
‘Yeah just walked out’ 
‘Jesus. Ridin’ two lads she was so? What a slut. Delighted for her’ 
‘I know yeah. Didn’t think she’d get with Marcus Daly. Thought he had a different type’ 
‘Ah he likes any type.’ 
‘True. He’s hot though in fairness’  
 	 
New Year’s Day, Balrahan. 
Another year down and still going strong. The usual crowd have arrived in. No New 
Year’s Resolutions here, thank God. Billy Reilly has his few pals down the end, the younger lads are out throwing a few darts and listening to the jukebox. Their first full year’s drinkin’ behind them. The Christmas clothes are getting a good wearing too. Oul’ Dinny Cronin is down one end of the bar. Hasn’t said a whole lot since he came in around noon. Hasn’t heard a whole lot either God bless him. There’s Joey Flaherty and JP Dwyer and Ben and Simon, the twins. Not a woman between the four of them. The racing has the blood going and the boys are getting lively. It’d have to be Snert Murphy, the little bollox, to bring down the mood. 
‘Any sign of your man, Murt?’ 
The boys throw him a look, but he’s a persistent little hoor when he wants to be. I don’t want to give him the satisfaction. Billy steps in. 
‘What’s it to you Snert anyway? Ya ever mind your own business do ya?’ 
‘Ah poor old Billy. Ya missing Mr. Mahon to tell you a few fairytales and buy ya yer drink for ya?’ 
Billy’s harmless enough. Wouldn’t hurt a fly. Knows who to pursue, does Snert. A little weasel. Never had the grounds to bar him. Just sits there, drinking, sneering, observing. The odd bet. Simon steps in. 
‘You’re only ragin’ cos his young ones gone off, ya dirty fucker ya’ 
That gets a response alright. A few cheers. You’d think he’d have got the message at this stage. Plenty of other establishments to drink in this town. Snert had a thing for Mahon’s daughter, by all accounts. Whether he did or didn’t to be honest I’m not sure. But we’re not likely to let the truth get in the way around here. I’ll let the boys have their fun here. 
‘I’d say ya went after her and she ran away, that the case Snert?’ 
More laughter. 
‘Woulda thought she’d be a bit big for ya Snert?’ 
I step in here. No need lads. Craic is craic, but she was a grand young one. Atleast she’s out of this place and away from the father and that other one. Australia or so I hear. I doubt she’ll set foot in this town again. Why would she? Doesn’t keep in contact with anyone around but I’m sure there won’t be a bother on her over there. Still. A big shock.  
‘Have you need talking to him at all though Murt, seriously?’ 
Not the first time they’ve asked, but atleast Ben is more sincere than the Snert. 
‘He won’t be around again lads.’ 
‘Did he go back over to yer one in Argentina?’ 
That gets a few chuckles, then Snert feels brave again. 
‘He’s some hero to yee boys. He was brave enough leaving that young one and she pregnant wasn’t he?’ 
Snert Murphy couldn’t care less about Katelynn Dennehy or her unborn child. It’s the pretence that gets to me. My blood boils a bit. My voice raises, out of character. 
‘Not that it’s any of your business Snert, you little bollox, but that baby wasn’t his and that was proven. What he did wasn’t right, but who are you to preach your morals around here. Devlin Mahon was a good man for this town. He worked hard here for years. And many men enjoyed his company and benefitted from it. I spoke to him last week. He called me… 
I calm a bit. Speak more slowly. 
‘…He called and was asking for yee. Said he’d be back for a while sometime, but not too soon and he’d enjoy a pint with yee when he does.’ 
‘Did ya ever get that couple of hundred off him? You’d never give any of us that sort of leeway with money’ 
‘If you want to drink somewhere else you can. He passed his regards to all of yee anyway and that’s that. I’ll say no more’ 
Mahon told me a lot more than I care to tell these. Never have I heard the man more disconsolate. A wife and daughter both lost to his lustful ways, is how he put it. 
Career put on hold. Hasn’t heard from Gemma since she left. Not a sign. Heard from a relative she’s in Australia and doing well. I’m glad for her to tell you the truth. He asked me more than I could tell him. Naturally enough the man asked what I’d heard about young Katelynn. I couldn’t bring myself to tell him that little fucker Daly packed his bags. No place for a young chap like that then either I suppose. Gone playing music in Spain according to the younger fellas. According to the Snert she’s still in 
The Jazz. He has it on good authority she’ll get her job back after she leaves and wants to come back. She’ll be alright too. Had notions about herself I suppose, but shure won’t she find her way too, like the rest of us.

3ccdtj,1,2015-07-06,Job opportunity advice for recent college graduate,s08,AskMarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/3ccdtj/job_opportunity_advice_for_recent_college_graduate/,"I am a recent college graduate with my bachelor's degree in business admin/marketing and I have an opportunity to do marketing for a law firm that someone I know works at. It would be mostly web marketing which I have some experience in due to my internship. However, I have no interest in this industry, working in this position or industry long-term, and I have no knowledge about how to market a law firm. The website is in bad shape right now and I don't even know where to start. The tasks of the job are not concrete, so it seems like lot of responsibility on myself and I don't know if I have the experience to work on my own like that yet. I am also afraid of there not being enough ""work"" to occupy myself with full-time since I will be working on mostly my own.

The other issue is that they want me to create a general marketing plan and goals for them before we make anything official. But again, I am doubting myself and my experience since I have no knowledge of how to market the firm.

To me, it feels that it would be just be a filler job. For example, if I get another great opportunity in two months, I would want to take it. While I want to make money, I am not super desperate right now. But I also don't want to turn it down and then not find a job and regret not taking this one.

So basically, do I pursue this opportunity and take the job? Would web marketing in general look good on a resume even if I try to get a job in a different industry next? If I do pursue it, what type of things should I say I will do for them in the plan?"
3ccm52,5,2015-07-06,"I'm [23 F] thinking of ending my relationship with my [24 M] fiance, I feel like he's neglectful.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ccm52/im_23_f_thinking_of_ending_my_relationship_with/,"Hi everyone, I need to confide about one of the biggest possible decisions of my life. I'll try to make it short. 

I've been in a relationship for 7 years, engaged for 2 of them and cohabiting for the past 3. He's always done the basic stuff, paid his part of the rent and sometimes helps with housework/laundry/cooking when I am overly stressed and overwhelmed. I recently finished grad school which consisted of a full-time unpaid internship, full-time coursework on top of which I maintained my part-time job to pay rent and buy groceries. 

I gifted him a $1500 sum of cash from my student loan excess to pay off his debts before I began the program (*Stupid stupid idea of mine, I know**). Now, I'm financially overdrawn and my credit is ruined from footing so many bills this year while he works full-time and earns close to 40K per year, but is consistently short on cash. He recently took 5$ from my coin jar to pay for gas, knowing that I haven't been able to make minimum payments on my student loans for weeks.

He spends his money on junk. Fast food, going out for coffees, and his new fad is wanting to buy new livingroom furniture despite the stuff we have being completely functional. We put off our wedding for a year so that we can save up, but so far he's doing nothing. He also needs major dental work, but again, won't listen if I remind him of our other expenses. 

I'm hurting right now because I spent hundreds (read: 400-500) of dollars on an awesome birthday weekend for him in the winter, but for mine? He took me out for fried chicken at a fast food restaurant. I just graduated my program with honours, and he didn't even take me out for dinner. I also tracked down and retrieved his stolen bike while I had the flu (long story...) and even the police officer said ""wow, someone deserves a steak dinner tonight!""

At this point, I've made him out to be a bad guy. I promise he does not cheat (that I know of) and has no drug habits... He pays rent on time and sometimes buys groceries. The hard part is that I can't even get out of this relationship because I'm so financially screwed from this year or else I'd take some time on my own. 

tl;dr I'm thinking about ending a 7 year relationship but I can't afford to. 



   
**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!"
3ccn8f,16,2015-07-06,[FR] 3 dates with a girl from OKC. Let's debrief some of the better plays from these 3 days.,Goobynight,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3ccn8f/fr_3_dates_with_a_girl_from_okc_lets_debrief_some/,"I now realize that it is definitely not best to have your first FR be 3 dates in one, but hopefully someone will enjoy this.

Skills I felt solid at going in:

* Eye contact

* Leading, at least in terms of always being the one with a plan and inviting her to come along, instead of asking her to come with me.

* High value: I go to a top school, love my summer internship, and can express that without being self-indulgent (in contrast to this sentence).

**Pre-meet on OKC**

I'll keep this section brief, especially since it is honestly pretty weak in terms of technique. Just got lucky. Here was my initial message from back in May:

&gt; Hey, this might seem sort of out there, but I appreciate the values you listed in your profile. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to be checking out the Cavs game in Lincoln park tomorrow. You should totally come with me.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't want to go, just tell me you aren't interested. My feelings will be fine and I'll appreciate it more than being ignored. Thanks!

Her response:

&gt; You're a cutie! I'd love to meet, but I'm not sure if tomorrow's the best day

I agreed with her, since we were both going into finals week at separate universities. So, at this point, we went dark for 19 days. I then went home for a week before starting my summer internship. 

**Day 1**

For the record, it took about one month to go from initial message to meeting, but I wasn't texting her or anything in between. I didn't even learn her name until this day. 

I told her we were going to go rock climbing, which I consider I really fun, active first date. Unfortunately, it was pouring, and this particular wall is open air, so I had to ad lib.

We had a surprisingly chill vibe between us from the start, so I decided we would go to this craft store she wanted to hit up. We talked while she shopped for some stuff and then I found us a place to eat (I was new to this part of Chicago).

Overall: Still nothing that great here. Actually pretty weak, since I didn't even kiss or hug her. She at least got to see how I responded to plans not working out and how I can identify good local food in a new area, but as I left, I had a feeling this would be a friendship at best.

**Interim period**

In between days 1 and 2, my team managed to score 2nd place at a hackathon. This gave me both a great story and clear DHV. We were texting during this week. I'm okay with texting as long as I'm not investing more into it than her and it isn't taking away from another part of my life. This was mostly picture updates on cool shit in our lives (her completing her crafts, me competing in the hackathon).


**Day 2**

This is one week later (last Friday). 

I worked and she had the day off. She takes the train down to meet me for walking along the Chicago river. This actually goes awry when she let's me know that she is *legitimately afraid** of tall buildings (quite ironic for working in NYC/Chicago). I handle this pretty well, help her focus on some dogs and the water rather than the skyline. I have experience with calming techniques for anxiety/depression. We end up finding a spot to sit and talking. At some point I'm able to string into the conversation that I'm hesitant to call my work ""work"". I love coming in and I have fun throughout the day. I have a feeling that this is an attractive quality to have.

Eventually, I have us abandon the riverwalk and start exploring downtown. I remember asking her about her scarf type thing and trying it on. She definitely got a good laugh out of this and we made our way to a candy store she wanted to hit up. We spend a good amount of time in this 2 floor candy store; she's loving it, so I* just let it happen*. There's a good takeaway here I suppose. If you're somewhere like the zoo or this candy store and the girl girl is thoroughly entertained, just follow along and reap the rewards!

We make a pit stop at a starbucks to charge her phone. I guess I had a handy converter in my backpack to help her out, which expresses some handiness?

Lastly, she had dinner plans with her university friends later that night and clearly wanted me to walk her there. During that walk, I offered my hand to her when going down a staircase and she either willingly didn't grab it, didn't see, or just couldn't respond quick enough. I took this shit completely in stride; kept us going and talking like nothing happened. Within 30 seconds, she is brushing against me and grabbing on to my arm. Great feeling. I remember reading some advice here on how this is exactly what we should do in this situation. Thank you!

At that point, I pretty much knew I was solid. When a girl squeezes your hand, she's down for a kiss and the kiss goodbye was completely natural/expected. 

**Interim period**

On my way home, she was already sending me pictures of the food during the meal. I met up with my buddy and sent her some pics of us having a good time buying chicken and playing games. She straight up texts me at one point ""I must admit I kind of miss you"", so I suggest that we should probably spend the holiday together.


She sort of makes it difficult saying that she could only meet me during the day before having to go to some BBQ. I respond bluntly saying that I'm looking for one main group for the entire holiday, so it sort of breaks down into us meeting on Sunday (allegedly).

One note here is that she definitely shit tested me asking ""Also don't you have like friends to meet?"" My plan was honestly to just find my own fun by playing volleyball or spikeball on the beach, but I just remained mysterious here, responding with ""I do, but our stuff is a little more transient"".

The afternoon of the 4th, she sends me a pic of her tanning by the lake in a bikini. I send her pics of our neighborhood picnic with a petting zoo and performances (what do you guys think of these pic exchanges?). 

A few hours later, one of her +1s for the BBQ apparently isn't feeling well and she's now offering me the spot. Game time.




**Day 3**

I meet her at the station with AFC friend. He'll come up more later. We do some quick beer shopping and head to the apartment party.

At the party itself, I do great. I'm getting to know everyone really well and she can clearly sense my social confidence. I check back in with her every so often, but the majority of my time is spent making my way around to every other person. I definitely suggest this.

Another wave of people shows up and I'm exchanging beer for an American flag hat and taking pictures with these dudes. Another girl says I'm cute in the hat, and she's clearly into me at least a little bit. The girl I came with notices and even texted me a ""....."" because I kept the conversation going for a little while (I'm free to do that), but I pull her back in as I tell her we have to leave for downtown.

AFC comes with us, which is totally OK. The ride takes a while, we actually miss the fireworks and decide to go to a bar. I'm able to jump in and recommend a place nearby that serves some nice country/American food. Just another case where I get to lead and show off some local knowledge.

Eventually, I just text her that it would be nice if we have some time alone. This other guy had offered her the chance to ""crash at his place"" multiple times. I guess he didn't really know we were dating, but I just maintained my frame. We actually end up having to pretend we are all heading home before regrouping. This dude was 3rd wheeling that hard.

We do some more walking around downtown, enjoying the ambiance before I suggest heading back to her place to see those crafts she painted (she had already soft offered this so I didn't even need the ""excuse"" honestly). 

We get there, take care of her drunken roommate and then head to bed. I didn't want to have sex with her yet, so I was completely satisfied with making out, kissing and touching each other all over, cuddling, and waking up next to each other. During this, she even apologized for not coming and seeing me earlier that day.

Basically as the title says I'm afraid that I will end up alone forever. Right now I'm 19, will be a sophomore in college, have good grades/ a good internship, and have a decent amount of money. The only shitty part of my life seems to be my social life. I have a small amount of friends, around 2 to 3, but that's it. I don't have a very good social life.  I feel like it will stay this way forever and I end up getting depressed about it often. 

I've never even hugged a girl or done anything. I now consider myself undateable. I have never met a girl who was actually interested in me or anything I had to say. I feel trapped and become depressed when I realize I won't be able to anything about it. I feel like even if I try extremely hard I won't be able to find anyone. I feel like no one would actually like me for who I am. Because of this I have started to hate myself more and more. I can't find any good qualities about myself. I hate everything about myself and I wish I was someone else. I don't have any self esteem anymore and my self confidence is at an all time low. I don't know what to do. 

Because of these feelings I feel like I am not worth doing regular things that other people do. An example of this is that I was sitting next to a cute girl on a bus and I think I wanted to talk to her. I stopped myself because I thought I wasn't worth talking to her. I don't believe that I am on par with other guys my age and that I am worth less than them. No one would want to even date me if they could date someone else. Even if I managed to get a relationship I would probably get cheated on or dumped. 

 I back-out with a lot of things. I thought about getting into photography and picking up some other hobbies but I stop myself because of my lack of self worth. I tend not to go out, go to the mall, and do other things because I feel like I am not worth it. I have some nice clothes but I don't think it will even look good on me so I leave it my closet. That somehow I don't deserve to have anything in life at all. I feel like a sub-human and that everyone else around me is 10x better than me. I feel like the worst of the worst. Sorry for the rant."

Then, this guy comes in an hour late. Dr. So and so. 

Apparently he was supposed to be interviewing me at the same time.

Asks if I have any questions. 

I'm blank, I just asked them all to the other guy still sitting there. 

""No questions? You're not prepared. ""

Asks what I plan to do after I finish my bachelors this year.

I say I wanna start working right away. 

Says I have no motivation, why are my standards so low? Why not go for my PhD. 

FUCK YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. 

Ever consider I need the money and I can't waste anymore time at school? 

Just because you wasted your life getting your PhD doesn't mean I want to.

Then he just leaves. Just gets up and Poof.

3ccveg,46,2015-07-06,Top Ten Mistakes Students Make on Their College Application Essays,WriteToCollege,APStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/APStudents/comments/3ccveg/top_ten_mistakes_students_make_on_their_college/," The following should help you...feel free to go to my website for more information: WriteToCollege.com 

Top Ten Mistakes Students Make on Their College Application Essays

It is important to first understand the purpose of the college application essay. A student’s transcripts as well as his academic and extra-curricular achievements do not give any unique insight into the student as a person. Yes….they will illustrate hard work, intelligence, drive, aptitude, etc. However, these are the same attributes reflected in the other 30,000 applications for the same institution. I know that grandpa says, “No one is as perfect as my granddaughter” but in this arena….the obvious is commonplace. 

Quick Reality Check:
Class of 2018
Harvard: 34,295 applicants 2,023 accepted
Yale: 30,922 applicants 1,935 accepted 
Princeton: 26,607 applicants 1,939 accepted 
M.I.T 18,357 applicants 1,419 accepted 
Columbia - 32,952 applicants 2,291 accepted 
UPenn 35,788 applicants 3,551 accepted
Harvard turned down 500 students with 2400 on the SAT and…. 1,100 students were turned down with 800 on SAT Math Component.

DON’T BE DEPRESSED….
Simply put, essays help the admissions office evaluate your potential to fit into their school’s community and culture as a person. (Not as a student….not as club president….not as the driving force for raising money with a dance-a-thon or relay-for-life team and not as a swimmer who placed first in his county). Once again…the 30,000 other students….many of whom were driven to get 2400 on their SAT were also club presidents and competitors who gave their time to charity work….if not a kidney. 
Just remember, you parents aren’t the only ones with a bumper sticker that reads, “My child is an Honor Student.”

TOP TEN MISTAKES…
1) Writing about academic accomplishments. 
a) Deja Vu: These accomplishments are on your transcripts. The admissions officer already knows you achieved high marks in twelve AP classes.
b) Birds of a feather flock together: Remember your best friend when you were in the 6th grade? You drifted apart in high school once you started getting straight A’s and your friend ended up on America’s Most Wanted. The two of you aren’t applying to the same schools. On the other hand, everyone who is applying has similar or identical academic accomplishments as you do 
• Similar Classes / Similar Grades / Similar Test Scores / Similar Extra Curricular Activities: President of Physics Club, Class President, Swim Team Captain, 1st Violin in School Orchestra, Yearbook Editor, Mathletes Captain, 1000 hours of community service.
Academic accomplishments don’t tell the school anything about you as a PERSON… …as an INDIVIDUAL. It’s no different than stating the obvious… “I am smart.”

2) Trying too hard to appear intellectual.
a) I can curse in twenty languages: A thesaurus is not necessarily your friend. Using words like, “plethora” or “myriad” only serve to drive an admissions officer to early retirement. You need not swallow a thesaurus to “sound” intelligent.
This comes from The University of Virginia: An actual excerpt from a TERRIBLE essay…. 
“From an early age, we accept death as the inevitable, but do not comprehend its actual denotation. Death is the impending future that all people must eventually grasp. In my early teens, my grandfather tragically perished. As a youth who did not identify with such a cataclysm I was saturated with various emotions. Initially, I was grieved by the loss of a loved one and could not understand why this calamity had to befall upon my family. I always considered death to have a devastating effect, but was shocked by the emotional strain it places upon an individual.” 
Do you get any sense of the PERSON who wrote this? It’s just a collection of clichés put together with “Ten dollar words.” I get NO insight into this teen as an INDIVIDUAL. 
b) That Pythagoras was no square: You don’t need to discuss your love of Shakespeare or Milton if it’s not true and you think it sounds better than discussing the merits of the Twilight series. On the other hand, if you’re reading Fifty Shades of Grey you have bigger issues to worry about than what college you get into.
c) Eszopiclone, Ramelteon, Triazolam, Zaleplon, Zolpidem: There are enough sleeping pills on the market so the admissions officer doesn’t need an essay to put him to sleep. I am not suggesting that the essay rival that of a SNL monologue but it can’t be boring either. You can write about something as dry as my mother-in-law’s Thanksgiving turkey but it needs to sound interesting in story, sub-text, personality, connotation, sentence length, syntax, and unique in perspective. 

3) Trying too hard to appear creative. There is a good reason the common application topics changed a few years ago, removing “A Topic of Your Choice.” Too many came across as pretentious, clichéd, and desperate (trying
too hard) in an attempt to “stand out.” These aren’t creative writing assignments. They aren’t
looking for “clever,” they are looking for YOU.
A few bad examples…
• Sweat dripped from my brow as the proctor meticulously handed out the nationally recognized assessment examination. My pulse raced and my heart pounded through my chest…
• It was a cold and dreary night when I first arrived in London. I could hear the faint whispers of the Bard himself beckoning me to the Globe Theater. 
• It was all up to me. Bases loaded with two men out in the bottom of the ninth. We were suffering a dearth of three runs. I dug my cleats into the dusty granules of dirt, held my bat firmly and watched for the pitch like an eagle watches for its prey. 

4) Taking a generic approach. Stay far away from these types of clichés. 
a) Check the basement for Pods or Avoid clichés like the plague. i) “I’m hardworking, ambitious, and driven.” ii) “I love to be challenged.” iii) “I am intellectually curious.” iv) “My peers often look to me for leadership.” v) “My grandfather’s death made me want to be a doctor.” vi) “I want to make a difference in the world.”

5) My Major interest is to Major in Chemistry
• No matter which common application question you choose, don’t write about what you plan on majoring in. Let’s say you want to be a Chemistry major. (My homage to Heisenberg and Breaking Bad) Your resume is filled with AP Chemistry, internships and summer programs in chemistry, chemistry clubs, etc. And now you write that the place you are most comfortable is in a Chemistry Lab??????? You appear one-dimensional. You don’t look like a well-rounded person with multiple interests, perspectives, etc
• Most colleges have supplemental essays….one of which asks why this major. If your main essay is about your major….what will you write for the supplemental essay? It will appear repetitive and further promote you as a one-dimensional person. 

6) Not understanding the true point of the essay.
a) I can touch my nose with my tongue: What makes you unique and not like every other student who is applying?
b) When I was five, I was abducted by Aliens: What life experiences imply that you will fit in academically and socially? 

7) Not reading the school’s website. 
a) I want to go to (Name of School Here): “I want to go to NYU because it is in New York City and I want that city experience.” There are more than TWENTY colleges in New York City….so why specifically NYU? What does NYU offer that all the other institutions don’t offer?
b) Professor Smith’s maiden name was Quackenbush: Read through the school’s website and discover that 80% of the faculty are Nobel Prize Winners, that there are 250 clubs and the school provides internships in Papua New Guinea. But don’t write this. Be specific as to what internships and why….and what clubs and why…BE SPECIFIC 
*Don’t cut and paste. Don’t plagiarize. Don’t regurgitate the website’s stats. Merely show the admissions officer that you KNOW the school and what makes the school UNIQUE.
Don’t use the website information to sound like you are working in their advertising department. Here is an example of that….as well as too many clichés to count. (That itself is a cliché) 
Penn Nursing’s motto, “Care to Change the World,” speaks to who I am. I want to be that nurse practitioner who impacts families, who betters society, and who makes a difference. I want to be that PNP who smiles, who makes children feel comfortable, and who heals.
And Penn’s School of Nursing will help me achieve that goal. Where else can you gain clinical exposure in the sophomore year with access to world-class hospitals, such as The Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania? Where else do you have the opportunity to engage in real-world research, like at LIFE, and improve quality of elder care?
But practical experience is just one side of the double helix of education. The rigor of Penn’s academic curriculum also calls my name. The emphasis on leadership appeals to me. 
BE SPECIFIC Why do you want to go to our school? What are the SPECIFIC things the school says about….Academics, Internships, Clubs, Organizations and Traditions that appeals to you? And SPECIFICALLY WHY? 
DON’T KISS THEIR $#$@%. Why do you want to go to our school? Telling them it’s a prestigious university with distinguished professors, unparalleled resources and a spectacular campus tells them nothing that they don’t already know…and you sound like a Kiss Up!

8) Forgetting that you are unique. 
You didn’t have to be abducted by aliens, or work with terminally ill dolphins. It’s about you as a teenager. Not a student, an athlete, a volunteer. Just as a citizen, a sibling, a son, a social animal, a human being Clarifying Points
Although these are overused and clichéd topics…(The SEVEN DEADLY SINS)….
i) Vacation: Club Med / Costa Rica/ Cruise ii) Sports Injuries iii) Death iv) Disease v) Divorce vi) Disorders vii) Relationship break-ups

9) THEY ARE FINE IF your perspective is UNIQUE!!!!!!!!!
• It’s Okay to Fail • How I discovered my love of science when all I really wanted to do was impress a girl in class.
IT’S NOT THE ACTIVITY…IT’S YOU IN THE ACTIVITY. It’s not about being a member of the swim team because you swim. It’s about the relationships you developed, the life lessons you’ve learned…without the “hard work” and “driven to win” stuff. This applies to everything you write about. It’s about YOU in the topic…not about the topic. 

10) DON’T BE NEGATIVE: 
Word Choice is extremely important. The following “sound-bytes” come from a first draft. The girl is writing about being a Muslim in a Post- 9/11 world. Notice the language. • “Faced the same abuse…” • “Soiled Muslim image…” • “Erase the grime…” • “When others realized that I was human…I acknowledged it as well.” • “Forced to go through the motions of being a Muslim…” • “Face the realities of the world…” • “A religion with a tarnished image…” • “Ease the burden of future generations…” Same essay….nothing in the content was lost. Notice the word choice now. • “A sense of self-respect and pride…” • “Love and kindness...family…Muslim community…” • “Perceptions can be changed with honesty, patience and education…” • “Misguided information…” • “Erase the stigma…” • “Defuse myths and assumptions with a smile and understanding demeanor…” • “Supportive friends from all backgrounds who believe…in tolerance.” • “I aspire to further promote the positive reality…and acceptance…”

3ccvyb,2,2015-07-06,Me [18F] with my best friend [19M] 1yr; lashed out at me and cut me out of his life,oregonian643,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ccvyb/me_18f_with_my_best_friend_19m_1yr_lashed_out_at/,"Throwaway because he's been fairly hostile. Also, sorry, long post.

I've been best friends with Sam (fake name) since August, we were freshmen at the same college and from day one we were super close, even having some romantic involvement off and on but it never got too serious. Most of the time our friendship was platonic.

Second semester of this past year, things started to get a little tough for him, but I always was his rock and stayed by his side. He lost his job, as did his mom; he had to sell his car, TV, etc.; he had a hard time keeping up with tuition. I was a shoulder for him to cry on, there whenever he needed, always took him out with my girlfriends and I on the weekends to take his mind off things. At the end of the year, things seemed especially rough, but I was always there when he needed me (if not in person, then always over text, as we were both busy). He seemed to end the year on a good note, saying he got approved for some more loans so he could stay at our university.

Fast forward 1mo; I'm home for a bit, he tells me he can't stay at our university. I was devastated, and so was he. When I get back to my university for the summer (I'm here for an internship), we hang out, he's noticeably depressed about everything and despite it being hard to relate to him, I do my best to be his rock.

A couple weeks into being here, I find out that I girl I grew up with back home committed suicide. Needless to say, I was devastated and in a state of shock for several days. I detached, became a bit of a hermit, etc.

However, even as the pain from that event subsided, the summer was still taking a toll on me. I was stressed about not making money, felt very lonely without my girlfriends, and missed home. I work a lot and have time for little else. 

With Sam, we hung out once right after the girl's suicide and I was noticeably upset, so I wasn't very social and didn't feel like doing much; since that hangout, he invited me to a few parties, but they were all over an hour away and most times I had work the next day. He said he understood. I invited him to see a movie, but he cancelled at the last minute because he couldn't afford it. I was upset but I understood as well. The other day, in an effort to see him when another friend was in town, I said he could meet us at a festival we were going to; however, he got in a car accident on the way there. Shocked, I asked if he was okay, and he said he was fine, he would meet us after filing a report. I recommended that we just hang out at my apartment instead. He got seriously offended by that, cursed me out, drove home, and drank by himself.

I was hurt and confused, but I apologized and figured I'd let him reach out to me next. The next day, I tried to send him a Snapchat and it didn't go through. Confused, I checked Facebook - couldn't find his profile. I asked my boyfriend to see if he could find his profile, and sure enough, it was there. He'd blocked me everywhere as well as all of my close friends. 

I texted him, asking him why. He lashed out, saying he wanted nothing to do with me or any of my friends anymore, saying how I had gotten so boring to hang out with and it was pointless when we did, how I cost him so much money (which I didn't intentionally, and he never asked for gas money from me), and how I bailed on him ""all the fucking time"". Apparently, me suggesting we hang out at my apartment (""bailing on our plans"", in his eyes) was the last straw and he wanted nothing to do with me. He was depressed and felt his life was going down the drain, drinking a lot, and felt like I didn't care. He told me to never talk to me again.

I tried to reason with him, and--here's the kicker--he said I was a shitty person for ""costing him gas money"" the night I found out about the girl who killed herself and I wanted to go home, and he willingly offered to drive me home (I didn't ask him to). Along with a string of insults and expletives, that was our last contact.

I'm trying to make sense of this situation. I don't know how to proceed. He's clearly depressed and hostile, but I don't know if I'm honestly at fault and/or what to do. I think he needs help, but I don't know if it's my place anymore. Generally, I'm just confused, and I would love an outside opinion.
   
**tl;dr**: Best friend having a rough time, thinks my slight flakiness and being a bit more antisocial than normal is grounds to terminate our friendship. Hostile, cuts me out of his life, but I think he needs help for depression/drinking."

But some incredibly important things are learned when it s NOT those pesky parents nagging and doing the repetitive teaching. As we sat down and started looking through all those emails together Elle looked at me with eyes as big as saucers and said, I can t believe how nice people are. This family and the next are some of those people. And from there we got to work on all the other details. Sooo ya and i also like talking to marta the main girl that directs me on what to do italian. On Tuesday Dave and Max left for Nationals. There were some very compelling options where she would learn so much and the time frame worked for us, but for some reason, ever since I got the very first email from the family moving to England who had offered to have Elle live with them, that idea planted pretty. We missed our friends in California where we have gone for many years. 2 favorite part of work is lunch with all the co workers. She lucked out on the red eye flight. Oh and one pretty sweet one in San Francisco too that was hard to turn down. She had Skype interviews with both companies and although both were pretty great options, she decided to go with the architecture firm. Uuhhhhm how about we wait till i can look back on the experience. This is the picture she sent with the comment I m good as she took off: We bought her a train ticket from Heathrow to Paddington Station before she left, and she found it and met up with this awesome family who she stayed with her first four days. Since then she has worked hard, learned all kinds of things about architecture, fallen in love with the London public transit system, fallen in love with her family there and new sisters has learned so much from her co workers from all over the world, and has fallen so in. The girls and I packed up the car and headed to Park City the next day. With our hearts racing with nervousness through the games, and our hearts also soaking every last minute of this fun sport and this even more fun boy we adore so much. Poor Max never had a choice on all this, but we had the perfect situation for him in China and this is a process that we re realizing will be refined each time we send a child out. Both would not be paid internships because of the strict visa rules in England, but the value of the experiences she would gain at either place would be worth it s weight in gold. My brother Eli and his wife Julie are actually the ones who sent her off and took such great care of her from NYC since we had to leave a day early to get Grace back to summer school. So that is good and at around 5 on friday we all went out for ice cream which was fun. The dad of the family she is staying with is an amazing photographer and has taught her so much about photography. We will be forever in your debt and we can t wait to meet you some day. I have a list of all the phrases ive heard on my phone. I learned a LOT about how a real job in an office works. I knew something else would work out and the host family offer was still there. We missed our friends in South Carolina who we met up with last year. Love and gratitude to you dear families who have made this experience so amazing for her. Right at that time we got another email from a blog reader right there near London who had a connection with a lady who works in fashion for Elle to interview with, and then a great friend who lives in London who we had been in contact with about all. 5 yes im going to paris and i have pretty much just about nailed every single thing on my bucket list which rocks plus extra. The family who offered to have her stay with them there had a pretty awesome internship rigged up for her in the Dad s company and we were all the family she was going to stay with and us in the desert pretty sad when we found out it wasn t going. And here are a few random pictures that I ll have to have her comment on some day to tell the whole story: My sister happened to be in England this summer for a little bit so it was so fun for her to meet up with them in one of. Elle is in London and my girls are up at the lake with my parents. And it made me wish I had fifty children to go out and soak up so many awaiting adventures. And a lot about the city and london culture 14 ive picked up on like 2 british phrases but me and the girls are really really workinf to say lift pushchair lovely and other things more. But the funny part is that even after that little let down, London still felt exactly right. Kids soak in more than we realize, as evidenced by some of the impatient or not so nice things my kids say that I realize mimic exactly what I have oot. I do still want to go see the tate modern but i dont think my fam really wants to so i might just go quick after work once. And they are people I ve never even met. Here s an excerpt from one of her emails she sent she was answering a bunch of my questions that were ese are the ones that weren t just housekeeping stuff. It made me want to be like them and reach out with my heart more. That s why every time I think of Elle on her summer internship I get the biggest feeling of happiness and gratitude. They are good friends with our friends who live there and have two of the cutest ever teenage daughters who took such great care of Elle. We go get food at a take out place then either eat on the terrace, the dungeon kitchen area or we will go to the park and eat if its a nice day. Yesterday wasn t a very traditional fourth of July for us. I love the, Teach your children everything you know. 3 least fav part of work is the awkward time i have at the end of the day when i just want to leave but i still have stuff to do that i dont want to do ahhahah 4 i think i would love wimbledon but i will be gone. Luckily she has her photography to help her earn the money she needs. When I mentioned here on the blog that Dave and I were ready to embark on figuring out an international internship for Elle this summer an idea inspired by Dave s brother who did just that with his kids the summer after each of their junior years, and Max took the. Elle and I wrote a big list of the most viable options that extended from places like Ireland to Sri Lanka and everywhere in between. "
3cdh16,0,2015-07-06,CMV: The reason college graduate have trouble finding jobs is because they do not do enough in college,a1j9o94,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3cdh16/cmv_the_reason_college_graduate_have_trouble/,"I think that the primary reason college students have trouble finding jobs after college is that they do not do enough during college to make themselves viable candidates.I would like this view changed because it seems to be in conflict with other views I hold. In most cases I believe that when people fall on hard times, it's not because they are not trying but rather that they genuinely are not able to fix the issue.

Based on my own experience, I am about to start my third year in college, when people have difficulty finding work after college, is because they did not do enough while they where in school. They didn't participate in extra curricular activities, they didn't work part time, they didn't seek leadership positions or internships, and they didn't keep their GPA high enough.

Since I know that not everyone can afford not to work, I would consider students preparing themselves if they work part time or seek to be meaningfully involved in extra curricular activities.

For some context about me personally, I am a rising junior at a large state school. I am paying for school myself through a combination of scholarships and part time work. My mom worked as a lunch lady when I was younger and my dad is enlisted in the military so they do not have connections that have helped me in my career so far.(That is not to say they haven't helped, just not from that perspective) I have held leadership positions in multiple on campus organizations and my GPA is 3.67. I had a relevant internship after my freshman year, and I am doing a relevant internship this summer. Based on my work experience so far, I have already had job offers for after I graduate. I'm trying to do everything I can to make sure I get the most out of my time in college.

I just feel like most college students aren't really trying to make themselves viable candidates.

In order to change my view, you would need to demonstrate one of two things. 1. it is not feasible for the average student to spend time outside of their studies and maintain a good GPA. 2. Even heavily involved students with good GPAs are having difficulty finding work.

We broke up today over a long text conversation, which I hate but sometimes that just how it goes. 

Quick backstory: we have known each other since the beginning of college and had a few non-sexual but very tender encounters during our time there. About 10 months ago she got an internship at a nearby city and visiting each other was one of the things we had always spoken about but never acted on. I took the leap and stayed with her in her apartment there. Aside from the first night, what ensued was a passionate rekindling of our seven year old relationship. We were in love and it happened fast. We were both open to the idea of a long distance (and long term) relationship, and so we decided to make it official in our minds. We would survive by visiting each other as often as possible, and by staying in touch daily, whether it be by text, phone, skype, whatever.

I am currently employed on a 2 year rotational development program, meaning that I work for 6 months at a site and then move to another site, usually some significant distance away. In this case my latest move worked to my advantage and we ended up just 1.5 hours apart. Great. We saw each other bi-weekly, we kept in very frequent contact while apart, and generally things were very good. 

The ""first event"" as I call it happened when I was on a workshop abroad for a week. The place we were sent was a very rural, out of the way farmstead that had absolutely no cell coverage (and yes I did have a cell plan that was setup to work abroad). By sheer luck she got sick a couple of days after I left and had a few bouts of faintness - it was quite serious. Over two days I tried multiple times to call her, but every time we got connected the call would drop after a couple of minutes. I resorted to text to keep in touch with her. During this entire period I perhaps went 48 hours without being able to send her a message because the connection was so intermittent. Everyone else was in the same boat so it wasn’t like I could have just used someone else’s phone. This was a huge issue when it got back. I was guilt tripped for not caring, I was hung up on, I was on the receiving end of passive aggressiveness – it was an event, one that took several days of prostration to mend.

We were good again, though there was the odd occasion where due to work I was very busy and would sometimes prefer to text on a given day because I was at it so late. Keep in mind she had her own schedule too – it’s not like she was languishing at home waiting for my call every day. These “missed” days would sometimes pass unnoticed, on others causing other bouts of passive aggression. 

The second event was this weekend just past. I attended an Independence Day celebration with some friends in the downtown area, leaving my house after having called her in the morning. She was due to fly home from a weekend getaway that we had previously been on, but decided to extend her stay past what I was able to for work reasons. After her flight she neglected to inform me of her having landed, so I texted her to make sure she was OK. This wasn’t good enough for her. Never mind that I was in the middle of a crowded park minutes away from a firework display.  I ended my text message with “I wish you were here,” to which she replied, “I don’t, you’re probably drunk.” Let me be clear that drinking has NOT been an issue for me, though she has always been highly critical of people who are moderate, occasional drinkers of my. I was going to call her the next day when my parents called, so I told her I would call her afterwards. It lasted a little longer, and I could have perhaps notified her of the delay. She gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the day, opening up to the final conversation that broke us up.

Ultimately what went wrong in this relationship was that we had different opinions of what constituted caring for the other person. Despite calling her 90% of the time, and texting her nearly 100% of the time, it wasn’t good enough. I didn’t care enough (her words). I acquiesced to her needs as much as I could, but there was always the risk of there being a time where I didn’t meet her standards, and I guess the latest one broke the straw over the camel’s back.

My question is really in the title here. Was I in the wrong? 

Obviously you have limited perspective here, and would probably want her side for completeness, but unfortunately I can’t offer that. If nothing else, writing this was an opportunity to organize my thoughts, and has shown me what I can and cannot accept in future relationships. 

Thank you for reading, and apologies for the lack of tl:dr - I couldn't write one in this instance.

3cdogo,317,2015-07-06,Graduated in 2010 with 200k Student Loan Debt - My Journey Thus Far,DonaldBubbletrousers,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3cdogo/graduated_in_2010_with_200k_student_loan_debt_my/,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

I graduated in the Spring of 2010 with just south of **200K** in Student Loan Debt (198.6K to be precise) Many of us here are battling Student Loans and i decided that my story may be helpful to some (if anything, it can give you the *at least im not that guy* feels)

**How I Cultivated So Much Debt:** I had the brilliant idea at the end of high school to follow my dreams of being an Architect and to study somewhere that was interesting and far away to impress my friends and family back home. I chose an out-of-state private school, which over the 5 years i spent earning my degree, the tuition + room and board averaged 56K per year. I worked my ass off my freshman year and earned a half tuition scholarship for the remaining four years. Considering that the scholarship i was awarded added up to 96K i thought i was in good shape. I thought wrong and left college with 198.6K in Student Loan Debt.

**The Real World Got Real:**  I was staring down the barrel of $1458 a month towards Student Loans. I looked into all the possibilities: consolidation, IBR, ect. ect. This is when i found out that many of the options for easing your payments only apply to Federally owned Loans. (80% of mine were private) My best option was to make Interest Only Payments, which lowered my payments by roughly $600 a month for 2 years. 2010 was a dark time to graduate. I spent 4 months looking for a job. The best opportunity i was offered was a 6 month unpaid internship in NYC *which may or may not* become a full-time paid position. I came to the realization that even if i could find an architecture job,i would have a heck of a time keeping up with the impending student loan bills. I knew i had to get creative and get to work fast, my 6 month grace period was almost up. Sallie-Mae was on her way to my front door. 

 **What Did I Do** I was getting a little desperate, I had no safety net, the recession was crushing my parents and they couldn't help. When in high school i gave swim lessons and ran small soccer camps and I decided to go with what i learned from that. I started a business teaching kids how to play soccer. What does that have to do with my dream of becoming an architect? *Nothing*. My first year i made only 12K, it sucked. The next year 22K, the next 34K. By mid 2013 I had grown it enough to be approached by an interested buyer. I sold it for 108K in 2013, paid out over 5 years. I then moved to a different state and started another business doing the exact same thing. (side note: this was the most miserable and stressful thing that i have ever done in my life) While starting the new business, I picked up a job working for a steel fabrication company as a project manager. What does this have to do with my dream of becoming an architect? *Almost nothing but at least its in the same industry*. I work off commission at that job and i have steadily increased my earnings. In 2013 I made 45K total. 2014 I made 63K. This year the ball has started to roll and i am projected to make 130K!

**Whats Next:** I still owe 141K and I am currently paying the $1458 a month towards my loans. I also take 20% of my earnings before taxes and put it towards my loans as well. (This year through June, I have paid off 18K) I am paying my loans off in order of interest, snowballing if you will, and have eliminated all loans above 7.5% (thank you 2008 for the ridiculously high rates) At this pace, i will be able to pay the rest off by the end of 2020.

**My Advice:** From the get go I decided to focus on the bright side of  my crushing debt. **It kept me HUNGRY** I have learned to be decisive, to take calculated risks, to believe in myself and to solidify positive habits. Without the loans, i doubt i would be as successful.
 **Look at your loans as a challenge and rise to meet it!**"
3cdsbt,1,2015-07-06,Relapsed after 17 days- Pretty much the first time in 2 weeks I've been left alone for an extended time and I'm deeply ashamed.,PopeBenedictThe16th,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3cdsbt/relapsed_after_17_days_pretty_much_the_first_time/,"I'm really really ashamed of myself and I feel as though I've completely let down my girlfriend and myself. Don't feel obliged to read this whole post, but if you have advice or words of support please offer it.

The following is context and really not that interesting, but it's stuff I meant to post about at the time of occurrence. 
No one need feel obliged to read it, I just needed to get around to posting it.
 
Two weeks ago, I returned back to my girlfriend's place in Brisbane, where I live from a 3 week long holiday in the Blue Mountains, where I moved from about a year ago and  my family and pretty much all of my friends live. Early on in my visit I relapsed and was mostly unable to maintain a streak of more than 2 or 3 days, and I binged often throughout the holiday.
3 days before I was due to return home to Brisbane I got my act together and stayed clean, and continued to do so once I was back in Brisbane until today.

Prior to my relapse early on in my 3 week holiday I had maintained a 47 day streak, which I had boasted since I first begun nofap.

The primary reason I began NoFap was simple- My addiction was hurting my girlfriend and damaging to my sex drive and our sex life.
I would crave PMO even on days where my girlfriend and I had had intercourse multiple times and sometimes I would still watch porn even though sex was on the way later. 

My actions (When my girlfriend became aware of them) were damaging to her self esteem, our intimacy in our relationship, and my constant lies made it very difficult for her to trust me.

My secondary motivation for abstinence is that I believe it may help alleviate my anxiety (Particularly in social scenarios), and maybe improve my mood and self perception in general, although I'm not altogether convinced of this because during my holiday I binged on PMO a lot and was still very outgoing and quite happy in and of myself.

I apologize for the huge text dump, but this is all stuff I meant to get around to posting as it happened etc.

Now that I have relapsed, I feel really really awful about what I've done. I was proud of where I was in my &gt;2 week streak and it felt really good knowing that I was neither hiding anything from my girlfriend nor doing anything that would hurt her.
What makes me most ashamed is the fact that this is pretty much the first time I've been left home alone since I got back, as today she started her internship, and has been gone for hours, but prior to that she's been on break from uni.
I know that telling her that I relapsed will be really hurtful and upsetting to her, but trying to hide the truth will be even worse, and damaging to her trust, especially when the truth comes out (And it will).

This is the first time I've been home alone for more than an hour in weeks and this relapse is going to make my girlfriend feel really apprehensive about leaving me alone.
I don't really have much more to say, if anyone has words of support (Even if it doesn't feel like you're saying anything new) or advice (Even if it's buck up and be honest with your girlfriend) I'd love to hear it, I'm feeling pretty down and ashamed of myself for what I've done right now."

This is my reusable throwaway...I have asked a lot of questions with this account. I am sorry if you people are getting tired of answering them..his one is different though. 




I feel like I am too far along in life to get a degree. I feel like I cannot pack my shit and move somewhere where there are jobs. I feel overwhelmed by life. Any help is greatly appreciated and I will take it to heart. 




**My stats:**

* 23 years old, male, single --- No strings attached

* Have Associates Degree of Applied Science - Business Technology

* Have worked at my helpdesk/sysadmin job for 6 years. Am an assistant/no room for growth/broke as hell - pay is not respectable

* Live in an extremely rural area with hardly any jobs and none related to my field  





**Problems:**

* I am broke.

* I want to relocate to a larger area (for many reasons)

* I am unhappy with my life. I want to further my education. 

* I didn't take my high school or technical college experience seriously. I was side tracked by life...and women.

* I have never been out of my little bubble (I drove from home to my technical college every day) so I am really looking to do something out on my own for the first time. I want to experience life...

* I want a Computer Science degree. I like programming, server farms, data centers, and embedded electronics (arduino, FPGA, Software Defined Radio, etc..) but have *no* education at all with them. I figure a CS degree will hit all of these areas just enough to let me find my thing. 

* I am not that good at math. I would **love** to get a proper education in mathematics now that I am older and actually give a shit. I really enjoy the little bit of math that I have learned through my limited programming experience. 




**Questions:**



1. Can a 23 year old that wants to move to a new state (texas) get any kind of financial assistance?

2. Are college loans the devil? I will get a job if my studies allow. 

3. I am considering (assuming I do follow through with all of this) trying an internship at Texas Instruments or some other large company. Is this possible? Is this crazy?

4. Can I make my car payment with student loans if I choose to do so? (yes, I plan on having a job...but I am making sure that I can afford to get started)
 
5. Can anyone recommend a CS degree program in the DFW area?




Thank you. I feel lost and like I have missed my opportunity in life. "
3ce0s8,1785,2015-07-07,"Dear Amazon interns, some advice from an old man who has been at Amazon way too long.",amzn_vet_throwaway,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/3ce0s8/dear_amazon_interns_some_advice_from_an_old_man/,"Hello visiting Amazon Interns! 

I hope you are enjoying your summer here in Seattle!

I'm sure by now most of you are settled into your gigs at Amazon and working on some project the team you got stuck onto has put off for months and thought, ""Fuck it, just give it to the intern when they show up in June.""

Since I have been at Amazon I've seen hundreds of you guys come through, you're all smart as hell and you work yourselves to the bone over the summer for a chance to impress your mentor and get a job offer. 

You are smart, driven, and are no doubt going to be successful in whatever you do, which is why I want to urge you to STAY THE FUCK AWAY from Amazon when it comes time for you to leave school and jump into the workforce.

There are a number of things that Amazon doesn't tell you when you sign up.

You know that big pile of stock that they promise you in your offer letter? You are going to vest around 20% of that in your first two years there.

Now, the average employee stays at Amazon for LESS than two years, so when you do the math to compare offers from various companies go ahead and factor that in. The entire system is designed to bring you in, burn you out, and send you on your way with as little equity lost as possible.

That signing bonus they offer you to offset the fact that they give you jack shit for stock your first two years? If you leave before two years is up you actually end up OWING Amazon money. You have to pay it back on a pro-rated scale. It's not a bonus, it's more like a payday loan.

Two years is also the amount of time you have to get promoted from Software Development Engineer 1 to Software Development Engineer 2 before they put you on a PIP and kick your ass out the door. If you are an SDE-1 at Amazon your job is in every way temporary, you are basically participating in a two year job interview for an SDE-2 role.

In other words, up to 80% of the initial stock grant presented to you in your offer letter is contingent upon you being promoted to SDE-2. There are a limited number of promotions each review cycle and chances are very good you won't receive one of them.

Amazon's work life balance is awful, and it's even more awful for fresh college students who don't have obligations outside of the office to excuse them from working all night. You'll be stack ranked against your peers, so if the rest of your team is going to stay until 8PM working on some project we need to finish before Q4 then you better do the same, otherwise it's going to be PIP city for you come review time.

The most fucked thing about bright young engineers such as yourselves going to work for Amazon is that you have your choice of ANY technology company out there. If you are smart enough to get through an Amazon interview loop then you're smart enough to get through a Google/Facebook/Apple/etc. loop without any problems. So why throw yourself into an environment that is designed to chew you up and spit you out?

I'm sure you will kick ass on your projects this year. Work hard but don't spend all night working. Leave at 5 or 6PM and go enjoy the city while you are here. While you are in the office pay close attention to the happiness and job satisfaction of your team mates.

Read up on the stories people have posted about life at Amazon, they are completely accurate. Here are a few:

http://gawker.com/inside-amazons-bizarre-corporate-culture-1570412337

Check out the reviews on Glassdoor:
http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Amazon-com-Reviews-E6036.htm

You are smart, hard working, driven, and the type of employee Amazon loves to take advantage of.

Don't let them take advantage of you.

EDIT: Wow, this post got more attention than I thought it would.

[koonawood](https://www.reddit.com/user/koonawood) has posted some great messages on this thread covering many of the things I brought up and more in a very well thought way, you should read them. :)

EDIT #2:

For folks asking for me to reveal my identity to prove I am really an Amazon employee: Sorry, that's not going to happen, I have a mortgage to pay. If you think I'm lying please disregard everything in the above post and read the comments section instead. Plenty of posts agree with what I posted.

For folks accusing me of being a recruiter for Google/Facebook/Apple since I listed them as examples of companies that people could get jobs at if they are skilled enough to pass a loop at Amazon: Fuck it, don't work for any of those companies, go work for a technology company who works in an area that interests you, the entire concept of a ""BIG 4"" that you absolutely need to kick your career off at allows these larger companies with lots of brand recognition to exploit you just like Amazon does."

Which, i immediately believe is condescending, and i've told her a version of that before. 

The only time I really do anything right is when im in school, but even throughout my college years she had constantly been saying negative things about me being a failure or just, other things like things. This cause me a lot of stressed, to which i started getting sick and missing a lot of classes and ended up having to drop a lot of them. This has been going on for like, three years now and I had to take a break from school because I just couldn't take it anymore and was doing so poorly I ended up on academic probation. She yelled at me a lot and was ""disappointed"" and immediately said I need to get a ""real job"" if im not going to school. I get it, I do, but i already had a job that i was getting a lot of hours ago, so it wasn't like i was sitting around. Then I got an internship in a field I had been considering and ended up loving it, and all she did was criticize me through it. ""Cool you got this but wow it's so far away and like why aren't they paying you, you need to do something that pays real money instead of doing something that could actually help you get your foot in the door.""

Any of my life decisions she doesn't agree with. She ""doesn't dislike"" my SO, because he graduated a year ago and just got a job a month ago, complaining about how he isn't ""the one"" for me and how he must be doing nothing because he couldn't get a job. However she's been looking for a new job for months and all she does is complain about how there's ""no work anywhere"". She's also heavily Christian and we constantly argue because all she does is how talk about how i need to ""Find God in my life"" or minimize everything I do by saying, ""One day you'll understand."" and how I need to have more peaceful spirituality in my life. I do, but clearly not the kind my mom likes. 

Anyways, i feel like i'm divulging from my point. Like any kid, I love my mom, but sometimes I feel it's because I have to. Growing up, my parents pretty much taught me through their actions that family isn't important, so I don't really feel like it is. I'm not close to any of my family, and If i never spoke to any of them (many of which I already don't) it probably wouldn't affect me terribly. But going into this, all my mom DOES is talk about how IMPORTANT family is and how all we have is our family, but has completely shown me the opposite of this. 

This is mildly important? Anyways the main point of this that kind of was the catalyst to finally ask what to do is that one of my Great aunt's is here visiting and stayed with us for the last couple of days. My mom's family comes from central america, so they only really speak Spanish and I never learned. So tonight was the last night my great aunt Marie (Fake name, probably 70ish F) was staying with her. Her younger sister who lives in the same state we do a couple towns away, Lucia (also fake name, maybe late 60's F), was driving over to our house to come get her. 

Now my mom and Lucia have had issues for as long as I can remember. Lucia treated my mom really poorly when they still lived back at home, and my mom has resented her ever since then. Five or so years ago, she told Lucia that she'd ""never speak to her again"". Que today. Lucia is driving to our house, and gets lost since its dark and our place is kind of hard to find. She calls Marie, telling her that she's lost and Marie turns to my mom for directions. Instead of actually taking the phone from my great aunt, she's just telling her directions and Marie doesn't really know where anything is so just rambling off directions. I was upstairs when this started, so when I came downstairs my mom starts mouthing for me to take the phone and give her directions. I don't know how long this had been going on, but my mom EASILY could have just taken the phone and given directions. I understand they have beef, but giving directions takes like four seconds and she could have handed the phone back afterwards. 

At this point I just get irritated because i'm sick of being put in the middle of my mom's issues when it comes to family stuff. Growing up she used my brother and I to pass messages along to my dad, and vice versa, and I'm just over it. She's an adult and I feel like she can answer the phone. 

I realize now, looking back on it since it happened like forty five minutes ago that I should have just taken the phone and given directions, and I will probably call Lucia in the next week to apologize and tell her I just refuse to get involved in their angry business or something. But anyways, my mom could have dealt with this in like a minute. So my mom and i are just whispering back and forth to just take the stupid phone and Marie is just trying to give directions. Lucia finally shows up, and we help Marie take her things to Lucia's car. My mom hides behind the trunk and is just handing things to me, to hand to Marie, and I go to talk to Lucia and be like, ""shit, sorry about all this. I'm sorry you got lost, etc etc"". She looks just, tired and flustered and I don't blame her. They leave, my mom and I go back inside and I tell her I can't believe she just didn't take the phone and give her directions. She tells me that I should have done it, she didn't want to do it, etc and starts laughing about it and goes upstairs. 

Now I mentioned that family is important to her earlier because I have an older brother who I'm not close to anymore. Long story short, he did a lot of drugs and drank pretty much every day, was never home, partied whenever he could and treated my mom and I like absolute shit. So I've absolutely hated my brother for the last couple years and refused to have a relationship (he was also my mom's favorite and it was so apparent, I barely existed to my family during high school, etc). He's doing better, because he moved to my mom's home country and is just fine. So I don't hate him anymore because he's not in my life and I'm happy he's happy, but overall i still don't really care what happens. But because he's doing fine, my mom is constantly pressuring me to patch things up with him and get to better terms, because we're FAMILY and he's my brother and all we have left in the whole world is family. So obviously when this starts happening with my great aunt's, i just kind of lose it a little. I'm beyond frustrated and I don't know what to do. 

Anyways I'm sorry I rambled so much! But did I over react? I know I want to apologize to my great Aunt about what happened, but if I do my mom is just going to yell at me and we already butt heads and don't get along. I pay cheap rent to live here and she constantly used to threaten to kick us out when we did something she didn't like, and I can't really afford to rock the boat super hard. 


**tl;dr**: My mom acts like a kid with a grudge over family stuff and basically refuses to talk on the phone to give directions for like a solid minute and tries to put me in the middle of her problems. Am I over-reacting?"

I have several study guides for exam P and have completed about ¼ of the material for study in each.  I am loving every minute of my study time and find that I’m learning quickly.  I have a BA in Biology, a BS in Nursing and a MS in Nursing.  I have 12 years full-time nurse practitioner experience.  I will never go back to nursing.  For the past 3 years I have been a stay at home mom/part-time math tutor.  I feel like I have the time, resources, aptitude and passion to invest in the studying required to pass the tests.  What I don’t have is a math degree or an internship under my belt.  With 3 degrees, I don’t really want to go back for another unless I have to.
My question is what else should I be doing besides studying for/passing exam P, then moving on to exam FM?  I would like to simultaneously (soon) be working on learning VBA and possibly SQL.  Do you have any other recommendations for what I should be doing now to prepare myself for looking for that first job?  How would I go about getting an internship?

3ceook,2,2015-07-07,"Math Master, Data Science, Musicianship",phugo,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/3ceook/math_master_data_science_musicianship/,"Hi all!
I almost earned a Master's Degree in Mathematics following such a path called ""mathematical physics"" in which I have done some statistics, data analysis, algorithms and probability along with the mathematical physics courses.

I discovered - maybe too late - what I want to do is not the pure mathematician and I want a ""real world"" job which involves more statistics, probabilty, coding than mathematics. 

Data Science seems to fit what I want to be my day job even though I tasted a very little of this and in ways designed on what I studied and probably without liniks to the real world problems (namely homeworks). So I'm not sure about some things:

* Are there similar carrers I've not considered fitting my needs?  

* Is my pure maths background enough to start a job (internships and similar as well) or I have to go for a Ph.D.?

* (that's the weird one) Is the Data Analyst/Scientist a good job to put alongside the musician's life? 
Since nowadays I'm studying both at University and the Conservatory, I think I will be able to do this, but I'd like to know if there's someone living this ""double life"" even during the job years.

Sorry for my poor English!"

For the past year I've been actively interested in web-development and coding in general - I completed a 3-month RoR course (we studied basics of Ruby, Rails, Javascript, JQuery, MySQL, HTML + CSS)  and I have some small personal projects I have been working on, but I find it very hard to work consistently and confidently by myself. It just doesn't feel right to put half-completed projects in my portfolio, so I often hesitate when asked to provide code samples.

I came to Berlin because I hoped I would find a dev-team willing to take me on even as an intern and maybe help me grow as a developer, but it seems like even for an internship one must have 3 years experience in the field!

3cet5m,1,2015-07-07,[Blog] - SEA Smurf at Gold,NeverEndingHope,EmperoroftheSands,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmperoroftheSands/comments/3cet5m/blog_sea_smurf_at_gold/,"I just reached SEA's Gold Division on my smurf on Garena's servers. Overall, I'd say the skills of the players here are higher than those on NA's servers, but I'll see if that extends to above Gold on my way to Plat. 

I've been taking Azir to Mid at every opportunity I get. Here's what I've done with most games:

21/0/9 - Basic stuff for AP Mages. While going 9/0/21 can compensate for mana and allow Azir more freedom to poke in-lane, the damage lost from the Offensive masteries is pretty noticeable. Though some players like to take the mana Utility Masteries for Azir, the Movespeed is pretty invaluable for dodging skillshots during the laning phase (especially now with AP Ezreal running around). Also, taking the Potion Masteries instead of the Buff Masteries is better due to his weaker laning phase, and with full build, he isn't as reliant on Blue Buff for maxing CDR.

Runes are still Mpen Reds, HP/Level Yellows, CDR/Level Blues, and AP Quints. Azir loses some trade potential by being forced to taking CDR/Level Blues instead of MR or AP, but he isn't meant to be a very strong laner to begin with. Azir strives for late-game, and that's what this set does best for him.

Start Doran's and 2 Pots is typically best on him, as no other set up gives him as strong as a start.

Rushing Forbidden Idol before Fiendish Codex gives Azir more room to cast spells and to poke. If I get Blue Buff, I'll grab a Codex instead though. Both of them grant 10%, so typically the difference isn't too noticeable. I'll also grab Tier 1 boots, and 3 of each Potion when I go back to lane after my first couple backs so I can poke and push freely without worrying too much about mana sources. 

Pushing is Azir's best early weapon, as his opponents will have a harder time keeping up in CS. He can push fast enough to back off when his creeps reach the enemy tower to avoid jungle pressure, and won't lose exp or CS because the tower will kill the wave before the new waves can reach the middle of the lane.

After Morellonomicon, I still like to go for Luden's Echo instead of Rabadon's Deathcap (which will change when the AP Itemization patch hits). The movespeed is much appreciated, as well as the extra damage. That extra damage at 100 charges will outmatch the 30% AP bonus from Rabadon's since Azir won't have as much AP to multiply early-mid game.

Full build is still usually Morellonomicon, Sorceror's Boots, Luden's Echo, Zhonya's Hourglass, Rabadon's Deathcap, and Void Staff. Depending on the enemy team, Luden's Echo or Zhonya's may be replaced with Abyssal Scepter.

When I have the time from my internship, I can get back to League and head to Platinum next."

3cevph,1,2015-07-07,Comunicado del CCM sobre el reglamento de primarias,Jaime_Paulino,PlazaValencia,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlazaValencia/comments/3cevph/comunicado_del_ccm_sobre_el_reglamento_de/,"&amp;nbsp;

La publicació el passat 1 de juliol del [**Reglament de Primàries**](https://sendy.podemos.info/l/CXNOkZ7LJPdGck50JEmGBQ/x1Gl8gBtDPiTPm16eB4bKg/0oSwDIgoXwVrBZDcQoOIQQ) per a confeccionar la candidatura de Podem a les eleccions generals està generant un significatiu debat entre diverses instàncies de l'organització. Els debats han marcat la vida interna de Podem des del seu origen i ofereixen elements valuosíssims per a millorar el nostre funcionament intern, contribuint a la maduració organitzativa i política de Podem.

A l'esdeveniment polític que marca aquest debat s'expressen les dues ànimes de Podem: tant la que constitueix el veloç vehicle electoral que ha de respondre amb
agilitat a les etapes externes d'aquest cicle polític, com la que configura l'espai social de participació i de nova política. Ambdues són necessàries i, com sempre s'ha sostingut, és necessari cercar un equilibri entre elles.

En aquest sentit, el **Consell Ciutadà Municipal de València** manifesta el següent:

1.- Els temps polítics als quals es deu Podem com a partit obliguen a reconèixer les servituds externes a les que estem sotmesos. La possibilitat latent d'un avançament electoral exigeix un exercici de responsabilitat en la configuració de la candidatura que no té un acomodament fàcil amb els temps polítics de reflexió, debat i cerca de
consensos als quals aspirem. La posició irresponsable del partit en el govern, que està especulant deliberadament amb la convocatòria d'eleccions generals, ens fa haver d'estar preparats i preparades amb suficient antelació per a poder afrontar un possible avançament d'aquestes. Així, agost apareix com un mes crucial. 

2.- Ens sembla convenient insistir, no obstant açò, en què es duguen a terme els esforços polítics necessaris per a trobar la màxima compatibilitat entre les necessitats estratègiques i les demandes de millor i major participació: 
 
&gt;-Per açò, considerem particularment important que el reglament done cabuda a la millor representació territorial possible, bé sota un model de circumscripció múltiple (provincial o autonòmic), bé sota un desenvolupament més ampli i definit dels criteris de correcció territorial que suggereix el propi Reglament.

&gt;-Ens sembla igualment necessari proposar una gestió del temps del procés que permeta, dins dels límits de les necessitats logístiques del cicle electoral, la millor qualitat participativa de tots els membres de Podem. 

Podem ha d'estar desbordan-se constantment per a ser útil als propòsits polítics que es va marcar des del seu naixement. Ha d'obrir-se incessantment a la societat i, al mateix temps, ha de fer tots els esforços per mantenir alta la il·lusió i l'ànim dels activistes. És per açò que demanem al **Consell Ciutadà Estatal** que participe del debat i oferisca respostes per a millorar els processos participatius, tant de cara a aquesta com a les pròximes cites electorals.

&amp;nbsp;


**-------------------------------------------------**

&amp;nbsp;

La publicación el pasado 1 de julio del [**Reglamento de Primarias**](https://sendy.podemos.info/l/CXNOkZ7LJPdGck50JEmGBQ/x1Gl8gBtDPiTPm16eB4bKg/0oSwDIgoXwVrBZDcQoOIQQ) para confeccionar la candidatura de Podemos a las elecciones generales está generando un significativo debate entre diversas instancias de la organización. Los debates han marcado la vida interna de Podemos desde su origen y ofrecen elementos valiosísimos para mejorar nuestro funcionamiento interno, contribuyendo a la maduración organizativa y política de Podemos.


En el hito político que marca este debate se expresan las dos almas de Podemos: tanto la que constituye el veloz vehículo electoral que debe responder con la máxima soltura a las etapas externas de este ciclo político, como la que configura el espacio social de participación y de nueva política. Ambas son necesarias y, como siempre se ha sostenido, es necesario buscar un equilibrio entre ellas.

En ese sentido, el **Consejo Ciudadano Municipal de Valencia** manifiesta lo siguiente:

1.- Los tiempos políticos a los que se debe Podemos como partido obligan a reconocer las servidumbres externas a las que estamos sometidos. La posibilidad latente de un adelanto electoral exige un ejercicio de responsabilidad en la configuración de la candidatura que no tiene un acomodo fácil con los tiempos políticos de reflexión, debate y búsqueda de consensos a los que aspiramos. La posición irresponsable del partido en el gobierno, que está especulando deliberadamente con la convocatoria de
elecciones generales, nos hace tener que estar preparados y preparadas con suficiente antelación para poder afrontar un posible adelanto de estas. Así, agosto aparece como un mes crucial.

2.- Nos parece conveniente insistir, sin embargo, en que se lleven a cabo los esfuerzos políticos necesarios para encontrar el mejor encaje entre las necesidades estratégicas y las demandas de mejor y mayor participación: 
 
&gt;-Por ello, consideramos particularmente importante que el reglamento dé cabida a la mejor representación territorial posible, bien bajo un modelo de circunscripción múltiple (provincial o autonómico), bien bajo un desarrollo más amplio y definido de los criterios de corrección territorial que sugiere el propio Reglamento.

&gt;-Nos parece igualmente necesario proponer una gestión de los tiempos del proceso que permita, aun dentro de los límites de las necesidades logísticas del ciclo electoral, la mejor calidad participativa de todos los miembros de Podemos.

Podemos debe estar en constante desbordamiento para ser útil a los propósitos políticos que se marcó desde su nacimiento. Para ello debe abrirse incesantemente a
la sociedad y, al mismo tiempo, debe hacer todos los esfuerzos por mantener alta la ilusión y el ánimo de los activistas. Es por ello que pedimos al **Consejo Ciudadano
Estatal** que participe del debate y ofrezca respuestas para mejorar los procesos participativos, tanto de cara a ésta como a las próximas citas electorales.

I've counted all of my expenses and financial aid which leaves me with $8,400 for food and housing.

The problem is that I don't know how much food or utilities cost in my rural college town (Blacksburg, VA). I assumed it would be $1,800 for nine months of food. The cheapest apartments are far from campus and cost at minimum $400. The leases are 12 months, so if I assume the cost of an apartment is $450, that leaves me with $1,200 for utilities and internet.

I have one guy who wants to move off-campus with me and four who are considering it. My summer internship is unpaid and my parents are in no position to help out. I'm worried that I won't be able to get the security deposit since I have no income right now and I think it'd be crazy for me to get another job (taking summer classes and working full-time).

Do any of my numbers seem wrong?

EDIT: Getting money isn't necessarily the issue any longer. **It's being able to pay for the security deposit and first month's rent by August 1st which is the problem.** I've been contacting home/townhouse owners as well as the apartment agencies and it seems that me being unable to pay the security deposit and rent until August 17th is a major problem."

I recently published my first Android App after about 3 months working on it. I study chemical engineering but I am a self-taught programmer. My intention is to land internships and eventually a full time job as a developer. Accordingly, my personal portfolio will play a huge role in making this happen.

While I think my code formatting is decent, it would be great to get an opinion from the androiddev community. I'd really appreciate it if you took a look at some of my android source files on github and provided some feed back!

Generally these are the guidelines I follow in terms of code formatting:

* Group class variables by association, leaving a single line of white space between groups and commenting each group with a header

* Create a class called constants to store a global instance of all constants used throughout the project

* Group lines of code by association/completion of a single task, leaving single white space between groups

* If a group of code is around 6 lines or greater, create a separate method

* If a block of code is used more than once, create a separate method

* Use singleton design pattern for objects used asynchronously with multiple activities (ie. SharedPreferences and DatabaseHelpers)

* Call a method as an argument to another method if it's result will only be used once. I add a comment specifying the result of the method call if it isn't already clear from the name of the method... Saves on memory used

* Perform all data retrievals on the main UI thread unless I see significant performance issues

All feedback is welcomed!

At this point I was a scrawny, socially awkward asain boy who spent too much of his time playing runescape and watching naruto/bleach.

As an awkward 13 year old who hadn't really had any experience talking to girls and really wouldn't for another year later, that 2 week Alaskan cruise was great. I was getting to know and crushing on her ridiculously hard. I mean really, how could I not? She'd done all sorts of really cool things that I hadn't even thought about doing. She'd drank, smoked pot/cigarettes, been to a lot of parties, hooked up with tons of people, and she was talking to me. I mean it was just as friends, but still, back then that was huge for me.

Being a super nerdy kid without an ounce of muscle mass on me I didn't have a lot of friends, male or female. Here I was, in the middle of the ocean, surrounded by a group of older, cooler friends who genuinely wanted to hangout with me, albeit it might have been partially out of boredom. I wasn't coming to them asking to hangout, they actually invited me, which had never happened before. I was given a bedtime of 11pm but fuck that. I wanted to be around her more to get to know her better. I didn't want to have sex with her, I didn't even really know what that meant at the time, I just wanted to be around her and listen to her talk about her life. I remember sitting with her and a few other cruise friends up in the library one night until like 1AM.

I broke my bedtime and my family was pissed, but it didn't matter. I didn't want to leave. I don't have anyone around my age in the family that I can talk to so forcing me to leave was forcing me to be alone, and when I was alone I just kept on thinking about her because I didn't really have anyone else to think about at the time. I was crushing hard. I think to this day she might be the only girl I've had a crush on, and this was 5-6 years ago.

That night I was listening to her talk in the library at 1AM I felt like I really got to know her. She was crying. She seemed vulnerable and I felt close to her even though I knew she was just venting to us because she knew she'd never have to see us again. She told us about how she felt like she screwed up by smoking and drinking too much and not doing as well in school as she wanted to. She was nervous about college. She was worried about her (ex?) boyfriend. She wasn't this bad ass unapproachable figure in my mind anymore. She was really human and I wanted to be there for her. I've only felt that close to someone a few times since that night on that 2 week cruise.

I told her I hadn't had my first kiss yet and she offered to be my first but I turned her down. To this day I don't know why I did. I mean I was into her so why? I guess I didn't want my first kiss to be out of pity. It still hasn't happened yet. If you met me you wouldn't guess, but this is the internet so I'll be completely honest. She was the first girl to sit on my lap and hug me outside of my family. I'm 19 years old and I haven't had a crush on anyone since then. I don't think I've felt that platonically close to anybody again actually. And yeah, I'm still a virgin.

I still randomly think about her a couple of times a year when I'm falling asleep and wonder what she's up to now. Should I facebook message her? Probably not. After the cruise ended I think she posted pics and wrote on my wall once or twice and I haven't had contact with her since. I messaged her with ""hey"" twice during high school years later but she didn't respond. She probably has so much going on she didn't even remember who I was, which I understand. I wasn't really anyone noteworthy back then. I wouldn't remember me either. I do want to message her on facebook just to see what she's up to and catch up with an old friend who I only knew briefly but I'm afraid I would mess up and that she wouldn't respond again. Three strikes and you're out right? So I've been afraid of sending a third unanswered message years later.

It also seems creepy to me that I'm still thinking about her every now and then years later but she really had a huge impact on me. I mean I only knew her for like 2 weeks but I think about her more than some friends who've I've known for years and lost contact with. How is it that she's part of the reason why I don't drink, smoke, or party. Wanting to be appealing to someone like her is the reason I started lifting and wrestling during high school. It's part of the reason why I started doing bjj and muay thai. It's part of the reason why I pretty much live at my MMA gym outside of my internship this summer. It's why I want to be more social at school and why I'm less of a total introvert than I would have been otherwise. I'm really glad I had the experience I did.

As a 19 year old I look like what you'd expect someone who takes classes at an MMA gym or a wrestler to look like. I put at least an hour or two in weekdays and more on the weekdays. This summer if I wasn't at my MMA gym I was in my high school wrestling room. My grandfather passed away earlier this summer. I was with him in the hospital when he passed. I remember not knowing how or what to feel. I couldn't do anything, he was just gone. The open casket and funeral felt like just going through the motions. It didn't do anything for me. I found peace by training harder and pushing myself because it took my mind off of what had happened. I'm not exactly good at what I do, but it's still what largely defines me. It's what's molded my body to look the way it does. It's where I have many of my friends. In writing about meeting her those years ago I felt like a vulnerable 13 year old loser nerd with a crush again and I liked that. I don't know why I brought up my grandpa. I haven't told anyone outside of my family of his passing.

3cfp0s,4,2015-07-07,How do you deal with an overly-friendly girlfriend?,localbizdude,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/3cfp0s/how_do_you_deal_with_an_overlyfriendly_girlfriend/,"I've [30M] been dating this great girl [29F] for about 9 months. She's very attractive, does my laundry, makes us dinner, is generally very respectful to me and seems very loyal. She goes out of her way to make my life easier. Except for one thing. Edit: People are hating that I put her above average acts of kindness and fondness towards me as the first thing I say about this girl. Of course she's awesome to talk to, fun to hang out with, and we share a lot of the same senses of humor and life decisions (when to have kids, work or personal life, saving for the future, etc.). We're a great fit.

I have started to notice that she ""accidentally"" likes to try to make ""friends"" connections with men in the most random places.

Example:
Movers - she'll make jokes with them, talk about what they're doing for school, ask about their personal lives, and share with them details about her life, ""Oh yeah. Well I'm glad we're doing this now because my sister is going out of town to Europe in a few days. She's visiting these countries over there...etc."" Things I've never seen from other women. They talk back and I can see that they like the attention from her.

I am afraid that she will find herself leading on or unknowingly having inappropriate conversations with men. A few of which I have already seen happen. A random guy she hasn't talked to in years, who was a fellow student from a summer internship, saw online that she was moving closer to his area and texted her that they should hang out sometime. A text that she showed me and I immediately recognized as a open-ended friend or romantic request (could go either way, the classic subtle ""hangout"" text). I explained to her that this was the case. She had already responded to the text ""Yes, please! That would be so much fun."" She agreed that it would be weird if I responded to a similar text from a girl and agreed to go hangout 1 on 1. She totally got it and agreed that 1 on 1s like this one are not good for our relationship. A very mature conversation between the two of us.

After doing plenty of research online with guys who have asked this question in a similar way, my general idea is that she likes to seek validation in men and make connections for friendship. I genuinely think that she doesn't understand that actively trying to talk more personally with men - breaking the personal bubble, especially going into your 30s when everyone is seeking a mate, is usually seen by those men as a sign of attraction. She may not think so, but as a guy myself, this is how we usually feel. I think even you guys would notice what I'm talking about if you could be around her.

It all makes sense now. She is too friendly with men and it's putting her and me in some weird situations. I am a big believer that men and women, especially as we get older, cannot truly be friends without romantic feelings especially if we have a significant other. However, I am unsure as to how to approach this subject with her. She would listen to anything I have to say and I want to make sure it doesn't come across as jealous or as being insecure, but this is a strange thing that needs to be addressed. I think I am going to sit down and lay all of this out for her. I do not want to tell her who she could talk to, but she needs to be made aware that as we get older, men see this as attraction attention from her and it's not so innocent, at least from the guy's side.

What should I do? Am I just being really insecure?

Before getting my master degree I have to do an internship in a company. I have started my research now and I want to hear from you guys about your experiences and suggestions.

For example my first questions are: Do you think it's better to do it in a small company or in a big one?

What are some mistakes that I could do?"

I dream of being good to a Daddy. Of making dinner, making small gifts, singing when he comes home, and above all else, being a good sub. Someone he can be proud of.

Alas, not only do I have no Daddy, I have never had a Daddy. I have never worn a collar. I have never belonged to someone.

I have so much submissive energy. I am absolutely ready to cook, clean, make gifts, and look pretty. I have so much energy to be of service, but yet I have no one to serve. How can I be of service during this period of singularity?

**I can train myself.**

Wouldn't that be nice for a Master or Daddy to show up and the sub is already obedient and takes care of themselves? In my eyes, as a Switch, that would be quite the luxury because from what I hear there is a lot of behavior and service training.

To me, there seems to be two parts:

1. Managing good deeds to the Master or to others.

2. Managing good deeds to themselves.

On point number one, I can learn to do service on my own. Maybe not sexual service, but I can absolutely learn table service, how to cook, and how to clean on my own. Voila! I am immediately ready to serve!

On point number two, I can actually train myself to be better to myself. I'm sure like many of you, I had the thought to have a Master train me to exercise, eat vegetables, be on time, dress nicely, and keep my apartment clean, but alas I have no one. Am I to wait forever to do these things?

~~Hell no!~~ *cough* excuse me, I don't cuss anymore. 

At the end of the day, the Dom is the enforcer but you will have to carry out these acts on your own. My my, wouldn't that be nice to say. ""Not only am I trained, I trained myself so you likely won't need to put any effort into these things, and I have learned to be obedient."" That sounds awfully attractive! Managers love a hands-off employee.

What do you want your Dom to enforce? I have a very good idea and so I made a list. Here is my list:

&gt; 1. No procrastinating. Must count to 3 and proceed. No frivoulous time wasting.
2. Living space must be clean at all times.
3. No cussing.
4. Must take medication at 7:30PM and morning medication with breakfast.
5. Must sleep at 9:30PM every night, except for Friday if with friends or at an event Saturday.
6. Must eat clean except for one treat daily. 
Must eat 4-5 complete meals (starch, vegetable, protein) daily.
7. Must exercise and stretch/meditate daily.
8. Must be at work at 7:50AM daily. Do not arrive late to or leave work early.
9. Must be productive 50 pomodoros a week outside of scheduled work hours.
10. Must journal daily.
12. Must not eat out except for once a week or when with friends.
13. Must be fiscally responsible (honor system).
14. Must leave house once a day (weather permitting).
15. Must not worry execessively of reputation within the community.
16. Must dress as if on date every day. Perfume, mascara, and hair done daily.
Must buy new clothing as appropriate and not solely wear clothes gifted from friends.
17. Must not pick hands and apply ointment as needed to heal any wounds on hands.
18. Must not pick face and obey skincare routine daily, particularly sunscreen.
19. Must maintain integrity (thoughts=intentions=words=actions) to self, friends, work, community.
20. Must not belittle self or be despondent about future.

Some of those things I already do but find important, like having integrity. Some of them need *serious* work, like procrastination and cleanliness. A Dom would absolutely see this immediately if he came over and saw the psuedo-cleanliness to indicate I obviously only do this for him and not myself. 

I will beat him to the punch! The house will already be clean. I will already be healthy and exercising and eating right. Good Lord, I will be such a little delight.

***I am actually the winner in this scenario because this will absolutely make me a happier and more complete person. The goal of training is to make you better and happier and you can absolutely do this to yourself.***

Yeah I won't have a reward system which will make me a bit sad, but over time I will reap the benefits and eventually, so will my future Daddy. 

Maybe we can start a thread being accountability buddies and praising each other? Let me know what you think,

And thanks for reading. :)

edit: wait just to be clear my internship is beyond lax so I have plenty of mental energy outside of work, also the pomodoros would be like hobby stuff like drawing and doing crafts and hobby coding stupid stuff, like the world's least usable website. That is so totally happening, it's going to look like a fake portfolio website and I'm going to act totally deadpan. Play catch me if you can with my buttons! so I learn mouseover events. Buahaha the trolling never ceases. With responsive design. O:) "

edit: pomodoros would mean hobby projects like art because my internship is very mentally light and a lot of coding for fun. I do take my medications but I miss like 2/14 doses a week, no actual effect but still, no excuse. And if I take my meds at night too late I'm not sleepy and end up going to bed really late on a work night. My life is actually pretty good. 

I am the type of person who is organized and ambitious about my career, but comes home and makes a mess and farts around. So my life is actually going very well, I just don't want to be living the same lifestyle when I am 30, or subjecting anyone else to this as I live alone currently. This list is really *self* improvement, as in I go the extra mile for others and my career but not actually myself and it bothers me. I can't wait for someone to come change this because my house should be clean *tonight.*

If I exercise I will be the tag champion! but definitely never hide and seek ;D"
3cg87q,1,2015-07-07,Stop wasting your time and maximize your life P1 - Strategy,[deleted],GetSuave,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetSuave/comments/3cg87q/stop_wasting_your_time_and_maximize_your_life_p1/,"Hi everyone,

Recently found this subreddit and I want to share you my personal views on how to stop wasting your time and start getting results.

Every year we hear and see it again: New Year Resolutions. ""I want to become fit"" ""I want to make more money"" ""I want to bang more chicks"". Easier said than done because eventually you have to 'do' it. But why do most people still fail then?

They don't have a schedule and a perfect plan.

That's right, they don't have a schedule at all. If you don't know what you're going to today that will help you in the future, how will you ever improve? Also we don't like wasting our time, so we take the best approach and start implementing it into our daily schedule.

Now how do you get started?
•	Write down the things you want to improve on now.
•	Do your research and find the best approach towards your end goal. (But don't waste too much time. Get a good strategy started and fix it later on)
•	Start doing it.

That's it, simple as fuck but most people fuck it up anyway. They tend to do something 'whenever they feel like it', which is not how you're supposed do it. If everyone is doing it this way, you should know that you shouldn't do it.

As I like practical advice, here is a quick way to become better at something. I will explain in another post how you can implement this in your schedule + all potential self improvement tips.

Case:
I want to be the top student in my class (simple College goal), while using my knowledge to get internships and networks and get a jumpstart in the field.

How do we achieve this goal:
Top student:
Get good grades. This is done by studying the material lots of hours in the right way. How do we study that material the best way? By using practise tests! 

The Best Way to Study is using Practise tests http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2008/02/21/the-best-way-to-study-practice/""

Get internships:
This is mostly done by getting networks (warm approaching) or applying (cold approaching). I prefer the warm approach because it's ten times easier and gives you way better results. 
How do we get networks? We have to find these people first. Where do we find these people? By going to field-related events! Where do we find those field-related events? By using the Internet and doing our research.


How do you convince those people to be interested in you (making a sale here)?  By dressing sharp, have a great look and talk about the industry. 
•	Dress sharp? Find great guides online (start with reddit)
•	Have a great look? Good hygiene, a haircut, skincare and a great physique will get you very far. 
o	Hygiene: just shower. and take care of smell.
o	Haircut: go to the hairdresser atleast once a month.
o	Skincare: take care of your skin (reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction)
o	Great physique: start lifting / eat the right way towards goal
o	We can go further with shaving, teeths, ... but you guys get the clue: maximize each option!

•	Talk about the industry? Find great resources online (or buy a magazine subscription) and keep yourself up to date. It's not that difficult and it will probably take you one to two hours a week max. in order to keep yourself up to date.

As you can see now we already have quite some stuff going on that will help us towards our end goal. If we make a simple list we get this:
•	Study the right way
•	Networking (event / dress sharp / look / industry updated)
•	Internships (comes from networking or cold approaching)


Next post will be about creating a schedule to fit your self-improvement and a list of all potential self-improvement topics.

I'm doing my CS internship where one of the tasks is going to involve finding the smallest ellipsoid (in any number of dimensions) given a set of points so that all points lie inside the ellipsoid.

I've been trying to find a summary of all algorithms one could use to solve the problem but I can't understand a single thing I've found so far. 

Example links:

* http://people.orie.cornell.edu/miketodd/ublndetz.pdf

* https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~psun/bio/MVEpaper_accept.pdf

* http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/examples/cvxbook/Ch08_geometric_probs/html/min_vol_elp_finite_set.html#source &lt;-- this one looks simple, but I don't understand how it works

Could someone give me a hint on how to approach this problem? I need to have a general idea of what needs to be done until tomorrow.

First, I want to say I have no sob story, I am not facing any particularly hard part of my life... I am a Computer Science student and I am currently between the 2nd and 3rd year. I luckily got a summer internship, in a really good company in my country. I'm very grateful for that, and I'm learning a lot, but it is really tiring, as I come from a whole year of a CS course, which is pretty hard, as some of you may know.  

 I'm working full time, and have to take the train to work, so I don't have a lot of time to  myself, or to play....  
However, I have some time at night where I could use a nice relaxing game. Now, here's where my request starts: I love DayZ. I just love the concept. As soon as Arma 2 got on sale, last year on the summer sale, I instantly bought it. I spent many hours on the Dayz Mod, and loved every minute of it. I just don't like the zombie's AI and a couple of other stuff, including having not many players around...    

 I have my eyes on DayZ Standalone for a long time, and if one of you amazing guys out here (there a lot of awesome guys on this sub - it's a beautiful community) could gift me a copy of DayZ Standalone, I would be so happy. I could have a game to relax at night, without thinking too much, after coming home from work - which is really stressful, and making have no vacations. I can't afford many games because my parents are so overburdened with tuition money, and other expenses of having me on college. Luckily, my internship is paid, and I will be able to host a couple giveaways in here, so I can return to the community! I'll probably be doing a giveaway in a couple of days, because I have a spare key of Red Faction Guerilla lying around :D  

So, I'd really really love to get DayZ. It is asking too much, but I know this sub is capable of doing amazing things, so I decided to ask... Thank you for your time reading this, and sorry for the big wall of text! :/  Please don't stop being this amazing community!   

Cheers to any CS buddies out there! :D

3ch9kq,0,2015-07-07,I(27/f) Can't decide who to be exclusive with (20m/26m),throwawayacc8823,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3ch9kq/i27f_cant_decide_who_to_be_exclusive_with_20m26m/,"Throw away account for obvious reasons.

I met two guys on Okcupid. Let's call the first guy Andrew and second guy Brian.

Andrew is a hard working person, he works in the hospital(but not a doctor). He has busy schedule. He often replies texts in 3-12 hour intervals. We would text each other everyday, but usually about 3-5 sentences per day. Ideally, he's the type of guy I want. He has never dated anyone before. 

However, my relationship with Andrew is kind of lukewarm at best. Sometimes it takes him 12 hours to reply a text, even on his off days. We only see each other once a week despite the fact that we only live 15 min drive apart. He often doesn't make plans with me and I'll have to be the one making plans. Initially I thought he was just busy. But he had two weeks off recently, and was still acting the same(seeing each other once a week, takes forever to text...etc). 

He's kind of my ideal guy. Someone who doesn't have ex problems(I'll go into this later). Someone with mundane life without most of his career path and everything set.

On the other hand, there is Brian. Brian is a super fun person to be with. He's 6 years younger than me so initially I told him that I was just looking for friends. Things hit off really quickly after the first date though. He would text me throughout the day with good morning, lunch time, and all those small things, and he actually makes some good fucking effort to see me.

He doesn't drive so he would take public transit for 45 mins to see me, and he would see me almost every other day despite his busy schedule (he's a full time student AND has a full time job. On top of that he volunteers at various charities and clubs). Now that I'm typing this out it makes me sad to think that Brian puts way more effort than Andrew in seeing me. He's actually enthusiastic and excited to be with me.

The problem with Brian is that he's...kind of young. He doesn't drive and is still struggling to find himself. He just got an internship at a company that he wants to work for and I'm happy for him, but everything is sort of uncertain with him. To top it off, I've always had this ex issue with him. He talks about his ex a lot, and sometimes compare me with his ex in a complimentary kind of way (oh you are better at xxx than my ex). 

They only dated for a month really, but stayed as friends with benefits up until two weeks before he met me. His ex still occasionally send him picture of herself on snapchat, and it totally freaks me out because I've had this deep ingrained ex problems.

To cut it short, I've had 2 bfs before. My first bf was still living with his ex when we were together, and never moved out. Needless to say, it ended painfully. My second bf, basically used me as a rebound, and dropped the bomb about going back to his ex a year into our relationship because ""despite that [I] was the better option, he still feel more connected to his ex.

Ever since then I kinda just don't want to deal with men who's still in touch with their ex, because....fuck it that's so much work and heartache that I went through.

Brian has been wanting to make me his girlfriend, and I've been postponing it. I feel like I need to make a decision now because it's not fair for him. Objectively, Andrew is better for me(for a long term relationship and for my insecurity issues, but I definitely connects with Brian better).

Please help me. I need all your opinion before making a decision.

3ch9zz,10,2015-07-07,I Paid A Man $15 For My Sanity,iamzafuzz,redditstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditstories/comments/3ch9zz/i_paid_a_man_15_for_my_sanity/,"Real talk though: New York is bat shit crazy. It’s expensive, it’s loud, unforgiving and hot. And for most people in this city, the hustle is the only kind of life they know. It’s the kind of life I have been introduced to through an internship I acquired here for the summer - a summer I would have usually spent chilling on a beach with soft sands caressing feet, cool winds grazing naturally wavy beach bum hair previously acquired using expensive bedhead sprays and sun soaked skin shimmering gold. 

I find that my ideal summer now, lives ironically, on huge billboards sporting Corona Ads on the busiest streets of New York as a tease to those who would have to give up two months of their rent to get a ticket to paradise and then, to me, a now homesick intern craving some peace of mind. Honestly, it’s great advertising. The very idea of a chilled beer running down a parched throat under the beat of a heavy sun… yum. 

But, that’s about as close to paradise as one can get while living on a budget in New York… Beer. Or if you’re me and rather not lug around a beer belly with the weight of all the other things going on in life at the same time… WINE. I am fortunate enough to be able to still enjoy New York for all it’s crazy and beautiful, but sometimes, I can’t help but wonder what the lives of those constantly smeared in it’s unforgiving grease and sweat must be like. 

But, one man gave me 5 minutes for $15 to wipe off all the gunk and remember who I was amidst all the chaos. 

On another typical day in New York city, I got done with work, rushed out the door to seek solace in my visiting boyfriends arms, but mostly in the wine that he brought along with him (priorities). We decided to “indulge” in a little bit of consumerism before we headed off back to Brooklyn for the rest of the evening. Stereotypical roles reversed, I, along with my disinterest, lingered through the countless aisles stacked with stuff… lots and lots of stuff. 

While I waited for him in the monochrome section of the store to get away from the screaming patterns and sale signs, I dreamt up ideas of a cozy, comfy bed, a warm meal and a glass of wine until my thoughts were interrupted by a nudge. We moved on to the next store where I hoped to find a monochrome section that was bigger. 

Done with shopping, we started making our way back to Union Square to catch the next L to the G into Brooklyn. This routine so intertwined into my everyday life that the act comes second to breathing. But, on that particular day of that particularly gruelling week, something caught my eye… 

…A board made of straws covered in bright lime green with pink and orange font reading, “PICK A SUBJECT AND A PRICE GET A POEM”.

I shifted my gaze a few inches above the board and found a man sitting behind a blue portable plastic table, already busy engrossed punching the keys on a type writer in front of him. 

Used to my usual distracted state of mind, my boyfriend was accustomed to stopping multiple times in the middle of streets, trains, restaurants… anywhere really, while I satisfied my inquisitiveness by making photographs of the things that intrigued me. However, this time, upon following my gaze, he immediately pulled out his wallet, bundled up some cash and pulled me behind the girl awaiting her piece. 

He stood next to me and asked, “What do we ask him to write about?”

“Fire.”

“Nah. Too typical. Something else.”

As we waited for our turn and tried to think of a topic, I began noticing the  number of people who stopped around us in contemplation and but then chose to walk away; the number of people who were missing out because they probably valued their time too much. I wished they had the patience. 

The girl in front of us walked away with the piece he had carefully written for her. 

We eagerly approached him, handed him the money and said “Pineapples”.
He thanked us and barely looking at the money, shoved it away in his pocket. He took a breath, stared afar and back at the type writer in front of him. His fingers mingling amongst themselves while his mind juggled ideas, words, letters, thoughts. He took out a blank sheet of paper from a folder placed on his right, fit it into the slot of his typewriter at which point he expressed his interest in who we were and where we came from and what us brought us to New York. We exchanged a few words until our conversation ended and as he placed his hands together. The finger mingling stopped. His ideas at the ready. With a deep breath, he began typing. 

With nothing to do but wait for him to finish, I began noticing his demeanour. His hair was a big, “poofy”, glorious mess with little leaves stuck here and there that he clearly did not care to take out. I thought of him to be a simple man. He had simple things. Things he needed for that day and nothing more. A typewriter, a folder with paper and two pens.

5 minutes. It took him maybe around 5 minutes to cook up a poem about this peculiar looking fruit. He gently tugged the paper out of the slot, placed it on the table, fetched one of his ink pens and began editing away little pieces on the paper. His disposition was so intriguing that I didn’t realise how I had drained out all the commotion around me with such ease. I forgot about my desire for deep slumber and warm dinner. I realised how I felt more present in that moment just watching him than I did in weeks. I felt peace. It felt amazing to not be on the move.

He handed us the paper and we bed farewell. We both got onto the train, pulled the paper out and anxiously read his words. His words…

We read it over and over and over and over. We couldn’t stop. It meant something new to us every single time. He gave us a bit of his world for $15 and it was beautiful. But, what he hadn’t realised was that he had also given me peace and quiet. He gave me things I value most for a price I chose. Time for myself to breathe, mindfulness, a sense of gratitude and art. And I couldn’t help but feel sorry for all the people who were losing out on this experience because of their obsession with the hustle.

Lynn Gentry, I just want to say thank you. You have given me more in 5 minutes of my time here in New York than I’ve managed to in the month I’ve spent in this city.

I genuinely hope more people find you. They need to.

For those of you interested, but a little too far away from the chaotic beauty of New York to find him in, read about him and more of his work on http://lynngentry.com/"

So I recently found myself in a disadvantageous position where my summer internship is in the dumpster, and as a result I have oodles of free time. 

I have been dabbling in streaming for the last year. Nothing serious that I have put a lot of work into. However with all of this free time i have been considering doing something a little more extreme, more so than anything else as a project/goal for myself. 

I was considering taking a full 7 days and keeping my stream up while playing games, living my life, and learning how to really stream proper. It would be more than just an endless marathon of PC gaming, taking inspiration from Justin to just capture my life in between gaming marathons. As such I would be able to transition from PC games to having friends over for tabltop games, and engage in other gaming activities. 

My only concern is breaking twitch rules in regards to things like: playing npc matches on stream while I do things like sleep, or take a camera away from the computer removing myself from the gaming for short periods of time. I also fear just doing something that's a gimmick. I want to do something challenging and fun and treat it as a learning experience and constructive use of my time in an arena I love. 

Anywhoo I guess I was just here looking for any feedback or advice from the crowd here. If it's something that's even really feasible with twitch rules or if I just sound like a blabbering idiot. 

All the best &lt;3

3chwx4,9,2015-07-07,Need some unbiased LTR advice,redterp22,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3chwx4/need_some_unbiased_ltr_advice/,"**Background:**
I've been a lurker of TRP for about a year now. Started seeing a girl back in January, lets call her Jenna, who has a lot of great characteristics for a LTR. Conservative background, great relationship with her father, parents still married, only had two relationships so body count wise i'm her third time, she is really sweet, and I find her attractive(HB7.5)

Jenna and I are both 22 years old and going into our senior year of college together. We started dating back in February and so far I have been able to hold frame whenever i'm around her, and she frequently tells me I'm the best sex she's ever had. (Not saying this to brag but just to provide info)

I'm 6'4, fairly confident, lift 3-4 times a week with the stronglift routine, and I am trying to learn how to play guitar and speak spanish. I am currently interning in NYC, which made our relationship long distance for the summer(roughly 4 hours).

**Situation:**
Jenna and I talked on the phone, snapchatted each other and video chatted pretty frequently while i've been away. I know normally this is frowned upon, but under the LDR circumstances I thought the circumstances might change. Three weeks into my internship, Jenna was strongly hinting to me over the phone that she was unhappy being in a LDR so I made the decision for us to go on a break. During the phone call she told me that if I met someone else I was interested in not to hold back.(This is a huge red flag for me because i'm sure she just said that so she doesn't feel guilty about seeing some other dudes).

At this point I pretty much have demoted her from a girlfriend to a plate, and I thought I would be okay with that but just the thought of her possibly seeing some other guy makes me a little sick and feel a little jealous(even though normally I'm not a jealous person.) 

I came back home for the holiday weekend to hang out with friends and family, and Jenna reached out to me to hang out. We met up and I fucked her good 5 times. All was going well until I noticed that she set a passcode to her phone. I have never looked through her phone, but this was another red flag to me because before I left for NYC she didn't have a passcode on her phone. So my gut is telling me that she has something to hide. My brain and gut are telling me what I don't want it to be, while another side of me wants to think that she isn't talking to/fucking another guy. I really saw her as long term going into this school year, but after this(even though I'm not certain she's fucking around) I am hesitant to commit exclusively to her. 

**EDIT:** I think it's important to point out that I definitely give her what she needs in bed. Only sometimes I tell her nice things while I fuck her slowly. I think it's important to change it up during sex and mainly ill dominate her and fuck her roughly while dirty talking her. She lives in a small rural farm town and I am definitely a better option to than the others guys back home. I definitely admit to catching feelings and saying some things only a love struck beta would say. My intention is to kill off these feelings and stop saying soft shit in bed.

This fall I'm starting my MSc programme, and would like to get myself an internship for the next summer. I have a decent background in software engineering and math. I have passed several courses on machine learning, and comfortable with reading research papers. I did several internships during my undergrad study: one was a SWE-internship in Silicon Valley, another was a recommender systems research at a local company.

The job of my dream would be that at DeepMind (well, who wouldn't say that?), but I do realize that I have no research experience (i.e. published papers), so I aim a bit lower.
Another thing to note: I don't feel like these Data Science roles are right for me. I see them mostly as stats guys doing stuff in their excel / r / matlab with the outcome of better understanding your processes / audience, whereas SW guys deliver new features.
And the final note is that I plan to do a lot of research during my MSc so in 2 years I can get into a decent PhD programme. Thus, good recommendation letters are a plus.

Sorry for the lengthy introduction. So my questions are:

 * What are my chances to get this kind of internship being a Master's student? Haven't they all been taken by hungry Phds? :-)
 * What can I do to improve these chances? I have something like 3-4 months before the applications start.
 * How should I position myself (both in CV and during interviews): should I emphasis my software engineering experience, my research attitude (mostly lots of ML-related courses), or something else.
 * How does an interview for such positions look like? Is it usual SW-interview (algorithms, programming techniques, etc) without any emphasis on ML part, or quite the reverse?

TL;DR math-and-software-engineering heavy internship without business-shit is wanted. Preferably at a top company. And then there're 4 silly questions I want wisdom of reddit to answer."

Am I just overreacting?",iamabadperson12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cjb8y/my_boyfriend_21m_of_a_year_never_wants_to_see_me/,"Me and my boyfriend Jon got together during our sophomore year of college, and we've dated for a year. 

This is the first serious relationship either of us have had.

We're had a mostly good relationship, with a couple of bumps. We started out in a FWB situation and then decided to become exclusive. Initially he wasn't entirely sure if he wanted a relationship, but eventually came around and apologised.

Since then we've had some minor arguments about me being a priority in his life. This has come up about three times, including now. First, at the beginning of our relationship when he wasn't sure he wanted one, he ditched me for a friend last minute. We worked that out like adults and everything seemed okay.

The second time occurred a few months later, during a really rough time for me, when I started struggling with depression, and while midterm exams were underway. I was crying myself to sleep every night but he was buried in books and only saw me twice in a month. It ended up solving itself later during winter break, as we finally had time for each other, but it left a couple scars on the relationship.

Now, we've been out of college for summer. I have an internship from 8-5, but other than that my days are largely free. Jon and I currently live about a mile away from each other. He has a car, so transportation isn't an issue. We've been back for about a month and I've only seen him twice. The situation doesn't appear to bother him, but it's really starting to distress me. I'm in therapy for my depression, which has since gotten better as exam stress faded. 

I've tried talking to him about it, but bringing up any sort of issue in our relationship is really hard since I hate having these sorts of conversations over text, and he tends to respond with a negative, ""What have I done now?"" kind of attitude, and his ego flares. He just says we'll work something out but offers no concrete plans, since he says we see each other all the time during the year. I do have hobbies and I do see my friends quite often, so it's not like I'm sitting at home pining for him, but I miss him. I keep bringing up fun things for us to do, but he seems largely uninterested.

He sees his friends from back home almost every day but whenever I ask him to see me after work he's suddenly broke or busy or tired. He still tells me he loves me every day but I'm starting to feel really insecure in our relationship. He tells me he's happy and we're okay, but I'm not happy and I'm not okay. I feel like I'm constantly bringing up issues and nagging him.

What should I do?

**TL;DR: It seems like my boyfriend has time for everyone in the world except me, even with no job and no responsibilities.**"

Me and my boyfriend, let's call him Bob, met while starting grad school here on the West coast. We are going to grad school in the sciences, so imagine our surprise when we actually found an entire group of very social, outgoing people in our incoming class (not the most common for the subject we are getting our PhD in). So the first year and a half of us knowing each other, we were actually very, very good friends. I was one of the only girls of the group, but I've always tended to make friends quickly with guys because I'm just really laid back and don't care much for drama. The first year of us being friends, we were very close. Close, as in we would at least have a text a day from each other. The feelings were platonic at the time, as I had a boyfriend from back home still. The summer after our first whole year at school, my boyfriend and I broke up and I was single for the first time in a while. I stayed single for a number of months until one night, I learned that Bob had a crush on me for a while but he was too afraid to say anything because we were such good friends entangled into a larger group of very good friends. He finally got the courage to tell me a couple days before I went home for Christmas. We became even closer, started to be romantic, and a soon later we were officially together. 

Our entire relationship has been great. It started from the foundation of a great friendship, so we have very much in common and have a very happy relationship, or so I think. We have never had a fight about anything. I know sometimes that can be a bad thing, but it's not because we're avoidant of issues or anything, it's just that we see almost the same on everything and we're very open and patient and understanding and have never really had an issue arise. The strangest thing about our relationship is that we have not said ""I love you"" to each other. Not saying I don't feel it (because I do) but I'm really hesitant to make the first step to say it because of some hardships in past relationships. I think this is very important in a relationship, but I know that he (or I for that matter) is not very forthcoming about talking about emotions. We do occasionally and that's all that we've ever really needed.

Anyways, I bring you to the current situation. Bob got an opportunity to take an internship in New York. Whenever the opportunity arose, he told me over dinner one night and asked me to play devil's advocate as to any reasons why he shouldn't go. If he took it, he would be leaving soon and be gone for an entire year. I told him the only possible downside would be that he would delay his progress in his PhD for one year... but I don't even see that as a downside because the year of industry experience is such a great opportunity and could put him at the top of the pool in job searches when he does get his PhD. I fully encouraged him to do it. When it comes to decision making, my mentality is that you shouldn't include your personal life as a major factor in it, because you never know what could happen. I didn't mention anything with our relationship as being a deterrent from taking the internship because I really am 100% supportive of the internship. Also, I have no problems with long distance relationships (I have had multiple long-distance relationships before and I can handle them, the guys never could though in my experience). In fact, I chose going to grad school 15 hours away from my home state over staying at home and reapplying to other schools to be closer to my bf at the time. I think career-first and this is what Bob is doing as well in this situation. I am completely okay with it. 

Now, I assumed that this meant that Bob and I would be doing a LDR. It wouldn't be easy as I only get paid a small stipend and travel money is short to come by, but I can budget better and make it work. However, now I'm not so sure Bob is on the same page. When going to bed last night, he mentioned that we needed to talk about what was going to happen to our relationship when he left (which is going to be very soon). He said we have a couple options, and wanted to know what I thought. I said that I have no problems with LDRs, and that I know they are tough but I'm always willing to do it when I really do care a lot about the person. After all, it will only be one year. Very small in the grand scheme of things. We have both admitted to being very happy in our relationship up until this point. I will still have some time here after he returns from his year internship, so when he returns we will both still be around. We were both silent for a while after that, and I finally asked what he was thinking. I was starting to get upset at this point because I didn't realize that he was considering other options. He said something along the lines of ""well we both don't like LDRs so we can think about some other options.""  

Now at this point I'm really upset. The only two options I know of outside of doing a LDR is either taking a break or completely breaking up. Now for me, taking a break doesn't equal breaking up, because I've had a relationship or two where taking a break actually allowed us to grow as a couple. I guess that's the option I like most.. but I also fear that I'm going to be so hurt from him leaving that ""taking a break"" actually WILL mean breaking up for me, and that I won't feel the same when he gets back because of feeling abandoned. 


I know this situation isn't that uncommon, but I'm really not sure how to feel right now. I don't want to see this guy I love walk out the door without even trying to keep us together, and I don't think the other options will fare well. I can't talk about this with any of my friends here because, well, we are both in the circle of friends and I don't want to put any of them in a weird position of ""taking sides"" per se. I guess I'm just looking for some advice, some comfort, some ideas, anything. 



   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend is moving away for a year, and we're unsure what we should do as a couple. We have both been admittedly very happy with our relationship up to this point, but now I think he wants to break up and I don't understand or know how to feel about it. "

Now that the madness that is Le Mans has died down a bit, it's time to talk about a few things that have been going on behind the scenes here at /r/wec! All of the mods have been very busy since Le Mans, with exams, moves and internships, so apologies that this is coming a little late.

#New Moderator!
Firstly, I'd like to formally introduce myself as a mod of /r/wec! You may have seen my posts around, including the [Le Mans Primer thread](http://redd.it/38c8g9). During the 24 hours of Le Mans, /u/CookieMonsterFL, /u/onefunkynote, and /u/Sindroome24 approached me and offered me the position and I gladly accepted! My job will mostly involve creating content and responding to any issues that you guys might have, so feel free to shoot me or the rest of the mods a message if you've got any concerns.

#Le Mans Weekend
A massive thankyou to /u/Atto_ and /u/hennogarvie1 for allowing the use of their streaming network for the full 24 hours of Le Mans, pissing off a bunch of their server providers in the process. These guys deserve a massive thank you from everyone here and we would have not been able to have the reach and the experience that we had without your help.

**Traffic Stats** because we know how much you guys love that.  
So after /u/CookieMonsterFL's amazing 1955 disaster thread, plus the resulting le mans hype, /r/wec has had over ***265 THOUSAND*** unique pageviews in the months of may and june and a total of ***OVER ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PAGE VIEWS*** over the course of those two months! We destroyed 8 thousand subs and just kept going right up until the end of the race. At one point towards the start of the race, we had the largest IRC channel by about 3 times.

And the best part about all of that was *how little* we had to moderate things, even with the massive influx of new members. And for that, we thank every single one of you in the community. You all made our jobs very easy over the weekend and it was and has been since an absolute pleasure to moderate.

#What's still to come
As /u/Sindroome24 mentioned last week, we'll be covering the 24 hours of Paul Ricard next weekend, followed by the 24 hours of Spa Francorchamps at the end of the month, which features in /u/Sindroome24's running order contest. The next WEC event is on the 30th of August at the Nurburgring, which should be a cracker of a race!

After a generally positive reception to the [How the race was won thread](http://redd.it/3acmqd), I'll be continuing that for all WEC rounds and possibly other endurance races too.

Finally, we're working on a few things behind the scenes which, if they end up going to plan, should be awesome! Look out for a big announcement in the next few days! While Le Mans might be over, the WEC continues to roll on, and so are we here at /r/wec 

Thanks heaps everyone!"
3cjork,31,2015-07-08,[Rant/Vent] [Advice Request] My parents call me an inappropriate insult for not meeting their convoluted expectations.,2ndisthe1stloser,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3cjork/rantvent_advice_request_my_parents_call_me_an/,"This is my first post on RBN. I need to tell someone about the awful trip my supportive SO of 3 years and I took to my Nparents house to see my (possible N, possible GC) brother's graduation from HS. It was the first time my SO visited my parents, so it should have been a cheery affair, but instead it was utterly terrible from the start. My parents are very selfish, almost skeezey people although they spend a lot of money on objects to pretend otherwise. 

There is a lot to unpack about this trip, including the $2500+ they spent on my brother's graduation and computer, my mom saying some white supremacist shit, and my dad treating me like a child although I'm 23, and generally just ignoring my partner and I except to suit themselves.

The actual graduation event itself was also ill met. I hate most of my high school experience and am not so quiet on that fact. However my parents have trained my brother to have all these friends whose parents they can pretend to be friends with (unlike me). My parents have been going to all these grad parties (weird right) and my nmom has been shining in all her glory (gag). Although I'm pretty sure all these people just use them for the fact that my nfather is retired and drive their kids everywhere. All my brother's friends are way more successful (ivy league/prestigious private school) than he is (low level state school and an indifference to his doing well in school), as are their parents to my parents, so to my trained eye these surface relationships have an expiration date.

One encounter during this time was particularly uncomfortable. At the graduation was this lady who knew my parents and I had talked on the phone about an internship. Things didn't work out because they left me a message for an interview on my cell phone I didn't see for a month (Doh!). I didn't tell my nrents what happened, but I have no tough feelings because 1. it was my mistake and 2. I am doing well now. Actually I am much more successful and educated than anyone else in my lower middle class family, which is a point of tension. By their materialist standards I am better than them, which they could never admit since their self worth depends on being better than me. 

Anyway my parents pointed her out as she walked by and I asked my nrents to introduce me to her, which is reasonable since I hadn't met her in person. For some reason this caused a lot of inexplicable tension. They freaked out, but did it anyway and it was really awkward.

Later I was talking to my brother. He said that because of this incident and another encounter where I didn't act super friendly to this girl whose parents are friends with my parents (I said hi but it was a bad time to reconnect), my parents called me a ""b****"" while they were in the car with him. I was aghast. Of course in the past my mom has called me this to my face and in front of family, but now they are doing this behind-the-back-criticism of me. I think it because they are afraid of me and the fact that I don't love them anymore, but still want to hurt me by relaying their disappointment through my brother. Obviously there's also an expiration date on our relationship, that coincides with my financial independence. We are basically LC, but my plan is to skip the family hell-idays this year, and go from there. Any insights/similar experiences RBN?

I was looking for some input as to how bitcoin can be used with OAUTH. Right now there is one server that signs all the tokens, when it goes down new tokens can't be authenticated. This is where I think bitcoin comes in.

Is it possible to have multiple authentication servers and use (multisig?) transactions to verify these tokens. That way the traffic can be routed to any of the servers rather than only traveling through a single server. That way if one server were to go down the system stays in place and continues to work.

If anyone can give me tips on how to implement this I would greatly appreciate it!"

I'm a community college student who is about to start his first internship.

I'm tasked with developing a WYSIWYG web page builder/editor for a small business. For the project, I plan to use AngularJS, Jquery, and an open-source rich text editor from GitHub.
I'm still researching available text editors. Perhaps I may use textAngular (https://github.com/fraywing/textAngular).

The project is elaborate and actually a little over my head but I like the challenge. I don't know AngularJS but currently learning it on my own.

Fortunately this is an open-ended project with a generous time frame (till the end of the year). So I figure I'll get it completed in a few months but I rather collaborate with others on this project.

I'm hoping to find a fellow student, who like myself, needs to knock out internship requirements before graduating.

Actually anyone is invited to help me but I figure, this being an unpaid internship, I don't want to waste someone's time unless they need the experience.

I'm very appreciative if anyone who is knowledgeable about these kinds of projects could provide pointers or be available to guide me when I run into trouble.

If you know a place on the web that is better suited for this kind of request, please let me know.

Thank you reading my post and considering my request.

At least, according to my license it is. I used to be Shawn Milner, a relatively successful businessman with a bit of a drinking habit. I had lived as Shawn for twenty-seven very satisfied years, taking what I wanted from life and giving it my charming company in return. Even when that company was unwanted.  
I was handsome, bold, strong… I really had it all. Not that I didn’t work hard at some of it; it takes more than wishful thinking and good genes to earn a square chest and a six-pack. But the art of communication, the gift of manipulating people? That came naturally to me, and I had no problem reaping its benefits.  
I still remember the party that changed my life. It was a business function, after-hours drinking in the office. I suggested to Maria, one of our younger interns, that she should stick by me for the evening. Didn’t really give her a choice, to be honest. A strong personality can be like that.  
Maria was smoking hot. She reminded me of that slutty-looking girl in that Disney movie, the one with the hunchback, but with more clothes on. I’d set my sights on her, but she was playing hard to get, acting like she just wanted to be friends. I’d have been fine with that, except that I wanted a piece of her. So I spent the party nursing one drink in a red plastic cup while making sure she had considerably more than that. Granted, there’s nothing wrong with fetching a lady a drink when she’s thirsty. Not at all.  
Crushing up a few allergy pills into the drink, on the other hand, is more of a gray area.  
At the time I didn’t see anything wrong with what I was doing. Or at least I didn’t let myself see. I justified what I was doing, telling myself that she was obviously drinking like a fish, and she’d get wasted eventually, so there was nothing too bad about giving her a little nudge in the right direction. And besides, there was like a fifty-fifty chance that she’d wake up, remember nothing, and thank me for taking care of her. So I felt no guilt - consciously, at least - when I dragged her down to the parking lot and into my car. And I felt even less guilt when I pulled the car over, leaned back her seat, pushed up her skirt and shoved myself inside of her.  
The really hilarious thing is, it wasn’t even that good. I barely lasted a minute, pumping into her at an awkward angle, and I came before I was ready to. I had planned to shoot it over her chest or face or something, but instead I exploded mid-thrust inside her. That was probably my real mistake.  
I took her home and laid her on my couch, then went up to bed. The next morning, she was gone, and I had a hangover so bad I wasn’t even sure what had happened wasn’t some weird dream. It couldn’t be, though, because I found Maria’s panties in the pocket of my slacks when I went to toss them in the laundry bin.  
Maria didn’t show up to work the next week, but nobody said anything to me. I was starting to think that I’d gotten away with my little indiscretion and had pretty much put it out of my mind by Friday night.  
Saturday morning proved how hasty that had been.  
  
I had been drinking on Friday, but felt queasy, so I’d gone home early. At first I chalked up the weird feeling to a fucked-up hangover and maybe a stomach bug. Still, it was weird getting out of bed. Everything seemed a little higher, and I had this weird vertigo, like I was lighter on my feet but somehow off-balance and about to tip forward or back.  
I made my way to the bathroom to take a piss, blinking the murky film out of my vision. The morning piss was a ritual of mine, perfected to a science ages ago: shorts off, stand at the toilet and let it go while stretching my arms and shoulders, then whip off the shirt and have a quick shower.  
I pushed my boxers off my hips, feeling weird still and noticing a strange looseness to the fit. Deciding the elastic must be fucked in that pair, I kicked them toward the trash bin and stepped in front of the toilet, conveniently open and seat-up for me. I closed my eyes, listening to the sound of water-on-water.  
Except that I wasn’t really hearing a lot of water-on-water. It was more like water-on-floor and water-on-leg. A spreading heat told me I was somehow pissing down my own leg. “Shit,” I muttered, grabbing at my cock to correct my aim.  
My hand closed on nothing but air. I tried again, pinching off the flow and running my hand across my pelvis. Nothing but smooth skin and soft hair, and then something that shouldn’t be there. My eyes snapped open and I looked down.  
All I could see down there was my chest. Except it wasn’t my chest; my chest was hard and square and a little hairy. This chest was pale, smooth, and appeared to be shaped like a really great pair of tits. I looked over at the bathroom mirror, still not processing the information.  
The face that stared back at me was completely unfamiliar. She looked to be my age, and pretty. I wouldn’t have thrown her out of bed. She had my green eyes, and the same dark brown hair as I did, but the similarities pretty much ended there. Her hair went down past her shoulders, not at all like my businessman’s cut. She had pale skin, lacking my beach tan, and high cheekbones. Her nose was smaller than mine, which was just as well because it looked cute on her, and her lips were fuller, although they were turned down in a frown of disbelief.  
My eyes trailed downward and hers followed. She stared at my pecs while I took in the sight of her shoulders, collarbones, and the curve of her perky breasts. B-cup, I thought, or maybe C. “No way,” I said quietly, then put a hand to my throat. My voice had changed, too. “Do Re Mi,” I said quietly. “She sells seashells by the… huh. Pretty. No, Shawn, stop it. What the fuck is happening?”  
I became acutely aware that I was standing in a puddle of my own piss. I mopped it up with a towel, wiped myself down, then tossed the whole mess in the hamper and walked nude back to my bedroom. There was a full-length mirror there, and clearly I needed to use it.  
There’s no easy way to say it, but two facts became achingly clear to me as I stood and looked in that mirror. First, that I had somehow become a woman overnight. That was definitely a vagina between my legs, and I had very little body hair, and a whole bunch of other facts pointed me at that conclusion. Second: I was cute.  
I looked to have shrunk down to about five-foot-eight, which actually bothered me more than the loss of my favorite genitalia. I suppose I was in shock, but dammit, I liked being able to reach high shelves! I put “buy a stepstool” on my mental to-do list under “why the fuck am I female” and turned to the side to check my figure.  
I had a low body-fat, that much was consistent, but I definitely wasn’t near as cut as I’d been the day before. Not “I”, I corrected myself, “she”. She had a low body-fat. Nice round shape to the breasts, pert pink nipples, curved-but-tight little ass in the back, decent legs… not really my type, I’d always preferred busty model-looking babes, but yeah, she looked pretty good. I faced the mirror again and ran a hand down my body, getting to know the feeling of it - the sensitive flesh of my chest, the soft-but-firm tummy, the downy little triangle of short-cropped hair… and then I slid my hand down across my privates.  
I didn’t know what else to call it, really. It wasn’t a cock or balls, obviously. I didn’t feel right calling it my “junk” either. Snatch? Gash? Suddenly those words seemed nastier than before. Pussy? I chuckled. That was such a silly word. But it certainly did seem to enjoy being stroked like one…  
That was when I realized that I was playing with myself. My fingers were stroking along the folds of my… self… and I was feeling little waves of pleasure tingling up my spine. It was pretty intense, really. Almost like back when I was a kid and I touched myself for the first time.  
I stopped, staring down at my hand. My fingertips were moist now, and even without touching I could still feel the excitement between my legs. “That’s impossible,” I said, keenly ignoring the impossibility of the entire situation. “I’ve had lots of… I mean, I used to… holy shit, I’m a virgin.”  
I sat down on my bed, staring over at the distraught girl in the mirror. Me. I was staring at me. This was all too weird. I was a girl, I was a virgin, and I had this sort of tingling urgency happening. I squirmed, rubbing my thighs together, and realized what that was pretty quickly: I was horny.  
Spreading my legs, I once more slid my right hand down between them to touch my pussy. Apparently I’d woken it up with that touching before, because I was getting wetter down there by the second. My fingers moved of their own accord, smearing the moisture along my lower lips, and I gasped at the sudden pleasure of the sensation.  
I laid back on the bed, relaxing, and started once more stroking up and down along my slit. It was mine, I told myself, so there was nothing wrong with this. Just a little relaxation to help deal with this… with whatever this was. I moaned, then covered my mouth with my other hand. Damn, that sounded weird. Weird, but good. I did it again, muffled by my palm, as I started probing at myself, getting a feel for this new place the same as I would have for any woman I’d been with. And then something changed.  
There was a sudden arc of pleasure, making me squeak in excitement. Like, actually literally squeak. My back arched and my fingers pressed down against my clit. Because I had a clit now. And goddamn did it feel intense. I rubbed it in little circles, biting down on the side of my hand, then pulled my hand away.  
“Holy shit, that’s intense,” I breathed. “I’ll… I’ll come back to that.” My other hand slid down from my face, cupping my breast and squeezing it. I rubbed my nipple against my palm and moaned again.  
“Fuck… really?” I asked my new body, looking down at my breast. I pinched my nipple and tugged lightly at it, then gasped. “Uhhh huh, really,” I confirmed. “I’m one of those girls.” I had met one or two before, although I’d always wondered how honest they were: girls whose nipples were as sensitive as their other lady-parts, or at least nearly so. I rubbed the nipple and the skin around it, moving my other hand back down to my pussy, and let my head drop to the bed.  
It really was overwhelming. Pleasure buffeted me from two directions, boosting itself like well-aimed speakers. My back arched and I moaned like… well, like a virgin. I rubbed and teased at myself faster, feeling a need for more and more, and then before I knew it, I was having my first orgasm.  
It was like breaking apart into a million pieces. For a split second, nothing mattered anymore, just the prolonging of the sensation. My eyes stopped working, my moans trailed off to a breathless squeal, and my fingers lost all sense of rhythm, wildly stroking and rubbing at my breast and crotch. I was aware of a wet squishing sound, but I didn’t care. And then as abruptly as it had overtaken me, the wave broke, leaving me panting, lying in a pool of my own sweat.  
“Holy shit,” I said softly, repeating my new mantra. “Holy… holy shit.”  
I swung my legs down off the bed and pulled myself up to a sit, then got shakily to my feet. I needed a shower, badly.  
The shower was a new adventure in itself. My skin was soft all over, and the water felt amazing streaming down my body. I was starting to wonder if my male body had been six feet of scar tissue and calluses, I was so damn sensitive. Especially “down below”; I rinsed myself off but didn’t dare do much else, as I started feeling excited again at the touch of the soapy liquid.  
I got out of the shower feeling clean, refreshed… almost like myself. Except I wasn’t myself, I hastened to remember. I was… someone else? I threw on a pair of boxers and a white undershirt that hung way too low on my frame, then started to investigate.  
“Shawna Milner,” I said, reading off my driver’s license. It was tucked in my wallet where it should be, and it had a really cute picture of me - of her - trying not to smile too hard. I smiled to myself, remembering how excited I’d been the first time I got my license. If I’d been a girl, I’d have probably looked something like this.  
The address was the same, and my old license was gone. Everything else looked to be unchanged, though; credit cards and business cards all read “Shawn”. I set the wallet aside and sat on the couch, then opened my laptop to check it.  
Nothing much was changed there, either; emails, bank accounts, my identity was totally intact. I opened my work email; obviously I’d have to take a sick day. Maybe a sick week. Or a leave of absence forever. Whatever.  
There was a single new message there, which made sense since it was Saturday and I was “do not disturb” on the weekends. What didn’t make sense was the subject line. I opened it and read the contents.  
  
RE: SHAWNA  
  
Hello, Shawna. You’re no doubt confused. Such is the fate of those who sin, especially those who sin against the Roma.   
Your manhood has long been your most precious possession, your identifying trait. Recently, you used it to sully the body of our clan’s daughter. We have used the seed you gratefully left behind to enact a curse against you.  
We do not wish to see you destitute. You have an identity, a government registration. You will no doubt be able to transfer your assets to your new name and continue living your life for many long years to come, secure in the knowledge that your manhood is forever taken from you.  
  
LYUBITSHKA TOKAR  
  
I stared at the screen, trying to understand. Gypsies? I’d been cursed by fucking gypsies, really? That was a thing? I leaned back on the couch and shook. There was a weird sound filling my ears. After a few seconds, I recognized it: this was what it sounded like when I laughed, now. When Shawna laughed. Hysterically. Gypsies! I slapped the couch and wiped tears from my eyes. A goddamn gypsy curse. Un fucking believable.  
Well, that gave me a goal, at least. It was Saturday morning. I could probably take a week off of work without anyone being too suspicious. So I had just shy of nine days.  
Nine days to find Lyubitshka Tokar, whoever she was. Nine days to get my body back.

3cktq7,3,2015-07-08,"[M/26] Wife is away on a two month internship trip and has ""forgotten"" me",flaccidicus,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3cktq7/m26_wife_is_away_on_a_two_month_internship_trip/,"Let me start of with saying that I hate the long distance thing, and that I am not willing to do it in the long run. But my wife got a good short period (two month) internship, that no one in their right mind could pass on, I support her fully in pursuing it.

I perceive us as a tightly knit couple and we communicate a lot during the day and spend each night cuddled together in front of a series or playing board games. Given that she is abroad we can't really do any of that, but I try to talk to her each day. Some days it's only a couple of minutes and I am OK with that. I am usually the one to try and initiate the contact because I miss her and want to talk to her about what is going back home and I am interested in hearing about the work she is doing.

She has been away for seven weeks now and I get the feeling that has started ""forgetting"" about me more and more as time goes by. It's hard to explain exactly what I mean. I still feel that I want to get in touch with her and and speak to her, but my wife seems to not share that feeling. She doesn't seem to have that same need for connecting with me as I have connecting to her.

She says she has a high workload, and doesn't have the time for long calls, and I believe that They have a reputation of working the interns hard. But we haven't spoken in five days now other than a few (maybe ten altogether) texts. I addition to that I have been low as shit due to other issues the past two days and I have told her via text that I really would need to speak to her. 

This morning she told me that she will would call me later today. She just sent me a text saying she is on a non-work activity and will work late after that. I called her out that and said that if she is so busy she can't call her husband it seems weird she can spare the time to do random activities during the day. She responded that she is heading back to the office.

I feel that she has very little respect for me and prioritizes me very low right now. What's up? Is she just tactless? Egoistic? Am I over reacting? I get a feeling I am not the only person to experience this when an SO is abroad. Do you have any tips on how I might deal with this situation?"
3cl1vr,3,2015-07-08,"My boyfriend [21 M] and I[21 F] have been struggling with communication and individual needs, is it worth still trying?",wanderingwonderingg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cl1vr/my_boyfriend_21_m_and_i21_f_have_been_struggling/,"Long story short: Lets call my boyfriend Ryan. I have known Ryan for about a year and a half, we started dating 7 months ago and everything was great. We had issues, such as my jealousy and perhaps lingering on the past. I worked to get past things, as did he, but still fought about dumb things often. I know much of the fighting was me being immature, but didn't see it as such a huge issue until recently. I've struggled with depression and anxiety in the past and have recently had it come back. I know it was difficult for Ryan to deal with my mood swings and aggressiveness, but he always seemed to not let it phase him. Another notable difference between Ryan and I is that whenever we fight or are mad, I forgive and move past as quickly as possible because I would rather take care of the issue and not let bad vibes linger, Ryan on the other hand needs alot of time to ferment and maybe move past. This difference has always been very difficult, because I often lose, motivation to forgive and move on because hes going to be mad for hours or days. 

Like most men, Ryan is rather unexpressive, but has made great strides in our relationship that he has never done in the past. I am quite expressive and emotional, so when he doesn't tell me how hes feeling in a fight or disagreement, it drives me crazy. I know these are normal struggles, but the issue continues.

After my ~3 weeks of severe depression (not wanting to move, crying often, missing home[am at college for the summer, instead of going home like usual], nausea), I finally was able to go back to my homestate for a week. I was so excited since I always feel refreshed after going home to family and comfort, even though I know I'd miss Ryan. But I figured the refreshed version of me would be good for us. Ryan has recently started an internship at a large accounting firm and is happier there than ever, but I am no where in that happy equation. 

When he picked me up from the airport 3 days ago, I was not happy to be back in this place because I had been missing home, I was excited to see him but lost the feeling when he wasnt there. After a few minutes, I found him but he didnt seem as excited to see me and I didnt have motivation to beg him for the recognition. We got in the car with my sour attitude and after a trecherous journey trying to find an open restaurant after July 4, finally got home. We both laid down far away from eachother and didnt even speak. After a few minutes, I said ""well this is awkward. What are we gonna do about it? Do you want to breakup?"". He said that he didnt want to break up and wanted to be with me. After a few minutes of my badgering him, he whispered, ""I think I do"". He meant he wanted to break up. It hit me hard.

It all hit me and I realized I had gone too far, I couldn't keep pushing him away like this. I begged him to give me another chance so I would fix my jealousy/trust issues. I would accuse him of ridiculous things just because of my past. I realized I couldnt take it out on him and tried to overcome my trust issues. Things seemed to be okay after this but I felt like I couldn't do anything wrong or it would just be over again. It didn't feel like he was there anymore. All I could wonder was that if I hadn't pushed him to say anything about brekaing up, was he going to anyway?

Its been about 3 days since then, and nothing has felt the same. I no longer feel that he cares or puts in effort unless I beg him to. I took off work the day after I got back to spend time with him because it had been a couple weeks since we had quality time together. He said he had to go pick up our washed sheets from his mothers house, but I said no its okay we have other ones. He quickly admitted to having plans with his friends that morning, but I just couldnt understand why it was so important to eat breakfast with his friends when I had been gone for a couple week and we were going through this problem. I wanted it to be back to normal so badly.

Quick side note: we moved in together 2 months ago thinking it would be fine and we could save about $600

I came home that night after work and we discussed but just ended up crying as he looked at me. I felt so empty. Its like everything changed in that one moment the night before. He constantly expressed that he wanted to work this out and be with me. I wanted the same but I don't know what to do anymore. Yesterday morning he said he was sorry for being a dick, and I said okay but then he was quickly irritable again within a fe hours and I was afraid to say anything in fear of making him angry again, but it just hurt so much not to express how much he was hurting my feelings. I would cry and he wouldnt even look at me. I know this is his coping mechanism, he numbs himself to feeling. I just want to know how to bring him out of this so we can focus on the issues that got us here. 

He went to a baseball game with his internship last night so I didnt see him the entire day. He called me before leaving for the game and was interuppted by another call from his friend. I have been waiting all week for today because I knew we both were free this afternoon after work. His friend called him to ask to hang out today. Ryan switched back to me and said he is going to hang out with his friend. While we hadnt explicitly planned our time together today, I thought naturally that he would want to spend time with me today after he had already busy on monday.

**Main problem:** I feel that he is so distant now, I'm worried theres no way to get him back. He keeps saying he is acting normal and wants to be with me, but I just feel no effort or love from him. All I want is simply things like hugs and kisses and consideration, but he only gets mad when I speak up about it. I'm afraid he is in denial about ending things, but he just says that he wants to be with me and work this out, even when I tell him he can be honest. He talks about the new people he meets and says how cool and amazing they are. I just feel scared and threatened. I'm not sure whether to keep fighting for him or to just end it now. 

I know results aren't instant, I have just been begging for some kind of sign that he still cares. I can't just keep going off of his words. I am trying to allow myself to be vulnerable and trust, but I feel only coldness from his actions. All I really want is a full chance for him to let me in again, I know I am at fault for some of this and am trying to be more reasonable, I just need him to let me. For now when we are together, I can tell his mind is not there. It's breaking my heart and hurting me so much, but I know I need to let go if this continues because I am trying with my all.

I'm not sure if I've gotten my problem across, but please ask questions if it will help you help me. 

Also I understand that we are still young, but that doesnt mean this isnt a problem. Whichever way this goes, I'd like to say I tried my best and use my knowledge in the future.

**TLDR**: I've pushed my boyfriend to numbness with my jealous accusations, do I have hope of reconciling?"

We have been ignored, tricked and a load of other noise from this particular estate agency (who I'm really tempted to name, but won't for now) who have delayed our moving in by a week because they ""forgot"" to inform us that the landlord has not responded to them about our offer -- all of which was made aware to us a day before we had to move in, a week after we had been hounding for an update from them. They have not been apologetic and instead have made us chase their tails so that we can finally move into this house without having to commute from God knows where to work. 

On to today: they sent us the tenancy agreement, which is an e-document that we can electronically sign, and told us that we are required to sign it by 12am today if we want the keys to the house. However, they have not received all of the reports from the referees of our guarantors to certify that they are eligible to be guarantors; it's very unlikely that all of this information will be sent by tomorrow. They THEN said that they will withhold giving us the keys if that information is not with them.

My question is this: I would like to sign this agreement now to make sure that our deed is done, but if we do, are we legally bound by the contract? What if one of the referees do not respond in time? Can we not terminate the contract for this reason? Is it even legal for us to sign a tenancy agreement before all of this is done?
 
What exactly can we do? I'm just scared that after all of this, and after they get their reports about the guarantors, they will pop up with some further requirement saying, ""OH, actually, there's also this you need to do,"" which they've been doing for the whole 3 weeks since we started with them. 

We always keep thinking we're done with them but we never are because they're in a rush to finish everything since they delayed so much already.

Thanks!

Now I cant find a job and it's starting to scare me. I had two interviews with two different companies (Sheetz, Sam's Club), and both wanted to hire me. Until my background report came in, that is. I disclosed my record to both companies, so I don't understand why they even interviewed me.

I am also a full-time student, about to start my last semester for an Associates in Computer Information Systems. I need to find an internship to graduate, and I feel like I'm not going to be able to because of some stupid shit I did as a kid.

Not having a job is starting to affect my self-worth. I think I'm starting to get depressed. I just feel useless. Like I'm destined to be nothing more than just a peg in the machine. It's hard to do simple things like get out of bed, or shower.

The pessimist in me is saying that I will have to take a minimum wage job and I'll be there all my life because of my record."

I tend to do dabs, vape, or do snappers and occasionally smoke bowls or blunts with friends. I have been considering quitting for a while now. At first, my plan was to just slow down, which I may have a little, but it hasn't helped me like I thought it would. I still sleep too late and feel like I could be doing a lot more with work and school. I have a couple big motivations to quit, and a couple big obstacles in my way. 

The main reason I want to stop is because I feel like I have so much potential in my life that I'm wasting. I go to a great university and I have a kick ass internship where I have a lot of responsibility and huge potential for the future. Over the past few months, I've found myself being lazy with work and leaving early to smoke or coming in late because I either over slept or smoked when I woke up. Beyond that, I truly hate that I feel like I can't sleep without weed. I don't like that a substance is controlling me and I miss remembering my dreams (I don't know if that's common, but I never remember them when I smoke). The other big reason is money. I love to travel and I work two jobs so I should have money but I always end up buying weed or a fun new piece. I want that to stop. 

The obstacles. For one, (almost) all of my friends smoke. Not all the time, but I'll still be around it a lot. Even my bosses smoke and smoke with me. The biggest reason why I haven't been able to quit is because I enjoy doing it with friends and it's so easy to rationalize that I'm not really doing anything wrong. I'm also scared of trying to sleep the first few nights. The last time I tried to quit I ended up texting my dealer at 330 am because I couldn't sleep and then gave up because I had more weed to smoke. 

I fear that I have a problem with addiction (rather, I know I do). In high school I was addicted to coke and a cheap form of Molly. The only thing that got me away from it was moving in with family 1400 miles away. I smoke cigs and now that I'm 21 I'm finding myself drinking every day. I'm a smart guy with a lot of potential, and I just don't want to to throw it all way. Day 1. Here we go. "

He usually comes up with stupid nicknames for me (his ""partner in crime"", ""tiger"", ""baby cheeks"", ""sugar"", or ""girl on fire""), and I either say ""stop that"" or ""I'm ignoring you."" There is usually some kind of smiling or laughing from his end.

Sometimes he kind of persists, sometimes he doesn't. Today he was joking about me ""letting my hair down"" and ""going out dancing"". I'm usually fairly professional when I'm at the office: I look nice and I try to keep my personal life to myself. I'm a bit sarcastic, but most of the people in the office are and that's the kind of humor that everyone seems to run on.

He actually did say ""y'know what, I'm going to come pick you up, you put on some tight jeans or a dress or somethin, with those boots you're wearin right now would be fine, and Imma take you out dancing"". We've talked about dancing before, and he usually makes jokes about wanting to go out dancing with me (to which I've said ""no"" every time). 

I usually just scoff and tell him off, and I know he's at least partially joking, but I honestly can't tell whether or not he's hitting on me. It doesn't make me uncomfortable per se, but today it angered me enough that I called out early. I try to ignore him and laugh it off when he does that, but I don't know how to phrase it to my boss that I don't want to work with him any more. 

A businessman friend of mine says that it's sexual harassment, but I wouldn't call it that mostly just because it doesn't make me uncomfortable. It just irritates me. He hasn't ever physically touched me except to punch me in the arm once (but that was a friendly/joking type of thing).

What's the best way I ask tell my boss (who is older than the guy I'm working with and is higher up on the hierarchy than him) to not put me with him any more? I understand if people think that the intern is fair game to poke fun at, because I just throw it right back, but I think that my coworker goes a bit far. None of my other coworkers have ever said anything like that.

[[Edit: I am the youngest person in the office by far and it's a very tight-knit group. I don't want to step on any toes or set people against me if they defend him.]]

**tl;dr**: My coworker bothers me and I want to ask my boss to assign me somewhere else."
3clbm1,3,2015-07-08,"My Girlfriend [18 F] is having a really bad time right now, and i need a way to cheer her up.",Rewind13337,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3clbm1/my_girlfriend_18_f_is_having_a_really_bad_time/,"Hey, this is my first Post on Reddit, or even any Forum, ever. So please point out any flaws in formatting.

My Girlfriend and I [18 M] are in a 14-Month Relationship right now.
She has been living in a seperate Home with 9 other Teenagers/Young Adults, who are all having Problems with their Parents, ranging from simply Divorced to completely shunt off.

There are Supervisors helping them along, finding Jobs or Firms to do Internships at, however it usually doesn't work out that way, they're Teenagers afterall. They get 2 Full Weekends in a Month for Sleep-overs, and 2 Days in a Week where they dont have to be at home at 19:00 for Dinner.

She has been living there for the past Five years, which is the longest anyone has lived in that home in perticular. Teenagers can, once theyre 18, freely cancel this, and be completely free.
They won't get any help anymore ofcourse, but the Possibility is there.

As you might expect, they dont have a whole lot of free-time living there. Ontop of that, they need to *request* to have a sleepover, or anything, really. This has been a real issue considering our time we can spend together, but we both accepted it and it has been going decently. We both would like more free-time, and i do my best to be at her place as much as i can (This is my first Relationship, and its still really exiting, after more than a year.), but when they reject an Offer, its quite tragic.
Ofcourse she wont do that, that's 5 Years of her Life wasted if she would. It was planned that she can leave this home, and find her own Apartment once she has a Job, or a Long-Time Internship with a possible job afterwards. She has sent out over 300 Applications, and after 2 Months of waiting, so far only 12 havereplied.

9 Rejections, and 3 Positive Feedbacks (All three of those were 2-Week Internships), She has done 2 of those and is about to start the third one, while still sending out more.

She has been attending school for the past Year, knowing that she wont make it to the next year, yet kept going there, because the certificate still counts for quite a bit.

---

Her Dad is a really abusive father, He used to hit her (when she lived at her Parents house) almost daily, for taking too long on simple tasks, or most of the time just because he wanted to.
She has 3 younger Sisters and 2 younger Brothers, hes abusing them physically. Almost daily. He takes Drugs regularly and is an Alcoholic.

After almost 4 Years She finally decided to stop this and has contacted Authorities to get either her Siblings taken away into a Home like hers, or the Dad. Probably to jail. Its still being decided what's going to happen.

---

One Month ago her Aunt had died, which ofcourse made her really sad, I did the best i could to cheer her up and after a couple of Days, and me taking nearly all of my Freetime to accompany her (Which I do quite a bit), she almost got over it.

A few days later, her other Aunt has been diagnosed with Cancer and her Mother is expected to also have Cancer. 

This completely crushed her. She wouldn't talk to me for a good Week, since she just didnt want to talk about it (She's a really silent person when it comes to mourning over this kind of stuff). 
Ontop of that her Parents dont want to be in Contact with her anymore, they didn't explain why, they live somewhat far away and we can't just visit them to ask them personally. 

I didnt know what to do, i brought her her favorite drink almost daily, tried to get her to talk to me about it, tried to just sit there and be there, just in case she needs me. Even if she didnt acknowledge me, it made her happy and i kept it going, even if it meant for me to spend 3 hours traveling with public transport (i dont have my license yet). 

This eventually made her less sad, and we spent some time together again.
A Week or so has passed, I did my best i could to help her process all this stuff, With Success, yet it still lingered, One does not process this many things at once.

This has been the saddest ive seen her, And i've known her for almost 4 Years now, we were really good friends, even before we dated.

---

2 Days ago, she said she cant take this immense pressure anymore, They (The Supervisors) don't understand how she feels. 
She just wants to cancel the whole thing and be free, but she knows it wont work out the way she wants it to. 

I told her that the worst thing she could do is cancel the Action, and that she needs to look at whats ahead of her. 

Chances are, she gets to live at my House for a Month, for the Duration of the Internship. I live almost next to it and She needs to be there really early in the morning. 
It's also her last hope of getting a legit Job and being able to move out of there.
If she won't get the Job, we dont know what's next.
 
---

I really need help, I dont want her to cancel the measure, i want her to be happy again and ive tried so many things. But I just dont know anymore. Any Comments are Appreciated.

---

---

**TL;DR**: Girlfriend is having a really bad time for the past Month or more, and it just keeps on coming, Our relationship is breaking apart because she doesnt want any help from me and im concerned that she may give everything up to this point up.

3cle64,1,2015-07-08,I’m stranded in Italy and I need to make an urgent itinerary. Tips and advice needed please!,[deleted],travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3cle64/im_stranded_in_italy_and_i_need_to_make_an_urgent/,"Okay! So I need some really urgent help here with my travel plans.

I am in Genoa, Italy right now on an university project that is planned for 6 weeks. It’s almost 4 weeks in and there are some pretty big problems that I won’t go into here but basically, the other interns and I want out. However, I don’t want to waste my last 2 weeks in Europe so I need to come up with an emergency travel plan. I’ve never travelled on my own before which is why I’m trying to get as much advice as possible!

Here are the facts of my situation right now:

-	I am a 20 y.o. girl, currently staying with a host family. They may be able to keep a hold on to my big suitcase so I don’t have to lug it around Europe… that means I will be backpacking with my backpack and maybe a small handheld.
-	I can leave Genoa any time from now 
-	My return trip from Genoa back to Australia is on 26 July which is unfortunately unchangeable (curses, airlines!)
-	I have an Australian passport so I don’t need a visa to go to most European countries
-	I have around 860 euros right now. If need be I could possibly add more to my budget.
-	I am interested in London, Paris, Berlin, Brugges, Vienna, Amsterdam… in that order. I won’t need to go anywhere in Italy because I’ve already been to the major cities on the weekends. Of course, I don't need to visit all the places listed and I'm open to suggestions. Esp budget friendly ones!

So basically, any tips or advice on where to go and what to do from now would be greatly appreciated, especially on travel routes and methods, accom and budget!

3clgts,2,2015-07-08,"Pro tips for new compsci students, from a grad recruited by an in-demand Vancouver startup",[deleted],simonfraser,https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/3clgts/pro_tips_for_new_compsci_students_from_a_grad/,"If your TA or instructor has difficulty communicating in English, this is the time when self studying becomes critical. As /u/TheTrevLife once said, your textbooks and assignments are in English. Don't rely on your TA or instructor; otherwise you'll have wasted $500. (More if you're an international student.)

Get used to searching *everything* on Google or Stack Overflow. In fact, this is part of Rich Vaughan's procedure for asking for help in CMPT 127; it also applies to labs/assignments in other courses:

    1. Read the lab instructions through very carefully.
    2. Think about the instructions.
    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
    4. Google it. Practice formulating questions as searches: this is an incredibly useful skill. Experts do this.
    5. Ask an instructor or TA in the lab and/or during office hours.
    6. Read these notes on getting help then post your questions on our CourSys discussion board.
    7. Do not mail the instructor directly, except about personal and administrative matters.

*Do CSSS FroshWeek!* You'll make great friends and get important networking contacts, in events such as the hallowed RAM'ing Invocation Ceremony (where compsci students pretend that their rituals matter like in Engineering), the co-op luncheon and Late Night Lunacy/Midnight Madness. This year there's also a workshop for new students who have absolutely no experience in programming, using the game making engine Stencyl. While on the subject of CSSS, it's a good idea to get involved with the student society.

A computing science major is not meant to be job training, but a broad education about computing. It is imperative to go to networking events, like the technical career fair (FAS OpFair), the co-op luncheon during FroshWeek, tech employers at SFU Fairs Week in the fall semester, CSSS-organized info sessions for Google and TELUS, etc. **Do this in first year and ask questions about how to get internships/co-ops with companies; get a head start on everyone else.**

Get on the mailing list for SFU's [Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/newsandevents/acm-programming-contest.html); if you're superhuman talented, you can compete in the ACM Programming Contest and get your ass kicked by UBC, UW and UC Berkeley at PacNW regionals; if you're just a mere mortal, you'll still learn a boatload of stuff.

**Contribute to open source software projects!** I can't stress this enough. Mozilla has mentored bugs and ""student projects"". Tinker around with ignored Github projects. /r/cscareerquestions is a great resource to find FOSS contribution ideas. And you'll be eligible for an award administed by /u/Perciva!

Personal projects are also good ideas if your knowledge of algorithms isn't rigorous enough for the big time OSS contributions. You don't have to reinvent the wheel--if you've ever thought ""why doesn't x do y"" in a program, you can write a program that fixes this problem. It can be something that has already been done before. If you really don't have any ideas, you're not alone. Check out the problems on Project Euler. Make a Sudoku solver. Anything you want, really.

**Do all three work terms of co-op.** It might take you five years to complete your degree, but you can compress it into four if you don't take summers off. And don't be afraid to do some work terms in SF or Seattle. They'll pay you way more than Vancouver employers, with free housing. Here are some median internship salaries for 4 month work terms (in CAD)

A Thinking Ape: $20,000

Arista: $20,000

AMZN Vancouver: $22,000

MSFT Redmond: $35,000 

Google (Mountain View): $33,000

Do a capstone. I recommend Google's UCOSP program. It'll teach you distributed programming with teams across Canada. It's so unfair how Engineering Science gets a capstone but Computing Science doesn't.

If you can get into CMPT 373 after your first co-op, take it! You'll learn more about software development methodologies from CMPT 276 like Agile, Pair Programming, etc.

If you want to become a software engineer in test/SDET also take CMPT 473.

Some upper division courses should not be taken with certain instructors:

* 300: Avoid Pearce. He's a nice guy but he doesn't teach enough about operating systems theory to get students attracted to employers. Take it with Vaughan or Fedorova, or in Surrey with Brian Fraser (or Arrvindh Shriraman if you're a masochist).

* 307: Avoid Bhattachayra, take it with Hell, Kabanets or Brad Bart (or Peters in Surrey)

* 310: Avoid Delgrande or Cukierman; Oliver Schulte is a much better AI instructor.

* 320: Fuck this class. I like Chris Bastone but with Pearce it's an easy A.

* 354: Again, avoid Delgrande, as well as Wo-Shun Luk. You'll want Schulte, Ke Wang, Jian Pei, or in Surrey John Edgar.

* 371: DON'T TAKE IT WITH REGAN!!!

* 405: Peters in Surrey. Berenbrink and Krishnamurti suck.

* 471: Hefeeda or Peters in Surrey. Regan and Qianping Gu should not be teaching this course.

NB: Joseph Peters is teaching 405 in Burnaby in the fall. So ""in Surrey"" is a bit of a misnomer. But that's where he usually teaches.

I recommend taking CMPT 354 (databases), CMPT 371 (networking), CMPT 379 (compilers), CMPT 383 (programming languages) CMPT 431 (distributed systems), and CMPT 479 (special topics course in parallel systems) if you want to become a software developer. UBC equivalents are CPSC 304, 317, 411, 311, 416 and 418.

Even though BUEC 232 is an option for the statistics requirement, I highly recommend STAT 270 for a more rigorous grounding in statistics. 

If you want to serious work in Big Data, take CMPT 419 (special topics, machine learning), CMPT 459 (special topics, data mining) and CMPT 413 (natural language processing). I'd also recommend at least some of an advanced algorithms course (405, 441), a systems course (431) or a visualization course (467).

If you want to do research in Big Data, then you should petition to take the graduate-level equivalents of whichever courses you choose: 726, 741, 825, 705, 711, 767 (467). Undergrads are also welcome to enrol in the graduate OS special topics course [""Algorithms in Massive Data"" (CMPT 886)](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~fedorova/Teaching/CMPT886/Spring2012/). You'll need STAT 285 and 350 at the minimum for statistical analysis knowledge. For more rigorous grounding of statistical theory, you can take courses in real analysis (MATH 242 and 320).

Speaking of research, there are plenty of research opportunities at SFU:

* Visit graduate research labs

* Do a 1 or 2 semester research project (CMPT 415/416, or CMPT 498)

* SFU work study under a faculty member (Example from [Oliver Schulte](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~oschulte/undergraduate-funding.html))

* NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA)

Pure math courses that may be of interest to Computing Scientists are: MATH 340/341 (Algebra II and III), MATH 342 (Number Theory), MATH 345/445 (Graph Theory), MATH 447 (Coding Theory), MACM 401 (Computer Algebra), MACM 442 (Cryptography), MACM 416 (Numerical Analysis II; differential equations and the like). And whatever you do, don't take MATH 440 or 441.

If you have an aptitude for mathematical rigour, take the honours linear algebra course MATH 240 instead of the applied linear algebra course for Engineers, MATH 232.

Get some experience with electronics. The Computer and Electronics Design minor is an option; however, if you want to keep your grades up for grad school or scholarships, there are plenty of MOOCs (Coursera, EdX, MIT, etc.) where you can learn electronics theory. Who knows, it may help you in the future.

And that's it. If you have any suggestions or corrections let me know. 

Congratulations to new SFU Compsci students and remember: It's not about making video games, and you probably won't become the next Gates or Zuckerberg. If that's all you want, check out the Software Systems major (which is less mathy and rigorous than compsci) or SIAT for experience in gamedev."

Here is what she used:
Matchmaster 1.0
Mineralize Concealer  NW15
MSF - Medium (not sure what MSF is)
Powder blush - Harmony (used it to give color to my cheeks and as a bronzer for contouring)

I am about to begin a teaching internship and would like to look put together and professional. The makeup the stylist did was perfect because I didn't look overly made-up and I felt I still looked natural with a little more oomph. Should I buy the MAC products? What other products are worth looking into? I do have an oily t-zone and get the occasional pimple, other than that my skin is pretty normal. I want to buy foundation, concealer, setting powder, blush/bronzer, eyebrow stuff, brushes, and a everyday moisturizer.

3clqdt,6,2015-07-08,[F4M] The Intern [Workplace],intheofficefun,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3clqdt/f4m_the_intern_workplace/,"I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom). 

There will be a fair amount of build-up here, lots of flirting and what not, but make sure your character doesn't come off too strong. I expect a lot of detail, and I will tell you if you do not provide enough. I would like consistency with that detail as well.

3clrcq,1,2015-07-08,Crush on girl (18F) that I (18M) might never see again,[deleted],askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/3clrcq/crush_on_girl_18f_that_i_18m_might_never_see_again/,"I went to high school with this girl. She's a year behind me. I was kind of a nerd in high school. Had friends and did well in school but rarely talked to girls.  She is really smart, popular and way too pretty to be with someone like me. I've always had a crush on her, and now I'm about to start my second year of college (my state school). She's about to go to a different part of the country for college.

I think she's out of my league because I've never really been confident about my looks. Since going off to school, I've become more confident about other things but definitely not my appearance.

I'm miserable at making advances with girls because I have this thing where I am really careful not to show that I like a person. Probably a mix of being reserved and having a bit of an ego. I'm also really self conscious and don't have a lot of confidence in myself in that particular area. 

My only contact with her now is the place we both lifeguard at. I used to work there a lot, but internships in the last two summers have made it so that I only really work there every other weekend or so.

As far as speculating if she likes me back, I guess I have no idea. She's not very flirty, and most of my conversations with her have been just polite talk about school or mutual friends. She once told me I should date this girl we both know, which I said no to. I'm not good at reading people, so for all intents and purposes, let's just assume that there's a 10% chance of her liking me back.

She lives within walking distance of my house, so it's not as though she's disappearing forever. It's just that neither of us will probably visit each other's schools or see each other again unless we're the ones facilitating that.

I'm just wondering what I can do in the way of establishing a connection or indicating to her that I like her. "

3clxd2,4,2015-07-08,Interesting tax tool for drivers,[deleted],UberDriver,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberDriver/comments/3clxd2/interesting_tax_tool_for_drivers/,"Hey people, totally not trying to spam your lovely community, but I wanted to share a little intern project we’re kickstarting over at Intuit Labs (makers of TurboTax and QuickBooks) that some of you might find very useful.

We’re basically emulating the tax withholdings process that regular employees get on their paycheck. Bottom line, you don’t have to manually set aside and save this money yourself anymore. We’re offering withholdings and a streamlined tax product along with a tax-refund experience. Check it out, and definitely let me know if you have any feedback.

3cml9k,2,2015-07-08,Having a hard time [21M] giving this girl [20F] space.,diabolusk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cml9k/having_a_hard_time_21m_giving_this_girl_20f_space/,"Real fast background story.

I liked this girl for a year and a half, and in my eyes I ended up loving her. I love her personality and her attitude, and I always hoped she'd be able to teach me how to be more like her. We hung out a pretty good amount and when school ended she broke up with her boyfriend. I came over in over-eagerness a week after it happened, swooped her up, and left for 7 months for my internship across the country.

The first month of the LDR felt like bliss. Sure we couldn't hang out, but we talked a ton and I felt like we were really connecting. She admitted she fell for me, and felt like I was everything she wanted in the relationship. And the time we spend talking just confirmed how I felt about her.

So a couple weeks ago, she found info on my interest in satanism (nothing crazy) and it shattered the honeymoon phase for her. She insists I've done nothing wrong and I've told her I'm not a satanist, but our communication was a fourth of what it was. I got really insecure because even though nothing was wrong, I felt like I was being punished. She seemed to not put nearly as much effort into talking to me, so I couldn't help but feel weird.

The lessened communication continued until last Thursday. I texted her saying I needed her to tell me she could commit. This frustrated her because I made her feel like she owed me things that she doesn't. She never said she committed to me, and she didn't know enough about me to make a decision. The thing is is that she's correct. I came over and confused her, and we ended up going way too fast because of it. I should have approached the situation with the way she feels in mind more, but I got eager and just wanted to swoop her up before I left for 7 months, which is not fair.

I texted her again Monday, saying that I was sorry and that I wanted to support her as a friend since that's what we started out as. She sort of said she appreciated it, but came back with two very big questions. First question is, why did I choose to go on a co-op so far away? Right before I left and before she broke up, I told her that I took an internship far away so that I could get away from her. She asked me about it awhile ago and I told her that I didn't leave because of her. So I admitted this time that I didn't leave because of her, but I tried to take advantage of the situation and told her otherwise. She just said ok, next question.

The other question she asked was, why did I love her so much? I tried telling her, her behavior, the way she treats the people she cares about, and I loved spending time with her. She thought this was enough to induce a crush, but not love. I don't know, I've spent over a year observing her, I thought I had a pretty good idea of who she was, but she was having a hard time understanding where my love for her came from.

So the last thing she said was, now is not the time and space is better for now. I may not have described her very nicely, but she's an amazing person. I really wanted this to work out. I'll be back in her city in January. She has mentioned that if the timing is right we can try being in love the right way, but maybe the last conversation ruined that for her.

I just hope she remembers how I made her feel during our good month of LDR. I hope she remembers how I feel about her, and how she felt about me while we talked so intimately. I have to give her space now, but should I move on? Does it seem like she's over me? I already had a plan of messaging her something nice and non-clingy before school started, but to hold off for the next month and a half. Just based off what I wrote, does this seem hopeless?

TLDR; Girl told me I needed to give her space, does that mean it's the end? How should I move forward?"
3cmmmg,12,2015-07-08,I am just really happy right now :),ayvyns,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3cmmmg/i_am_just_really_happy_right_now/,"I have had depression since I was a teen, which only got worse in college when I couldn't figure out what to do. I was in a downward spiral until I met my current boyfriend, who kept me sane throughout my senior year. I don't think I could have made it without his love and companionship. 

Fast forward two years, after a job I couldn't handle, more school, and a lot of emotional issues, I got lucky. I landed a paid internship at a surgical office that offers a ton of valuable experience that I'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. The work is difficult because I'm new, and I love it and look forward to coming in every day. And not only *that*, I have an interview lined up for a position in a hospital, as a direct result of my efforts last year to make a good impression and be likeable in class.

It's the little things too, like figuring out my skin routine and makeup, and organizing things more efficiently, that make everyday life so much better.

Our relationship is in a fun phase again. Last year and a half, we were tired and just focused on getting through each day. This year we laugh and get out more. Instead of hating myself or worrying about the future, I use that energy to find ways to make him happy instead.

I feel really lucky and thankful to be where I am today. "
3cmrcb,2,2015-07-08,"Me, a suicidal college dropout [21F] with my Grandpa [80]; he insults my boyfriend for not having a job/place to live right out of college.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cmrcb/me_a_suicidal_college_dropout_21f_with_my_grandpa/,"I'm so mad I'm shaking while typing this on my phone so bear with me.

April 2015 I decide to take some time off school because I'm too depressed to go to class or even get out of bed. I move out of my apartment and into my grandparents house. They only live 15 minutes away from my college. I was reluctant at first and tried to find another place to stay but they insisted. Cool, right? No rent, home cooked meals, hanging with my fam? Awesome. No internet but that's ok. It's great for the first two and a half months. I m barely there since I spend most of my time at my boyfriends place. He already lived with nine people, otherwise I'd be living with him full time. He was still a student at our university and was just about to graduate in June. He's very supportive of me and everything I do. He understands my depression and supported my choice to take time off. 

so the ides of June roll around and both my boyfriend and I are trying to find jobs and a place to live in LA. Our majors are film/theatre so that's the best place for us to get into the biz. Unfortunately these tracks are really competitive (like everything these days), so he only finds an unpaid internship (it's very promising tho and likely to lead to a job.) he is plugging away everyday, working really hard so we can live together. (I have major depression and holding a job is really hard for me. I'm getting some aid like food stamps and medi cal but nothing for housing.) Boyfriend is currently staying with his dad and stepmom in a tiny studio apartment in Venice beach. They would have me there too but there really is NO room. This whole time we've been trying to find a place to live. It's hard since we are both unemployed and most places require proof of employment to rent, plus credit checks and yadda yadda. We're really just dead in the water at the moment but we really are trying. 

Grandpa suddenly decides that us trying is not good enough. He suddenly decides he wants to sell the house and start remodeling everything so it's time for me to go. He just doesn't understand how hard it is. He doesn't get the depression thing. He grew up in east Germany and was on the run from the Russians and the nazis and shit when he was a kid. It was definitely harder than anything I've ever been through, of course. He's very smart and has never had trouble getting work. He constantly complains about young people getting out of school and not knowing how o do things and not being immediately good at their jobs. 

Anyway, he told me last week that I needed to get out soon and I was like ok I'll go stay with my mom (she lives about forty minutes north of grandparents house). So I packed a bag and went to stay with her for a week. I only came back today to my grandparents so I could get some more medication (antidepressants that I am very dependent on). I was only going to stay tonight and then head back up to my moms tomorrow. 

I come out of my room to use the bathroom and my grandpa calls me over. ""Hey kiddo!"" He has a pretty thick German accent. But not scary German like christoph waltz in inglorious bastards, more like christoph waltz in django unchained. Usually Anyway. Now it's scary. He starts asking how the house hunt is going and I begin to answer, throwing my hands up in defeat. He doesn't give me time to talk and he starts yelling. ""no don't give me that! Did you find a place or didn't you? If that boyfriend of yours really liked you he would have found a place and a job by now so he could support you. It's not that hard to get a job. Your grandma and I traveled all the way from Germany as we got a house and a job. We put all our plans on hold for you and it's been three months. Your boyfriend should have taken you with him. He's not a real man..."" Blah blah blah old man shit that is so outdated it's shameful. He goes on like this for a few minutes. My grandma is sitting right there letting him say all this, even though it's obviously very upsetting to me. I'm so stunned I don't respond. He chides, ""it's okay to respond!"" As if I wanted to even look at him after the things he just said to me. I choke out ""if I talk to you right now I'll just scream or cry"" so I grab my purse and phone and run out of the house. I can't help but sob as I'm running away. 

I power walk it down to this big park close to their house and am currently sitting on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean. I've been here for a few hours. I called my boyfriend and cried to him. He doesn't really care about my grandpas opinion but he is distressed that I'm distressed. He calmed me down a lot so I wouldn't jump off the cliff or hurt myself. Then I called my mom and she is so angry at my grandpa that she won't even call him to tell him off. She told me to get back in my car and come back up to her house but I left all my stuff (car keys, wallet, etc) at the house. Also I really need my medication and it won't be ready til tomorrow. 

I dunno. Typing this out I realize I acted pretty irrationally. But I feel he's being really unfair about this. I offered to pay rent and stuff when I first moved in but they didn't want me to. Told me to save my money. He only JUST mentioned to me he wants to sell the house and remodel. I left for a week to give them some space and only came back to get medication so I don't, like, kill myself. The part that gets me the most is he knows I'm at a really low point in my life. I didn't want to drop out of college. I don't want to be a dead beat. I'm constantly considering ending my own life to save everyone the trouble of dealing with me. And yet he has the gall to say these things to me, knowing how easily I'm upset. He didn't even try to be nice or sympathetic. And my grandma, who is more understanding about my situation and told me not to worry, I'm not kicked out of the house (she said this last week) just let him say these things to me.

I really don't want to go back to face them right now so I'm just sitting here in the dirt. 

I probably seem pretty childish for reacting so emotionally. I guess that I am. Any advice would be amazing. 

Tl;dr: grandpa is old and wise and I am young and stupid. Boyfriend is apparently a loser for not being immediately successful right after graduating.

3cmyg1,0,2015-07-08,My life is changing and I don't know if it's for the better of worse,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3cmyg1/my_life_is_changing_and_i_dont_know_if_its_for/,"In this past year I went to my first year away at college. It was great. Now I'm home for the summer. 

I had a very small, very close knit group of friends throughout high school. I had a best friend (let's call him D), 3 really close friends (M, A, L), and 3 friends I would hang out with occasionally who I consider to be more than acquaintances. (J, LD, MB)

In the past couple of weeks I feel like I've been losing control of some of the aspects of my life that I've found comfort in throughout the past. Firstly, I work an 8-5 internship every day. So that leaves very little time to try and schedule time to spend with said friends. Secondly, my friends D, LD, MB, and J are all living away from home this summer working as well. We don't go to the same schools so you can see why I feel like I've had limited contact with them. 

I haven't been around a single person that isn't a coworker or family for about a month now. My general routine of the day is to wake up, run, go to work, come home, eat, run, sleep, repeat until the weekend. Well recently I tried to make some plans with my friends for the weekend and they said (jokingly) that I have too many responsibilities for them. This hurt. A lot. I know it was supposed to be a joke, but when you're consumed with loneliness for the past month when I'm accustomed to having a great support group of friends to back me up it's hard to differentiate between the two. 

Furthermore, friend D and I are the type of people who won't contact each other for months and then resume friendship as soon as we get back together. I know this is not the greatest thing to do, and recently I've been trying to change that. I've been contacting him and I've been trying to schedule a time for us to get together at his place at his school for a weekend. Whenever I contact him I feel as though he doesn't want me to come up to meet him unless something 'fun' is going on at his house. In recent months he's told me that he's been experimenting with drugs. If he wants to do that, then that's great and I won't stop him. That is however something that I don't want to mix myself up with because of NCAA violation stuff. So now when I do get to hang out with him I feel as though our interactions will be reduced down to stereotypical college 'bangers' which require the use of drugs to have fun for the most part. I'm fine with drinking but apparently a lot of the people he surrounds himself with don't drink and strictly do drugs. Or so I'm told. 

Our whole childhood as best friends was epitomized through being able to make fun out of the most boring situations. I also understand that people tend to grow apart which I feel like what is happening here. However this is making me have a hard time with living at home, because with a lack of the security blanket of a best friend as well as having friends who poke fun at you trying to make plans with them tends to amplify the feelings of loneliness. 

Two of my good friends are still in highschool: L and M. During the year I was gone, they had to make a new group of friends seeing as friend D and I were their most quintessential part of their group of friends. Because of this, I rarely see them and when I do they often leave to join their other group of friends. And I also understand that. I've come to therms with the fact that they've found other people and we've grown apart in the time I was gone.

This probably isn't the most coherent of posts because this is the first time I'm able to put what I'm feeling to words. I feel abandoned to an extent, but not on purpose by the people who I consider to be my friends.  From a lack of being in our hometown to growing apart to ditching me for other friends, I just feel as though I've lost a little bit of who I am that I invested in these other people. I also feel sort of lost, and as if I don't belong where I am right now. I think I might have a mild case of depression, I'm not sure and don't care to check. It's nothing that getting away from all of this won't fix. 

I think the worst part of this situation is that next summer, I plan on staying down in my collegetown for the summer with a job and taking a possible summer class or two. My parents however want to see me during the summer, but if I do move down to school it would be difficult. My home is approximately a 10 hour train ride from my school and I wouldn't be able to just come home on weekends because of this. This would ultimately put a strain on the relationship I have with my family. Also, next summer my brother would not be around in the house as he is moving out. So it would just be my parents and myself. 

I'm stuck between wanting to maintain my mental well being in the coming future and wanting to make my family happy (which consequently has an effect on my mental well being). 

38 days until I move back to school.

3cnb1k,1,2015-07-09,My (21F) SO (22 M) of 3 years is 'checked out' and wants to be friends while he thinks things through,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cnb1k/my_21f_so_22_m_of_3_years_is_checked_out_and/,"Background: My SO, let's call him Chris, and I met in the first two weeks of college, and have been together ever since, about 3 years. We got together right after my family split up (Dad was arrested and put in the psych ward for his alcoholism, parents divorced) but he helped me through it happily. After some rough patches here and there, mostly me having anger issues about my Dad, we started to work things out. Then my Dad died this past October. Again, it was rough for a while, but for the past 5 months things have been pretty good for me. On our 3 year anniversary, Chris gave me a promise ring. While I don't want to get married for a really long time and don't want to have kids, I was so happy that I'd get to spend my life with my best friend - This is all important for later.

Chris started acting out of character about 4 weeks ago. He is currently interning across the country for the summer (no biggie, he did so last year and we had no problems) and when I came to visit him I picked up on his different behavior and asked him about it a few days in. He told me he had lost the vision of us in the future together and that if we stayed together I would wake up in 5 years and be very unhappy - I understood, as I have a strong desire to travel a lot and perhaps work internationally, but I thought that I had been very clear that I was in our relationship for the long haul. It was a really rough few days - I did my best to assure him that I want to spend my life with him, that he was what I wanted in life, and he eventually realized that he had given himself the idea that I would eventually leave him for a job abroad - which I would never ever do!!

So at this point I thought we were fine. I was pretty insecure about our relationship for the next week or so, but nothing that I couldn't get past and make sure that it didn't affect our relationship to badly. After I left and came home, things just got worse. When we usually text a lot everyday, especially since being long distance, he would send one word answers; when we skyped he was irritated; things like that. I knew something was off so I asked him about it.

This is where the ""checked out"" part comes in. He tells me he's burnt out and not ""in love"" with me anymore. While he stills loves and cares about me, and I'm still his best friend, and the sex is great, he's just checked out. He said that whole previous future conversation was just him finding an excuse for why he feels the way he does.

And the thing is, I totally get it. Re: the shit in my life that has happened. I have lots of baggage, but I have always told him that I don't expect him to have to deal with my issues - he always stuck through it. I myself had a moment of ""do I even want this"" last year - but I stuck through it. 

Chris just gave up. After giving me a promise ring 3 months earlier, just gave up. We broke up for a day last week, but I was in such heartbreak and I called him saying I couldn't not have my best friend in my life. He said he was being an idiot and that he had made a big mistake, and that he wanted me in his life, but that he needs to think about what he wants and needs. Technically, we are talking and are exclusive, which we made clear.

I know he needs a friend right now so that's what I'm doing. We text, have had a few phone calls, no skype. He was my rock for so long, I can be his friend now. But I am in so much pain and heartbreak, and it's so hard to even get through the day. His internship is also stressing him out so he doesn't have much time to talk. I know I can do nothing, essentially. I have to wait and see what he feels. How do I get through this? I just feel helpless, hopeless, and such intense sadness.

And for those who say leave him (like my mother), I don't think I could. He is literally my best friend and I love him so fucking much that I know I'll stay if there is even one tiny minuscule shred of hope left.

TL;DR: SO of 3 years is not ""in love"", although still cares - wants to be friends while he thinks about what he wants and needs"

The signal blanketed the Northern Hemisphere for 24 hours. Repeated in 10 languages, in morse and ASCII. Initially panic, then a widespread assumption of prankery. Less suicides than you'd think. Earth's median feeling was giddy uncertainty. A movie deal was made.

A week later, an amateur astronomer noticed an anomaly above Mercury. ""Big Shiny Thing"". His words. Radio signals were sent. No response. The Hubble was pointed at it. 100 km across. Changes on Mercury's Surface. An ESA probe on intercept course for an L4 asteroid was redirected.

Two weeks later, the probe lost contact.

**I WOULD PREFER YOU DID NOT WATCH.**

Some on Earth viewed this as an act of war. Interstellar War. There was much posturing in the news, which ultimately fizzled. Plans were drawn up, not publicly of course, for a swarm of nukes to be launched simultaneously from all over Earth. Nobody in charge seriously thought this would happen, but it felt good to have the plans in a drawer somewhere.

A probe from the Chinese Space Agency originally intended for the moon launched two months after the arrivial of what most now called The Visitor. It, too, lost contact after passing the orbit of Venus.

A coalition of the governments more impatient than uncooperative had a summit, then began construction of a large laser assembly, whose original purpose was to shoot down ICBMs.

Two comedy programs, one in Arabic, and one in English, featured The Visitor in a regular segment, providing commentary on Earth news. Neither could come up with a satisfying physical depiction, so they both chose a deep, booming voice emanating from the sky.

Mercury's surface albedo increased uniformly and dramatically. The Visitor started in a polar orbit, then switched to equatorial, then went out to Mercury's L2. A year 2 astrophysics question was calculating the energy required.

The laser assembly finished ahead of schedule. Precision mapping attempts of The Visitor based on laser scattering returned inconsistent, nonsensical results.

**THAT TICKLES. SCANNING US IS FUTILE. WE SUGGEST YOU DIRECT YOUR RESOURCES ELSEWHERE.**

Comedians found this hilarious, depicting The Visitor as an alien embarrassed it showed up to space school with its pants down. There was debate over whether astronauts should be kept on the International Space Station. The astronauts won.

**PLZ USE THE LASER TO SEND THIS WIKIPEDIA WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT.**

While a sub-committee of the laser committee was attempting to schedule a group call to discuss the correct response, an intern wrote some code to modulate the lasers' amplitude with an uncompressed copy of Wikipedia. This went live as the intern misunderstood an instruction from her supervisor, and was sacked briefly, then reinstated and put in charge of signaling.

**WE APOLOGIZE. THE USE OF ""FUTILE"" IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT WAS NOT THE BEST CHOICE, GIVEN ITS APPARENT CONNOTATION IN POPULAR CULTURE. WE PROMISE WE'RE GOOD. WINK.**

Four years passed. Second-rank universities started to offer programs in Visitor studies, which were such a  draw for top minds that first-rank universities grumblingly added their own. The Visitor settled into an unstable orbit between Mercury and Venus in year two. A Broadway musical, featuring a glowing light as the visitor and two actors in spherical costumes representing the planets in a ham-fisted love triangle, sweeped the Tonies. Most spaces agencies held off plans for probes to the inner solar system, but funding flourished, and several were sent to the asteroid belt. NASA launched a probe, cleverly on the opposite side of The Visitor from the sun until the last possible moment. It, too, went dark.

The Visitor's changes to Mercury had been a serious field of study by this point. Filaments criss-crossed all over its surface.

The original Wikipedia transmission had long finished. The former intern figured out a protocol for concisely communicating recent changes, and linked it in The Visitor's article (an obvious spot). After English, Wikipedia was transmitted in every language available. Serious attempts at a pure pictorial Wikipedia led to a few theses.

**CHECK OUT THIS SHIT.**

*(This message recieved in every human language that had been transmitted to The Visitor, including Tolkien Elvish and Klingon. And, in a move that was confusing to many, a bitmap diagram of the inner solar system with ""Check Out"" at the top, and ""This Shit"", and the bottom, in white block text on black.)*

Mercury suddenly slowed down. Due to orbital mechanics, it then accelerated towards the sun.

Calculations showed that Mercury, after passing the sun, was on an intercept course for Venus. No, wait, a near miss. Six months later, as Mercury approached its big sister, it slowed. Surveys indicated the filaments exerted massive force on the planet itself. At Mercury's closest point with respect to Venus, it pulled away a considerable chunk of the excessive Venusian atmosphere. The Visitor worked in overtime, never in a stable orbit, forming part of a Mercury-Venus-Visitor dance. Venus' long day sped up. A new space telescope caught images of Venus' surface, its clouds now thinner, and saw the same filaments.

Over the next year, The Visitor's apparent tinkerings with the new Mercury-Venus binary planet slowed in frequency. Venus' diurnal rotation sped up, and the distance between it and Mercury stabilized to where Venus sat safely within Mercury's magnetic field, lacking one of its own. The outgassing of Venus' atmosphere was an order of magnitude greater than what could be explained by the presence of Mercury alone, and most of that atmosphere ended up on Mercury, which was far too convenient. Mercury and Venus were having their worse parts, in terms of habitability, cancelled out. The filaments dissolved, until they were no more than scars on the planets' surfaces.

**HERE IS A GIFT. YOU ARE WELCOME. WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN, BUT NOT TOO SOON, AND AS FRIENDS. GOOD LUCK, AND HAVE FUN. WE HAVE MORE ERRANDS TO RUN.**

The Visitor accelerated violently south, from Earth's perspective, and after passing slightly more than 5 AU from the sun, disappeared in a puff of gamma radiation.

A little more than a year ago I met this guy when he did an internship in my country. He were only there for three months and then he had to go back. We decided to try anyway and we had a few amazing months together before we started the long distance relationship. And it went surprisingly well... It was hard for me, but also lots of fun. It took only an hour by plane to visit each other, so it wasn't that bad. It was super exciting to travel so much and experience a new culture, language and all that. I believe it was harder for me, but he taught me to enjoy our time together and not focus on the distance or our time apart. And I started to really love this kinda relationship. 
We were each other's first real relationship and I was madly in love. I still am. A few months ago he told me he was in doubt. I already started to imagine how a break up would feel, but he told me he wasn't gonna break up and that we were gonna work through it. 
We've seen each other every month since he moved back, but these past few months have been busy for both of us. So we didn't see each other for more than a month. It was hard, but I could manage. 
I went to visit him a few weeks ago and it was literally the greatest week ever. I was so happy, so in love. Also when I got back home id have one day before going on a holiday with my family. So saying goodbye this time wouldn't be the hardest. 
The last day we had planned a day together, only me and him and I was looking forward to it. But then it happened... He told me that he was in doubt again, but this time it wasn't only doubt. He was sure, he didn't want it anymore. He was tired of the distance. But the thing is. He loves me but he's just tired of the distance and also scared because he's still young. He's the type of person who wants to experience everything. He's always super busy and I was never really his first priority. But I really didn't mind. When we were together I was happy. 
Now my question to you is, how do I get over this guy? I'm still so in love and I can't believe that such a big part of my life is taken away from me. Not just him, but the visits, his friends, family and everything. He wants to still see each other, but I don't see how that'll work out. I think I need to see him at least one more time for closure and to get my stuff that I left there. But I'm not sure we can be friends, since I'm still in love with him. 
I know we were each other's first relationship but it was somehow really mature and good. We are both 21 and I know we have so much to experience still. I feel like ""setting him free"" is what I'm supposed to do, but it's really not easy. 
Please I need advise. 
Feel free to ask questions. "

There were about 8 in my batch and there was only one other Indian guy. We all had a cubicle mate, and mine was the Indian guy (straight from India). 

Midway in our internship, my cubicle mate, the Indian guy, got a different assignment and he moved to a different part of GE.  We then had a little turnover with some of our colleagues moving to different parts and new colleagues coming in. One new guy in my team was also a Desi guy. He was American born like me, and guess what? He became my cubicle mate even though there were other places for the secretary to put him. 

I realize that upstate NY isn't South Carolina, but the secretary lady on both occasions made sure that I shared a cube with an Indian. 

Also, if you go to one floor of one building there, you'll see that 100% of the people there are Indian programmers like they're being segregated the way I was.

So even though I thought I was an interesting American who saw beyond my indianness, the white culture doesn't honor my views or for my aspirations of a post-racial America.

And so, as the results turn in today. She was not included in the final roll of passers. So I'm here in front of the computer, hearing her sobs from the bathroom. Mom is in the study, Papa is in the garage, my other sister and younger brother is in the sala; all trying to suppress our sobs, too. We couldn't really confront her about it because I think she needs her space first, but we could hear her saying "" God, Mom and Papa, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I could've done better... etc...etc."" 

Sigh.

EDIT:

Thank you so much guys. People have said the Internet will make us lonely. On my worst days I believe this, but more often than not, people like you prove those people wrong.

I think everything's settling down now as my younger sister was able to make her join us in the dinner table today plus Papa was able to crack a joke, so. everything can be healed by a night of corny jokes and food, i promise!

I've been on the apartment hunt for weeks now and I am set on living in the Wicker Park area. It seems like I could find a better deal if I got a roommate rather than trying to find a 1 BR/Studio. Some things I would like are in unit W/D, hardwood floors, close to CTA, may be dog friendly. (I'm obsessed with exposed brick, so if by the off chance, I can find one of those with a good price that would be the dream!)

A little about myself:
I am a recent graduate from Oklahoma and moved to Chicago for an internship. I am a creative graphic designer so ideally I would love to live with someone who shares the same creative drive. I am clean, a non-smoker, 420 friendly and occasionally likes to have a few beers/mixed drinks. I am total night owl as well. I would describe myself as an extroverted introvert. I like to go out and socialize, but I occasionally like to spend time alone to reenergize.

I am looking for someone who is looking for the same. Must be open minded, LGBT friendly, etc. Female or Male doesn't matter to me. Prefer to be early 20's as well. 

I'm looking to pay anywhere between $700-1000

So I just got a call from a close friend saying he feels like his relationship is close to the end and I'll be meeting him in an hour to talk. A bit of background:

They've been together for 2 1/2 years, but mostly a long distance relationship. Met at university, he dropped out, but she continued. She went to France for a full year and for the last year has been back in the UK, but has been busy with an internship at Honda so they haven't seen each other much.
They were meant to move in together in September this year, but her father has said no, not until they're married, due to cultural differences. (Her family is Vietnamese). They will however be in the same city at least as of September when she goes back to Uni for her final year.
They've been on and off a few times, but only for a day at the max.
She's gone back to France now for a month but will be back at the beginning of August.

So the catalyst of it all came about last night. She said she was going to the beach and said she would text him when she got there, (this was at night, like 9pm). He didn't get a text from her until midnight saying 'sorry, I forgot to text you'. He's been stewing all day and has called me now saying he wants to meet and talk as he feels like the relationship is at its end.

Ultimately, I feel as though they've been heading this way for a while now, but I'm unsure if I should be going in as supportive, telling him that it'll all be alright and she'll be back in the UK at the beginning of August, or honest, telling him that I don't feel like it's worked for a while and he should consider potentially ending it.

What would you all suggest?

3cowhf,1,2015-07-09,Hidden Arcana: Developer Spotlight on Sean Hughes - Text version.,Silveress_Golden,Silveress_corner,https://www.reddit.com/r/Silveress_corner/comments/3cowhf/hidden_arcana_developer_spotlight_on_sean_hughes/,"Hi, I’m Anatoli Ingram, and welcome to Hidden Arcana, where we’ll give you an inside look at some of the people and processes behind the creation of _Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns™_. This week, I spoke to Game Designer Sean Hughes about how he got his start in game development, the projects he’s working on at ArenaNet, and what beetles have to do with event design!

Sean started making mods for his favorite games when he was fourteen. After hearing a motivational speech in his senior year of high school about turning passions into new lines of work, he began seriously considering game design as a career. He studied at DigiPen Institute of Technology, and in his senior year became an intern at ArenaNet. His first responsibility was to help iron out bugs on the Skills team. Sean also worked on the mesmer’s elite specialization, the [chronomancer](http://ift.tt/1GKEhDV).

Sean was offered a full-time position at ArenaNet following his internship, and he moved to working on maps for _Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns_. While creating content for the game was much different than his previous work on skills, the skills and combat systems of _Guild Wars 2_are so pervasive throughout the game that his experience proved useful. Players have skills, creatures have skills, and even bundles and objects can have skills; knowing how they work helps him make the best use of them.

[](//d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/f7a0aNuhoch-Village.jpg)

Event creation is Sean’s primary responsibility. He described the process of creating an event in one of the Maguuma Jungle maps, which came to him after he saw the [Nuhoch hylek](http://ift.tt/1czb9lW) using their massive tongues to grab and toss insects. Sean thought it would be fun if players could do the same thing, and so he came up with an event that would make use of the ability to toss bugs around with wild abandon.

The premise of the event is that the players’ allies want to raise beetles to serve them, but they lack the necessary bugs to fuel the process. It’s the players’ responsibility to collect creepy-crawlies, but it’s not as simple as picking them up or escorting them to their new homes. Instead, the event requires players to use control abilities to push and throw beetles onto capture points.

Events are built around one concept that makes them stand out, and in this case, Sean wanted to have players use control abilities to accomplish objectives. The first step was to build a prototype of the event from start to finish and determine whether the concept worked in action; concepts that initially sound good can end up being either too complicated, a poor fit for the game, or simply not fun. If the prototype seems promising, the next step is to invite fellow developers to playtest the event. Feedback was mixed: throwing beetles back and forth was fun, but the event was too easy and lacked tension, so Sean raised the stakes by adding enemies to harass the beetles and their would-be herders.

[](//d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/f7a0aNuhoch-Village.jpg)

Feedback is an important part of content development, but it can be challenging to use effectively. Sean said that feedback sometimes correctly identifies an issue, but not the right solution. An event may also be working as intended, but the goals and objectives may not be communicated correctly to the player. Interpreting the meaning of feedback is just as important as gathering it.

Sean said that his love of video games derives from the endless possibilities they provide for doing the impossible. As a gamer himself, he wants players who choose to spend their free time in _Guild Wars 2_—and the events he’s designed—to have the best experiences he can create.

background on me: I'm a 20 year old male who has consistently looked 3-4 years younger than my actual age because of a baby face, being only 5'6"", and being relatively thin. That said, I am fairly confident that I’m a handsome guy

The saga begins when I fell for my female best friend (A) in high school, and got friendzoned when I told her so. I was a beta kissless virgin at the time who had put A on a platinum pedestal, and fully believed the trope about ""being persistent”; she had contributed to my naiveté by feeding me such tropes like ""you'll find a girl and make her super happy"", ""you'd make a great boyfriend"", etc., so I didn't let it go and basically got shamed by everybody, male and female, friends and enemies alike, for the last 2 years of high school. My grades declined and I started smoking way too much weed. To make things worse, she moved into my neighborhood, which was torment.

We went our separate ways to college and I ended up not talking to her for 2 years, which allowed me to disengage (on occasion I’d miss her, but whatever). During this time, I got out of my shell at school and lost my vcard (I was completely unaware of TRP at the time, but in hindsight I applied many RP concepts in doing so); I am doing well academically and am currently working a paid internship at a prestigious NYC law firm that will hopefully allow me to get a foot in the door after law school. My career is in pretty good shape, I think.

Well, I saw A at a 4th of July party at our state university. I was rolling face and she was drunk as shit, and we ended up catching up and agreeing that we should be friends again. “I know we’ve had some rough times in the past, but I’m happy it’s behind us,” she told me. I literally can't even describe how happy I was in that moment between the MDMA and being in her presence. I wouldn't be surprised if I never felt this happy ever again in my life. Everything I had ever loved about her made itself abundantly clear once again as I stared into her eyes during this conversation (thanks to MDMA for allowing shameless, unfettered eye contact!). My dormant oneitis had resurged.

I talked to her again over the course of the past few days, finding that she seems genuinely interested in being friends again, but now I realize I have a serious problem. I'm in love with this girl again. She's the last thing I think about when I go to sleep and the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning. I literally cannot see myself having a satisfactory relationship of any kind with another woman while I know A exists. I have the self control to not do anything stupid like send her an lovey-dovey flowery exposition on how I feel (in the past I really was this dumb/cringey), or even talk to her as much as I would like (obviously if I were to text her first often, my intentions would quickly become clear, regardless of the content of the texts), but the weight of this feeling is crushing and depressing because once again, it won't be reciprocated. I want to be friends with her—she's one of my oldest friends, probably the closest I ever had too (though that was years ago now)—but not at the expense of feeling like shit in doing so.

What do yall think I should do about this situation? I might also post on r/relationships to see how their advice differs

OK, so I am a going to be a senior this fall in high school and i'm planning to apply to UMass Amherst as well as UMass Lowell (As well as a bunch of other colleges).

My intended major is Computer science. I've heard many good things about the computer science program at UMass Amherst and Amherst seems like the perfect school for many personal reasons (Size, location, cost, etc.) which are not really the point. The point is that Amherst is really where I want to go!! But i don't know if i'll get in. Can someone just let me know of my chances?

GPA: 3.6 weighted
SAT: 1770 cumulative
I also have a internship scheduled for later this summer
3 AP's (including AP calculus; AP Physics Calculus Based*; and AP Computer Science) senior year. 
(*Calculus based physics is significantly more difficult than algebra based physics)
Keep in mind that I am taking a AP Computer Science during my senior year which is also my intended major (I feel like that helps alot)
I'm am also planing to apply early to increase my chance.

I also have a good amount of extracurricular such as sports (Indoor Track, cross country, Ultimate Disc) and clubs ( Debate, robotics, art). I also started a tech club in my public library where I taught middle-school aged kids HTML and basic JavaScript (Basic coding skills essentially). I also have a good amount of volunteering hours.

I am in-state around 2.5 hr drive from the school. Money is a large reason why I want to go to UMass as the instate tuition will really help me out with financial matters later on.

I feel like I will get into UMass Lowell (maybe even the honors college?) which is my safety net but Amherst is a much more preferred school.  

My parents and I are on the same page (Really the only page we're on together) that Amherst is the best school for me. We simply cannot afford private schools and barely can afford out of state tuition for other schools. We also know that UMass Amherst standards are increasing every year and is another point of concern for us.

Someone please help me!!
Thanks in advance."
3cp7lz,8,2015-07-09,"Me [29 F] with my boyfriend [30 M] of 1.5 years, losing interest in me sexually",needtogetbonedmore,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cp7lz/me_29_f_with_my_boyfriend_30_m_of_15_years_losing/,"Please help me out here, I am not sure if I am being a big asshole or if I have a legitimate concern.

My boyfriend and I started out with a sex life that was absolutely on fire. He couldn't get enough of me. We went through phases of seeing each other most days, and he still wanted to have sex all the time, often multiple times per day.

We went through a period of long distance but had frequent sex for several weeks after he got back. Then about six weeks ago, we officially moved in together in a new city and he began a taxing short-term internship that means a lot for his future career.

I'd say the sex has been on a medium decline for the past month. We fucked every day the first couple of weeks we were here - which is the norm for us. Then it was five times one week, then four the next, and then three and three. I know he is tired, so I do more of the work e.g. giving him oral to warm up, getting on top.

I got pissed the other night when I came in the bedroom in a slutty nurse's costume and he didn't really... get into it. He petted me, but kept watching TV as he told me to get my new butt toy. When I bent over to arrange the stuff on the bed, I could see that he was still watching TV and I told him to forget it and stalked off. We both ended up just masturbating solo that night.

We did have decent sex the night before last. Then last night, after I spent four hours watching TV with him, I came out into the living room only to have him go back in the bedroom. I followed him and suggested I give him a handjob - knowing that he might be too tired for full sex. He politely declined, shut the door, and masturbated to porn instead.

That seriously pissed me off. I ended up sleeping on the couch. We talked a bit this morning and I told him that it's hard for me to reconcile myself to him not wanting me all the time and that it really hurts. He said that he didn't intend to hurt me - which I know, but it's not the point. He has done the same thing several times in the last few weeks - shut the door and masturbated while I was in the living room.

He is still very affectionate outside of having full-on sex. I'd say that we make out less than we used to, but we still kiss and touch and cuddle plenty. He knows that I'm into him sexually. He's remarked that I've never turned him down for sex except for occasions when I'm too sick or sore.

My body looks the same as it did when we began our relationship. If anything, it's a bit better - my boobs have grown a little on birth control, and I've been working out. I have been thin the whole time. Other guys hit on me when I'm out in public. I think I'm pretty attractive. He swears that he finds me so. Just - maybe not attractive enough to beat out porn and masturbation all the time?

I don't know what to do. I can hardly demand that he stop masturbating. I think that enticing him into sex when he's lukewarm might just make him want me less.

The big picture concern - we are talking about staying together forever and getting married (no kids though). If the sex is dropping off after so little time together, with us both still pretty young, then what will it be like when we are older?

When my bf's mom divorced his stepdad, one of the reasons she cited was that he had stopped having sex with her. My bf always thought that this was particularly horrible. I know that his opinion is that partners have to stick together through that kind of thing, and when we talk about it he is sensitive to the idea that I would do the same to him one day.

If he were older and having problems with ED or low desire, especially if they tied into medical problems, I would understand. I know that most guys go that way eventually. But right now, he is a healthy 30-year-old guy with a normal sex drive - he's just not directing it toward me so much anymore.

Honestly, the awesome sex was the main reason I got with him in the first place. Don't get me wrong - he's generally a great catch with a lot going for him. But I'm pretty sex-driven - to me, sex and passion are the main things I get out of a relationship, as I can get everything else from either friends or my own self. Given this, I don't know what to do.

   
**tl;dr**: My bf is slowly coming to prefer masturbation over being intimate with me, no matter how low-effort I make it for him. How can I revive things?"

I was recommended for the position by one of their regional managers (my former boss from a different company). They said they couldn't let a candidate with my credentials slip away.

I have been talking with other companies around the country and with my background and education they were talking about figures like 55-60K for the same type of position. 

I would really like the job at 35K due to location, family, wife's job, etc. However, I want to make a little more money to deal with student loans etc. Also, I am still waiting to hear on job interviews I had with EPA and various state agencies weeks back.

I was given an offer letter recently and I need to respond in about a week. Should I call and try to negotiate salary or do it on paper? I did some research on salary.com and pay scale.com. Given my background, the websites show I should start at 42-45K. 

Any suggestions are super helpful! Thank you!"

I spend so much of my day beating myself up for being tired because I didn't go to sleep earlier, yet when bed time rolls around I'm wide awake. 

I feel like I'm constantly behind in my courses due to missed classes and I never have the energy to catch up, except at bedtime (11pm). I can only survive classes by struggling to stay awake and rushing home to catch up on the second half of my sleep. I cannot stay awake past 4pm with napping. 

I once worked a 9-5 internship and was a zombie the entire time. After that I vowed to never work full time again and I haven't. 

Looking back, many people in my life have described me as lazy and I believed them. As well as DSPD, I also require 9 hours of sleep per night which doesn't help. In addition to sleep time, I spend around 5 hours per night trying to sleep. I feel like all my time is spent in bed, yet I'm often low on energy. "

* 1. Are the co-jobs in Vancouver only? Canada-wide? International?
* 2. If you get a summer internship that you applied for yourself, does that count as a co-op job?
* 3. What are some common co-op companies that you have worked for (looking for feedback from current students/alumni that participated in the CS program).
* 4. What happens if you can't find a job?

That's all for now, thanks. "
3cpwfy,0,2015-07-09,Should I apply for a women's scholarship?,Dinger814,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/3cpwfy/should_i_apply_for_a_womens_scholarship/,"So I'm considering talking an immersive 11 week web development course offered near me. Im financially struggling and can't afford to go the traditional 4 year degree route right now. The course would give me a chance to start a career in a short amount of time and is more affordable (around $9,500) though I can't exactly afford that much either. 

The school offers one scholarship: full tuition for one female student in each of their programs, 3 month paid internship after, and 6 month Chuch &amp;amp; State membership . The goal is to promote more women in the computer programming field. 

So is it wrong for me to apply since I am legally female, though I am male in all other aspects? I've been on T 11 months, so when I meet the teachers/staff they'll be meeting a guy. I'm also a minority, and there is a lack of representation in that department too...but that's not what the scholarship is for... Is it like blasphemy? It's an opportunity I could really use right now. I feel like it's wrong to claim my cis-gender for my advantage..but at the end of the day when I file my taxes or apply to schools or do anything with a legal document, I'm a woman. So why shouldn't I use that to my advantage when I really need it? 

I was thinking of emailing the school and asking, but I don't want to jump the gun and ruin my chances all together. Any opinions or advice?

EDIT: To be clear, I did not search out female scholarships. This happened to be the only scholarship for this program, which brought up my question."
3cq0wj,5,2015-07-09,My [20F] partner's [20M] porn addiction is taking a toll on our relationship.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cq0wj/my_20f_partners_20m_porn_addiction_is_taking_a/,"I have been in a relationship with my partner for a little over two years now and we have been living together for one year. About 6 months into living together, it became clear to me that my partner had a porn and masturbation addiction. 


We sat down and talked about it together. He agreed that this was something he'd been struggling with since he was 12 and that he wanted to make a change because it was clearly really impacting both him personally and our relationship. It was ruining his self-esteem and was upping his anxiety in social situations. It was making me feel a bit worthless and not as attractive to my partner almost because he would rather porn over me sometimes. I realise that this is a selfish way to feel and I have been trying very hard to move past it. It is also affecting our relationship significantly. 


After we had the long conversation about it, he connected with a support forum and managed to quit for 47 days. I was ridiculously proud of him and let him know that if he ever wanted to talk to me about struggles he was having that I was here. During this time, he became much more intimate and romantic with me. He paid more attention to me, spent more time with me. He would communicate more with me significantly and was more emotionally present in our relationship. He also communicated with me that he was feeling better about himself personally and in social situations. Our sex life was so much better because he was totally present without worrying about not being able to maintain an erection or reach orgasm (which he worried about because he was watching porn/masturbating excessively in secret). 


After 47 days, he flew back home for a 3 week holiday. He relapsed a lot. He lied to me about relapsing until the last week when he came clean and shared this information with me. I told him it was okay, we make mistakes and that I was proud of him for making it 47 days while also reminding him that it was important to just keep pushing forward. 


He has been home about three weeks now and for the first two, our relationship was like it was on his first quitting streak. I started my internship on Monday and it was the first time we were away from one another for a long period of time. After Monday and up to today (Friday), it has been clear that he has relapsed and it has taken such a significant toll on our relationship. He has been very emotionally distant, not been intimate with me at all and I feel just... absent? in the way that he addresses me. I'm not sure if that makes sense but the difference between the way he is personally and in our relationship between when he's quit to when he's relapsed is so significant and clear to me. 


We share a computer (connected to our TV) and so I checked the history - my suspicions were confirmed. He relapsed on Monday on the first day.


I think what hurts me the most is that he hasn't told me. I've never been mean or angry when it comes to this issue and I understand that he has an addiction. He has communicated with me always that this is something he wants to do and so I know that this isn't me pushing him to do something he doesn't want to do. I just feel very hurt and it's having a significant effect on my self-esteem.


I'm not sure what to do. We had a conversation last night where I explained to him the issues that I was having in our relationship for the last week (giving him plenty of opportunity to share with me that he has relapsed). He chose not to share this information with me. I didn't want to tell him that I snooped in our internet history because I don't want him to feel trapped in a cage or that he can't trust me and I feel very guilty for checking the internet history. 


I am posting this to ask advice on how to be more supportive for my partner as they are going through this or to ask how people have dealt with similar situations. I'm just going forward here really confused and unsure of where to go now and want to hear others input. 

   
**tl;dr**: Partner has a porn and masturbation addiction, quit for a month before having a series of relapses that have affected our personal relationship and us individually significantly. "
3cq30f,39,2015-07-09,Give it to me straight: Will my degree in mathematics mean anything to employers in the finance industry? How do I save myself from irrelevancy before it happens?,clever_username7,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/3cq30f/give_it_to_me_straight_will_my_degree_in/,"Heyo, I'm currently a college freshman who just finished up freshman year. I go to a community college in California with the intention of transferring to a higher end UC school. As I am aware that prestige matters quite a bit in finance, I am aiming for UC Berkeley, and I have the stats to get in, but UCLA/UCSD are more realistic. 

Anyway, I am majoring in Mathematics/Applied Mathematics/Statistics. I have scoured through many of the course lists at all 3 of these schools, and many allow for students to take courses in various disciplines as long as they're relatively math intensive. 

So, I plan to take multiple Probability/Stats/Finance/Economics courses along with some CS as well. Also, this coming Fall I plan to purchase a little Dell laptop for a couple hundred bucks to begin learning Microsoft Excel as I understand that the industry standard is basically a mastery of Excel. (I have a Mac for personal use and I hear MS Office sucks on it, so whatever.)

Anyway, am I at a disadvantage here? I just hear so many horror stories about unpaid internships being the new ""entry level job."" It's ridiculous out there. How useful am I going to be? I plan on working hard to get any sort of internship next, and the following summer. Preferably at a bank or financial institution, but really anywhere that will take me.  

I don't really know what part of finance I want to work in, because I haven't had any experience in any parts at all, so I'm going in blind here. I'm considering just taking a basic finance/accounting class at my community college, but I really want to focus on my Math classes and not ruin my GPA for transfer. 

Lets say I gain a good understanding of MS Office, I get a good amount of math done, and I have basic understanding of finance...Do I stand a chance? I'm not trying to get into IB here, not going for Wall Street, but hey, California is a competitive market. 

**TL;DR: What skills can a math major learn in order to be attractive to finance internships? What kind of places should I be applying to/trying to make connections with?**

On a side note, I interviewed about 4 months ago for a summer assistant position at an investment firm nearby my house. The man who interviewed me showed me around the whole floor, even gave me a few books on investing, finance, etc. (Intelligent Investor ftw!) 

He and I ended up emailing back and forth a couple times the following weeks and he ended up not choosing me for the position, but told me to definitely stay in touch. I'm 19, and I don't know much about this industry, but did he really want me to stay in touch? He said ""This industry is all about the connections you make, and you just made your first one, stay in touch!"" ...How do I do that? I figure in a month or two I'll email him asking some question about the industry, and then a month or two after that I'll ask if he knows of any internships opening up around? I get that I have to stay relevant in this guys mind, but what's the best way to do so?

For anyone who read this the whole way through, thank you. Your help is well appreciated.

**TL;DR for this second part: How do I ""stay in touch"" in a professional way with someone in the finance industry who offered to be my first connection to the industry?**"
3cq8c8,5,2015-07-09,[F4M] The Intern,intheofficefun,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3cq8c8/f4m_the_intern/,"I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom). 

There will be a fair amount of build-up here, lots of flirting and what not, but make sure your character doesn't come off too strong. I expect a lot of detail, and I will tell you if you do not provide enough. I would like consistency with that detail as well.

I'm a student in university right now, and am looking into an internship for fall and possibly spring semester. I'm going into my senior year and am on track to graduate with a degree in CS and Music Technology. 

My program has taught me some Python and decent amount of C/C++. That being said, I am completely aware of my lack of experience and therefore hands on knowledge in the programming world. Last summer I worked for a small tech start up in Indianapolis, but I learned more of the business and marketing side of things (CRM, Customer Targeting, etc.) I've also worked for my university's IT department as both help desk and more recently DT support, but I feel an actual programming internship would be a lot more beneficial. 

I'm doing fine in my degrees (3.7-4.0) GPA most semesters, and could happily supply a couple letters of recommendation if desired. My interests include puzzles, mathematics (mainly creative problem solving), and gaming. I also enjoy the audio/visual industry. 

I've spoken with my professors about landing an internship next semester so they are on the lookout as well, but I figured I would post here. Thanks for taking the time to read, please feel free to message me or comment with any questions. "

Owl of Minerva is now stackable or infinitely usable from the FM

Recode the FM for designated spots, remove spot stealing + people taking up too much room.

Step 2:
Buy gold from every gold site undercover : ban all those accounts...
Remove the FM shops of bots who farm elites for TONS of rare items 

Step 3: rework drop table to have difficult bosses drop cubes/protection/css/etc INSTEAD of elites, which is dominated by bots.

Step 4: Increase commerci cube drop rate,

Botting only seems to be a problem because about ~5 massive bot farm owners literally control the economy. They are the same ones who sell meso online as well. Just a few honestly I could ban them in a day.

Also tax is annoying haha!

3cqo5r,5,2015-07-09,Struggling to put my life together after Narc family [LONG] [TW],LongDaysLongN1ghts,LifeAfterNarcissism,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/3cqo5r/struggling_to_put_my_life_together_after_narc/,"I’m in the middle of a really tough time, losing my job, needing a new one, needing to move…sorry if this sounds whiny. It will also be long and rambling. 

The more I read the narc subreddits, the more I go through phases of extreme nervousness/distress and depression from everything I noticed. I know this is amplified by all the life changes, but I am truly afraid I am a monster and, try as I might, I may never be able to forgive myself and find happiness. 

At one point in my life – when I moved away from the narcs to go to a very prestigious college – I became the narc myself. I made some great friends but had a very hard time adjusting. Basically, the classes were 10x harder than high school, most people went to boarding school (I went to a poverty-stricken rural school that was very dysfunctional; we were all severely under-read), and I had no money or social skills. Zero social skills. Could barely interact with people who were not mentally ill or personality disordered. At college, I was getting rejected left and right from people with whom I wanted to be friends. A few people accepted me, but kept their distance (I am now very close friends with them, and they know everything). But most people sensed something wrong. 

I should interrupt to say my family is 100% fullblown narcissist, and they are aggressive b*****s. The gaslighting masters for my entire life, and I was the family scapegoat. I was overweight, dressed terribly in clothes 2 sizes two big, and yelled at because I looked homely. But they never bought any clothes or healthy food (spent $300-500 a month on their own clothing, but complained about being in debt). If I did get new clothes, they were laughably pathetic, like something a 5 year old should wear. My brother (GC) got his license and a new mustang that he totaled. I never even had driving lessons. I would get reprimanded for being overweight, but I was not allowed to exercise. I was not allowed to have friends until I was 17. Most days, I couldn’t go outside. I couldn’t consume popular music. If I sat in my room and read, listened to music, watched TV or played on the computer, I was screamed at for not going outside and being social or exercising. If I went outside and was social, I was screamed at because I said something wrong. They bought junk food all the time, but if I ate junk food I was being unhealthy. If I didn’t eat my food, I was wasteful. If I ate it all, I was a glutton. If I asked for more, I was called a “piglet” and “meatmouth” (the last one lead to a 7 year vegan stint). I went to the dentist 2x in my life; I have spent over $10,000 in the past two years on crowns and work because my mouth is in such horrible state.  There are 6 root canals in my mouth; I am only 25.

This example might solidify it. I wanted to be a musician and artist when I was in high school. It was the only thing loved doing, and I was notably gifted. They refused $10-week on lessons (remember, $300-500 on clothes they never wore). One day they forbade me to play any instrument in the house. Around that same time, my teachers noted my gift and kept encouraging me to reach higher. One of my favorite music teachers even made it a point to my mother that I had something real. But when I couldn’t practice anymore, I got progressively worse, and all my auditions for music school/local groups/scholarships were an embarrassment. Eventually I stopped playing for 7 years, and just started again only to end every session in tears.

At the same time, they bragged to their friends what a great little gifted musician I was. How they raised me right. And everyone would affirm it.

Another example: shortly after the music-practice ban, we had a family reunion for Christmas. My gift? A $1,500 keyboard – that I was NEVER allowed to play. But obviously, it looked like major support of the gifted child, if you were part of the extended family…

Look at this and convince me this isn’t crazy-making. I had several years where the police and CPS were sent to my house from friends and family, but nothing came of it because we looked so perfect. And my brother was so perfect in school, that everyone figured I was just a psychopath. 

And it was kind of true. A few months later, I totally snapped and became this monstrous person. This went on for 1 ½ years. After a school psychologist diagnosed me with ADHD, I took an Wellbutrin and Dexedrine. Combined with the stress, this made everything WAY worse. I honestly don’t want to relieve all these memories, but here are some of the things I did: curse someone out on Facebook broadly then deny it (purposefully gaslight them), pretend to be sick and need to go to the hospital for attention, completely miss every deadline I had, for work and papers, get involved with a codependent, gossip maliciously and threaten to kill myself when I was really hesitant and not going to do it. Tons of lies and nasty vibes to people. I was eventually sent to a treatment center for 3 weeks – didn’t do anything – and almost kicked off the campus. I somehow convinced them to keep me there, because I couldn’t go back home. 

And it goes without speaking that I lost 99% of those friends. Totally understandable.

Bear in mind I’m not proud of ANY of this. Thoughts of these things make me want to vomit and cry. There are no words to describe how sorry I feel and it chokes me up every time I think about it. If I could give everything I have achieved, and ever will achieve, up to go back and change things or apologize to these people, I would in a heartbeat. I can’t begin to imagine the hell I wrought and the damage done to my (and so many other people’s) reputations. And then those poor people working in administration, just trying to do their jobs….

All this toned down in the middle of sophomore year. It’s been 4 years since NC, and the final two years of college were terrific as I basically taught myself how to be a real person. I had a job and took graduate classes (sucked at them, worked to much for rent money to do my papers, but I at least took them). I’m notorious for working really hard to achieve my goals. And put in around 40 hours a week for student pay I paid for my degree in $40k+ loans, also put a roof over my head and (healthy) food into my tummy. Some of the people who saw me through those horrible years have forgiven me, and are great friends today. I’m very, very, VERY careful not to let anything trigger me – I’ve had close calls with toxic people - and to be mindful of my behaviors and actions. It all came out well in that I graduated, won an award for my thesis and a campus-wide award that literally hundreds of people applied for. 

My bosses loved me, my current friends love me, a ton of coworkers and colleagues loved me. I thought I was fine until recently. 

Here’s the problem: I cannot forgive myself. I can’t forgive myself for being a total monster who, has probably damaged her name to those who will be important networks and connections in my industry, who will probably never speak to me because of the stories they heard in college. I can’t forgive myself for almost wasting a good opportunity. I can’t forgive myself because, if by some miraculous event I am a successful person, the people involved in my worst years would have every right to run a smear campaign against me. Hell, they should do that now. 

I can’t forgive myself because I have been in so many toxic situations since “seeing the light.” Since I worked so hard to become better, that they even exist just confirms everything.  

One example involves me being a total slacker; I did terribly those first 2 years. In senior year, a friend/classmate and I were offered an internship with our professor. We would go to E. Europe and help him do a documentary. This was a dream come true (travel + film? I’m in). Would have been my first internship because I was too poor to do them before, and probably would have convinced me to move to LA and just trudge through it. 

We had to finish a final project first. Having been lax on discipline earlier, I scheduled that s*** down to the second and followed it rigorously. Then that “friend” of mine, upset over his recent breakup, started threatening me and his roommates with suicide. Overall we think it was a ploy to have us spend time with him. Having done that before, I totally understand this and I understand he was probably somewhat delusional. 

But one weekend – a weekend that we had to do a project for the internship-professor – my classmate had a close call. I had to drop everything and take him to the hospital before he jumped out of a high-rise. That Monday? The project was incomplete and I was yelled at for being unreliable, letting everyone down. And of course that would happen. After all, I was that irresponsible girl who didn’t have her shit together and never completed anything on time.

My professor passively retracted his internship offer. The kicker? He knew about my colleague's extremely poor mental health, that he had not done any work on our project and that I took him to the hospital (the colleague told him). He still offered my classmate the internship. He had the time of his life and it opened a lot of doors. I was so upset I moved across the country to get away from it all. 

But I’m rambling. The concern I have is over all these memories that are now only resurfacing. They make me want to beg for forgiveness, but most of these people will never speak to me again (and shouldn’t). I am afraid to reconnect with my alma mater, even some old classmates, because I definitely know some people who will be very successful in life who know these stories of that crazy girl. 

I’m afraid to do or make anything, because if it were ever noticed – and there’s less than a 1% chance of that –  I don’t deserve it after what I did. 

It's left me wondering - am I a psychopath? Sociopath? Narcissist? Antisocially disordered? Or PTSDed, depressed, anxious? I don't even know what's going on, and I'm afraid to find out. 

TL;DR: I’ve been a horribly toxic person in the past. Now that I have fixed so much of it, I can’t forgive myself. I’m afraid to be diagnosed and that the negativity will follow me and so I can’t move on with my dreams. "

BECAUSE I'M FUCKING DUMB AS A SACK OF BRICKS APPARENTLY. As my relationship with Jack progressed he managed to convince me that he loved me. The worst part about it, in hindsight, is that he worked so hard to make me believe that he loved me. Approximately a year down the line, after having worked so hard to convince me he loved me, he decides to tell me that he did not actually love me and that he was, "" candy coating things for me"". Should have left him then. Did not leave him then. BECAUSE I'M STUPID. He proceeded to apologize and tell me he was just upset about a previous altercation we had, and that he wanted everything to be okay between us. We moved into an apartment together. He paid all the bills because i was, and still will be until the end of the month, a full time student in a field that requires almost all of my time and has extremely inflexible scheduling and could not work. (sorry to back track, not that anyone is actually reading this or cares, but when Jack said he did not actually love me, it fucked me up pretty bad...i felt abandoned and got stupid and clingy and moody and that probably didnt help anything...just so that the story stays legit and it doesn't seem like there's not two sides to every story. this is just me venting my side of it.) He explained that he wasnt good at showing his affection or love in a physical (such as cuddling) or verbal way, and that by paying for the apartment and by buying little trinkets here and there and paying for our pets (which there are unfortunately a lot of) he was showing me that he loved me.  I believed him. Not long after we had settled into our new home, another altercation arose due to the fact that I started bitching about his friends and him being over drunk as shit at 3am in plain view and earshot of said friends, when he knew i had to be awake by 4am to go to an internship that puts innocent people's lives in my hands. Again, I could have handled things more tastefully, but I did not. So he decides to tell me that he lied about having ever loved me. in front of his friends, which i probably deserved for bitching at him in from of them in the first place, but i still felt that it was an unnecessary harshness. he told me that i was not worth loving, and that i should go kill myself. much to his dismay, I obviously did not kill myself. My idiot heart was, however, broken. severely. I proceeded to stay with him because he told me he didnt want to break up and that he was sorry, but that he just didnt believe in love, or that he wasnt ready for love yet and that if i could just hold out a little bit longer he would definitely love me. at this point i had truly begun to believe i was worthless and unlovable and began spiraling into a stupid depression brought own by my own idiotic decisions about this guy. I grew farther and farther away from him, he started lying more and more, and i began to despise him. it was subtle, but it showed just enough for him to start getting moody and to start further attacking my self esteem. (again, i am a fucking idiot for letting this happen. i am to blame in this.) I went out with a gal pal of mine, my drink got spiked, and i nearly lost my life. Jack was nowhere to be found that night. I snapped. I broke up with him. mind you I didnt say I left him, because that would require me to have taken my belongings and moved out, and I'm still fucking living with him because I am still in school and have no money and nowhere else to fucking go, because, again, I AM A FUCKING IDIOT. (he said he wanted me to stay in the apartment and get my feet under me and help me out or whatever until i got  my career underway) anyhow, a friend of mine asked me to be in her wedding, which i agreed to and was out of state for a week for the wedding, during which time Jack decided to fornicate on MY bed, yes the one I paid for, with an individual who i was naive enough to have thought was my friend (lets call her Jill). not only is the bed MINE, but all of the furniture and appliances in the apartment down to the toaster and silverware are as well. In lieu of paying half of the rent, I supplied all the furniture, tupperware, appliances, shelving, blankets, toiletries, towels, etc. After the break up I had made it very clear that he was no longer welcome in my bed, but that my couch was more than welcome to him and that he was free to purchase his own bed and allocate it anywhere he pleased, but not to fucking touch my bed. my bed is sacred. it is the one fucking thing that is 100% mine that I am at complete liberty to dictate the rules and regulations of. Jill violated that, Jack violated that. Jack then tried to lie about it, but Jill ratted him out. Jill now threatens my life because her sister (shall we call her Jane?) was previously my ""best friend"" who apparently turns around and tells Jill everything I have told Jane about my opinion on both Jack and Jill. I want to get out so badly. I hate to say hate, but I hate them all. I feel betrayed. again, its probably my own damn fault.....but fuck them all. I will be able to get my own HOUSE, fuck an apartment I'll be making serious money for my efforts, in approximately a month, and it doesnt feel soon enough to get away from these people. three people I stupidly trusted, now three people I want nothing more than to never see again. i am counting the hours until i can be free from them for good. yep. that was a good rant i guess? kai. Im done. "
3cqve7,1,2015-07-09,Clarifying a Benefit from NoFap,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3cqve7/clarifying_a_benefit_from_nofap/,"I keep seeing fapstronauts mention ""clarity"" as a benefit, but I wonder if that brain fog was really the case


I realised this morning that two months ago I was still fairly lost in my direction, I knew what I had to do and what to do but I just wasn't *sure*, last month I had a good general idea of what needs to be done to achieve my goals but something just didn't feel quite there yet; as of last week, I realised that I connected all the dots, between my low level plans (revise over the break -&gt; pass next semester -&gt; past the semester after -&gt; look for an internship) into my higher level plans (find sponsorship for employment visa -&gt; move to the US)


*Clarity*, is the subtle feeling in your mind that wasn't there before, your brain believes in itself that it can achieve something that it once felt was daunting and full of self-doubt, long term vision free from anxiety, is definitely a crucial benefit


It's the same as thinking about having to go home in peak hour traffic with a headache, it is often worse than the drive itself


I am very certain if I relapsed this clarity would definitely disappear overnight, and then I'd have to fight through a roller coaster week of emotions before I can baseline again, this alone is enough to refrain myself from a fleeting moment's pleasure"
3cqxlz,1,2015-07-09,I think we all need to check our privilege -- not just white males,[deleted],Rants,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/3cqxlz/i_think_we_all_need_to_check_our_privilege_not/,"OK, so this is the result of three, no four, incidents that have happened to me over the past month. I will preface this by saying that I am liberal and I understand the concept of ""privilege."" It makes sense. Lots of people benefit from things they did nothing to deserve (e.g. people who are born rich, people who grew up with good parents, people who were given good educations). That's privilege.  There is also a thing called ""white privilege."" I get it. Some things are easier for me because I'm white. Ditto for male privilege. That said, there is also a bunch of shit that is harder for me because I'm white. And these days, one of those things is dealing with all of the bullshit surrounding people attacking you just because you are a white male and have ""privilege."" 

Fucked up example #1: 
I'm sitting in my car in Berkeley, CA and a group up clearly upwardly mobile black-ish (I think North African) people roll up next to me. A 20-some year old guy opens the door of the van and slams it into my car. I look up from my phone and say ""hey! Watch it."" I get out and tell him to hold on for a second while I see if there's any damage. In response, he yells at me ""check you're white privilege!"" I'm like ""What the hell are you talking about?"" He then proceeds to curse me, call me racist, etc.

Fucked up example #2:
I was assaulted outside my house in Washington, DC. Police officers show up, find the guy, and then proceed to tell me it's my word against his and I'm a white guy in DC, so he'll never get convicted. Fuck me, I'm a white male, right?

Fucked up example #3:
Today at a softball game, a black girl who is a brand new intern at the place I work swings and lets the bat fly straight into the sidelines. It hits me, hard. Everyone is like ""shit. wow. that must hurt like a motherfucker."" And it did. It hurt like a motherfucker – I’m icing it right now. About 5 seconds later I'm still coping with the shock and pain and she turns to me and extends her hand for a handshake like, ""we're cool, right?"" I offer her a fist bump, to which she responds, ""you're making it worse. You know black people shake hands too."" Yes I fucking know. My best fucking friend is black. I spent Father’s Day with his family because my dad’s dead. I spend a shit load of time with black people. She has no idea who the fuck I am. But she decides the right thing to do is attack me for a mis-perceived racial slight. You know what she should have done? Give me a fucking fist bump. I didn't feel like shaking hands. I was in pain – am in pain. All I could muster was a fucking fist bump. But she -- after throwing an aluminum baseball bat at me -- felt like it was more important to call me out in front of the whole office for something that was not meant to offend. Instead, she should have been kissing my ass, or at least showing a bit of compassion. 

Add that to countless facebook rants about male privilege (which almost always ends up being equated with white male privilege), and a guy starts to wonder, WTF? 

When I was a kid, my mom, aunt, godmother and grandma used to sing anthems of women's empowerment to us like ""I am woman hear me roar"" or ""these boots are made for walkin.'"" There was something pro-active and positive about their feminism. I feel like today's privilege-focused narrative is not so much about improving the lot of women or minorities, as dehumanizing men who happen to be white. It's not productive -- and it's both racist and sexist. I can see why a lot of white men run into the arms of Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly. It's a lot more comforting than a morally and intellectually unaccountable Left. Why not run to a demagogue on the Right who embraces you rather than little intellectual fascists on the Left who constantly hound you for things over which you have no control?

So in summary, white privilege does exist. But so does fucking black privilege and female privilege. I suggest rather than calling people out over their privilege, we each take a look at ourselves and try to figure out how we can be better people."
3cqxv9,5,2015-07-09,My[21] live-in boyfriend[23M] is a lazy roommate(and taking me for granted),[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3cqxv9/my21_livein_boyfriend23m_is_a_lazy_roommateand/,"So, my boyfriend and I have been together about 8 months now. Because of an issue with my roommate(after signing a lease, she decided she no longer wanted to go to grad school, so she went back home, fucking me over conpletely on a lease that had 12 months left) he took over her half of the lease, and long story short, we now live together. I wasn't sure if we were ready to move in together, but I didn't have many options, as it's impossible to find a subletter this time of year in a college town, and he was doing me a huge favor. He dealt with my increasingly volatile roommate, and was overall just amazing in the situation.

And its been downhill from there. Be warned - this is a serious venting session. We're both nerds and introverts, more or less, and since almost all of our friends are home for the summer, hours or longer away. You'd think, then, that we'd do a lot of stuff together. You'd be wrong. He plays LoL, WoW, you name it, every night. Its his hobby, he enjoys it, so i try to be cool about it. Except, he makes no time for me. He whines and groans over watching tv with me half the time, which I have to beg him to do, btw, and I feel awful because I don't want to force him to spend time with me. I don't want to have to, but if I don't beg him, we do nothing but share a bed and sit in the same room doing different things. It sucks. We haven't gone on a date since we moved in together, 5 weeks ago. We decided to do a weekly date night. That's supposed to be tonight, every Thursday, but he's sick. We're pretty broke because of some stupid stuff with the leasing office, making us pay a new deposit before refunding my old one, but it's not like I adk for fancy meals, I just want to watch a movie, or go on a long walk.   

The other thing is, he's actual fucking pigpen. He leaves his clothes on the floor after changing, bitches about doing the dishes, and vacuuming or anything like that is ridiculous. He told me he felt like he's only around for chores the other week, because I asked him to help me with something. And I don't ask much of him. He also doesn't understand how much I do. Whenever I bring up the dishes, he reminds me he did them three, yes, THREE whole times since we moved in. When I ask him who he thinks does them literally every other time, he just rolls his eyes. I asked him to help me clean the bathroom last weekend, and he said it was fine and didn't need cleaning. It hadnt been deep-cleaned in four weeks. Our bathroom gets horrible ventilation, so it gets moldy if we aren't vigilant. I'm currently doing an internship, a part time job, and taking two classes online(one's a 400 level Capstone course), I don't always have time to do it all, let alone clean everything, too. I don't actually think he understands how much time it takes to keep our place clean, and I don't think he appreciates what I do at all. He works a full time job as a secretary for an optomestrist's office his grandparent's own. I'm a journalist, all of my committments involve writing, a big workload, and a lot of deadlines. 

We haven't sex in a week, because I've been super busy and stressed(and not interested) and he's been too damn lazy to even attempt anything. He's become so lazy, he used to care about his appearance and health, and now has put on a few pounds and says he doesn't care if I say anything about his (attrocious) diet. 

I know this sounds horrible, but you're only getting one side of it. He can be really great, but lately, I've found that hard to see. I love him, and we live together. I don't know what to do. Whenever I try to talk to him about this, it devolves into a shouting match, because I'm admittedly hot-headed, and he knows how to push my buttons. He always has this sarcastic, sassy tone in his voice that makes him sound so condescending. By the time the fight's over,  somehowI'm apologizing for getting mad.

I don't mean to sound so harsh on him, but I'm very upset right now, and I've had it putting up with this. He's sick, and I'm trying to keep my cool, but he's out in the living room playing LoL, and it is supposed to be our date night. If I confront him, he's just going to turn it on me because I didn't remind him and because he's sick. I' sick of always coming out the bitch, nagging him to clean and go on dates with me.
   
I need solutions that aren't: omg, break up with him immediately, he's the worst man alive and is abusing you emotionally. I need a realistic solution, because I live with him and I care about him enough to try to salvage this. How do I approach the subject? How to I make him see how much this is hurting our relationship? He sees no problem with any of this. 

I should add that, at my asking, he's tried and cut down a bit on gaming. But it's still so often, and it's a huge trigger point now. I know he tries, and he's no idiot, but I think he's oblivious to a lot of this, and how much it hurts me. But it's so hard to get through to him. It wasn't like this before, and I hatr to think it's because we live together. We both work so much that we hardly see each other any more than before. We also have different days off, so there's no weekend together or anything like that. Help me out.  Is it me? Am I just expecting too much?

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend neglects me and the upkeep of our apartment, plays LoL all the time, and ""forgets"" about our dates. Manipulates me. "
3cr2t8,4,2015-07-09,I registered for summer classes without realizing that I didn't have funding left for them. Now I'm in a super tight spot.,nevaehyeknom,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/3cr2t8/i_registered_for_summer_classes_without_realizing/,"I'm 31 and started going back to school a few years ago after a failed attempt at my local 4 year university straight out of high school. I had a series of massive anxiety attacks and couldn't function in school anymore. I have been paying on my student loans since then, until I started school again a few years ago.

&amp;nbsp;

I have two small kids, so going to school online seemed like the right thing to do to make me more employable in the future, even though I didn't have much direction. Last year I signed up for an Environmental Science class, and I loved it. I finally found my academic calling-- working in the field of Sustainability. I also earned my associates degree in December.

&amp;nbsp;

I transferred from a community college online, where I took most of my generals, back to my local 4 year university where I had all the anxiety issues in the past. Despite going through a lengthy appeals process (because I left abruptly and with bad grades, even though my grades are good now), I finally got in, but on Academic Probation because I left the university with bad grades. That was this last January. I took another Sustainability class and really feel like I've found what I'd like to be the area I work in. Because I was on Academic Probation, I wasn't sure if I was going to do well enough in my classes to continue my education. I was very scared and anxious, but I was able to do well enough in all my classes to get off of Academic Probation and feeling invigorated and excited about finding my calling.

&amp;nbsp;

I met with my advisor after classes got out and we decided I should take some summer classes to help me along to my Bachelor's degree. I made a stupid mistake, and just assumed I had financial aid for these classes. My previous school used money from the upcoming semesters for summer classes, whereas my current school uses money from the previous semesters for summer classes. I applied for financial aid and didn't expect any problems.

&amp;nbsp;

About three weeks later I finally get information back from my University that I don't have money left for the classes I signed up for, I was too late to drop them, and I was financially responsible for them at this point. I found this out the day before I had to go in to have my tonsils out and some surgeries done on my nose to improve my breathing. At this point, my husband started looking into other options for me because I was all laid up from my surgeries.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't have the money for my two 3 credit classes and my internship. Luckily, I still had a little Pell grant money that should cover the one credit hour of my internship, but right now I still owe the University just over $1,500. I've petitioned to see if I can ""late drop"" the classes, but it's been over two weeks and I still haven't heard anything back from them. I've gone to campus and run all over the place, spoken to 6 different offices and it doesn't sound like there's likely to be much relief for me. Right now the best case scenario is that I am allowed to ""late drop"" my classes, in which I'll still be responsible for the late fees, which I think could be a few hundred dollars. The worst case scenario is that I am not able to late drop and will have to pay off the entire bill before I can attend classes again. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm lost. I feel like I've been punished over and over and over again for messing up when I was 18. I had been so elated to finally find a field that I thought was a good fit for me and is growing, so I'd be more likely to find a good job at some point, and to finally be off of Academic Probation. I felt great, like I was essentially tying up loose ends and had worked hard to make up for the mistakes of my past. And now I just don't know what to do. I started a job the week I had surgery, but it's only enough to help my husband and I get through the summer, when he doesn't make as much money. I live in South Dakota.

3crv8m,1,2015-07-10,My college degree in in Limbo while I fight cancer. One teacher failed me even with documentation of the tumor. Here is the email I just wrote to him trying to get the grade back up.,[deleted],anything,https://www.reddit.com/r/anything/comments/3crv8m/my_college_degree_in_in_limbo_while_i_fight/,"Hi Professor,

Its been about two months of hell for me, just getting started. I officially got diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. I have all the paper work. To graduate I need a C- in your class. I'm not the best student but without this quarter my average was a 3.6, so you can see how this ordeal has effected me. I feel I have accomplished all of the class goals. I did well on all my speeches, participated in all our online meetings, did great on the quizzes. I missed one due to missing class to think about my impending doom. 

My cancer is in a higher stage but I think I still have a 72-80% chance for first line therapy cure. However before diagnosis I had 10 years of lymph nodes that were never biopsied . I thought I had an indolent lymphoma that had transformed due to all these new symptoms and that is basically to put it lightly not a good thing.

So my story is I started getting these symptoms December. First it was itching, which is a symptom of either kind of lymphoma they all share similar symptoms actually. I did not pay much attention to it until that is when I lost 10 pounds over night and a week later I got a whole bunch of nodes pop up in my elbows. This is when I knew it was cancer. The tests started after that. My Cat scan was the first day of our final and 4 days later I was told I had a 5 inch tumor above my heart. 

That was when I though I was about to die in a few weeks so why turn anything in. Luckily one of my teachers consoled me and told me to apply for an IN. This was available for every class but yours. I'm not sure if I just freaked out or if it was not there but there 4 classes two with the same name. 

The work was all already done. I assumed my group would turn in parts of the project like personal research. etc. I did all my work for the project and attended all the meetings etc. I just didn't turn in some of the files I thought my group would turn in. And I was not in the mood to rate my team members thinking about impending doom has some side effects you know.

Then the interview project I was missing a few components which I actually thought I turned in. I did read your message that I needed to resubmit some stuff.

Anyways after noticing that my incomplete was only sent to 3 classes I frantically emailed you the work along with the cat scan result on Saturday. Which was more then enough time to review it due to the circumstances? 

I don't know if you thought I faked it or what but I assumed I got enough points for at least a C- I personally think I deserve at least a A- in the class. Then the dreaded D. Okay I only need C-'s in my core classes, oh this is a core class.

So basically, this is the only class I need to graduate. Of course the others are in limbo but Im taking my sweet time worrying and soaking up life waiting till the last minute probably to do the last 3 projects.

I attached my hospital stay report including surgery and pathology results. You can call my doctor. You can meet me in person and see my surgery scars. 

Is there anyway you'd consider submitting a change grade request? I know I can challenge the grade but that's fucking bullshit. I don't wanna stand in front of a group of people and tell my sob story.

Six months from now I envision myself beating this horseshitassdisease that will probably prevent me from getting hired once I complete my internship. Retaking your class giving a speech about how I failed to graduate college because I thought I had terminal cancer, but turns out it was a more curable kind.

Come on did you really fail me with notation of a tumor in my chest?

Well I hope that about sums it up. If you manage to get to the bottom of this email I hope you can submit a grade change request. 

Sincerely, 

Kid who came from bullshit war-torn YugoSlavia with my mom and sister. To the grand old US of A, to struggle and put what little money we had into a private financially aided education , to almost complete college with a decent 3.6. Only to get cancer and not graduate because I thought I was gonna die so what was the point. I'm ready to fight this thing, get a real job and start giving back to society. I hope you can do this simple request for me.

I'm sure this is the weirdest email you have ever gotten sorry. These things happen for time to time. I think.

EDIT: Just to clarify - this isn't a puzzle in the sense that there is one clear winning play which will win you the game outright. It's more something I hope will spark discussion about the opening. That said, I know what I would do, but I would not be surprised to see someone suggest a better line of play.

SECOND EDIT: Provided this doesn't turn out horrible, I'm planning on posting a similar thread in a day or two for the Corp's turn 2 or 3. I think there will be more interesting lines of play there, but I figured first things first.

**SUMMARY:** The most upvoted line of play, suggested by /u/Calc3 (and others) is as follows:

* Install Sundew in new remote
* Install Eli in front of Sundew
* Click for credit

The reasoning behind this is the following:

&gt; Going fast with money against Kate is imperative, especially with Sundew. Playing it now as opposed to next turn nets you 2 credits, which is a big deal. The way to beat Kate is with remote pressure; if she is allowed to set up at her own speed, she is favored. If she's digging for SMC or something, you're in good shape. You're happy to give up random accesses as RP, so icing centrals is bottom priority. Icing HQ instead of clicking for a credit lets Kate know you probably have Nisei in hand as well as reduces the number of cards in your hand if she does come after HQ and makes it harder if you just want to Jackson or Gift next turn.

/u/IceRay42 also pointed out that RP is one of the best Corps at playing from behind in agenda points, which is some comfort in case Kate does snag an agenda from the unprotected centrals.

The second most upvoted line of play was the following, suggested by /u/Krystman amongst others:

* Install Pup on R&amp;D  
* Install Eli on HQ  
* Click for a credit  

&gt; If they run on HQ and R&amp;D you'll be able to rez both and still have money for a PSI game if there is a Future Perfect on top.
&gt; Eli on HQ is win-win. Either it's an ETR and your Nisei Mk2 is safe. Or they'll click through for 50% a costly trash or a 25% score.
&gt; Pup is good enough on R&amp;D to stall them long enough. for you to beef up the defenses there.
&gt; Next turn you can begin power drawing with Jacko to get an economy server with that Sundew. Also, plug Archives so they don't get free Dirty Laundries there. HQ needs spiky ice on top so they can't bounce. R&amp;D needs beefy ice.

Another point in favor of putting down some ice is that with Cortex Lock (and Komainu, though that's more expensive) existing, facechecking anything unrezzed can come with a hefty net damage pricetag early, so Kate is likely a bit wary of facechecking without first spending a couple of MU."

Although my mother is a Filipina herself, i never made it to the country that is half a part of me :) Fortunately this changes upcoming August, when i will visit the Philippines for the first time. I will stay there for 12 weeks and my first 8 weeks will be dedicated to volunteering at an aid organization in Olongapo City. After that, i will have 3 more weeks for travelling. 

During the weekends of my internship i'm planning on covering the north of Luzon which means hiking on Mt. Pinatubo, travelling Zambales and visiting Manila. After my internship i would first like to visit Banaue and the Hundred Islands for a couple of days. Then i would like to fly from Manila to Cebu and visit Bohol for another couple of days, After that i would like to fly from Cebu to Sayak and stay the rest of my time on Siargao Islands, because thats the place my mother originates from. The Enchanted River and the Waterfalls in Surigao del Sur also tempt me but i figured that they might be too far away and we all know the rumors about Mindanao and safety... Do you have any suggestions for more destinations that are near those places? I know that there are a lot of other nice places (Palawan, etc.) but i wanted the less touristy route.

Speaking of safety, since i'm all alone what would you recommend? Naturally i have Filipino features with the exception that i'm blessed with European Aryan blood that makes me almost 2m (6""2) tall, so maybe this keeps some of the muggers away? :D I've heard that trouble already starts at the airport when it comes to cab finding. I'll arrive at 7 at the evening and have to find a hotel in Manila to stay overnight, so how do i not get killed by the cab driver?

I will also bring my GoPro and i would like to film and take a couple of photos. Most Youtube guys are pretty casual when it comes to displaying their stuff but when travelling alone it might be different, so what would you say on how to behave with film and photo equipment?

I guess that's all for now. Would be happy to hear any suggestions!"

**Update:** I had my assembly in section view, so I un-sectioned it and tried inserting a part. It worked and seems to be consistent! The parts must have started in the ""Invisible Zone"" and I would get lucky occasionally with inserting my part in the right section ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2. *If* I get accepted, I would have to delay school here a semester, what is your opinion on this? Would this look bad on my transcript if I took a semester off to co-op out of state? IT IS TESLA FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
3. If you have interned/co-oped for Tesla, what is your personal experience? Was it worth it?

3cswdj,1,2015-07-10,Need some life advice atm,life_imitating_art,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3cswdj/need_some_life_advice_atm/,"Ok, here we go. 

So I created an account specifically just to tell my story a bit and ask for some much needed advice. But first, let me give you all a little background...

I am a female in my 20's and I have been dealing with self-diagnosed social anxiety as far back as I can remember.  I had suffered from crippling shyness all throughout my childhood. On the bright side, though, I've adjusted very well imo and now, only have a slight fear of strangers and how they see me. I feel little to no shyness around coworkers or friends whatsoever. I even managed to keep a few close friends throughout my teens. In college, my friend circle only grew, and I even somehow landed an amazingly supportive boyfriend who I’m still happily with. For the most part, I had considered my anxiety completely manageable and myself, a success. 

About a year or two ago, though, I had started to experience what I now have a name for: depersonalization. Randomly I began to have the feeling that I was existing in my own head rather than on the ""outside"", and the rest of the world felt borderline unreal and/or dreamlike. At the same time, it was a fleeting feeling and went away on its own, I guess because I didn't focus too hard on it. It was scary, sure, but once I looked up the symptoms like the hypochondriac I am, I soon started to relax about it. 

Then... this summer happened. I had recently graduated from college with my degree in Psychology, and spent the weeks after job-searching. My plan was to find a job after college and start saving for my Master's education later down the road. Plus, I just wanted a break from school for once in my life. Ever since my dad passed away last year, my mom has been struggling financially so I knew I couldn’t rely on too much help after school. Unpaid internships and volunteer opportunities were not an option for me. Employment was a must.

So here I am, I'm three weeks in to the job search, and I start to have the depersonalization feelings again. These accompanied feelings of being lost and a horrible fear of not being able to find employment. I tried to shrug them off this time, but to no avail. Without school to keep me distracted, I started to become more and more worried while the world around me became vivid and bright, but distant all at the same time. I even started to wear sunglasses around the house because I was constantly bothered by how bright everything seemed, and I’m doing this as I type. 

I looked up my symptoms yet again, and had irrational fears that I was going crazy, that I was going to lose it completely. Then the insomnia started and I haven't had a normal sleep schedule these past few weeks because I started to worry severely as soon as I hit the bed. A few times, I have even woken up in a state of severe panic for no apparent reason.  I’ve been averaging about 3-6 hours every night. Sometimes when I wake up, I don’t even remember that I slept at all, even though I know I must have. Or I’ll lie in my bed for hours, my mind racing through paranoid thoughts like having a heart attack in my sleep (this was how my dad died last year) or just not being able to get sleep. 

On the bright side, I did end up finding employment a week ago, and have been going through training. Ironically, I am working in a group home with the developmentally disabled. You’d think that would make me feel more... mentally capable by comparison, but honestly, the new job feeling is stressing me out all the same. I’ve never had a full time job before, let alone one of this nature.  Even though I know I should be happy to be making money, I honestly feel just out-of-place. Maybe it’ll change once I get used to it, but I still feel strange in the mean time. 

TL;DR I’m adjusting to a new way of life—living by myself, fully employed, and being away from home for more than months at a time. Sometimes I feel so afraid of putting a strain of my relationship, going crazy, not getting sleep, just having every paranoid thought you could imagine, that I pull into a random parking lot in town just to cry in my car. And this all came on so suddenly, or it seems like. Basically I just wanted to know a few things from people who probably have a better concept of anxiety than I do:

Is it normal to feel this way at this stage in my life? Should I work on the feelings right now, try to let it pass, or seek treatment? Also, is there anything I can do physically (exercise, eating healthier) that will make me feel better mentally? I’m really just desperate to get back to feeling like myself again and stop feeling like a burden in my relationship, so I’ll try anything that may help!"

3csxc4,1,2015-07-10,Caprice Nisei,BountyHunterSAx,Netrunner,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/3csxc4/caprice_nisei/,"I'm asking for help. TL;DR is -- is there more logic/intellect to playing around this card than the 1/3 odds I'm seeing?

So, I'm going to start this by saying nobody in my meta plays RP. That's not strictly speaking true, but it's close enough. I thought of the sundew/mental health/ELP/caprice w/taxy ice/Nisei-chain  RP deck in some form or another, as did others n my meta. Nobody in my meta thinks its particularly fair OR fun and so we don't play it.

Of all the players in my meta, only one uses Caprice Nisei ... and it's in an Industrial Genomics deck that plays out VERY differently. . .  so it doesn't feel as oppressive as it might otherwise have. It feels more 'deserved'.

It is my belief that the success or failure of a run is too precious/core/important a thing to be left in the hands of a psi-game. Stealing an agenda? Ehh, ok. Trashing a program? It's painful, but I can see it if the costs/triggers are right. But something as important as ""does a run succeed or fail?"" No. That should always be something that can be played around. Math'd around. Reasoned and prepared for with the only uncertainties being which ICE/Upgrades and whatnot since THAT hidden information is part of the game.


Apparently, FFG's designers disagree with me as they not only printed this mistake of a card but ALSO printed another Psi-Game ETR with no workaround in the form of Marcus Batty.



So if Psi-games are part of the game, and they're a part of the game that's here to stay, then my question is how do I deal with it? I feel like the card is unfair in that it negates any level of power by luck.
Say a runner is CRUSHING the corp economically. You've got 20 credits to their 6 and a full suite of breakers. They have a mélange they can't hope to protect behind an Eli 1.0. One run and 1-5 credits should be enough to kill it. But with caprice [net cost to rez server: 5], you're gonna spend 4 (psigame) + 4 (psigame) on average before you get in. Ten credits is a lot for just a gamble at maybe stopping them from getting all the money.

How do I deal with this? I don't want to be forced to treat every caprice'd server like it's unassailable. But I don't really see any other way. Mathematically, it will cost me 2 runs on average AND I need to float enough money to make those runs threaten an access. This is ignoring, of course, the scored Nisei Mk2 and mandatory first-click central bullshit that is RP.

The only solution I can think of is, again, math. Get the corp down to 0 credits. Then you know what they'll bid. Alternatively, get them down to 1 credit and run it twice. The problems with this strategy are that:
1.) It pigeonholes me into only playing ""econ-denial"" runners.
2.) It requires corps to be so bad at making money that they have a hard time consistently floating any. If you can pull that off consistently you just win anyway; no corp is in such a weak position.

When I went visiting another game store, someone explained: ""There is always a 'right' amount for the corp to bid based on the board state. So if you're up against a good player you should be able to read that. If you 'just choose randomly' then the corp ALWAYS gets a head by bidding 0."" I agree with this notion in principle; but in practice I just don't see it. Credit totals are seldom so low that 0/1/2 is a big decision for the corporation.
If I played 10 psigames in a row, and bid 0 ~60% of the time, but favored lower numbers when the corp was poor and higher numbers when they weren't, odds are more in my favor. But you don't GET to play 10 in a row. You need to run that many times. And pass all the ice that many times. This is brutal.

This brings me to option 3 for how to deal with Caprice-eous bullshit:
3.) Ice trashing. 
If you kill the ice protecting a Caprice, then it's multiplicatively-cheaper to get in repeatedly, because you aren't paying whatever tax(es) they set up more than once. Problem? Two things. One, pigeon-holing. Only anarchs can consistently have loads of options for ice-destruction ... and shapers can often do it. Criminals are in much worse shape here. Two it's a VERY temporary solution. There are 16-22 ice in a corp's deck, and all it takes to undo your time, money, and setup of killing one piece is to draw a few times and ""click-install"" another. Worse yet if they have interns.


So yeah, Caprice Nisei. I don't fight it in my meta often enough to have developed good counterplay. I find it offensive as a card (designwise) enough that I neither play it myself nor 'respect' it as a 'healthy' part of the game. But all this impotent rage doesn't fix the problem that it's there. In every tournament, carving bonsai trees whether I face it or not. So I'm hoping that I'm missing an obvious strat/line of play/line of thinking to counter it.

Have at it people."

I'm 20 and long story short, I want out from my abusive mother for good. I've foolishly relegated all the handling of my advanced financial and tax stuff to my mum, so I have no idea what the hell to do on my own, but desperately want to learn.

I'm currently living away from home, so that makes things easier and more difficult at the same time. A rundown of my life:

**-FACTS ABOUT ME-**

* Parents: Mother lives in a different city, father works/resides out of country

* Currently close to graduating (school paid for by my dad's RESP, no student debt thank fuck)

* A lot of my financial and ID papers are still at home (I'm going to swing by home for one last visit to reclaim all of it)

* Currently unemployed (trying to seek out something simple and minimum wage while I work at a 9-5 internship that could hopefully turn into employment)


**-CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION-**

**My TD Bank account**


* $2600 in Equity (RRSP, TFSA)

* $430 in Chequing/Savings

* Currently $0 in CC or any sort of debt

**Bills and expenses**

* $100/mo for food expenses

* Currently no cellphone plan of my own, considering dropping the family contract and switching to Wind with a cheaper phone ($40/mo)

* $550/mo for Rent (internet and hydro included)

* $40 for Presto Pass/Commuting


I know I'm not looking too hot at the moment, and sadly a lot of it was my own foolish reckless spending. I'm currently considering transferring stuff out of equity to address immediate needs, so I can very well at least keep my head above water for now.

What are some things that I as someone ignorant of independent living in regards to finances and taxes should do? Are there programs, bursaries or other auxilaries to add to my finances?


Thank you all very much!"

Learned before we even started dating that we'd be going off to different Universities. Got really close regardless of that well known fact. 


My wonderful girlfriend of 6 months is an absolutely amazing human being. She is beautiful, caring, thoughtful, determined, and very smart. 


Her plans lie within the range of finishing up college (Majoring in Neuroscience), attending Medical School, getting through her Residency and moving along with her internships (Or whatever it is Doctors have to do). She will become a Neurosurgeon. I have not and will never doubt her ability to strive in this field, or any other field she might be interested in. I care about this girl. I love this girl.


I met her parents a while back and we talked (alone) for hours on end - they wanted to know more about me, I wanted to know more about them. I learned about her families' values, their expectations of me and her, and got to get a feel for what it would be like in the future. Her parents (like mine) are not rich. We are a part of the American lower-middle class (Maybe even lower-class?), and are immigrants working off a highschool dropout education - VERY hard working people whom I respect a hell of a lot. Her mother does not work, her father works 4:30 AM to 6 PM six days a week. Without college, their living situation is manageable. She has a younger sister who is 4 years from graduating high school (and dealing with planning for college). 

Her parents are extremely supportive of her academic decisions. She's been involved in programs in school and out of school for the entire duration of her High School career and has always managed to stay at the top 5% of our class; she is an absolutely amazing student. 

Last year she visited [Private University] and fell absolutely in love with it. She is currently set to attend for the rest of the summer (some sort of early start program for 1st generation students) and her Freshman year. ONE semester of college for her is approximately worth FOUR semesters (2 years) at basically any other PUBLIC university (without even considering any sort of scholarships she could apply for that are not offered by this private institution). She loves the environment, feels comfortable with all of the people she has met thus far, and can really see herself there for the next 4 years of her life. She realizes it will be hard to stay on top - the current courses she plans to take are challenging.

I love her to death, but I feel as if she does not realize the financial situations she is going to put herself and her family through if she decides to attend for the duration of her college career. I have heard of the horror stories of people graduating from Medical School with upwards of 350k in debt. I realize most everybody (including myself) will struggle to pay off loans after school, though, I do not want her to end up regretting her decision. This is obviously a lot of money - ~200k of which she will be expected to pay off starting a few months after she graduates with her BACHELORS (No med school, no M.D. title yet; Not making any of that sweet Neurosurgeon dosh just yet). 

I am worried for her and her family. Her father has urged her to take the loans under her own name, understandably. I see a prideful father whose only goal is to bring up a successful daughter - a man who has lived through hell, and realizes the importance of sacrifice. My girlfriend, bless her heart, has yet to learn the importance of sacrifice. I have yet to learn the importance of sacrifice. I wish to god that the money would miraculously appear out of nowhere - I want her to enjoy her college years as much as she wishes to, but this massive price tag is making me worry about whether or not it will all be worth it for her. 

We have talked about continuing the relationship past high school after we've moved on to our respective universities. I blatantly told her the idea of being away from her for more than a year scares me to death and would be extremely hard to deal, though, I would be willing to go through with it. One of her main options for a transfer would be the [Public] University I am attending (Best public school in the state, Top 50 school in the nation). I am scared that if I ask her to consider a transfer to my school she will think I am asking her to drop all her personal goals and aspirations for me.

Yes, the idea of being together for the remainder of college excites the hell out of me - I would be 127% for that idea. I do want what is best for her. Though I still am unsure as to how the hell I would go about telling her how I feel about the financial situation she's setting herself up for without making it seem like I am the only reason I want her to transfer.
   
I have never posted on this sub and have barely browsed, I am sorry if I messed up any of the formatting. Any holes I might have left or any questions at all feel free to ask, I am looking for any sort of input on the situation.

The reason I did not mark this post under [Relationships] is because I simply want what's best for her, I do not want myself to get in the way of her bigger dreams and aspirations. I am aware I am a stupid lovestruck recent High School graduate. I just want her to realize that, sadly, money is too important to disregard.


**tl;dr**: Girlfriend decided to go to an expensive private school for College, I feel as if she doesn't realize just how badly it will screw up her financials afterwards (potentially ~$350k+ in debt), how do I convince her to reconsider?"

I expect 95% of you aren't medical professionals, and as such will assume none of you are (no offense intended). I'm not going to interpret what you're saying as affirmative diagnosis so much as an outside take on how cautious I should be.

So: I went to bed early last night because I was feeling a bit bored and down. I woke up early, which isn't unusual for me when I go to bed early. I got a normal amount of sleep. I was telling our mod the other day how early morning sunlight can contribute to mania for me, and perhaps it has contributed. I'm typing pretty fast right now...and apparently making more mistakes doing so than usual.

I had my normal breakfast...perhaps a bit more milk in my coffee than usual (I've been really conscientious about what I'm eating since I've been doing two calorie trackers (overachieving much?). After that I sat down and played Diablo 3 for at least two hours. It's not unusual for me to play it in the morning; I often do so before going in for my internship.

Here's where things start going differently: because I have plans this evening, I decided it would be a good idea to have extra caffeine today. Sometimes when I'm in the mood for it, rather than brewing a pot of regular coffee (which I tend to make like six cups of at a time, since I feel like any less and it comes out stupidly weak) I would brew a mug of espresso. That's right, not a shot, not two shots; a mug. I used to do this in college when I was on vyvanse. Sometimes I'd have two. This might've been why I did so well those semesters.

So most days I have two cups of coffee. By having a mug of espresso I at least tripled my intake for today. Now, I planned to go for a hike today, since it's my day off and I really want to lose weight. I learned that hiking on hills burns something close to 800 calories an hour awhile back, so I've been doing that to work out much more often.

So after I finish my espresso and complete what I was doing in diablo, I get my shit together for the hike. Planning ahead, I got my nalgene bottle for tons of water, grabbed jeans instead of shorts so I didn't risk ticks as badly this time around (it's a trade-off due to the heat), and drove off to hike.

I went for the hike that took me 45 minutes to complete last time and do it in 30. So I hike some more. And some more. Because I decided I damn well wanted to do it for an hour to burn as many calories as possible. It wasn't enough that on the first loop where it only took me 30 minutes I started dry heaving and at multiple points my heart was aching from working so hard. In my defense I've gotten two EKGs on my heart recently--one of which was a stress test--and have been exercising past this point frequently lately.

So far I've netted negative calories today (~-400). I feel pretty damn motivated and am thrilled I'll be seeing old friends tonight and the girl I keep finding myself crushing on wants to go out for drinks tomorrow.

I'm gonna be going grocery shopping for my parents later (always a good plan while manic xD), and have to clean the house before my friends sleep over; which usually pushes me towards mania.

**TL;DR:**

* Great mood (check)

* Tons of energy (check with the caveat that caffeine is involved)

* Woke up early but with the same amount of sleep

* Intense motivation to lose weight (check)

* Anxiety? (Not yet)

* Extended period of time? Nope.

So because I took [this](http://psychology-tools.com/altman-self-rating-mania-scale/) mania test and scored 15/20 (overestimating how often I've been like this), I'm thinking I'm probably manic. If it's just one day like this and there are stimuli causing it, would you say in your presumably non medically trained opinion I'm manic?

Afterthought: you may want to bookmark that mania test since it could come in useful."
3ctf7i,6,2015-07-10,My day so far,Chadmv95,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/3ctf7i/my_day_so_far/,"As a preface, I work as an intern at a computer software company.

So I woke up this morning, still a little high. So I thought hey I'll just have a very small bowl and ride out the day on a nice relaxing high. I get to work and I sit in my chair. Within 5 minutes my manager comes and starts talking to me about this confusing computer stuff. He stops his sentence to allow me to intelligently respond to what he just said. Little did he know I was high. And all I could respond with was ""wow 20 GIGABYTES that's a LOT!""  he looks at me with a face of resentment and disgust. He walks away. The guy sitting next to me asks if I'm okay, to which I reply, ""of course"". He then let's me know that all my manager did was ask me about my weekend plans. I've only been at work for 10 minutes. This was a bad idea."
3ctjgv,3,2015-07-10,Me [21F] with my boyfriend [21M] who has completely flipped behavior and stopped trying seemingly overnight.,wanderingwonderingg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ctjgv/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_21m_who_has_completely/,"**Long story short:** Lets call my boyfriend Ryan. I have known Ryan for about a year and a half, we started dating 7 months ago and everything was great. We had issues, such as my jealousy and perhaps lingering on the past. I worked to get past things, as did he, but still fought about dumb things often. I know much of the fighting was me being immature, but didn't see it as such a huge issue until recently. I've struggled with depression and anxiety in the past and have recently had it come back. I know it was difficult for Ryan to deal with my mood swings and aggressiveness, but he always seemed to not let it phase him. Another notable difference between Ryan and I is that whenever we fight or are mad, I forgive and move past as quickly as possible because I would rather take care of the issue and not let bad vibes linger, Ryan on the other hand needs alot of time to ferment and maybe move past. This difference has always been very difficult, because I often lose, motivation to forgive and move on because hes going to be mad for hours or days.

Like most men, Ryan is rather unexpressive, but has made great strides in our relationship that he has never done in the past. I am quite expressive and emotional, so when he doesn't tell me how hes feeling in a fight or disagreement, it drives me crazy. I know these are normal struggles, but the issue continues.

After my ~3 weeks of severe depression (not wanting to move, crying often, missing home[am at college for the summer, instead of going home like usual], nausea), I finally was able to go back to my homestate for a week. I was so excited since I always feel refreshed after going home to family and comfort, even though I know I'd miss Ryan. But I figured the refreshed version of me would be good for us. Ryan has recently started an internship at a large accounting firm and is happier there than ever, but I am no where in that happy equation.

When he picked me up from the airport 3 days ago, I was not happy to be back in this place because I had been missing home, I was excited to see him but lost the feeling when he wasnt there. After a few minutes, I found him but he didnt seem as excited to see me and I didnt have motivation to beg him for the recognition. We got in the car with my sour attitude and after a trecherous journey trying to find an open restaurant after July 4, finally got home. We both laid down far away from eachother and didnt even speak. After a few minutes, I said ""well this is awkward. What are we gonna do about it? Do you want to breakup?"". He said that he didnt want to break up and wanted to be with me. After a few minutes of my badgering him, he whispered, ""I think I do"". He meant he wanted to break up. It hit me hard.

It all hit me and I realized I had gone too far, I couldn't keep pushing him away like this. I begged him to give me another chance so I would fix my jealousy/trust issues. I would accuse him of ridiculous things just because of my past. I realized I couldnt take it out on him and tried to overcome my trust issues. Things seemed to be okay after this but I felt like I couldn't do anything wrong or it would just be over again. It didn't feel like he was there anymore. All I could wonder was that if I hadn't pushed him to say anything about brekaing up, was he going to anyway?
Its been about 3 days since then, and nothing has felt the same. I no longer feel that he cares or puts in effort unless I beg him to. I took off work the day after I got back to spend time with him because it had been a couple weeks since we had quality time together. He said he had to go pick up our washed sheets from his mothers house, but I said no its okay we have other ones. He quickly admitted to having plans with his friends that morning, but I just couldnt understand why it was so important to eat breakfast with his friends when I had been gone for a couple week and we were going through this problem. I wanted it to be back to normal so badly.

**Quick side note:** we moved in together 2 months ago thinking it would be fine and we could save about $600
I came home that night after work and we discussed but just ended up crying as he looked at me. I felt so empty. Its like everything changed in that one moment the night before. He constantly expressed that he wanted to work this out and be with me. I wanted the same but I don't know what to do anymore. Yesterday morning he said he was sorry for being a dick, and I said okay but then he was quickly irritable again within a fe hours and I was afraid to say anything in fear of making him angry again, but it just hurt so much not to express how much he was hurting my feelings. I would cry and he wouldnt even look at me. I know this is his coping mechanism, he numbs himself to feeling. I just want to know how to bring him out of this so we can focus on the issues that got us here.

He went to a baseball game with his internship last night so I didnt see him the entire day. He called me before leaving for the game and was interuppted by another call from his friend. I have been waiting all week for today because I knew we both were free this afternoon after work. His friend called him to ask to hang out today. Ryan switched back to me and said he is going to hang out with his friend. While we hadnt explicitly planned our time together today, I thought naturally that he would want to spend time with me today after he had already busy on monday.

Main problem: I feel that he is so distant now, I'm worried theres no way to get him back. He keeps saying he is acting normal and wants to be with me, but I just feel no effort or love from him. All I want is simply things like hugs and kisses and consideration, but he only gets mad when I speak up about it. I'm afraid he is in denial about ending things, but he just says that he wants to be with me and work this out, even when I tell him he can be honest. He talks about the new people he meets and says how cool and amazing they are. I just feel scared and threatened. I'm not sure whether to keep fighting for him or to just end it now.

I know results aren't instant, I have just been begging for some kind of sign that he still cares. I can't just keep going off of his words. I am trying to allow myself to be vulnerable and trust, but I feel only coldness from his actions. All I really want is a full chance for him to let me in again, I know I am at fault for some of this and am trying to be more reasonable, I just need him to let me. For now when we are together, I can tell his mind is not there. It's breaking my heart and hurting me so much, but I know I need to let go if this continues because I am trying with my all.
I'm not sure if I've gotten my problem across, but please ask questions if it will help you help me.


Also I understand that we are still young, but that doesnt mean this isnt a problem. Whichever way this goes, I'd like to say I tried my best and use my knowledge in the future.


**TLDR:** I've pushed my boyfriend to numbness with my jealous accusations, do I have hope of reconciling?

I've been fighting off a panic attack basically since 430 am when I woke up. It's a multipronged one too and it's like right at the edge and getting harder and harder to push back when I feel it creeping in again. I'm worried that I won't be able to hold it back until I get home and it will hit me full force while I am still at work. 

And work is part of the reason that it is there in the first place. The prongs are the following.

1. I started at this company and there were four of us who are administrative assistant interns and responsible for the duties that need to get done. It was pretty easy because there were four of us to do it all. About 3 weeks after starting one left, which I was aware was going to happen when I started. So, then all the duties were shifted to three and it still wasn't bad because there were three of us. And then Wednesday I learned that the woman I shared a cubical with wouldn't be returning after Thursday. So, now, there are only two of us to do all that four were doing. And the other woman who is at my level often has other important duties that need to get done other than what we do and so as a result I'm basically going to be carrying the work load that was once spread across three people. So, I'm feeling pretty panicky about that. 

2. We are going on vacation the first week of August and now have no money in our vacation fund account because of the ineptitude of the manager at our apartment complex. So, we are going to be trying to put away enough money to take with us in three weeks time *and* we will have to try and pay all our bills this month on top of it. And we can't *not* go because the place where we are staying we have already paid for and the money has already come out and there is no refund if we don't show up. So, we can't just flush $700 down the toilet. I'm considering just not paying the bills until after we get back so that we have plenty of money to take with us since we are traveling out of state and in case something goes horribly wrong it is important we have some kind of safety net. 

3. This is the thing that I think is causing the worst of it. I am going to my adoptive family's family reunion tomorrow. I'm so happy and excited to be going....but the catch is that my adoptive parents are going to be there. The adoptive parents who I was removed from when I was 15 because of the horrific abuse I suffered at the hands of my adoptive mother. I cut them out of my life the day I turned 18 and haven't had any sort of contact with them since then. And now, I'm going to be confronted by them. I'm so scared that seeing her will reduce me to a pile of jelly and I will regress to that terrified, emotionally unstable mess I was when I was a teenager. And I am also worried that she will end up saying something that sets my husband off and he goes off on her. I know that it is my fault that I am experiencing this panic and fear about this right now, because I am the one who is choosing to willingly go some where where I know it is extremely likely that they are going to be there. I could probably solve it quite easily by just not going. But there are going to be people there that I haven't seen since I was 15 or younger. And damn it I am tired of limiting the time I spend with the other members of my adoptive family because of my fear of that monster. 

Anyway, at least writing this all out has pushed the panic attack back again. Lets hope it stays there until I can get home. "
3ctmzz,0,2015-07-10,"Fed up with mooching, attention-seeking, histrionic friend...",bitter_resentful,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3ctmzz/fed_up_with_mooching_attentionseeking_histrionic/,"I’ve been close friends with “B” for about 3 years now, although I’ve known her for longer.  She’s always been fun, energetic, and more than a little weird – which I like. There are lots of things I really like about her. But lately, there’s way more about her personality and our relationship that I absolutely can’t stand. 

For most of her early 20s, B was a stripper. I was never bothered by it - she was safe and didn’t use drugs, plus she had a lot of fun and made really good money. In the meantime, I was finishing up my college degree and starting an internship. We saw each other all the time and had tons of fun together. 

Then, about two years ago, she decided to quit stripping. I was supportive and excited for her to start this new chapter in her life. But she became deeply depressed as she struggled to adapt to a life with much less money – and attention. This all came happened just as I was hired full time and was actually bringing in a decent wage for the first time in my life. I did my best to be there for her emotionally and help her out financially. I was happy to pay for nights out once in a while, give her rides, bring over food etc. 

However, the situation quickly began to turn into her mooching off of everyone at every opportunity, especially me. She was never particularly grateful for any help (financial or emotional) that she received from any of her friends, and started to simply EXPECT people to pay for everything, drive everywhere, and go through a lot of trouble to help her out in a variety of situations. She hasn’t looked for a new job, and won’t go back to school. She’s making about $11/hour in a call center and seems to have enough money to keep her wardrobe well updated and eat out nearly every day. 

It seems like she’s constantly manipulating people to save a few bucks here and there.  This alone is bad enough, but she doesn’t seem to think anyone notices, which is insulting. At best, she’s ungrateful and entitled about these favors. At worst, she’s expectant and indignant.

I think her entitled, mooching behavior is making me notice other personality traits that never used to bother me TOO much, but have now become completely repellant. Either that, or these behaviors have simply gotten worse… honestly, I’m starting to wonder if she has a histrionic personality. 

-	She needs constant attention and approval – she fishes for compliments constantly, usually about hair or makeup or clothes. If she isn’t getting compliments voluntarily, she’ll brag about herself nonstop.
-	She always wants the conversation to be about her- I’ve been embarrassed by how rude she is sometimes. She regularly interrupts people and attempts to turn the conversation back to herself.
-	She is a very funny / witty person, and doesn’t get embarrassed easily. Unfortunately, this often means that she’ll bring attention to herself by talking about inappropriate or deliberately explicit things. I’ve been extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed on numerous occasions because of this. 
-	She’s been unusually rude and short with me. She’ll be extremely bossy and condescending towards me, and seems to get annoyed with me really easily. 

I’ve gotten pretty fed up with all this lately, and have stopped feeding into a lot of this behavior. At the same time, I’ve been trying to remain a good friend and be as kind as possible. But I HAVE cut back a lot on time spent with her, mostly for the sake of my sanity. I can tell she’s feeling excluded lately, and can’t figure out why. It also seems like she’s frustrated her techniques aren’t working as much anymore. 

I really miss the fun, generous, encouraging friend she used to be. But I’m not sure anymore if that’s who she really is, or if she was just like that in the beginning because she was trying to impress me. I also don’t know how to tell her all the behaviors that are driving so many people away without deeply hurting her. 

I miss feeling like I can trust her, open up to her, and have fun with her without worrying that I’m being taken advantage of. Or getting upset when the conversation becomes all about her (again), or when she’s rude or short with me after I just did her a favor. I'm torn between feeling manipulated, and missing my friend. "

3cu0yj,3,2015-07-10,Need advice on possibly rather large life event (long read) housing / employment / auto / budgeting,S5EX1dude,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3cu0yj/need_advice_on_possibly_rather_large_life_event/,"Hello people of /r/personalfinance,

I have a possible ‘extreme’ life event coming up and would like some advice on financial planning or any other advice from people who went through anything similar.

Background info: 

I currently go to school for engineering and work an internship in Michigan. I am a Junior this fall, planning to graduate “on time” in two years. I met my girlfriend in high school and we have been dating for the past 2.5 years. She lives in New York, 6 hours away. She is going to college for Media Production (Cinematography) and will be starting sophomore year in the fall. She works two jobs, seven days a week during the summer, one is a managers (retail) position at a Goodwill. The other is an appraiser/ customer assistant at an antique mall. During the fall she will likely have to quit one of these jobs. During the summer I work 30 hours a week and go to class 7 hours a week. During the fall we are both full time students. We try to see each other as much as possible, which ends up being little more than one weekend a month. We both miss each other and have come to the conclusion that we are wasting the best years of our lives being separate. Whenever we’re together it is always a grand adventure and we both crave that, daily, when we’re apart. We’re both miserable with the people we currently live, and the drab of day to day life without each other, and just want to finally live and spend our lives together.
So, the point is, she has decided that she is sick of her jobs, her college, and working away the best years of her life, so she wants to come live with me in Michigan. She would try to find a job out here and possibly look to go back to school, maybe for cosmetology.

**Here are the points we need advice and help with:**

* She is thinking of transferring to a Goodwill out here for work, if this doesn’t work out, there doesn’t seem to be many opportunities out here in the city, other than fast-food, grocery jobs, ect… I might be wrong but I can’t really think of any other jobs around here that aren’t in the tech sector.
* We need to find a 1br/1ba apartment near my school, less than $800/mo that includes gas, water, electric, free laundry, and has a kitchen (at least a stove and fridge). Or, a place that doesn’t include these, but when added in to cost would still total up to less than $800/ mo. I have never gone apartment shopping before (having lived in student housing only) and have no idea where or how to start. The whole paying just to apply process seems intimidating and sketchy.
* Her car is in rough shape. She is planning on paying $500 to get things like brakes and tie rod and some other issues repaired, but it is still not a car I would be comfortable having her drive 300 miles at 70mph to get here. She was wondering whether to put in the money to repair it to then list it on Craigslist for ~$2000, or sell it for scrap value now and put that money plus the money she would have spent on repairs (and maybe more) towards a new car that could make the trip out here easier and safer. Then it would probably be a daily driver under 50 miles a day.
* Right now she is under my mom’s health insurance as a minor because she was independent and living at her grandmother’s house before, having not been to a dentist in over 5 years.. She now lives in an apartment but my mother still has her on the insurance. If she moves to MI from NY, will that affect this? Will she need new insurance? Could she possibly file for something from the gov, because of her independence status? 
* She thought about transferring to a school out here under some “sister college program” that would essentially be a student exchange program, if her school has that. If not, she has no loan debt so she may just drop out and work out here until she can qualify for in-state tuition, and then start film school, or just start cosmetology school immediately because it is cheaper. She is also open to other ideas and is not 100% sure what she wants as a career, she just knows that she doesn’t want a career in accounting or the like, but enjoys artistic ventures. Are there any other degrees or career paths that she could consider that she possibly hasn’t thought of yet? Should she just stick with the program she is in just to “have a degree”? Also, pertaining to this, what are some good interesting jobs for one without a degree, that can pay decently?
* Everyone on this thread likes to talk about having a safety net of cash just in case things go wrong. Well, this being a relatively large change in our lives that could potentially go catastrophic, what amount would be wise to have set aside before we go for it? We both make a decent amount of money, for college students that is.

Me, summer: $400/wk, fall: $300/wk. Her (assuming still in school in NY and at current job), summer: $350/wk, fall: $200/wk.   (after taxes)

Expenditures /week Me: Gas+Groceries= $50-60. Her: Gas+Groceries+Rent= $120. Or, $220/month, me. $480/month, her.

I’m also paying off classes, out of pocket, to minimize my school loans (currently 20k, probably up to 25k in the fall, but I have 5k in the bank), she has no school loans and government pays for her schooling. She has $3500 in the bank. Neither of us have parental financial assistance. Also, if she stays in school another year she will get another $4k grant plus $1k scholarship which could help with the car, moving etc. but she does not want to stay another year… She could also save up more money from her jobs, but again is not happy with her schooling and living situation. 
The trip itself to move all her stuff out here will probably be about $150-200.

Also, can we take pets (ferrets) over the Canadian border? Do we have to state that she is moving? Is it a better idea to just go through the states to avoid the hassle? The Canadian route usually saves me about an hour when going home. Are apartments usually okay with small pets like ferrets?

Is there any info that I’ve missed? Is there anything you need to do before you move to a new state? Will she need a new registration/ license? What things do people usually need to do before they move states?

Lastly, is this even a good idea? We have both been thinking about it for months, she says she can’t stand it anymore, so we’re getting serious about the idea, hence me asking you, gracious people of /r/personalfinance, for help.

Any advice or considerations would be extremely appreciated. Thanks so much in advance :)

PS. There is an important academy that she has been trying to get into at her school that would propel her into a very unpredictable career path that could send her all over the country, moving us further apart (which she fears). I constantly tell her she needs to do what would make her most happy in the long run, and she believes it would be moving out here with me, but I just want her to be able to take a chance at her dreams first. She says living with me and working anywhere would make her just as happy if not more, but I think I would feel guilty not persuading her to at least give it another shot (she didn’t make it in the first time around). 

Thanks again,

3cu14i,18,2015-07-10,ENFP mental health/burnout/etc.,justanotherjobseeker,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/3cu14i/enfp_mental_healthburnoutetc/,"Just wondering if other ENFPs have any coexisting mental health conditions they are going through or have ever burned out and have any stories or experiences they'd like to share.

Right now, as my username should imply, I'm looking for a job. Currently, I'm volunteering, etc. I'm starting to slowly recover from burnout and depression after graduating.

I guess what happened in my situation was that when I first started college, I had a lot of enthusiasm and energy. Thought I'd meet a lot of people who are passionate and excited about what they're doing. The problem was as an ENFP, I'm so interested in tons of things, that I didn't have a fixed clue as to what I wanted to do. I figured I wanted to be pre-med, but there were so many things I wanted to learn. I was going to double major, but in what? I liked Economics, Biology (anatomy &amp; physiology), International Relations. I was signed up as a biomedical engineer at first even though I wasn't feeling engineering (too much STEM for my personality). But I love biology and did very well in both chemistry and physics. 

I decided to be ""undeclared"" for my first two years so I can figure out what I want to do by my second year. I found out instead that I got into a very competitive program based on my high school performance. The catch is that while it's competitive and basically students graduate with an advanced degree in a very specific field that, at the time I got into school, was very lucrative, stable with assumed job openings everywhere, most students end up doing the same things academically/experimentally while in school. There's not much you can do to set yourself apart and that was okay at the time because there were more jobs available than students. There isn't much you can do outside of this field with my degree because it relates to a specific area.

I was very unsure about doing this degree because of the fact that you can't specialize and also end up doing routine tasks at the job. But my family was so proud and I could tell they were uneasy by my initial indecisiveness. They did say they would be happy if I did anything I wanted but you can tell when that's half true. I met a girl who came from overseas too and who was impressed that I got in and told me she tried but didn't. I felt incredibly guilty for being kind of ungrateful: like I had this gig practically lined up for me with an in-state tuition that can make a lot of money. In addition, I had friends and fam asking me what I wanted to do with my other majors ""what are you going to do with an international studies/bio double major"" &amp; like ""every job eventually gets boring"". I pictured myself studying something I loved and ended up working at a boring job I hated more than what I could have done in this program I got into. I felt that I needed to push myself out of my idealism and get real.

But as I went through school, every year I was feeling continuously less ambitious and motivated. I had no idea what I was working towards. Before, I used to just read up books on biology for fun. I was e-mailing different labs to see if I could do research assistance (which is something nobody in my major does) Now I had to force  myself to study and be realistic. But it was a challenge.

I saw my grades fall, my motivation continuing to decline. My friendships were making me more anxious and depressed than enriching my life. I was being used for either emotional support or schoolwork. The other students in my class who were ""more responsible"" were kind of over-the-top Type As who were just interested in my major because it made them feel smart rather than being passionate about the content of what we would be doing. Sadly, for a really ""good"" major, nobody was interested in anything else outside of what we were doing.  I needed work experience and I did everything to try to secure a job in my field, but I wasn't able to find anything. My friends had worse grades than I did, but they found jobs in a shorter time of span than I was looking. It was basically a hit or miss-the employers kept telling me they had ""no room"" for people in my class when I was employing, although a few students got hired later. I practiced my interview skills with somebody. In one interview I went for a certain company, I was amazed that the employer suddenly started to vent in front of me. She told me how much she hated her job and how tough it is to get herself to work everyday. I didn't know if I wanted to work there, but they ended up not having openings anyway. A lot of the places have now started to short-staff to save money, so it made it harder for me to find something.

I basically cruised through school without real work experience. My college hooked me up with a few sparse unpaid internships, but being an unpaid intern is basically being a volunteer amongst paid staff who'll either have a lot to use you for or have nothing at all for you. I did learn a few things, but it was difficult coming in without a job. A couple of times, supervisors raised their eyes when I said I didn't have a job. They asked several times why and I told them I couldn't find anything. I felt even more stupid.

I kept losing passion and enthusiasm for everything. I was more bored than I was busy. I was losing organization and detail skills. I used to clean my room every weekend and now I don't even make my bed. It's like a constant ""what's the point"". 

The only thing that helped was using Twitter/Reddit when I got in my 3rd-4th year. I used social media too much. The articles here and the people I met was everything I wanted in a college academic and social life. I used to read 8-10 articles on new things everyday. I've gained insight that I never had before. This was rekindling the lost passion, although not directly helping with my academic/job situation. I started to go to after school lectures at various universities to hear on the interesting topics i picked up from the internet. This was in my last year when I should have been studying for my certification exam so I can get my ""real"" ""big kid"" job. But I had zero work experience in school, my major although once touted for ""job availability"" was becoming far more competitive with more graduates than jobs a year or two before I graduated. Because it's so specific, my leadership roles, involvement and few research assistant roles were not convincing to employers. They want to see hard evidence of involvement in SPECIFICALLY my field, not that I was working in an EMT-type role and could take vital signs. I ended up slacking on the exam study, failing it my first round (which is ridiculous because it has a high pass rate-and I graduated with a fair, decent GPA). I was just so depressed at home feeling like a failure. I'm re-studying for my exam applying to all kinds of jobs even outside my major, but like I said, my field is so specific, I'm either ""overqualified"" or don't have qualifications that translate to other jobs. I'm just wicked depressed. Everytime I try to study again, I'm reminded I failed my exam and feel like I just failed throughout college. I think about the time I used to be so upbeat and passionate and actually was focused on school and can't even finish one thing anymore. I don't know what I'm doing at all, to be honest. This is the worst burnout I've ever experienced. I do have anxiety/depression all my life but everything just feels empty. I wish I chose medical school like I initially intended to because I realize I feel like although med is hard, it's that constant learning, taking exams and working in experiences that gives it so much to do that my mind can stay busy with different tasks. But I'm afraid sometimes that I'm not capable. My depression is surely awful right now.

I was starting to consider buying stuff to contribute to the sessions (my own glass, trees etc.) but I had to quit smoking 30-40 days before a pre employment drug test that helped me to land a seriously sweet internship. This internship is great as it can very possibly land me a career in the future! All was well, and I passed! Now to where I'm at right now....I've been working here for around 10 weeks and I haven't been able to smoke this whole time because they have a pretty strict no drug use policy (federal government job)  and they do frequent random drug tests.  I'm always browsing /r/trees, as well as related subs and I have started to join the smoking community without really being able to smoke. I popped into a smoke shop for the first time (having recently turned 18) and I was in awe! I couldn't leave without getting something--I purchased a grinder. Then a week later I bought a pipe. A week after that I bought a vaporizer (Pax 2). I'm also looking into the process of getting my medical card being that I've had 4 major hip surgeries in 3 years, and I do experience a lot of pain. I don't really know where I'm going with this, but all I know is that come August 5th, I'm gonna be ready to experience the greatest smoke session of my life!! Everything is in place, the only obstacle in my way is time...so smoke one for me fellow ents, it seems like these 3 weeks are going to take an eternity. Maybe some of you can give me some advice or ask questions..

Give me some tips as a new smoker. What's the best way to go through the process to attain my medical card? Talk to me about what I am to expect my freshman year of college. Anything goes!

I am a 19 year old (20 in late august) college student attending community college in California. I will transfer to a 4-year university starting in fall of 2016 as an economics major. I will study there for two years to get my degree. My college will be paid for in full by my parents so I will not have any debts. I know that this already puts me at a much better standing and I have my parents to thank for that.

Starting in a month, I will either be interning for something related to my major (I'm waiting for responses) or I will be working as a security guard (if I cannot get an internship in my field). On top of that, starting in fall, I will also have a job on campus from my community college. As I stated above, my parents are funding my college life. This means that my only expenditures will occur in fall of 2016 when I transfer. I will be working both of these jobs throuh next fall and after I transfer, I will be spending about $1700-2200 on a few things I want (including a computer and a revamped wardrobe).

What should I be doing now (or even later)? What should I be planning for? What should I be looking into?

tldr; college student, going to be working soon, parents paying for the next few years of my life, what do i do with my money?"

I am 18 and attending Georgia Tech and am currently in the College of Computing pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I started early this summer so I am already on campus taking classes, and am registered for the fall semester. I'm an in-state student so my total costs per semester are about $12,500, however I currently have the Zell Miller (HOPE) scholarship which pays my tuition (Approx. $5,000 per semester) so that brings it down to $7,500 in loans. With the AP credit I brought in I may be able to graduate a semester early, or I may choose to take a minor in Computing in Business. I plan to find a job for the Fall and Spring semesters to at least have some cash on the side, and hopefully put some aside to save/invest. I also don't know what method of investing or savings to pursue, so help with that would be greatly appreciated.
Finally, after my Freshman year is over, I have the possibility to pursue working as a Peer Leader (PL) on campus for the remainder of my time at Tech. This position pays free rent ($3,000 per semester) along with a $300 monthly stipend. I would like to pursue this opportunity, and would you recommend it over an internship or other form of work? If it looks as though I've overlooked any other points that you would like to point out that would be greatly appreciated, thank you all for your time!


To Recap:


*Loan for summer is $2,750
*$7,500 in loans
*With $7,500 in loans, debt looks at about $63,000 
*$4,500 in loans for last 6 semesters if I work as a PL
*Debt could be as low as $45,000 (working as PL) or as high as $93,000 (if I were to completely lose the HOPE scholarship)
*These numbers could be reduced if I do not take a minor and graduate a semester early, these assume 8 semester enrollment plus the Summer 2015 Semester
*looking for a method of savings or investment that suits my age/earnings
*Any additional advice or help is greatly appreciated!

The lyrics of the Momma's and the Papa's bounce inside my head, remnants of my car ride entertainment still lingering from the morning commute. I stare at the glass door to our office, my hand hesitating on the door handle. The two week vacation had been nice. *Really nice,* my brain corrects as I will myself to walk inside. I could just turn around, walk back to my car. Text the wife, tell her we're going back, forget this hum drum work life I lead. Images of my Sarah, sunning herself on the pool deck, flashes of smiles and wet hair and naked skin in a tropical paradise flit past my closed eyes. *She'd go along with it, right?*  If only.

*Every other day, every other day Every other day of the week is fine, yeah.*

I gaze across the office, the familiar smell of ink and toner cartridge mingling with aroma of fresh coffee. I sigh, not catching the difference, the newness. *Same old office*. At 34, I'd been doing this job for 10 years. I do it well. It pays handsomely. And I am incredibly bored by it. I look around desperately, searching for something fresh, something to excite me again. *Nothing*. I settle in behind my desk, still not realizing the answer wafts right under my nose.

*Oh, Monday morning, you gave me no warning of what was to be.*

""Hey Zach."" I glance up at Chris as he leans over our common cubicle wall. His large, round face splits into a conspiratorial grin. ""How was the trip?""

""Awesome,"" I say with a sigh, silently wishing the younger man away, still clinging to the last vestiges of my escape from this monotonous existence. ""Its kind of hard to be ba-"" 

He cuts me off. ""Yeah yeah, blah blah blah."" He leans farther into my work space. ""None of that is important.""  I shoot him a glare, which sails right over his head. *Ass*. ""The real question is, have you seen the intern yet."" He winks piggishly. I grimace at his face. The rich smell of fresh beans tickles my senses again. It hits me. *That's whats different!*. My coworker's eyes widen and he hisses, ""Here she comes.""

I wrote this up as a late submission to someone else's post. I'm on my phone and now can't seem to find it, but regardless I think I was hours too late in submitting it to her. So I'm posting it for you instead. Here's the skinny:

I am a bored sales exec. I'm content in my marriage and i love my wife. But the reality is that my job and even my love life are routine, stale, rote. What i need, even though I don't realize it, is a spark.

That's where you come in, the new summer intern in the office. You can be nothing more than the coffee girl or an integral part of the team; your character is wholly up to you. My only preference is  that you play someone  younger than me, preferably by at least 10 years. 

  I like the idea of dallying in places where I shouldn't. I want to be drawn to you, each step I take closer a battle as my conscience screams that I'm playing with fire. I want to reason away why I'm not doing anything wrong, how it's just silly fun, until suddenly I open my eyes and it isn't. I want you to drag me into the deep end and hold me under until I just can't fight the desire any longer. 

I'm looking for a certain kind of female character. The kind that sees what she wants and knows how to take it. The kind that takes pleasure in slowly stripping away my resistance. The kind that enjoys toying with her prey and isn't afraid to use the fact that my job and marriage are on the line if anyone finds out.

I am open to most kinks. No violence, scat, or watersports. I am most definitely a switch. I will resist that dark little voice that whispers *cheat*, put up a front and try to keep you at bay. But push me over the edge and I will hold you to the wall while I part your thighs with my tongue.

Send me that message!"

Since she's having to drive down to go to the concert, she asked if she could stay the night and I obviously obliged. She's also asked for some of my hoodies and shirts, idk if that's relevant haha. I just have this mix of excitement and nervousness to see her and thought writing it down might help!

3cw2a1,4,2015-07-11,"Since joining this sub,",SapperChop,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3cw2a1/since_joining_this_sub/,"I've found myself constantly thinking to myself, ""damn, that sounds a lot like me"" when I read others' posts about the problems they are going through. I didn't realize that weed had such a psychological pull until I realized I don't dream anymore, I'm not happy anymore, I'm not putting my best foot forward in every day life, anymore. It felt like I was doing everything right, as long as I smoked right before. 

I haven't dreamt in so long, and I miss it. My girlfriend wakes up and tells me all about her epic dreams and I can't relate at all. I can tell the many nights of Netflix or chilling at home is taking a toll on her. She is a social monarch, and she has dealt with it this long, but I don't know how much more she is willing to take. Though she says she has no problem with it, as long as she is with me. How lucky am I, right?

My relationship is the most important thing to me, and I can tell marijuana is starting to take a toll on it. She doesn't smoke, she met me while I was high, and didn't meet ""sober"" me save a few hours after waking up at the max, until we took a week vacation out of state. The trip was wonderful, and I didn't miss weed at all, so I gave myself the green light and let myself continue smoking heavily since we returned. 

She has since explained to me that she ultimately wants me to stop for a few reasons. Some background, she is an aerospace engineering student graduating soon, and I have a little time left before I graduate from college whereby I'll be entering the same industry as her. She explained that she doesn't want to be associated with marijuana plainly because of the societal stigma (albeit it's getting better, the stigma is very much so still alive) that comes along with it. She argues that none of her colleagues do it and she doesn't want the ""stoner"" boyfriend. I completely agree and I'm aware I need to stop if not for that but for a few other reasons too. I'm applying for internships for the spring, and if I have any bites (fingers fucking crossed in this job market) I'll be drug tested, and want to be ready. I've also recently begun flight school, and although I haven't flown high, I obviously would fail a drug test, which is dangerous and stupid, I know. 

I fell in love with marijuana when I got out of the Army. I was never an avid runner, always a big heavy body builder type. Since weed entered my life, I went from struggling to run 3 miles to running 10k's in less than two months. I lost forty pounds while smoking, and everything was good. 

But now...

Now I barely run, I don't want to work out, I still get extremely good grades, but I can detect a major change. My overall motivation changed slowly over time, to the point where I was questioning everything, academic career or otherwise. Though it wasn't the question you might expect, I was asking myself how I could incorporate marijuana in more and more aspects of my life. I was running home in between classes to take a grav bong hit, I was chastising myself for forgetting to roll a joint for a day out, I was, and still am, wondering about weed. I've been sober for 35 hours, and I've been strong outwardly, but internally I am frustrated that I'm not high. 

When you don't have it, marijuana is the ultimate problem solver, or so I think. 

I ink this is for the better, no, I know this is for the better, it's safer, for one. Flying while smoking is fucking dumb. Just like driving, which I did without question. A few wrong turns here and there, but nonetheless I was lucky. I don't recommend it. 

So since coming to this sub, yesterday, I realize I'm with you guys and girls. I'm with you when you tell me about your lack of social motivation, your sleep issues, and your memory problems. I had an argument with my girlfriend a few days ago in which I COULDNT remember what was said 10 minutes prior. Who wants to live like that? It's embarrassing. Plus the word vomit that spews, stuttering, lack of clear, coherent thought, it is just a bad time when you've got real shit to handle. 

I'm addicted to the process of getting high. I'm addicted to the scent that escapes as I open my grinder. I'm addicted to packing my bowl nicely, and cornering it like a pro. I'm addicted to trying to take in as much smoke as I can, and exhaling as slowly as I can through my nose without coughing. I'm addicted to how it opens up my lungs, and I can run like a fucking race horse, which obviously does wonders for my confidence. 

But fuck that addiction, it's psychological, that's why I think, no, I know I can stop these cravings. 

I've changed my paradigm and everytime I think about smoking weed, I remember how awesome it is going to be to remember this day tomorrow, or next week. I'll remember how my personality is slowly reverting back to my old self. 

I'm embarking on a journey, friends, and I want your advice, your comments, and your criticisms to help me along the way. If nothing else, this post got this off my chest, the most personal thing I've put on the Internet. Hell, I don't even know if this makes sense, it's 3am and I can't sleep. Stay strong friends.

There is a part of me that thinks it is arrogant to exalt my suffering to the level of the destitute men and women forced to sleep on the street. There is also a part of me that thinks the first part is kidding himself, and that my reticence to identify, to say ""I me, with no home, am homeless"" is the real arrogance. A way to say I am different from, or better than those ""other"" homeless people. The truth is I've never really had a home.

My parents divorced when I left for the dorm. The house of my youth was sold and it's assets divided. I was welcome to stay at either of the empty nests my respective parents purchased, but neither had a bedroom for me, and logistics plus strained relationships following the divorce served to complicate what is already a very complicated homecoming for summer of freshman year. I elected to spend the summer as a ""Professional Volunteer"" hopping from one Church Camp to the next that would give me food and lodging in exchange for offering my assistance a week at a time.

I got good jobs through college while living in dorms and afforded a apartment with a friend my senior year (I say ""afforded"" only if you discount the immense student loan debt I was accruing) but graduation hit at the same time as the 208 recession along with the dissolution of my network of friends and I found myself forced to choose between paying rent on a credit card or living in my car. I chose the latter.

It was a 4Runner with back seats that folded and I was in Southern California in the spring. Quite comfortable actually. Nevertheless I wasn't there long before a friend from church noticed my condition and invited me to live with him, sharing a bedroom and paying very low rent. I had no personal space, no storage, no way to settle, but I had a great time with it If I'm being honest, and built some great friends.

Then I got a great job offer in Kansas and had to leave the cheap living arrangement to be a Campus Missionary. I drew upon my vagabonding experience to make the drive and hobo out on both ends of it, but again it was not long before permanent lodging was made available in the basement of a kindly couple who supported my ministry. When that ran up I could have filed a lease, but chose to live in my car again for three months as a sort of experiment. I wanted to see if I could live this way. If people would be hospitable, offer me places to shower, to rest. I wanted to see if my work would suffer. It didn't. I had a great time. Some things about residential life are just so ostentatious.

When the experiment was over, despite success, I decided that I did not want to be a sycophant, refusing to stand on his own two feet when able. I moved in to another cheap apartment with a professor friend. Then I received a full scholarship to a Masters Program in Texas and pulled yet another road trip, to move into yet another dorm room, Now pushing 30.

Part of the program entails an internship at a hospital, and the one I was offered is far from my 200 sq feet of paradise. I wear a suit and tie and work 8 to 5. People call me ""Sir"". But when I get off I hang my suit on a line in my van and sleep in a different place every night. I try to search couchsurfing.com for an air conditioned place to crash. If I fail I either sweat it out on a futon mattress in my backseat, or I drive two hours each way with gas I can't afford to my nearest reliable host.

It's only for the summer then I'm back in the dorm, but that's only for one more year and then who knows? With jobs and mortgages the way they are for millennials, and my personal history and skill development the way it is... Maybe I'll convert a school bus.

**TL:DR** I'm Couch Surfing all summer in a new city. I seem to end up in these situations a lot. I've had some apartments but never a real stable ""home"" that felt mine."

I am progressing too slow, and I seem to waste a lot of time because I don't know what to focus on. I feel desperate and I'm willing to study my ass off.

So a little background on this situation:


I am 18 and attending Georgia Tech and am currently in the College of Computing pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I started early this summer so I am already on campus taking classes, and am registered for the fall semester. I'm an in-state student so my total costs per semester are about $12,500, however I currently have the Zell Miller (HOPE) scholarship which pays my tuition (Approx. $5,000 per semester) so that brings it down to $7,500 in loans. With the AP credit I brought in I may be able to graduate a semester early, or I may choose to take a minor in Computing in Business. I plan to find a job for the Fall and Spring semesters to at least have some cash on the side, and hopefully put some aside to save/invest. I also don't know what method of investing or savings to pursue, so help with that would be greatly appreciated.
Finally, after my Freshman year is over, I have the possibility to pursue working as a Peer Leader (PL) on campus for the remainder of my time at Tech. This position pays free rent ($3,000 per semester) along with a $300 monthly stipend. I would like to pursue this opportunity, and would you recommend it over an internship or other form of work? If it looks as though I've overlooked any other points that you would like to point out that would be greatly appreciated, thank you all for your time!


To Recap:


* Loan for summer is $2,750
* $7,500 in loans per semester
* With $7,500 in loans, debt looks at about $63,000 
* $4,500 in loans for last 6 semesters if I work as a PL
* Debt could be as low as $45,000 (working as PL) or as high as $93,000 (if I were to completely lose the HOPE scholarship)
* These numbers could be reduced if I do not take a minor and graduate a semester early, these assume 8 semester enrollment plus the Summer 2015 Semester
* looking for a method of savings or investment that suits my age/earnings
* Any additional advice or help is greatly appreciated!

I got suspicious. Then she looked at my battery usage, etc. and as always, ""there was no issue with the battery"". I asked her if she was able to look at my other types of data and other concerns about privacy, she said there's nothing to worry about.

Could she have access to the data from the apps I use, such as Mails, Password vault, etc.? Should I be concerned about what she might do with them? It doesn't matter if she's with ""Apple"".

I'm wondering if anyone is available in Austin to at some point tutor, or mentor rather, me in Java/programming fundamentals.  I've taken a long course at ACC.  I acquired a great internship, and then a job at a different place afterwards that I am currently at.  I understand the syntax, I just don't really know where to go from here.  Aside from probably 100 exercises and then a group project while in school, I haven't actually written anything in almost a year, and I know that's an issue.  I guess someone to push me, and push me in a direction that will be worth it.  Frameworks? EE? Learn JavaScript? Learn blah blah blah.  There's *SO* many directions to go, and *SO* much to take in that I don't know where to go, let alone how to get there.  Not sure if I'm making sense, but I ultimately just want to be a good programmer/developer, and I'm having trouble finding out how to get there.

I just woke up again and she was in my dream again. She comes around about every other night, and it absolutely sucks.

We dated for about 3 years, started at high school prom, ended before the spring semester of the last year of college. She went to a private religious school a few hours away, and I went to a public school just down the road. She was the first woman I ever really felt love for. 

I am Catholic, and I wanted to save myself for marriage, she's Baptist, also never had sex, and she definitely pushed my boundaries on that front. We fought over sex, and I completely understood where she was coming from. Everyone else our age was doing it. Her roommates were bringing guys home, people talked about it during class, etc.

One night while we're watching a movie, I decide that tonight was going to be the night, I want to marry this girl, what's the difference in a year or two before we get married? So we did.

Everything crumbled from there. She had a month internship in a city 4 hours away, and she didn't want to talk during it. She ""needed space"". She almost stopped all communication with me, and kept telling me that it wasn't me, it was her. 

The fall semester started and I had a study abroad trip planned during the winter break. She was extremely supportive and again, a wonderful girlfriend. We would meet up on weekends and hang out, make love, and then go back to our regular lives. We called each other every night, and I thought everything was back to normal.

I got a facebook message from one of her friends from the city she had her internship in.

He said that he had ""fucked"" her a few times since the summer and that she wasn't as innocent as she seemed. He then sent me pictures of her in his shirts without pants on, or her at a computer completely nude. 

She said he would come to the house, with his gun (Texas), and demand her to get naked. Then he would rape her. She ""played along"" because of how scared she was that she would be shot. 

My heart sank. I broke up with her because that just sounded like bullshit. She had kissed a guy during that summer too, which I found out from one of our mutual friends. So I didn't think she was telling the truth. I went on my study abroad trip and had the time of my life.

It's July. 6 months since then. During spring break, we met up for  late night coffee. She wanted to have sex. I told her no. She then told me that in the 3 months since she and I broke up, she's been with 4 partners, one of which was a complete stranger during a one night stand. She dropped 40 pounds, been working out, and looks better and more attractive than she did when we started dating.

She wanted us to get healthy together, and I'm starting my weight loss journey right now (6'0, 285).

She isn't good for me. She isn't the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. I blocked her on facebook, instagram, twitter, deleted her from my phone, got rid of everything in my life that reminds me of her. 

And I still dream of her every other night. I've woken up in tears, and I'm fucking sick of feeling sorry for myself. I've gone on dates, and none of them have gone very well. I am re-saving myself and asking for forgiveness for what I did (you don't have to agree with my views on sex, I'm Catholic and I understand that this isn't a popular view).

I just need to get her off my chest.

TL;DR - First love cheats on me, hits gym, starts sleeping around, and I can't stop dreams I have of her, even though I don't want to be with her."

######**The Congress of the Republic of New England**

---

&gt;""In the past, the Republic of New England has passed bills regarding the future of education. They have worked to great success. Now, we will work on improving the people who make education possible, the teachers.""

&gt;""Historically, New England has always been a region with teachers who go above and beyond, and further improving this can only do good things. For these reasons the Republic of New England has passed Bill E-03, providing teachers with more benefits, along with other ways to improve education.

~ President Charlie Baker on the Passing of Bill E-03

###*Bill E-03*

---

***Section the First, Respecting and Encouraging Teachers***

--

&gt;(i.) **RESPECTING** teachers by granting them generally higher pay, and making them teach fewer classes, which will lead to less classroom time. This time can be used for workshops to help improve the quality of teaching, or curriculum development.

&gt; (ii.) **DISCLIPINING** teachers in the form of temporarily reduced class loads.

&gt; (iii.) **TREATING** teachers differently. They are responsible  for each new generation of learners and should be regarded as some of the most influential individuals in the country. Teachers will now be taught how to teach to inspire, and so students can learn, while still following New England Core standards. In addition, teaching will now be treated as a top-level occupation, and paid the following minimums, in government run schools.

   - (a.) **The salary range for teachers of elementary school is:**  *$40,000-$60,000*
   - (b.) **The salary range for teachers of middle school is:** *$45,000-$65,000*
   - (c.) **The salary range for teachers of high school is:** *$50,000-$70,000*
   - (d.) **The salary range for teachers and professors of college and/or university is:** *$85,000-$125,000*

&gt; (iv.) **GRANTING** teachers more freedom to teach as they would like. Hiring the best teachers and paying them well will lead to teachers who can teach with only mild oversight from New England Core standards.

--

***Section the Second, The Importance of Teacher Education***

--

&gt; (i.) **REQUIRING** teachers to learn Spanish. Studies of teachers in New England show that the majority do not feel they have the skill set in order to meet the demands of second language learners in their classrooms. With the increasing number of students still learning the English Language, teachers must learn Spanish as a teaching requirement, as most immigrants are of Hispanic descent. 

&gt; (ii.) **RAISING** the standards for becoming an educator. Attempt to make education a ""first-choice"" job rather than a ""last-choice"" one. More stringent training for teachers in their actual subject will be required. An example will be made in the subject of mathematics. Teaching formulas and procedures is only a portion of the picture, deriving the formulas themselves in interesting activities done with manipulatives and visuals is the other part that will teach students common sense and relate mathematics to the real world, while still continuing with the New England Core standards. This makes mathematics a field of problem solving, which it truly is, rather than just a field of disparate numbers. For younger students, applying popular concepts can be helpful. Example: for the football players, a wide receiver lines up 15 yards left and he catches the ball 20 yards down field.  How far did the quarterback throw the ball?  The Pythagorean theorem (and just about every bit of math) can be applied to common real life scenarios.  Not only does a real example make the topic more tangible, it also makes the topic more interesting. The result will be a generation of adults who can utilize mathematics seamlessly to solve real life problems. Teaching in this way will be taught in college.

&gt; (iii.) **CONTINUING** education for teachers by providing annual seminars/workshops/classes for teachers. In order to stay competitive with the world, our teachers, the backbone of the education system, need to be continuously growing and learning new skills and ways to effectively teach our youth.

&gt; (iv.) **UPDATING** and improving the teaching curriculum annually. This will happen by creating online official government forums where teachers can communicate and discuss lessons, as well as organizing meet-ups in person. Based on teacher feedback, New England Core standards will also update.

&gt; (v.) **ELIMINATING** the bachelor degree for certification and instead providing internship opportunities combined with a graduate program for teacher certification.

--

***Section the Third, Providing Personalized Learning Opportunities For Students***

--

&gt; (i.) **INDIVIDUALIZING** and personalizing learning for students both in pace and format.

&gt; (ii.) **MOVING** away from standardization and a ""one-size-fits-all"" system. Reduce the amount and importance of standardized tests, using them only as a guideline and not to determine ones future. Starting at grade 10, the system should develop and promote career and technical education. 

&gt; (iii.) **INTRODUCING** graduation at sixteen for students pursuing associate degrees and trade certificates.

&gt; (iv.) **REDUCING** class size in order for teachers to work one-on-one with students to see if proficiency is achieved and re-teach if necessary.

--

***Section the Fourth, the Importance of Basic Skill Development***

--

&gt; (i.) **FOCUSING** on basic analysis skills, with reading analysis being very important.

&gt; (ii.) **FIXING** misconceptions about New England Core standards. These standards focus on critical thinking skills and learning all of the traditional curriculum (and more) in a manner that allows students to solve real life problems. The high stakes testing was a part of the previous standards of the United States, and will not be a major part of New England core standards.

--

***Section the Fifth, The Structure of Schools***

--

&gt; (i.) **REDUCING** the distorting role of sports in school life, which engenders misplaced priorities for too many people.

&gt; (ii.) **DIGITIZING** classes by providing each and every student starting in Grade 6 a means of accessing the internet. Most of the world’s information is online and we don’t need professors and teachers simply repeating it.

&gt; (iii.) **TESTING** students online, in a secure program, when standardized testing is necessary.

&gt; (iv.) **EXPOSING** students to different careers by bringing professionals to a school, or allowing pupils to learn in a real-life environment. The point would be to familiarize students with real world careers and jobs that could be available to them someday. This would help student be more focused on what career or field of work they would like to pursue when they reach college, saving them time and money. 

--

***Section the Sixth, Teaching Styles***

--

&gt; (i.) **PROMOTING** teaching styles based more on thinking/analyzing and less memorizing. Innovation and creativity are based on understanding things, not on something that is memorized. Focus on teaching students how use and apply their minds to tasks or problems. These are skills that are usable in any career field.

&gt; (ii.) **INTRODUCING** a pratical skills program intertwined with the current academic system. This will be optional class to be taken as an elective, starting in middle school.

--

***Section the Seventh, The Evaluation of Students***

--

&gt; (i.) **PRESSING** schools to give harder and more interactive tests and exams, moving ahead of the old way of using your memory to write answers on a piece of paper. Some tests could be taken vocally or even in groups.

&gt; (ii.) **REDUCING** the amount of importance and frequency of the standardized tests that suck time and creativity from students. Less emphasis on standardized tests as a as a measure of rigor and accountability is neccesary.

&gt; (iii.) **REALLOCATING** the money that would usually go to standardized tests to support for a child’s whole education, including social-emotional needs. Included in this is devoting funding and resources to providing social supports to students and families in terms of nutrition, health care, child care, counseling, supervision, etc.

By Javier Watanabe 

Originally published in Vanity Fair, 2030

Since it's release in December, 2020, Watershed has been called the most perfect movie ever made. It is the rare film that lives up to the hype and exceeds it. It's in the culture, when was the last time you went a day without hearing someone describe a moment as being like something out of Watershed?

""Greatness is hard to quantify,"" says UCLA professor Evan Mielke. ""Is Citizen Kane 'greater' than Vertigo? Is Sophie's Choice sadder than Terms of Endearment? All I can tell you is that I've never met a person who didn't cry when Sadie got that phone call, who couldn't quote the sandwich speech verbatim.""

Critics agree. Heck, everyone seems to agree. Watershed is that rare story that seems to have touched everyone. Upon release, it was an instant smash hit, drawing the kind of grosses usually reserved for Marvel Superheroes. It's since ruled the roost as the top movie on IMDB, and is the only film in history to earn 100% on Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, and uRatyr. It has spun off four international remakes, a Broadway play, and a neuralapp. It's hard to believe this all began on 227 pages of Kirkland-brand printer paper, hand scrawled in 16 shades of Crayola.


+++

Alan Smith is perhaps the least prolific writer of all time, making Harper Lee look voluminous  by comparison. Aside from a few school papers, Watershed is the only written work that bears his name. He was born in 1984, in Alabama and diagnosed with autism at age 8. His father left before he was born, he was raised by Netflix and television while his mother pulled double shifts at the local Pizza Hut.

""Weird kid,"" recalls neighbor Horace Gulcher. ""Didn't say much, but he remembered everything he watched. One time I saw him watching Top Gun, and he was mouthing along to every word.""

And what of Sarah Douglas May, his muse?

""I don't recall them ever talking much. Min (Alan's grandmother, Minerva) hired her to clean the place. Of course the whole thing got Hollywood'd up, and you make her out to be the love of his life."" He pauses to take a sip of his Fanta. ""Then again, I guess no one can say she wasn't.""

Sarah May moved to Los Angeles in 2003, with hopes of working in the entertainment industry. Alan would only see her once more, on a visit home. She left behind a copy of the screenplay for Chinatown (either as a gift or by mistake, sources vary), and Alan seems to have only read it once.

""He only needed the once,"" says Mr. Gulcher. ""The kid had a memory like you wouldn't believe.""

+++

Sarah May died in a car crash in 2015, and when Alan heard, he retreated to his room for a period of months. Later that year, Minerva Smith died of a stroke the day before Christmas Eve, her daughter having pre-deceased her six years prior. Alan was moved from his first home to the one that would be his last, Sleepwater Asylum in Fairhope, Alabama.

Callum Swift, then an orderly, now retired, remembers Alan vividly. ""You could have a conversation with him, but not about much. He mostly watched TV. He had a mean streak, too. If he got to feeling stubborn, you had to watch out cause he'd come at you.""

Mr. Swift remembers the day Alan first saw Chinatown. ""The movie came on HBO, think it was (in point of fact it was AMC). He was watching it as he'd do, and then he just... it was electric. He had this, I guess you'd call it an a ha moment. He comes up to me and says, 'Mr. Swift! This is that! The words make the pictures! They're both shadows of the same thing!'""  Swift pauses again. ""I know you boys like to treat anything he said like it's the damn DaVinci Code, but it seemed like nonsense then and I haven't changed my thoughts on the matter. Was he a genius? It's hard to say that of a kid who never figured out toilet paper.""

Sleepwater Administrator Laverne Robideaux recalled ""He asked me for paper. I gave him a sheet. He said give me a lot, so I gave him the ream. He went to the crafts corner and started marking it up with the Crayolas. He wanted a pen, but for safety reasons... anyway, he used up the entire box."" 

The writing process happened over the span of three afternoons. There were no revisions, except for the last minute addition of a title page. Robideaux remembers: ""I thought it was... well, I just didn't know. He begged me to send it to 'the Paramount,' and he wore me down. I got him the address and the envelope. He insisted on writing the address himself."" She jokes, ""I paid for the stamps myself. Maybe I should get some royalties!""

She won't, but history owes her a debt. I, like many, have seen the envelope in the lobby of the Writers Guild of America. The return address, like the title page, misspells Alan's name as Aln.

+++ 

Brenda Adams remembers that day well. It was September 16th, 2019, and she was an assistant for Jack Brian. ""I came over and Jack was reading it with some of the guys. They weren't very nice about it. They were reading the dialogue and laughing, but it was like they were making fun of it. Carl (Nussbaum, then an assistant, now the head of Development for Chen Productions) made like he was going to shred it, and probably would have if Walter hadn't said anything.""

Walter Cahill, the cultural hero of the day, was working IT, fixing Brenda's cable. He didn't know story, but he knew people. ""I was listening to them making fun of it, and it reminded me of the playground bullies."" He smiles sadly, suggesting he's all to familiar with bullies first hand. ""So I guess I was predisposed to like it, but then I actually heard the dialogue. In my head I'm thinking, Jesus, are you hearing what you're reading?""

I mentioned this to Brenda Adams, now an Emmy-winning producer for the BBC. She laughed.  ""In his head? Walter screamed it at them. I just wanted to calm him down, so I just started reading it, and I'm like, whoa, this is really good.""

So would she have read the script if it hadn't been for Walter? She hesitates, then smiles. ""Honestly, no. It was written in crayon for god's sake. Everyone likes to pretend that they'd have just known greatness when they saw it, but it's a hard job. In the fog of war, you make mistakes. If you believe that anyone would have noticed the script, you're arguing appearances don't matter. Or you could argue that Jack Brian is a genius of unparalleled sensitivity.""

Mr. Brian declined to comment for this story. Since Watershed, in his his efforts to find the next Alan Smith, he has signed deals with autistics, conjoined twins, and a psychic who claimed to be channeling the ghost of Kaspar Hauser.

Adams continues, ""Jack finally read the script. He was mad at first, but then it just won him over. They had lost the envelope, so he and Carl had to chase down the janitors. They dug through three of those rolling garbage things before they found it. He made an intern retype it so it wouldn't look like, and I quote, a crazy person screwed a pack of Crayolas. Once we got over how good it was, we were a little apprehensive. If you really think about it, there's something hostile about the whole crayon thing. What kind of a person would do that? Could we actually work with them. I was actually relieved when I found out it had been sent from an asylum, which sort of made sense..""


The rest is, as they say, history.

A few remarkable things about the 227-page draft: Other than the author's name, there are no misspellings. Though written by hand in block crayon lettering, if typed according to the style of the script for Chinatown, comes out to exactly 120 pages. Every sentence in the scene description is essentially a shot of the finished product. The final cut of the movie is almost exactly in sync with the original draft (though the character Stalin Hitler was eventually renamed Stan Little).

I talked to screenwriter Joshua Bernhard about this at an afterparty, the night he won his second Academy Award. ""Yeah, I've read it. Everyone has. You know, they teach a class just on that at USC? They tried to figure out ever movie he'd ever seen and they make the kids watch it, and I dunno, get inspired."" He shakes his head.

A studio head told me, on the condition of anonymity. ""The script is all story. Dunc (Director Ian Duncan) has been coasting on it for years, but the truth is, Uwe Boll could have won an Oscar for it.""

Matt Lazarus, author of the book ""How to Write a Script in 24 Seconds,"" met me at a Starbucks. ""That script. Jesus. People always used to say that a great script could be written in crayon and it'd get made and I used to laugh at them. In my extremely limited defense, who'd have seen that coming? It's all a crapshoot."" He would have said more, but his manager reminded him that it was time to restock the bathrooms. 

Screenwriter Lew Cuddy the Third called from location on Meet the Spartans 4 - Spartans in Space! ""I always said a script could be written in crayon it would get made. America is a meritocracy. The cream rises to the top. People vote with their dollars, and the winner takes all. You don't get to where I got-- I mean Alan got without being something special.""

Following the sale of Watershed, there was a brief boom in crayon scripts, before the style of the times moved to Sharpie scripts( sparking a brief rise in spec sales and the stock price of Newell-Rubbermaid), before the trend culminated with Mikey Sullivan infamous mid-six figure sale of Deez Nutz, a script written in his own semen. A representative of  for Mr. Sullivan reported, via Snapchat, that it was done 'For the Lulz. Sullivan was later fired from the project for creative differences. Most of the executives who provided background for this story expressed relief that the trend has apparently subsided.
 
Alan Smith never lived to see his script become a movie, he died of a thrombic embolism in the spring of 2020, a fate that ironically mirrored the last reel of his magnum opus. As of this writing, the movie's legions of fans are crowdsourcing funds to turn Alan Smith's childhood home into a museum.


One of those backers is Joshua Bell, the violin virtuoso who once famously played anonymously on the street to see who would recognize greatness, or at least stop to appreciate it (spoiler: almost no one). ""It's tempting to say that a great script could be written in crayon and get seen, or that the people who ignored it are idiots, but it's always more complicated than that."" 

So what conclusions does Joshua Bell from the unlikely success and/or near failure of Alan Smith's masterpiece? Not a single thing.

""We like to believe in a just world, that greatness rises, that we live in a meritocracy. People don't look for value where they're not expecting to find it. Look, this article is going into Vanity Fair, it's presold. Would people recognize you as a Pulitzer-winning journalist if you wrote it in crayon and left it in the park?""

It's a fair point. As I wander through Central Park watching a panhandler scrawl a racist screed on the marble statue of President Obama (the second one, not the first), I wonder if I might be ignoring the next Alan Smith."
3cy87i,57,2015-07-11,♥❤▀▄▀▄▀🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴★★NOTICE: Our new CEO is a CANNIBAL!!!!!🍭⎛✿⎛❤♛♣♣♣★✪▃▄▅▆❂▆▅▄▃🍭🍭,nlofe,circlejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/3cy87i/notice_our_new_ceo_is_a_cannibal/,"Hello my magnificent bastards. There is something you all should really probably know about. And it surprised me for sure so maybe it might surprise you like it might surprise me.

Yesterday as we all know Chairman Pao has resigned from her position as CEO of Reddit. I don’t know if this is a good thing or if this is a bad thing, but I am not really in any position to say either way. I can only weigh in on my personal opinion, but I don’t even think it’s appropriate to do that. But all of this is beside the point, today I would like to bring to your attention that the new CEO of reddit is in fact a cannibal!

I understand that right now you must be like, “this nlofe guy is out of his mind” but allow you to show you my pieces of evidence. Ok for one, I would like you to take a look at this guy’s profile. u/spez. Now you may be wondering who this is but this is in fact our new CEO. Now look at his “moderator of” subreddits, which will display the subreddits that he moderates. This will probably not work on mobile. In there if you click the more button you will see r/Cannibals! You probably have to click the “more” button because it doesn’t have as many subscribers as the other subreddits, but let me tell you! This is because **nobody would want to subscribe to a subreddit about cannibals!!**

Now my second piece of evidence is as follows. Go to r/Cannibals (don’t worry, I know it is a rather disgusting topic but there is nothing there that is NSFW as we like to call it), and look at the moderators. The only moderator you will see there is the sole moderator, spez! As I had mentioned before, this is none other than the new Reddit CEO! Now you may notice the text that reads as following, “created by FuzzyNavel” and you may think well ok FuzzyNavel just handed off this subreddit to this spez guy and he didn’t have any say or anything to do with this! But allow me to show you one thing one more.

If you go to u/FuzzyNavel’s profile, you will notice something. This person has but three posts, and these are all explaining the formation of the subreddit! Now one of the posts is [this]( https://i.imgur.com/quA6yww.png), a very convincing post about how FuzzyNavel was trying to get the reddit admins to consider it being a requirement to accept a position of being a moderator instead of getting the position automatically immediately upon receiving the request. However there are a few things that I would like you to notice about this very curious fuzzynavel person. For one, their account is about half as many years old as that of spez’s. This means that it is not unlikely that this FuzzyNavel person is in fact none other than spez’s alt account!

Now you may be thinking, “okay now this is just ridiculous, there is like no evidence to support that this is spez’s alt” and at the first glance you may be right! However you would be wrong, and I will like to show you why. In addition to being half as many years old as the spez account, which could be a clue to being spez’s alt account, it is also worth taking a look at the awards given to fuzzynavel. These awards you can see under the trophy case. Now you may be wondering why I just said “awards” if I’m telling you to look under the trophy case but on the reddit wiki, this distinction is made more clear than. “The award is the reason someone is being honored -- the category in which they excel(led). For example, ""Best Link"". The trophy is the digital token placed on the recipient's user page to commemorate that particular person winning that particular award on that particular day.” So there it is, the award is the reason a trophy is given, to be put more simply.

Now that being said, I would like to show you WHY it is that these awards are very suspicious. OK so if you look at spez's trophies what do you see? Well a bunch of trophies probably received just from being on reddit for so long. You know, ones like reddit mold, that April fools day like years ago, and combocommenter and best comment, which honestly I really still don’t know who gets to decide those but whoever it is I’m sure they have one boring job, just looking for people to give out awards to every day. Of course, you are still being paid to Reddit so I guess it’s not all that bad, but still, I’m sure there are much better admin positions available at reddit. What are they? Don’t ask me. But they have to have some cool jobs for sure. 

Now if you take a look at these trophies, what do you see in common between spez’s account and fuzzynavel’s account? Well, verified email. Sure. What does this mean? It just means that you registered an email with your reddit account and that you verified it from your actual email by clicking on the link inside of that email from Reddit or whatever. But this trophy doesn’t matter because everyone and their mother-in-laws can get it easier than. But what else do these accounts have in common? Well, it’s not the “year club”, as you will notice that FuzzyNavel is part of the five year club but spez is part of the ten year club! As I had already mentioned, spez’s account is twice as old fuzzynavel’s and this is one of two ways to check that. The other way is to go to the “redditor for x years” where “x” is a number, like not the number written out in English but the Arabic symbol, for example, “3”. Now if you hover over this little piece of text, you will notice a box come up! What is contained within this box? Well, none other than the exact date and time of their joining! Note that this does not work once again on mobile. This is typically much more accurate than the number contained in the trophy case because the award in the trophy case can often be slow to update. For example if you go to some random user’s profile and compare the date of their joining by hovering your mouse over the “redditor for” text and then comparing it to the “year club” trophy, you will often find that the two are very different! Not because the trophy doesn’t have the date and time but rather, because the year club doesn’t even accurately reflect the accurate number of years it has been since joining! It’s worth noting that when we’re comparing something like five years to ten years, in the case of spez and fuzzynavel, that it doesn’t really matter if it’s a difference of a year or two, but it is still very good to have the correct information.

But anyway, my point is that the year award/trophy will not be the same because they joined at a difference of five years ago… FuzzyNavel apparently joined five years ago and spez five years before that. Now, what other trophy do they have in common? Correct, none other than “Rally Monkey”! So what is this “Rally Monkey” thing? Well, to be 100% completely honest, I don’t know for sure. When I click it it just takes me to some subreddit about Stephen Colbert and there is absolutely nothing about this particular trophy on the [awards page]( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/awards#represent), unless I’m missing something very significant. However, I am thinking that it has something to do with some sort of in person rally. I am guessing this from a [post I saw on the Stephen Colbert subreddit]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ColbertRally/comments/e57pb/got_my_rally_monkey_trophy_all_that_chasing_of/). 

The people in the comments of this particular post discuss how people were visiting tents and such, so for the sake of time, I think we’ll just assume that it was some sort of group gathering where social people got together. And how would somebody get their account to display this very special trophy for being at the event? Well, they probably had some sort of sheet of paper or something where you wrote down your username so you could get your trophy. And notice the little text below the award on each of the two accounts. The spez account says “century club” but the fuzzynavel account says “visited the tent”! Now why would they say two different things? Well I will tell you why. It is because they are the same person!

Now you may be scratching your head like “wtf” right now but let me explain. If you have a piece of paper where the users write down [their](http://i.imgur.com/vgvW5wG.jpg) username, it’s probably being watched LIKE A HAWK by some of those admins. Let me remind you that at this time, spez was kind of an admin but nobody really liked him so he wasn’t really thought of an admin. I mean, this didn’t work in Chairman Pao’s case because she’s the CEO, and that can’t really be ignored. But when it’s just another admin, just another person they’re paying for seemingly nothing, they can kind of be ignored until they finally give up. 

Kind of like when you get a dog from a breeder with a really low iq, you’ve been waiting for so long to get this little puppy and you have been so excited and you could hardly wait for this day to come! You get your towel ready and you drive all the way up some monastery in upstate New York just so you can get your purebred $2500 puppy which was bred by some monk and is supposed to be really good quality and you’ve been on the waitlist for like 15 years now and it’s finally your turn, now YOU get the puppy! Well you take it home and play with it for a few days and guess what? It’s retarded. It is undoubtedly the most retarded dog you have ever set your eyes on. You don’t really have to have been familiar with this dog for too long to understand that it’s not just because a puppy that he’s acting like that monk decided to keep half of his chromosomes to keep for his own dog. Oh no, you know this right at the moment you set foot in your house. Of course, when you first picked him up he seemed great! I mean, really, how could a puppy screw up being handed over to you by a bald guy. But this is about the only thing that wasn’t screwed up by this dog. You take it home and play with it and make it pee but it won’t play and it won’t pee, it just walks around like the thing is cosplaying Donald Trump except his cerebellum melted out of his nose. This is spez. 

Now it is also worth noting that spez was the cofounder of reddit. Kind of like how Steve Wozniak cofounded Apple, but while he might be as unpopular as the Woz, he certainly wasn’t as innovative.

So anyway you’re at this tent being watched like a hawk by all of these admins. Spez want’s a trophy and he thinks that nobody will even remember his face, so he goes to the first tent, the “Century Club” tent, and signs his name on the piece of paper. Chromakode and kn0thing look at him kinda strange, like they’ve seen him before, but before they can remember he gets his ass out of there. But this isn’t good enough for spez. Spez gets the “Rally Monkey: Century Club” trophy on his account. He decides that he wants to make his alt account more convincing. So he heads over to “the tent” and once again writes down his name. Jedberg makes that “I know you from somewhere” face while hueypriest, ketralnis, and raldi talk loudly amongst themselves and spit kettle corn into each other’s faces. Spez once again signs his username down, but this time as FuzzyNavel. Spez dislikes being around people so he goes home. This is where the Rally Monkey trophies come from, and why both of the users, spez and fuzzynavel, have them.

Now, you might be thinking, “well great, that explains the Rally Monkey trophies, but what about all of the other trophies on fuzzynavel’s account?” To which I would say well if you had the attention span of a spez you would know that we already went over the “Five Year Club” trophy and the “Verified Email” trophy, and just recently we went over the “Rally Monkey” trophy. But what’s left? Ah yes, the Reddit Santa trophies… in particular, “Secret Santa 2010”, “Secret Santa 2011”, and “Summer Santa 2011”. Now why would spez put these on his alt account instead of his main account? Well, there’s a few reasons.

The first reason is that he wants to make it look more realistic. It’s as simple as that. When you have an account with almost no trophies and no karma that just makes an occasional comment it makes it kind of obvious that that account is either an alt or that it’s a new guy. And nobody wants people to think that they’re new! Maybe one of the few ways to get around this is to right off the bat make some really meta comments around reddit so people think, “oh wow, this guy must be a lot older than he seems!” But then you’re just gaining karma for your alt instead! As such, it’s better just to put some trophies on your alt. And what better way to do this than to participate in reddit santas on your alt instead of your main account?

But that also raises the question, why would he put these cooler trophies on his alt account and not just put some of the more boring trophies on his alt instead? Well, he wouldn’t want to put reddit mold on both because it would start to make it obvious that that account was an alt (but we can see right through your games, can’t we, spez?). But more importantly, spez **HATES** the santa trophies. 

Now you might be thinking, “ok, now where did this come from? Proof?” To which I would say I was getting to that! So it’s kind of a little known fact that /u/kickme444 started the whole reddit santa thing. And spez can’t stand kickme444. But why is this? Well, it’s simple, really. Look at all of kickme444’s trophies! Any normal redditor would realize that karma, trophies, etc, etc,. have pretty much no intrinsic value. But spez is no normal redditor! Spez is the cofounder of reddit, like the Woz to Apple! And his trophy case is completely lacking! How embarrassing! Even Chairman Pao has more than double what he has!

Spez knew kickme444 for a loooong time. And kickme444 always thought they were friends because spez would always be talking to him about relationship problems or whatever else might be going on with him. But what kickme444 didn’t realize is that spez was just keeping his friends close, and **his enemies closer**. This is a warning to you, kickme444! Next thing you know he might be stealing your trophies or your karma!

Now you may be wondering, why doesn’t spez just, you know, spawn himself some trophies if he’s the CEO now? This is typically a common oversight to those who are new at reddit detective work. But the answer is simply this. Should one of the other admins notice that he’s giving himself a number of trophies he’s unqualified for… well he certainly won’t be fired, as admins have done a bunch worse things than that from what I learned over at /r/conspiracy. No, the problem is that it would be even more humiliating if one of the other admins found out that he felt bad about his lack of trophies and just decided to spawn more!

Think back to our retarded puppy analogy. You take the puppy home and you think, “what have I done to deserve this?” You feed it. You try to play with it (but most of the time fail because its motor control is pitiful (melted cerebellum, etc, etc). You make it pee. So on and so forth. But there’s just something about such a pitiful, pathetic dog that makes you want to watch it all the time and hug it. Oh don’t get me wrong. You still loathe that bald guy for giving you a dud, and you really wish you didn’t wait in that waitlist without any other pets except your goldfish which you have no idea how it’s still alive for 15 years! But just something about a pathetic dog makes you want to pet it and hug it and not smack the shit out of it, instilling in it’s stupid dog brain every day that you are the master here and that the dog has no place to bark at the neighbors in the small hole in the wooden fence that shows the neighbors gardening like every other goddamned day. Maybe it’s just been too long since you’ve had a decent dog? Actually, come to think of it, your last one was pretty dumb as well. Oh well. What can you do? You don’t feel like waiting *again* for another dog, so you make do. 

This is very much like how everyone pays attention to spez, even when he wasn’t the CEO! Everyone’s paying so much attention to this him, and as frustrating as it is he’s never given the opportunity to get himself some of those sweet, sweet trophies. He does fudge the karma on his alt a little bit. I mean, he’s had some comments in the past that loosely connected him to his main account the he’s deleted but they barely added up to peanuts as far as karma goes. “I’ll just add some karma to account for inflation” is probably definitely along the lines of what he was thinking.
Also, take a look at fuzzynavel’s account. Notice anything unusual! Right! Fuzzynavel/spez is the moderator of the subreddit, “/r/housepets”! Why would spez make a completely empty subreddit on his alt, and not even put anything of value in the sidebar or make any posts? Why, it’s simple really. To give the alt, fuzzynavel, more validity! Nothing says “I’m a seasoned veteran of a reddit user” like being the moderator of a subreddit or two! Of course, spez couldn’t add his alt as a mod of any of his subreddits that he modded at the time, primarily because he didn’t want people to make the connection! And he was doing a pretty good job up until now.

So in short, you will find that spez was in fact the same user as fuzzynavel, who just tried to make it seem like being the moderator of a cannibalism subreddit was an accident, but in reality it was not! Far from it! …but wait. Why would he create a cannibals subreddit if he was trying so hard to hide the fact that he was a cannibal? In addition, there was already a subreddit at the time for cannibalism - /r/cannibalism! Why wouldn’t he just use that?

Well, I’ll tell you! Spez doesn’t just want to be *part* of a community about cannibalism. He wants to own the community about cannibalism! Spez wants to be able to tell all of his cannibal friends to come and join his reddit community! Think about it. How would r/Cannibals, a subreddit that until yesterday nobody except spez knew about, and even if they did find out about it, they would probably go to /r/cannibalism, which has a much more active community, relatively speaking. How would spez’s cannibalism subreddit manage to get 116 readers? Undoubtedly at least some of these readers came from the post yesterday when somebody pointed out that spez was a moderator of r/cannibals. However, 116 does seem rather steep. Unfortunately, we’ll never know for sure unless spez were to publicize the traffic stats. 

So what are the implications of having a CEO cannibal? Well, as most people know, cannibalism is illegal in most parts of the world. Does he do it to feel cool? To get respect from his peers by being “edgy”? Who knows. But what matters is the implications of being a cannibal. I’d like to tell you story to help you gain a bit of perspective about the situation.

In the small town of Dicktown, NJ, lived a small boy and his two parents. The boy had two fathers, who lived together since the late 90’s. While they did everything together, same sex marriage wasn’t legal in New Jersey at the time, and it was very much frowned upon in this area so they kept their relationship secret. They adopted a four year old son in 1999 and while one father went to work every day to pay the bills, the other stayed home with the son. Same sex marriage wasn’t legal in New Jersey until 2013, but the fathers wanted to be married for their son so in fall of 2004 they moved to a small town off of Webster Lake in Webster, Massachusetts and married the same week. The boy was lovingly raised by both of his parents, and though he never truly understood how his parents were related for a long time, it didn’t matter to him as the three of them were very close. 

However, something seemed to be missing to one of the boy’s fathers. Aaron was this father’s name. Aaron was happy as things stood, but still wanted something more for the family. He discussed with the other father, Samuel, the prospect of getting a family pet. Samuel said the idea never crossed his mind, but that he would be willing to try it. However, Samuel wanted to make sure that if they got a pet, it would be a pet that would only be the best for little Raul, their son, to which Aaron fully agreed. Aaron asked if they wanted something less expensive to take care of, like a Cat or a bird purchased from a store but Samuel said no, neither of those would be good for Raul, as Raul wouldn’t be able to talk to either of them. Only a dog will work for Raul. Raul is four years old now, and should have friends. However, since his parents were fugitives they could never take Raul to school in the event that somebody might see one of them. As such, they decided to get a dog. 

However, this was only one of many problems solved. Neither Samuel nor Raul knew what kind of dog they wanted to get for Raul. Samuel suggests getting a Poodle, but Aaron insists that a Poodle would be too smart and they wanted a dumber dog. Samuel then suggests a German Shepherd and Aaron at first thinks he’ll be too violent, but realizes that there are locations from where one can purchase a German Shepherd that will supposedly be nothing other than perfect dog, including being friendly and nonviolent. Samuel asks Aaron if he knows what he’s talking about, and says yes, you’re almost certainly thinking of the Old Eteks monastery way up north. The problem with this monastery is that in order to get a dog, it’s not uncommon to have to wait years and years, since these dogs are so highly valued.

Aaron says we should wait, as being hasty to get a crap dog won’t do anyone any good. Samuel agrees. They call and talk over the phone about themselves, why they want a dog, etc. and eventually are put on the waitlist… currently running about seven years. Aaron says they were lucky to only have to wait seven years.

In the meantime, Raul gets old enough to walk to school himself. The teachers are very curious why Raul seems to know almost nothing despite his claims to be a student who just recently moved in the district, but Raul promised not to tell the teachers the name of his parents. Raul makes a friend by the name of Thomas, but Thomas dies a week later due to cardiovascular disease only Raul, a prostitute, a compulsive slapper, and the well-off CFO of a brokerage firm attended the service. He *was* the 67-year-old custodian after all. Thomas lived a very simple life from what Raul knew of him. He grew up in a small town in Utah right outside of Salt Lake City, and himself admitted that he was never the smartest person. He lived a simple life, taking odd jobs for most of his years until he became a custodian for a government agency branch in 1984. The agency’s budget was cut in 1986 and Thomas tried to get a job as a custodian at a different branch or at the headquarters, but they were already overstaffed and couldn’t bear to hire another person.

So Thomas decided that he would look for somewhere to work locally again. Being a custodian didn’t really give him a decent income, in fact, it was rather poor. However, it gave him what he needed to get by and he enjoyed the job to some degree, and that’s all that Thomas could really have ever asked for. Raul landed a job as a custodian for the local school district in the early 2000’s. The district was tiny, and as such, all of the grades went to one school. Once again, Thomas didn’t make a particularly remarkable salary but it was enough to live off of. 

The one thing that Thomas did wish, however, was that he could have someone to love. All his life since he was 18 and his parents kicked him out of the house, he’s been living alone in his small apartment. Thomas didn’t want to stoop so low as to purchase a prostitute with his hard earned money, but he did anyway. What he didn’t expect, however, was that him and this prostitute would get along better than either of them could ever have anticipated. They were married in 1993 at a small wedding consisting of Thomas, the prostitute, Libby, and Libby’s daughter, Faye.

Libby later moved into Thomas’s apartment, and they were both ecstatic for weeks, finally having a reason to live. Faye, who was accidentally conceived six years ago by one of her clients resulting in the divorce of her previous husband who accused her of cheating on him, was six years old and went to school in the local district — the same one where Thomas worked. Thomas was familiar with most of the student’s faces by now after working there for some time, though it did take him some time to learn the faces of the new kindergartners every year. They all looked the same to him.

Every so often Thomas would see Faye in the hallway and they would wave to each other. Faye’s friends thought she was weird for being so close to the janitor, and she didn’t want to tell them that he was her father because then she’d be subject to more bullying, so she just slapped them across the face. Faye would often wind up in the principal’s office and resulted in phone calls home on more than one occasion. She would always be scared about what her parents had to say when she got home, but neither Thomas nor Libby really cared about her slapping habit, especially since she was doing it in her father’s defense. So Faye would just keep slapping away on an almost weekly basis. She met the judge several times, but the judge in that town really didn’t give a shit about anything she would do.

At least, that’s what Libby and Thomas thought. As it turns out, Faye was “servicing” the judge in return for being excused on all of her charges. This was between her and the judge for at least ten more years. But that is a different story.

What Thomas never knew and he never tried to learn about Faye was her history with her other father. I mean, most would probably immediately assume that someone rented a prostitute, somewhere along the line someone forgot to take their pills or whatever, and the guy never sees her again and that’s that? Well that’s what happened.

Her then-husband, Margus, or “Marg” as everyone called him, was a manager for a brokerage firm located in Manhattan. He went to college at Penn State University as a business major, not really knowing what he wanted to do but figured he would find out somewhere along the line, and that his business major could be used just about anywhere. He was going as undecided for a year or so but hated the general education credits he was being forced to take from the course, so decided to pick up something that he could use for just about anything.

Well, it was a smart move to some degree, but it was lucky for him that where he was trying to get into didn’t really care about the major. He applied for an internship at a very large brokerage firm, “Wetrade”, in 1985. The New York City branch had just recently opened up and was looking for people, and interns. He started out as a “runner,” getting people coffee, documents from the copier, and whatever else needed to be done around the office. What little he did see of people working with actual stocks, though had interested him. Now keep in mind that it was much easier at this time to become a stockbroker than it is now… you didn’t need the passion – the determination to actually make a profit. Sure, you would still be cold-calling people from the phone book, but that was just a part of being a broker, nothing to be done about it.

In short, he went and got his certification sponsored by Wetrade in order to be able to trade stocks and actually became a broker. He became a certified broker by Wetrade, and stayed a broker for maybe five years or so, then was promoted to CFO thanks to his BA in business and having joined Wetrade early on during its career. Wetrade did require him to pursue further education, though, as having a CFO with only a bachelor’s naturally made them look bad, but they didn’t have any other valid candidates at the time, and he *did* know the CEO after all. 

While he was CFO, he was working around the clock five days a week, sometimes Saturdays as well. One particular Friday night he crashed at a bar and was stripping the bottle of its label. A woman sat next to him, asked if she could sit there, they began to talk, etc, etc. This woman was Libby, and this is how they met. While this relationship was unfortunately rather short lived, it was rather intimate, and they had a child in almost no time (or so Marg thought). But Marg was a smart guy, and he knew when that baby was born and it had blue eyes but both Marg and Libby did not, that something was horribly wrong. Marg cried for forty days and forty nights, but Libby wasted no time getting back to business. It wasn’t before long that she met Thomas.

However, Marg would not so easily let go of Libby. After all, he did initiate the desire for divorce, and while Libby was very confused at the prospect of Marg not knowing what she does for a living (she swears she tells him, like, every day since the day they met) she apologized profusely. Was Marg just being dense? When he started to think rationally and from an objective point of view, he started to feel bad. After all, it wasn’t Libby’s fault that she got pregnant with some random client. Well, it was half her fault, but at least it was half *not* her fault. Right?

So Marg decided that he would call Libby and do whatever he could for her. He did feel horrible after all.

Marg was depressed to find that Libby and Thomas were married–but he refused to accept that as a final answer. He decided to straight out ask if they were still having financial troubles. Libby was at first appalled that he could just brazenly ask about their financial situation… but at the same time, she would be lying if she said she wasn’t at least slightly relieved because they both knew that they were in trouble. Libby was a prostitute and Thomas was a custodian, *and* they were both raising a child. They were collectively making very little a year and in a way felt bad for trying to raise a child off of this meager income. 

Marg said that he could help her out, but under one condition… he would be allowed to stay with them. Their house in Dicktown wasn’t particularly close to the branch in NYC, but it was much closer than where he had lived at the time in northern Delaware. He would have to go up to New York, get a hotel for a few days, and go back down. Wetrade would pay for the apartment and the travel expenses, but it certainly didn’t make travelling any less of a hassle, and Wetrade would certainly appreciate a closer distance that they didn’t have to pay as much for as well.

Marg told Libby that there would be no BS, especially now that she’s remarried, and that he would pay rent and more. However, none of this mattered if Thomas didn’t agree… after all, it was his apartment. That said, Libby has now been with Thomas long enough to know what he likes and doesn’t like, and she rather easily schmoozed him into accepting her ex-husband stay at the apartment – but only since he offered to help out financially (why else?). 

So now Marg, Libby, Thomas, and Faye were all living in one tiny apartment. Marg slept on a couch in the living room, Libby and Thomas shared a bed in the master bedroom, and Faye had her own twin bed in her bedroom. Marg had originally intended to move out before too long and find an apartment near, if not in, the city. He didn’t foresee, however, him taking a liking to the family setting that was going on in this small apartment, even if he was single himself. As such, he would end up staying for quite a while. He didn’t have time for dating as CFO, and he didn’t feel like going through the trouble of finding an apartment, taking out a loan, and so on. So he stayed there, and everybody benefitted.

Fast forward a number of years, the four of them are getting along fantastically. Marg is still CFO of Wetrade, Libby still does what she does best, Faye is in grade school, and Thomas is still the school’s (sole) custodian. Now, as custodian, he knew a number of the student’s faces, but he learned even more when he started to keep an eye out for Faye. In particular, he started to have pleasant conversations with one of the children who would eat lunch alone in the cafeteria while he would stand by the trash can to keep students from throwing out the backpacks of the other students. These regular conversations weren’t long lasted, however, as Thomas died of cardiovascular disease not too long later. 

Raul and his parents went to the memorial service, but the parents had to stay in their 1972 Ford Pinto with the custom tinted windows to stay hidden. When some police showed up, they had to book it out of there, though Raul was still at the service. Raul, with tears in his eyes, stood at Thomas’s grave, long after the service, to pay his respects. Standing with him were none other than Marg, Libby, and Faye. On the frustratingly sunny and otherwise cheery day, the four of them stood at Thomas’s tombstone, reading Thomas’s name, birthdate, and epitaph written by him when he was whiling away the last few days of his life in the hospital – “Thomas Joyner – 1937 - 2004 – Spez is a fucking cannibal”

When dealing with a cannibal, one must carefully consider how to go about addressing the issue without upsetting them, unless you can communicate anonymously. This is because the very definition of a cannibal is someone who consumes other humans, and they are probably more willing to consume those who are more hostile or aggressive to them than those who are close to them. Now, many people enjoy using reddit for its anonymity, but you must consider that spez is now CEO of reddit, and as some people might know but many might not, reddit **does**, in fact, log IP addresses. If you don’t believe me, just check out the Reddit [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy). In there it is clearly stated that “reddit stores the IP addresses associated with specific posts, comments, and private messages for 90 days after they are made or sent.” and that “We also log, and retain indefinitely, the IP address from which the account is initially created.” So what this essentially means is that if you challenge Spez’s cannibalistic practices, he has your IP address and is more than likely willing to come to your house and rape you, kill you, skin you, and eat you (and if you’re very, very lucky, in that order). Or he’ll at least mail you dog shit, god knows what he’ll do; I’m pretty sure a prerequisite for working at Reddit is being mentally unstable.

Now, you might be thinking, “But that’s just an IP address! Unless you’re, like, the government or something, you can’t get a particular address from it! And in addition, it’s more likely than not a dynamic IP address, so the address is always changing!”

To which I would say you’re right! But let’s refer to the previous text so graciously provided by reddit’s wiki: “reddit stores the IP addresses associated with specific posts, comments, and private messages for 90 days after they are made or sent.” What this means is that if you do just about anything on reddit, **including** message spez and tell him to stop being a fucking cannibal, they have your most recent IP address. Now of course, if you’re at McDonalds or whatever then they don’t have your IP, but this would involve getting your neckbeard ass out the door and in the car – something very few neckbeards want to do if I know anything about our neckbeard community. You could also use a VPN but on the same note, what neckbeard is going to have money for a VPN? Ok, how about a web proxy? Oh well that’s great and all except that study has shown that **96 percent of proxies log all of your data**! [Source](http://73percentofproxies.blogspot.com/2015/07/blog-post.html) Well that sucks… that about Tor? **Tor is completely compromised**!! [Source](http://73percentofproxies.blogspot.com/2015/07/blog-post.html)

Now consider the next piece of information. Regarding the whole “IP address can only be looked up by the government” orderal… just remember who reddit really is. At the time of writing, Reddit is the **10th biggest website by traffic in the United States** [Source](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com). Now imagine you’re a tiny-ass ISP like Time Warner Cable. The CEO of Reddit comes to you and is like, “shit boy u i got money n i got ips u got addresses for dis money, lets make it happen k?” What do you say to them? Yeah, that’s right. You say, “k,” because you know damn well that this fuccboi be givin yo greedy ISP ass a shitton of money for deez addresses. Nobody has to know that you’re selling them out, and the ones who do find out will find out too late because they’re getting their ass thrown in a casserole!

Pretty much my point is that if you want to message spez about his unhealthy habit you can’t do it through reddit! Now I don’t know spez’s email and even if I did I wouldn’t be able to post it here because krispykowards would ban me for brigading. SO what’s the solution? Well, it’s quite simply to **write in this thread how much of a retard spez is for being a cannibal!** Now you’re probably thinking, “but you just told me if I do that he’ll eat me, dipshit.” But here’s the thing. Everybody already hates spez. Remember the puppy? 

Spez already has one hell of a hit list and he sure as hell isn’t going to put people who just tell him how bad of an idea it is to eat other people over those who have offended him and what not in his past. Think about it, he’s the co-founder of Reddit. Think about how much hate reddit and redditors as a whole have gathered on 4chan, facebook, youtube, CNN, reddit, etc. Now imagine that you’re a cannibal who’s hungry and is looking for people to eat. Where’s the first place you go? That’s right, those people who have told you over the years how absolutely horrible, how vile, how **absolutely disgusting** reddit is! And all that anger you’ve built up over the years while in limbo as the Reddit admins’ pet, all those names you’ve written down of people you would just *LOVE* to consume is finally starting to have a purpose! And you know for a fact that if one thing is certain, it’s that you got yourself one **long-ass list a’ names**.

So now you’re panicking. I remember trash-talking reddit some years back… am I on the long-ass list a names? Probably, unfortunately (for you). What can you really do if you know that you were put on the long-ass list a names? Well, chill out and take a deep breath because we’re going to make this through, but it will take some effort on your part as well. Just follow what I say very closely.

**First of all**, remember that he is *just a human being* (and a real hero (lol but not really)). Over the years he’s picked up detective skills from those who have tried run from his consumption in the past. And remember, he does travel all across the planet to get what he wants. What else do you think the CEO of reddit does? What is there to do? That’s right! Sit with your head up your ass in San Francisco, and when you’re not doing that, travel the globe looking for people to eat! 

But with this in mind, remember that it’s pretty much all he does, as someone with an ADHD level like his doesn’t like to sit with his head up his ass more than six days a week. If he can’t find someone after so long, it’s not unlikely that he’ll give up. But remember! **Don’t hide with family and friends!** If he finds you with a family member or a friend, not only will he eat you, but he’ll also eat your loved one in front of you as punishment for making him go all this way! [Source](http://www.reddit.com/u/spez). Also, go at least three states in any direction away from where you currently reside! It don’t matter if you live in Providence RI or buttfuck, Alaska. Spez will always look in about a two state radius from where your last logged IP said you were.

TL;DR
You really have to be careful about what you’re doing because if you happen to make a misstep at the wrong place the results may be worse than anticipated!"
3cycqb,2,2015-07-11,Regarding Recommendation Letters,beespatellas,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/3cycqb/regarding_recommendation_letters/,"So, I'm in a bit of a pickle and I'm starting to get worried. Back in April, I asked one of my science professors for a letter of recommendation. He was not responsive to emails so I talked to him in person and he agreed to write one. I told him I would like it by the end of May. Fast forward a few months. He still has not submitted it. I have emailed him twice over the past 3 weeks and called his school number/left a message. I'm worried he will just never get back to me and just forget to submit. Many med schools require 2 science profs, and he is one of my 2. At what point do schools put a hold on my app for not having the required letters? Before interview invites or just before acceptance? I have 5 other letters currently (science prof, non-science prof, PI for research, and internship mentor). It would be very difficult for me to get another science prof with such late notice. What do I do??"
3cyt5w,1,2015-07-11,Can I have a friend ?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3cyt5w/can_i_have_a_friend/,"The past 3 months I've my problems really began taking a heavy toll on my mental health.  Really a bummer. On top of that I just broke up with my gf. 

Basically it was because of communication problems that were my fault. I'm a major introvert and a bit depressed so as the summer came around I just lost interest in everything. All I wanted to do was stay in my room. Me and my now ex didn't talk because I didn't write her and when we did I'd seem uninterested.  The fact that we broke up isn't all that bad. It's the fact that she began slandering my name on social media which made me very angry and I'm a very very easygoing person. 

I'm a large guy, gentle giant so to speak and I guess I have control of my anger but I fear that I'll be triggered and do something I regret. 

I have no friends and family is not there for me. The only person who I believe genuinely cares for me is English teacher. Jesus I wish I can see her now. I suppose I'll use these couple of months for and bit of self improvement because I am convinced I'm selfish and nd I hate that I am this way. A true friend wouldn't be bad. And I don't mean we talk for a week and then your in the wind.  I will appreciate it regardless,  just wished I had a friend that'll be a friend and not a  failed intern type of friend."

3cz0ym,35,2015-07-11,Help dealing with my emotions after my best friend committed suicide.,DivineYuri,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/3cz0ym/help_dealing_with_my_emotions_after_my_best/,"This last Tuesday, my best friend took his own life. I'm getting feelings as if it was my fault, because I didn't contact him for almost two weeks so I wasn't able to notice any problems he was having. 

I don't have a brother, and he's a friend I would call one. I'm feeling distraught as if a chunk of my has been ripped out of me. I lost the single person that I believe completely understood me, and I could call my best friend. 

I lost him, and I feel like I need to do my best to help his family while this has helped somewhat I haven't found myself recovering all that much. I'm having my emotions violently shifted from accepting to enraged to breaking out crying as I don't know what to do. He was there for half my life so far, and was my best friend throughout it. Now he's gone.

We shared so much while in High School we would both create stories, and worlds to share together. We would give advice on each other's worlds, and look to improve. We enjoyed games together, and supported each other when we both decided what we wanted to do. I started to study hard to become a Engineer, and he pushed his body to become a Marine. We supported each other threw and threw. 

As High School ended I went off to college, and he joined the marines. We didn't see each other for a year and a half. Though we talked for that time, and I finally got to see him again. It felt we were as close as ever when we hanged out again. Then a few months later one of his kidneys failed I tried to keep him company during this time, and support him though I was busy with school so I wasn't able to be there as much as I wish I could. When school was over I had an internship, and while I kept myself in touch I still had things to do. A few weeks ago his second kidney went. I heard about this, but was so busy that I felt I couldn't call him. I was too busy, and then this last Wednesday I learned he committed suicide.  

I've had some support, but he was the one that I would of been close to if this was anybody else. The sympathy of other people doesn't seem to help me like it should. As if the only one that can truly repair that hole is him, and only him. 

I guess I'm asking is if any other INFJ's have dealt with losing someone that you would count as extremely close, and what has helped you recover?

(I'm sorry if you feel this is all over the place I'm not clear on my own thoughts about anything atm.) "
3cz9q1,11,2015-07-11,"The whole ""Linkedin"", banking, business, hedge fund, resume/CV boasting, graduate snob culture.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3cz9q1/the_whole_linkedin_banking_business_hedge_fund/,"I'm nearly 30 and looking for a new career having come from a blue collar background and exploring every career possibility including white collar roles in business/marketing/finance etc.


One thing that has really irritated me is the whole culture of high flying graduate snob culture. You know the type, mid/late twenties, captain of the university rowing team, graduated from a good university, loads of extra-curricular activities, managed to land an internship with a Fortune 500 company, really good looking, great high school/college grades and works in a middle-management type job or marketing/accounting etc.


Most companies look down at ANYONE that hasn't followed the same template. To land a decent finance/business job you must:

* Ideally have gone to private school
* Earned excellent high school grades
* Gone to a good university/college
* Gained an internship with a good company
* Be involved in some sort of extra-curricular activity, president of a glee club/rowing club/badminton society/chess club
* Be good looking with good teeth
* Probably have rich parents who were hedge fund managers, lawyers, doctors etc




**Linkedin** is ridiculous. I've read tons of profiles on there. It always has the same *perfect* picture of the person smiling, wearing a nice suit. They'll go on to use the SAME words and phrases as thousands of other profiles things like:

* ""High level communicator""
* ""A genuine passion and drive for growth and developing business models""
* ""Highly capable""
* ""Highly motivated""
* ""A natural leader""

It's the same on almost every profile. They've all done the same, graduated from college/university with honours, interned at JPMorgan, then somehow landed a senior position having only left high school 5 years earlier. Seriously?


And if you don't fit that mold, such as myself, you have ZERO chance of being accepted on a graduate scheme/placement/internship. Your face won't fit. You're too ""old"" at 30 etc. 


Experience seems to count for nothing. Your face either fits or it doesn't. If you're not 21/22/23 or a fresh graduate in his/her early-twenties, you may as well not exist.



The biggest irritant for me, is the amount of crap all these graduates in marketing/finance/banking/IT put that for the majority is complete lies. For example, most profiles mention they have a ""real passion for procurement and investment"" or ""a genuine interest in financial projections"". Seriously? These thousands of people genuinely ***enjoy*** discussing finance, marketing, ""procurement"" etc all day, day in day out? Part of me thinks that perhaps the financial reward and ""status"" is far more important to these people.




Horrible culture of snobby people that turn their noses up at anyone that doesn't fit their mold of an ideal candidate, or who hasn't gone to a certain school/college or hasn't interned as such and such a place.

3czj4n,0,2015-07-12,28 and struggling badly. Constant up and down finances and no clear direction in my life.,plipmaster,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3czj4n/28_and_struggling_badly_constant_up_and_down/,"So I just turned 28 and I’m sick of my situation.  I’ve been in and out of employment and different careers more times than I care to count in the last 6 years and I’m starting to feel so hopeless.  It seems every time I finally start to get ahead with my finances, a layoff would come along and I would have to spend almost all my savings getting by till I found a new job.  My wife and I are big savers thank god, so it worries me to think about what would have happened to us if we weren’t keen on saving.  The problem is, we feel so behind where we feel like we should be.  We want to purchase a small starter home, we want to be investing into a retirement plan, we want to start preparing to have children, but we don’t have any of that because as soon as we save up 10-20 thousand, we find ourselves having to face unemployment or some big relocation or something and draining through all of that reserve....  (And yes, we are frugal with expenses too!!)

The big problem for me though is I just can’t seem to find a solid career to invest in...  Nothing feels right to me.  I’ve become a jack of all trades, master of none and while I used to think that had its merits, I’ve come to realize no employer wants the jack of all trades.  They want the specialist or t-shaped employee (breadth and depth) even when they are most likely going to require their employee to become a jack of all trades anyway....  Since high school I knew I always wanted to have a solid and long career, but couldn’t quite figure out what I wanted to do.  Ten years later, I find myself asking the same question.  Sometimes I’ll spend hours just meditating on the subject, but I just get more and more frustrated.  Things I’m good at bore me to death, while things I’m interested in do not pay well or are too far out of reach.  Sometimes I think I should have just become a doctor or something because here I am at 28 and pretty much in the same boat as I was when I graduated college.  No real net worth, moving job to job, and feeling wholly unfulfilled. 

Before I continue, let me give some quick backstory:

Originally I was dead set on being a game developer.  This has been my career dream since childhood.  I was planning on going to a 4 year game design school for a B.S in Game Development where they teach you the works (programming, art, animation, sound, design, etc).  Unfortunately, my family was extremely against the idea and considering I would have to relocate out of state and get more expensive loans, I was talked (well, forced) out of the idea.  It’s one of the biggest regrets I have till this day. Instead, I attended a local University where I studied more traditional degree choices in the health field.  I did that for 3 years and hated it.  I wasn’t even close to finishing my degree because so many times I was unable to enroll in courses I needed and advisers led me astray by having me take electives that really weren’t helping me other than filling my schedule.  Not only that, but I couldn’t settle on a specific degree and I just in general hated the experience because I didn’t feel like I was learning anything important.  So many of my professors were utterly terrible and I felt like I was just wasting my money.  (Now that I am older and wiser, I realized that is just how college is!!)  I dropped out.  Considering I was already 3 years deep in time and money, I still wanted to do my 4 year game design program but felt the cost and time investment was too great now.  Instead, I chose to go to an audio technical school with the goal of working my way into video game audio. I went to the one year program and loved it.  I aced the program and got a game audio internship at a Triple A game studio before I graduated.  I thought I had made it, but I was naive.  I worked at that company for 2 years as a permatemp before getting laid off.   This is when things began to go bad for me.  

I spent the next 3 years putting immense effort into trying to get my game audio career off the ground.  I worked some very nice contracts (up to $55 an hour + OT) but they were always temporary with no benefits or medical.  Any free time I had was spent building my network and trying to secure more full-time employment.  It was a all-consuming effort that ultimately led to depression, anxiety, and a myriad of health issues that still bother me today.   While I managed to scrounge up contract jobs here and there, and had over a dozen final on-site interviews at some very well known studios, I was never able to obtain a full-time position.  I threw in the towel after 5 years of trying to make it work.  I was 26 at the time.  

At that point, I knew I had to get a degree, but once again considering the time and money thing, I chose a online degree in Accounting, something I knew I could get through quickly because it was an area I was strong in (even though I disliked it).  As I obtained my degree online, I took other jobs as a Consultant, Project Manager, Scrum Master, Administrative Assistant, Accounting Clerk, but they were always temporary and I didn’t feel good about any of them.  Mind you, I did love my game audio work, but the pursuit of it was killing me and I just wasn’t getting anywhere with it.  I realized I needed something else and I’ve pretty much since given up game audio due to the terrible anxiety even the thought of pursuing it again gives me.  

So right now I just finished my degree, and I’m looking for entry level accounting positions, but I still have strong doubts about what I’m doing considering my Accounting Clerk position (which had a lot more high level responsibilities) was extremely boring 90% of the time.  There are fields I still would love to get into, but they seem WAY too far out of reach.  I still sometimes feel I should go back to my Game Design school and get a degree in that like I always wanted, but I don’t have 2-3 years and 60k to drop anymore, and I’m wary of the game industry after seeing the volatility of it.  (Even in the more secure programming type positions).   I also always really wanted to learn how to code, as a software engineer, but I worry I’m just not cut out for it.  Even if I was cut out for it, I fear it can take 2-3 years to get good enough to get a job doing it and that seems so long.  And if I don’t have a Computer Science degree or similar?  Well that will even cut down my chances for making it a career even more.  Sometimes I think I want to start my own business, but where do I get the capital?  Sometimes I think I want to write a novel, but where do I find the financial freedom to be able to focus in on that?  The point is I need a steady way to produce income, and I just can’t seem to find my answer.    I’m like a ping pong ball just bouncing back and forth between all these different fields, and my time and money to experiment is pretty much run out in my opinion.  Some people tell me, 28 is young yet, go back to school for a whole new degree, but the thought of taking that time to do that and the money needed terrifies me.  


So what do I do?  How do I know what to finally settle in on, and what to focus my time, money, and energy into doing to provide a livelihood for my family and I?   It takes everything I can muster to avoid falling into a deep depression that lingers over me, and I’m worried if I don’t feel like I’m on the “right” path soon, the depression is ultimately going to catch up with me.  

Thanks for any advice.  I appreciate it!


EDIT:  On the plus side, both me and my wife have 750+ credit scores, save as much as we can, and spend as little as we can.  The only debt we have currently is our school loans and we pay them off as we can.  Like I said, the biggest problem for us is the constant feast and famine finances!

3czp6d,8,2015-07-12,Husband gave me an ultimatum.....move or divorce.,littleorangemonkeys,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/3czp6d/husband_gave_me_an_ultimatummove_or_divorce/,"Together since college, married almost three years.  Lots of shit has happened to us in the last year.  I realized I'm not good at supporting someone with a mental illness.  He sank further and further in to depression, let his anxiety and anger completely take over, and turned to alcohol to treat it all.  We separated at the beginning of the year after a particularly nasty fight.  

I've had issues with our marriage for a while; division of household labor, sex life, his anger issues and drinking.  Taken one at a time, the issues didn't seem that bad - something we could work on together and overcome.  But now that I've been away from it for several months, I realize just how unhappy I was.  

He can't talk about our marriage without blowing up.  Call it anxiety, call it anger, whatever, but we cannot have a conversation about what happened or how to move forward without a verbal tirade from him.  Name-calling, saying hurtful things (which he later takes back and admits he said just to hurt me), and even through email I can feel his anger and rage.  I have suggested therapy multiple times, he either rejects or makes a half-hearted sweeping gestures that never have follow-through. Then he calms down, promises that things will be better, but tries to sweep our past issues under the rug.  I can't trust that things won't crop up again until we deal with them....and they always crop up again, because we never deal with them.  

Cut to tonight.  I get a series of text messages (it's always text messages).  He found an old letter I wrote to him after we graduated college.  Begging him to stay in the state for the summer while I finished my internship, then I'd move for him. That was 12 years and a lifetime ago.  I had no career.  I do now. 

Now he wants me to move back to his home state.  I'd have to give up any chance of my career since there's nothing there for me.  He also said that ""This is our last communication on our issues unless you agree to DO something to show you are invested in this"" aka move to his home state to be with him.  

If I don't agree to move with no discussion, all he wants from me is my signature on the divorce papers.  I am not opposed to moving in theory, but not without some therapy for him and couples counseling for both of us.   Even if he started his own therapy, I might consider moving for the chance that couples therapy would be productive if he could get his anger under control. 

 He's moved twice for me and my career, but hasn't had the persistence to stick with any one thing for more than a year.  He wants to be self-employed, but doesn't have the drive to build his own business.  He wants his job to have deeper meaning and can't stand it when a job is hard or boring and ""crushes his soul"".  We have different values on work and money, and it's become increasingly hard for me to support him while he finds his passion.

So I'm looking at getting a divorce.  Because I can't move with no forward progress on his part.  It's killing me, because he is going to see this as me being stubborn and emotionless.  That my career is more important than my marriage.  That I really am the cold, heartless, manipulative woman he believes me to be.  

The good parts are so good.  There is so much potential in our relationship, but it has never, in 13 years, materialized.  I'm just stuck in this holding pattern of thinking if I just helped him out, supported him, kept our lives running, that he would turn in to the man I know he can be.  I think I'm mourning the loss of what could be more than the loss of the reality that I was living this whole time. 

I'm emotionally wrecked because by making this choice, my marriage is over.  It's the right choice, but I can't help feeling regret and overwhelming sadness.  

How do I feel better about this? "
3czts9,1,2015-07-12,Everything Seems To Go Wrong For Me,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3czts9/everything_seems_to_go_wrong_for_me/,"So, I'm here because I don't want to bother my friends with how I'm feeling or burden my parents. I'm a 24 year old guy, I've lived overseas in Thailand for 16 years and graduated high-school in 2009 and moved to the United States and drifted from place to place (California, Indiana)... Since I graduated I can't seem to make the right decisions. Most of my friends graduated at 22 and are well off into their adult lives. They're getting married, doing awesome things with their jobs, etc... And here I am the kid that keeps fucking up, still stuck in university (a super senior of some kind). It's 2015, I'm 4 credits away from graduating with a BA degree in History. The only class I need is a general education math course... I've sucked at math since the fifth grade. It has always been the bane of my existence, despite being good at other subjects. I can never wrap my mind around math. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, this isn't exactly conveying what I wanted to convey so... here's a better explanation. I attended a Christian private university 4-5 years. Half of my family members advised against it and the other half said go for it. I'm not a huge party guy, so my logic was that if I go to a Christian school they'll keep me ""somewhat"" out of trouble and I can keep my parents happy cause they were missionaries at the time. (Stupid reason, I know)... Needless to say I've amounted a massive amount of school debt. My parents even took out a loan, to help me. I feel super guilty about taking any form of money from them. **Fast Forward** to my supposed final semester... I got suspended from said private Christian university with... 4 credits left to graduate... Because I didn't attend enough chapels... The reason for that stemmed from the fact that I couldn't stand to go to the gatherings due to my ex-girlfriend (who I bought an engagement ring for) being there with her new ""rebound"" boyfriend. When she dumped me it shattered my entire perception of the Christian world etc... I wouldn't say I was a super strong believer or practitioner of any kind. But if you had asked me, I would have said I believed that there was a God... I know it's dumb, but after she dumped me I quit believing, I wanted nothing to do with Christianity. I felt and still feel to this day that certain people within the administration at my school sided with her after the breakup. I don't know, call it paranoia. **Fast Forward** again, it's July 2015. I am too afraid to tell me parents the reason for me getting kicked out of school. I told them that there was a proficiency exam to get into the Math class that I needed (which was half true) and that I had failed. Needless to say, I had to move back in with my parents (and my handicapped grandmother)... I feel like a total loser. Not only did I fail them, by not graduating in the expected timeline. But it looks like I'm going to end up doing it again. They paid $3000 to register me for two summer classes that would give me more than the 4 credits I need to transfer back to my original school for my degree. Unfortunately, it's looking more and more like I'm going to fail both classes. They were 10 week classes condensed into 5 weeks and I haven't been able to keep up. Despite the fact that I quit my job to give myself more time to focus on them. Apart from that, the money I've been saving is starting to dwindle. And without my BA I can't get a ""real"" job... I still don't want to tell my parents... And it's weighing on me everyday! I feel like if I tell them, it will crush them. There's already been a ""problem"" child in our family (my older sister)... The last thing I ever wanted to be was another reason for stressing them out. They already have enough on their plate with my grandmother's struggle with dementia and polio. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm just finding it harder everyday to even be motivated to achieve **anything**, when I've clearly already fucked it up. I can't recover from my poor grades or pay my parents back. Not to mention the insurmountable amount of debt I already have (in the $80k region I believe). I just want to move on in my life... Get my own place, find a job I can tolerate, and meet the woman of my dreams (sappy I know). I've had four encounters with women since my last girlfriend. And with each failure, I feel worse and worse about myself. I used to be pretty fit, however, in my opinion I'm starting to let myself go because I don't believe anyone could love me. The first girl I encountered after my girlfriend dumped me... Shut me down... I asked her out because I thought there was a strong connection. She told me, ""I have a boyfriend."" Which to my knowledge this day... She does not have one. The second girl I encountered, was the polar opposite of anything I've ever been attracted to... I thought I would finally be finished searching. She was as corny as me and enjoyed joking around etc etc... She even said she was attracted to me and we hung out a lot.... But then something changed and she didn't see me that way anymore. That relationship tanked out and I haven't talked to her in 5 months. Another relationship was with a girl I worked with during my summer internship at a school. We really hit it off, constantly flirting with each other etc... Then my best friend's sister was like... I think she's a bitch, please don't go out with her. Naturally, I trust her word... And unfortunately it changed the way I perceived her. Needless to say, when we went on a date... It just didn't work... She turned out to not be what I wanted in a partner... And that makes me sad because I'm wondering if maybe my standards were too high(?) I feel as though I want the ""end game"" happiness, yet I constantly get in my own way. Lastly, I started to get desperate because since I started living with my parents... I haven't really met anyone my age let alone of the female persuasion. So I tried an online dating site my friend suggested (Coffee Meets Bagel). Blah blah, I ended up meeting this girl... She was perfect. Funny, pretty, entertaining, adventurous, and liked beer. It was going great we went on three dates, but I think I scared her away. Earlier on we texted a decent amount, she was interested in me etc... On the second date, I asked her as we were leaving if they were ""indeed"" dates -- To which she said yes. Now I can't help but think I should have kissed her that night... But I didn't because I was unfortunately a bit too inebriated to think clearly... She then texted me later on, that she wasn't really in a place to be in a relationship etc... And just wanted to take it slow. I said that's fine and still invited her out to another date. We did that date and everything went well... But I haven't seen her for two weeks since and she hasn't texted since last week. I thought if I didn't text her that maybe she would show me ""some"" interest. She hasn't and I can't help but thinking that I made so many wrong calls and fucked myself again... 

&amp;nbsp;

In summary, my financial life is a wreck. I'm trapped in a purgatory like situation where I'm constantly playing babysitter to my handicapped Grandma and living like a teenager with my parents again. I don't believe in God anymore and the only thing I feel bad about is the fact that my Mom prays for me every night and cries when I tell her I don't believe. I'm stressed out by the burden of the secrets I have to keep from them. No women seem to want to pursue any relationship whatsoever with me and I feel like a total loser. The only thing I have going for me right now is a video game tournament I entered with some friends. We're ranked #2 right now and have a good shot at winning the championship. Unfortunately, this makes me more depressed because I realize it really ""IS"" the only thing I have going for me. I know people say things will get better, but from my experience even if they do get better... It's just preparing you to fall harder. And I can't get the girl I met online out of my head... I honestly have a life full of regrets... This is constantly depressing me and I don't know what to do! Thanks to anyone that takes the time out of their lives to read this miserable rant. There are a lot more details etc (you can ask me about)... But I tried to condense this as best I could, since I just have this ""physical"" pressure on my heart and shoulders... This has helped just to write about it. I also apologize for the terrible formatting. I'm not used to making entries this long. "
3d0619,3,2015-07-12,"I [20M] don't like my girlfriend[19F] of almost four months romantically anymore, but I can't find it in me to break up with her.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d0619/i_20m_dont_like_my_girlfriend19f_of_almost_four/,"This is my first post to /r/relationships and it's probably going to end up longer than I'd like, so I'll apologize now for that, but I also want to start at the beginning. 

I met this girl at a pregame when a friend of mine was visiting our school (October 2014), and we hit it off as friends. We stayed friends for a while, and ended up drunkenly making out at a couple parties, the first of which she didn't remember, the second and third she did. Each time we both kind of shoved it aside as we were drunk and such. 

Eventually, I start to have a bit of a crush on her, but I'm not sure if it's because I want to date her or because we've made out and I want to date someone. In earnest, I had very little in my life that was really stable, and I knew a relationship would help in that regard. After talking with a close friend, I decided to ask her out, and she said yes. 

The relationship started out really fast. We both wanted to try to take it slow, but it just didn't happen. Maybe two or three weeks in and I accidentally, offhandedly said that I loved her. Not an ""I love you"" but in a way that I'd say I love my friends. She took it the other way, and at first I was fine with that, but grew uncomfortable with that whole situation, and told her the truth about it. She was totally fine with it, but the whole thing happened. 

Fast forward about a month and I start to have my first doubts. It's pretty clear to me that she cares about me a lot more than I care about her, and that makes me uncomfortable, but after talking with a friend, he calms he down saying that it's likely to settle down and even out in the future. 

Although we go to the same school (5 hours from home) and are from about 45 minutes away from each other, I got an internship that pulled me across the country for the summer. Before I left I had to get my tonsils out, and she would come over to my house to hang out with me during my recovery. Towards the end of my two week recovery, I told her I loved her while on Oxycodone. That said, I really felt that I meant it then. 

Fast forward to these past couple weeks. She still cares about me way more than I care about her. In fact, I'm pretty sure I only care about her as a friend. I love her in the way I love my friends, but there's nothing special to it. When we had sex back home, it never felt like more than just sex to me, and she would say it did to her. 

I'm in a situation where I don't want to hurt her, because I do care about her a lot, but I don't think I want to date her. I'm also in a situation because I have flights booked to surprise her in two weeks that I've been coordinating with one of her Sorority sisters. 

Emotionally I don't think I can't stay in this relationship. It's too hard for me to see her love me and miss me so much, when I don't miss her or love her any more than my best friends. I also don't think I can handle breaking her heart when she has no idea this is how I feel. This surprise visit in two weeks is also frustrating, because it's been planned for a month without her knowing anything, and if I go, it'll show her a falsehood about how much I love her, making it even harder to break up with her. 

I could just not take the trip back, and tell my friend who is coordinating the whole thing about this, but she's very close with both of us, and it'd be a lot for her to handle. 

In addition, I've shown no signs of not liking her anymore. I've always been the listener in the relationship, so it's been easy for me to just sit back and listen to her talk about her day/week etc. In fact, I've probably given off the opposite signals I'd like from drunk calls where I'll say I love you way too many times. We've never had any major fights, and barely any minor ones. 

**tl;dr**: I don't love my girlfriend any more than I do my close friends, and I want to break up with her, but she's also been a close friend all year, and I don't want her to be sad on my behalf. How can I manage this kind of a situation?"

Long story short I believe some of the infrastructure the company I work for has been left in default configuration and is therefore using droptail as it's method of [active queue management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_queue_management), which isn't the most efficient. However in order to get this fixed I need to provide proof of this to my boss.

I'm an intern and have only been here for a few weeks now so my knowledge about everything is likely very limited compared to a lot of the people here, sorry if there is an obvious solution to this that I can't find.

I have access to a (slightly out of date) version of IxChariot and endpoints that will communicate via this device that I can install other software on as well if needed.

What's the best way to prove this is using droptail? Or if it isn't to try and find out what method of queue management it is using instead?

Thanks in advance for any help you guys can give me :)"

3d0ffp,9,2015-07-12,Pet friendly ground floor duplex rentals?,Izabeau,Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hamilton/comments/3d0ffp/pet_friendly_ground_floor_duplex_rentals/,"OK, so in the summer if I end up getting kept in my current summer internship (which I probably will but the looks of it) my pay will be increased a good amount and therefore I'm gonna feel pretty comfortable moving out and paying for rent. 

Problem is I promised myself where ever I go, my 8 year old shepherd/husky mix goes with me too. So ideally for a dog with that much energy (even at that age, apparently that's considered ""senior"" for dogs) I want at least access to a decent fenced backyard(doesn't have to be big big). So I figured a ground floor duplex would be ideal, rather than a high rise apartment or something else with no backyard. 

How are my chances of finding that? I mean in two of my childhood homes my family lived in a ground floor duplex with access to pretty nice backyards for our pets to run around. This would have been well over 10 years ago, so I don't know how much things have chanced when it comes to getting lucky like we were. 

I'd figure though it'd be more pricier than a high floor duplex, right? With that new pay and getting it split with one or two friends that have expressed interest in moving in with me I'd say anywhere from 700 to 1200 for rent would be doable for me and the other person(s)?

Again I would just like an idea of how doable this would be and if anyone with pets has had luck in this? If there are other affordable housing options I could choose instead that'd work better for my situation, I would appreciate that too!"

The lyrics of the Momma's and the Papa's bounce inside my head, remnants of my car ride entertainment still lingering from the morning commute. I stare at the glass entrance to our office, my hand hesitating on the door handle. The two week vacation had been nice. *Really nice,* my brain corrects as I will myself to walk inside. *I could just turn around, walk back to my car. Text the wife, tell her we're going back, forget this hum drum work life I lead.* Images of my Sarah, sunning herself on the pool deck, flashes of smiles and wet hair and naked skin in a tropical paradise flit past my closed eyes. *She'd go along with it, right?*  I shake my head as the computer comes to life, welcoming me back to my dull existence with a whir and a beep.

*""Every other day, every other day Every other day of the week is fine, yeah.""*

I gaze across the office, the familiar smell of ink and toner cartridge mingling with aroma of fresh coffee. I sigh, not catching the difference, the newness. *Same old office*. At 34, I'd been doing this job for 10 years. I do it well. It pays handsomely. And I am so bored with it. I look around desperately, searching for something fresh, something to excite me again. Nothing. So I settle in behind my desk, still not realizing the answer wafts right under my nose.

*""Oh, Monday morning, you gave me no warning of what was to be.""*

""Hey Zach."" I glance up at my coworker Chris as he leans over our common cubicle wall. His large, round face splits into a conspiratorial grin. ""How was the trip?""

""Awesome,"" I say with a sigh, silently wishing the younger man away, still clinging to the last vestiges of my escape from this monotonous existence. ""Its kind of hard to be ba-""
He cuts me off. 

""Yeah yeah, blah blah blah."" He leans farther into my work space. ""None of that is important."" I shoot him a glare, which sails right over his head. Ass. ""The real question is, have you seen the intern yet."" He winks piggishly. I grimace at his face. The rich smell of fresh beans tickles my senses again. It hits me. *That's whats different!*  My coworker's eyes widen and he hisses, ""Here she comes.""

-----------

I'm looking for the intern I can't resist, the spark of excitement I can't stay away from.  I want to be a good husband.  *Damnit*, I am a good husband.  Wrack me with guilt as you take me by the hand and lead me into dalliance.

I am a huge switch.  Expect me to try and stick to my vows, to struggle to listen to the small voice of my conscience as it begs me to pull the brake.  This can be a light-hearted office fling or a sinister seduction as you relish in the destruction of my marriage.  Both work for me.  Just know that while I will do my best to be the good man my wife thinks I am, once you tip me over that brink I'll happily take the lead, take you in every way you desire.

Looking forward to your orange envelope!"
3d0q3y,30,2015-07-12,"Brief observations from my first time in China, living in a dorm with 3 mainlanders",heptagrammaton,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/3d0q3y/brief_observations_from_my_first_time_in_china/,"Background: I'm Chinese-American, living in Shenzhen for an internship in bioinformatics.

Yes, I am the guy who made a fuckton of threads about how my relatives are convinced that I'll be mugged and killed the moment I cross the border from HK into Luohu.

**PROS:**

- The public transportation system is really fucking good. The bus between Yantian and Luohu seems to arrive every five minutes or less, and even at peak hours the trip takes precisely 55 +/- 1 minutes. There are lots of people, but standing isn't that bad and the throughput is such that it doesn't get crowded and you can eventually get a seat if you have a long ride. The metro, in both HK and Shenzhen, is amazing. In contrast, the buses I take in Seattle are smelly, constantly late, slow, crowded, and just sort of shitty in general.

- Bus etiquette is actually better than in Seattle. Illustrative example: In Shenzhen, if I have the aisle seat and someone wants to sit next to me, I'll move my legs to let them squeeze past me into the window seat. In Seattle, it's basically expected that you slide over to give them the aisle seat. I took that seat and not the window seat for a reason, motherfucker, why do you think I should give it up so easily to someone who got on after me?

- People are really friendly and helpful if you take the time to get to know them. If you don't, they're at worst just impersonal.

- The density means that a cold bottle of iced tea for 3-5 kuai is just a short walk away from almost anywhere.

- People are a lot less smelly on the bus. Also, for some reason the cigarette smell is a lot less disgusting than it is in the US even though the number of smokers I encounter is way higher.

- My privileged American dollars, when converted into RMB, go quite a long way here.

- People-watching is great, and I like how all the girls wear skirts and sundresses. Really like it.

- China and HK feel very ""alive"" compared to America. I don't want to romanticize this place too much, but it's definitely got a certain sort of ""bustling"" feel to it that makes Seattle seem like a sleepy village in comparison (which, in comparison to Chinese cities, is, I suppose, actually true).

- Shenzhen feels much, much safer than Seattle. Yes, it's a little dirtier and not as ""modern"", but it feels much more ""livable"" at the same time.

**CONS:**

- My material standard of living is lower, because I'm living in company-provided dormitory accommodation. I have to do stuff like hand-washing my clothes that I've never done before, and my privacy is definitely very limited (how do people (by which I really mean my roommates) even masturbate? in the tiny shower that has shared floor space with the squat toilet? wtf?). However, this does add to the novelty and, honestly, I spend most of my time outside of my dorm room anyway; I barely notice or mind. Yes, the mattress is hard and there are bugs; if you aren't a fussy princess you'll get used to it in a day or two.

- It's hot and humid at this time of the year. It sucks for like 10 minutes when I step outside and then I get used to it. Keeping a handheld fan around helps, as does an umbrella and lots of water.

- People speak in the obviously vastly inferior dialect of Mandarin when in fact Cantonese should clearly be the lingua franca of all of China.

- Laduzi my first two days here. The presence of a very clean Western-style toilet about a minute's walk away from my office definitely helped. I also downed half a bottle of Seirogan but I don't know if that helped at all.

- The two major brands of bottled milk tea that I've noticed are way too sweet. They need to put in like 20% of the current amount of sugar. Also I drank a small canister of soybean milk that had a produced-on date of like three months ago which seems unsafe but I didn't notice any negative effects so whatever.

- My Internet connection is super slow and I need to upload my pictures to Facebook like 5+ times before they don't give some inexplicable error. It took me an entire afternoon to download Hearthstone and I'm not going to even bother watching any anime.

**MISC:**

- Holy shit, the people I live with play fucking League of Legends whenever they're not outside doing goodness-knows-what.

- Chinese bureaucracy is a beast to navigate if you don't have someone ""in the know"" who can help you out.

- Crossing the street is rather exciting when it's one of those really long crosswalks. Dodging bicycles is fun.

- The work I'm doing is cool and I'm learning a lot, but I hesitate to say too much about it in a public setting."

Indiewire spoke with filmmakers Dave LaMattina and Chad Walker as well as Big Bird himself, Caroll Spinney, on the eve of the film s showing at LAFF. CS: Well Deb, my wife, is a really fabulous archivist. Dave LaMattina: In 2005, I interned at Sesame Workshop. She searched and came up with tons of things and they drove away with about three carloads of films. It was a daycare center for slightly older kids. I Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story is a feature length documentary about, the original behind and on. Because it s kind of a city scene. Contents Official description I AM BIG BIRD is a feature length documentary about Caroll Spinney, who has been Sesame Streets and since and at 80 years old, he has no intention of stopping. It must have been a godsend for you guys as documentary filmmakers, that Caroll and Deb had such an extensive library of home videos. I was telling a friend about the internship and she said Oh, I m related to Caroll Spinney and I said, Oh that s great. CW: That kind of came out of necessity. Distribution rights and will release the film theatrically on May 6th 2015 and through video on demand services on May 5th. Do you remember where you got that idea? So Chad, myself and our partner Clay Frost who is the executive producer, started talking about this as an idea for a documentary and in 2009 we approached Sesame Workshop. The documentary is produced by Copper Pot Pictures, with founders Dave LaMattina, Chad Walker and Clay Frost as the filmmakers. I AM BIG BIRD will peel away the instances in his life that inspired his creation of characters that have influenced generations of children. Caroll would have these amazing stories but there just wasn t any footage of it. Premiere was held at the Montclair Film Festival in New Jersey on May 3, 2014. When his first marriage to a woman embarrassedby hiscareer ended in divorce, Spinney foundDebra, the love of his life, who meticulously documented practically every moment of their marriage and life together. I was in the home video department and I had no idea who Caroll Spinney was. Caroll Spinney has been playing Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street for 45 years when, after making a humble start as a traveling puppeteer, he was invited by Jim Henson to come to New York to work on Sesame Street. Years ago, Spinneyhandpicked his ownsuccessor, an understudy who has since waited, quite literally, in the wingsfor almost 20 years. Elmo was introduced, and the writers began to explore different characters. There are also a few animated sequences in the film. And it was all those little animations and all those little cartoons. I am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney story premiered at Hot Docs this year and screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival this weekend. CS: Well a script came along where Big Bird wondered why all these children were going into a building, and he peeked in the door and they were all having fun. That was really the inspiration for the style of the animation, and then also it always seemed like there were numbers and letters flying out of people s mouths to help you learn so that s where the idea for text came from. Caroll, did it take you a lot of digging to find them? Years ago, Big Bird s popularity began to wane when stiff competition from other children s programming forced Sesame Street to shift its focus to a younger audience. The fact that Caroll participated in the rewards and was involved gave us some unique stuff. And, as the yellow feathers give way to grey hair, it is the man, not the Muppet, who will steal your heart. We re really big fans of Kickstarter here at Indiewire. You might know that turned down an offer to play Big Bird, but you probably dont know that until a last minute change of heart by, Big Bird was supposed to go to space aboard The Challenger. Then you had six hours of driving through New Zealand just with the camera sticking out the window that you would go through. So we were able to tap into this amazing audience of people who, like ourselves, grew up on Sesame Street and who wanted to see this movie get made. And Dave and Chad, how did you guys go about digging through and finding what you wanted and needed? Moving on to Sesame Street it s revealed in the film that Big Bird started out as a country yokel and you had the idea to transform him into a big kid. But even on those tapes you find little gems, like Caroll running and falling down the hill and Deb laughing at him and stuff like that. Chad Walker: We were able to hit our goal, which was 100,000, and we actually even surpassed it and made 124,000. In October, it was announced that had acquired the U.S. Directed and Produced by: Dave LaMattina Silver Spring, MD June 21, 22, 2014 Melbourne International Film Festival Melbourne, Australia August 16, 17, 2014 The Screening Room Newburyport, MA September 21, 2014 Brooklyn, NYC October 25, 2014 See also by Caroll Spinney. The film has a ton of your home videos, Caroll. Like Caroll said, there were just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours of stuff to go through. His time inside the Bird has taught him about the world and about himself. Filmmakers Dave LaMattina, Chad Walker and Clay Frost with Oscar the Grouch. So Big Bird wanted to go in but Jim Henson had this idea, he always had wanted to make a silly goofy bird. He has been a constant presence in our lives for over 40 years, his path weaving through American history like that of. So we started thinking about what an interesting way would be to tell the story without anything to cover it and we thought, what s really big in terms of Sesame Street? We had talked about Kickstarter almost as early as when we had pitched Caroll. "

Unfortunately, before the train reaches Zurich, he has died, hiking the countryside near his chalet in the region of the Swiss village Sils Maria. The camera and cutting follow an organic and prophetic rhythm, at once condensing and announcing the film s themes and metaphorical fixations. To prevent this, we ve introduced a human ness test. This is a film about repression, about learning to treat desire with miserliness if one is to go on as if unwounded. More than a film about the malice of language, Clouds of Sils Maria is, curiously, the capturing of this mesmerizing spark spawned by Binoche and Stewart s unlikely non encounter, which escapes language proper, but fits rather handsomely inside a cinematic flask. Name: Email: Your email address will not appear on the site. Director s Olivier Assayas Screenwriter s Olivier Assayas Cast: Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, Chloë Grace Moretz, Lars Eidinger Distributor: IFC Films Runtime: 124 min Rating: NR Year: 2014 Binoche classily refusing to slay Stewart, and Stewart respectfully accepting her smallness before the French star. She s headed to an event in Switzerland, where she s to accept an award for the playwright responsible for her first big break. Review: In Clouds of Sils Maria, Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart bring it with gusto ArtsATL. In that play, Maloja Snake, she portrayed a teenage intern named Sigrid who seduced, abandoned and devastated her 40 something boss, Helena. Maria is the lead character in Clouds of Sils Maria, but Valentine is the more interesting one. It s a good thing Valentine is around to make her coffee, run lines, and disagree with her lofty interpretations of art and life, keeping her on her toes. Ce film n est pas disponible pour le moment sur MUBI mais 30 autres merveilles le sont. There s something treacherous about this train, a sense that the sturdy tracks on which it travels conceal its true aim: chaos. Olivier Assayas opens Clouds of Sils Maria with nothing short of a master class on how to shoot a scene inside a moving train. The story from then on follows the misleading simplicity of a Bergman script, and relies on the capacity for nuance of the actors faces just as much. When Kristen Stewart exits a Zurich train station and finds no paparazzi lurking outside, you know she relished delivering the line, The cockroaches mustve taken a later train. In the über flattering portrait of Stewart that Assayas penned for French Vogue, he compares his encounter with the Hollywood actress to Binoche and Kiarostami s in, and Maggie Cheung and himself in the exquisite : the kind of unlikeliness that creates, if not magic, a rather photogenic kind of spell. A Hollywood starlet named Jo Ann Chloë Grace Moretz as famous for starring in slick, brain dead sci fi flicks as for grainy TMZ fo. She has no clue who he is, but Valentine tells her hes a real up and coming talent. We meet Valentine in a train zipping through the Alps, en route to a Zurich film festival where Binoches Maria will accept a lifetime award on behalf of the reclusive playwright director Wilhelm, whose play turned Maria into a star at age 18. There are strong echoes of All About Eve in this complex, compelling drama from Olivier Assayas starring a luminous Juliette Binoche as a performer confronted by the inevitable passage of time. GFT is registered as a charity No SC005932 with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator. Binoche and Stewart s co inhabitance on the screen works so well because it s a non encounter: Binoche classily refusing to slay Stewart, and Stewart respectfully accepting her smallness before the French star. Enders and Valentine s personal relationship, treading the porous line between professional distance and erotic curiosity, mirrors the characters in the play in both discrete and obvious ways. Or perhaps Stewart had the ability to match Binoche. Stewart s acting strength lies in the way that she doesn t try to mimic Binoche s complexity, instead remaining resolutely an American, from the vulgarity of her tattoos to the putative plainness of her insights regarding the play. And you wonder, can things continue to go smoothly for them? Valentine sometimes seems like a kid sister or best friend someone who doesnt just maintain Marias calendar but can call her out when the actress is, well, acting out. This train is actually alive, a psychosomatic bomb of anxiety and turmoil were it an airplane, the turbulences would be incessant leading up to the deceiving stillness of the Swiss Alps, where we learn a seasonal gathering of clouds the Maloja snake effect has foretelling powers. Yet this isn t like Abbas Kiarostami s, where not knowing what belongs to the fiction of the fiction was the core concept of the film and its principal source of pleasure. Stewart is surprisingly self assured as both a punching bag and launching pad for Binoche s tour de force. The younger role, her role, is to be played by rising star Jo Ann  Chloë Grace Moretz. Their characters relationship is central to Clouds, as Maria agrees to act onstage again in the work that made her famous. Who better to embody such strategy than the awkward Stewart, whose movie star reluctance is a pose so consistent it s as though her shoulders lean perpetually forward. Twenty years after she made her name in an acclaimed stage play, world renowned Maria Binoche is approached to play the older woman in a revival. Acceptera t elle dêtre à son tour la victime? Director: Olivier Assayas Cast: Juliette Binoche, Chloë Grace Moretz, Kristen Stewart Year: 2014 Running Time: 2h 4m Country: France/Switzerland/Germany Language: English/French/Germany/Swiss German with subtitles. SC097369 with its registered office at 12 Rose Street, Glasgow, G3 6RB. Only, now, Maria agrees to play Helena, a role she detested a quarter century ago for being an emotional weakling. Glasgow Film is an operating name of Glasgow Film Theatre GFT. Comment: Sorry folks, We ve had a problem with spam. When the two run lines with each other as they hike through the Alps, it can be deliciously impossible to know if they re lines from the play within the film or from the film itself, as they re both so viscerally invested in their delivery. Vingt ans après avoir connu le succès en interprétant Sigrid, la toute jeune fille qui fascine et conduit au suicide Helena, une femme mûre, Maria Enders, au sommet de sa carrière, est confrontée à cette même pièce, mais de lautre côté de la barrière. You make it sound like Binoche did Stewart a favor by not acting to her full power. The friction between Binoche s gravitas and Stewart s unintimidated response to it make for a fascinatingly quiet drama. Assayas s train neither derails nor performs the sterile background function of Lars von Trier s in the horny teen preys on married man scene from. Phone glued to her ear, dealing with film publicists, media outlets and lawyers on her clients behalf, her Val is factotum to Juliette Binoches famed actress Maria Enders.

3d0uua,4,2015-07-12,"My mother [58F] told me [22M] she ""loves me, but doesn't like me."" She said I don't respect her. She's right; I don't.",UncleSlayton,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d0uua/my_mother_58f_told_me_22m_she_loves_me_but_doesnt/,"I'm not really sure what I'm looking for with this post, but at the very least I really need to vent.

A little backstory: several years ago, my parents finally ended things, an outcome I saw coming from miles away. Since then, my father has remarried and become noticeably happier and calmer; my mother has a long term BF and has become noticeably more bitter and resentful towards my father. She claims she has been an enabler to my father throughout their marriage, and allowed him to disrespect her, and she won't stand for it any more. She says she's with her current BF because he respects her for who she is. Her boyfriend is a fat PE teacher who has little personality and will generally go along with whatever she wants, so I can see why she'd view it that way.

But she claims that, like my father, I don't respect her. And she's correct.

I strongly believe that respect is earned, not automatically doled out to everyone I come across. Prove to me you are deserving of respect, and I will respect the fuck out of you. I respect my father for his intellectual ability, work ethic, and willingness to have rational discussions about various topics instead of remaining uselessly stubborn on a single viewpoint. I respect my brother for having excellent foresight, starting two businesses, and being promoted from intern to management at a third, all before he was 18. 

But my mother. 

My mother is not capable of rational thought, and always acts purely out of emotion, which drives me nuts. When I try to steer her towards reason by making logical arguments, she breaks down, tells me to stop making her feel like an idiot, and adds a tally to her mental ""times he disrespects me"" list. She refuses to learn to do simple tasks, such as listing an item on Craigslist, having already decided she's ""not good at computers."" She wanted an exercise machine to get in shape, so I tracked down a free one and got it all set up and adjusted for her. I'm at her house at most once a week, and I've still used it way more than she has. She reads plenty of ""fat acceptance"" books, so this isn't too surprising. She treats my aforementioned high-achieving brother like a baby, and wonders why he never comes out of his room or stops texting his friends. She has decided to buy out my father to keep the $650k, 4br, very nice but inconveniently located house they've had since '89 despite the fact it's now way too much house for her since next year she'll be an empty nester because ""all the other smaller houses cost just as much!"" (yeah, right). Then she worries how she'll ever afford to buy him out while blowing money left and right on eating out, new furniture and decor, even insisting on keeping the thermostat at 68 in the summer. She makes my head explode.

If she's not giving me a reason to respect her, I can't.

This all came to a head yesterday when she told me she loves me, but doesn't like me. I'm still not sure what to make of that. We are clearly very different people, so it's no surprise we don't get along as she'd like. But what am I supposed to do with this knowledge? Am I supposed to somehow accept her for all her ridiculousness in the hopes of having her change her mind about me, or should I accept this is how she feels about me and carry on with my own life?

Oh, and the ironic part? My mother is a therapist.

**tl;dr**: My mother, who I do not feel is deserving of my respect, feels I don't respect her. As a result, she loves me, but doesn't like me. Should I find a way to respect her even if I don't, or should I simply accept this as the way it is?

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not judging my mother for her weight. I really don't care. But I'm not going to respect her for wanting to lose weight, then deciding accepting it is easier. That's the only reason I brought weight into the OP. I regret doing that now, but I'll leave it."

How do I get back with her?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d0zzc/my_long_distance_exgf_20_f_of_3_years_broke_up/,"We met in high school and dated for 3 years up until our second year of college. Everything was fine with her up until we left for school.


During our 2 years in college, we were a long distance relationship. She goes to a Canadian school and I go to an american school about 9 hours drive away. We texted and called daily, skyped weekly. However, I did not seem to put much effort into our relationship because I always assumed things would be fine after college. For example, I took awhile to respond to texts and I was unenthusiastic during skype and phone calls.


She was constantly worried about me meeting other people and not spending enough time with her during our summer break. I assured her that I would not cheat on her and I really meant it.

When summer came along, I wanted to do something career-oriented (internship, volunteer, etc). She wanted to spend the summer with me. I told her I was able to do so, but I am unsure how long it could be since I have work during the summer. I promised at least two weeks together during the summer.


She broke up with me early summer because said she didn't want to hold me back from my career goals. I respected her decision, but it was really heartbreaking because I have always thought about her and our future together even when I didn't show it.


I met up with her in canada (family trip) about a month after our breakup. I told her I still liked her a lot and I apologized my lack of effort and immaturity. She told me she is not looking/ready for a relationship at the moment and that we should be friends. She told me not to dwell on the past and keep moving forward, which to I agreed to.


We text daily and I avoid bringing up the past. I want to keep our conversations positive with the goal of eventually starting a new relationship with her. I still very much like her and this isn't because of the fact she left me or from loneliness. 

I want to keep an open line of communication, but do not want to be just friends. How do I suggest the idea of starting a new relationship without scaring her off, especially since it will be long distance?

3d16px,2,2015-07-12,I [21F] have a crush on someone [21M] who is not my boyfriend [21M]. Help me sort things out?,internthrowaway5,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d16px/i_21f_have_a_crush_on_someone_21m_who_is_not_my/,"TLDR: In a temporary rut with my boyfriend of 1.5 years. Recently I've reconnected with another guy who I hadn't talked to in a long time. He has a girlfriend but (unknowingly?) flirts with me, and I can't help but wonder ""what if"" I had dated him instead.


Hi /r/relationships, I'm hoping to get some unbiased help here regarding a sticky situation I'm currently in.

I've been dating my boyfriend Jeremy for a year and a half now. We've had our ups and downs, but I think we're very compatible in terms of personality, values, and intelligence. I fell in love with him because he thinks differently than the norm, similar to the way I do. He takes me to exciting places all over the city and we're constantly trying new things. 

However, Jeremy tends to get into personal ruts where it seems like he has symptoms of depression (for lack of a better word- I don't think he actually has it). This happens once or twice a year for him for weeks at a time. So far I've noticed it 1) over the winter when the weather is really gloomy or 2) when he doesn't have a clear purpose, like right now, since he is out of school for the summer without an internship and is bored.

During these times, Jeremy stops being a great boyfriend. Not that he's bad, but he's not the same person that I love being around. He stops wanting to leave his apartment or try new things, and he sleeps 12 hours a day. I try to be supportive but I can only last so long before getting frustrated. This has caused relationship issues for us in the past.

Now, enter Edward. I've known Edward for about the same amount of time I've known Jeremy, almost 2 years. Edward and I used to be great friends and have always had a lot of chemistry. Before I started dating Jeremy, Edward had long been another prospect on my mind. I got an idea from him though that, even if he was interested in me, he wasn't interested in a relationship at that exact time. So I moved on, started dating Jeremy, and we pretty much stopped contact.

Through circumstances out of our control, Edward and I have recently been forced to spend a lot of time together, and we've became good friends again. He's been dating someone for apparently a few months, and I am happy for him.

BUT he keeps subtly flirting with me. And I don't know if he's just feeling socially awkward because we lost contact for so long and he's just mimicking how our friendship used to be OR if he's actually still interested in me.

Jeremy is in a rut right now, and he has been for weeks. I am not physically attracted to him when he gets like this.

As a preface, I'm the kind of person who will always wonder ""What if?"" even if the situation I have right now is actually great and I'm unable to recognize it. But I've been wondering ""What if?"" for a while now, basically since Edward and I have become friends again, and it greatly worries me that I've been thinking about Edward more than Jeremy lately. My thoughts include:

-Am I just physically attracted to Edward or is it also something else (Everyone I know acknowledges Edward's attractiveness as being unreal)? Is that normal? Is that okay?

-Am I unsatisfied in my current relationship? Are these ruts that Jeremy gets into too much for me to handle long term?

-I've been thinking about Edward A LOT lately. Is that because I'm interested with him or because I'm temporarily unsatisfied with Jeremy?

-Is Edward even interested in me? He has a girlfriend. Why is he flirting with me? Is he unhappy with his situation and wonders about our potential as a couple as well?

-Do I talk to either of them about this? If not now, how long should I let it go on before I do?


Thanks in advance for your help.

3d170j,3,2015-07-12,Disagreement with me [22 M] and my parents [mid 50s],SnorMunch,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d170j/disagreement_with_me_22_m_and_my_parents_mid_50s/,"I [22M] am an engineering student on a 16 month internship with 1 year left in my degree. I chose a company close to my parent's home because I wanted to save money. I spoke with them about getting a position further away from home and renting an apartment, but they insisted that I get a position near my family home in order to save money due to large rent costs. When I moved back in, I did not agree to pay anything and they did not ask. My father purchased a car for me to commute to work, but the car is under his name. I was going to pay for it myself as I had more than enough money saved up, but he offered to pay for it. I promised to pay for all maintenance for the vehicle, which I have been doing. Since my first year of high school, I have been working part time in order to save money. I was on government loans, but last year, I was not eligible for the loans. I decided to pay for my rent and tuition out of my own hard earned savings. Previously, my father had paid for either my rent OR my tuition. I used the loan to pay for the other. I have 2 sisters, one of which is in university and my parents pay everything for her; rent and tuition. She has never worked before. My finances are not great as I have a lot of debt but I do have a substantial amount of money invested. I must mention that my nationality and background is Hong Kong Chinese. My family would be considered the lower end of middle class.


A month after I started my internship, my parents began to ask me for money; about 20% of my income (they did not say this exactly but the amount was equivalent to 20% of my monthly income). I told them that was ridiculous as this generation, the millennials, will have a much harder life due to a rapid increase in the housing market, a decrease in jobs because of later retirement, contract employment, difficulty in building a career, and low increase in wages. Because of this I need to save my money and invest wisely in order to save enough money to be able to afford a house and retire at an appropriate age. 


Here are some of their arguments:
They argued that **since I have been home I give them much more work.** I asked them what and my mom named off a bunch of things like cleaning, cooking, washing clothes. She seems to think that it is her responsibility to do this and refuses to let me do any of my own  of the household chores but yet holds it against me. 

**Any money I give you we will give back to you just as much. We aren't greedy for your money, but we don't need it.** I partly agree with this, but I do not think they are being fair between me and my sisters. I paid my own rent and tuition and this should more than pay the monthly payment that I owe. They also do not think that as a family we should be counting all of the money so closely like an accountant. I disagree because I spent $16k last year WITHOUT GOV'T FINANCIAL AID (long story) while my sister had all the payments paid for by my parents.   

**If you don't give money how are we going to expect money from your sisters.**  Just what??

**You should give us money because of love.** Money is not about love.

**If you give us money we will be happy since it means you care about us.**

**We used to give 50% of our income to our parents back in the day.** It is a completely different generation, a different country, and a different culture.

**You are too selfish.**  My parents ask me to run errands, such as getting milk several times a week from the grocery store. I also do the dishes and mow the lawn, as well as driving my sister places, etc.

**You have changed so much. I thought I would be happy that you are back.** People will change when they have been living at home for their entire life and then go out to live with other people their same age for 4 years. I have developed my own thinking and have realized my parents' flaws, such as being emotionally manipulative to their own kids.

As of now they have since lowered their request to some spending money for my mother, who is a full time stay at home mom and has not worked in more than 25 years. I still do not think I should pay as they continue to emotionally manipulate me into paying. Whenever I rebuttal their arguments, they choose not to listen and just walk away instead.

I am grateful to my parents for letting me stay at home during my internship but I only agreed to this because they offered, with no strings attached initially.  My sisters do not work and do not do well in school, yet my parents wholeheartedly support them and have no problem paying for all their expenses and more. I do not want to give in them because I believe that their rationalizations are unfair and I want to keep saving for my future. Am I justified in my decision? Has anyone else experienced anything similar with their own families and can offer me some insight? 

My girlfriend's parents are also Hong Kong Chinese but her parents are very westernized. She asked her parents the same thing and they said that they would never ask her for money because they understand how hard it will be in the future and they want her to save money for a home in the future. Why are my parents not this logical?

Thanks in advance for any replies and for reading this post.

**tl;dr**: Student moving home for a year for internship , Asian parents requesting large amount of money that was previously not agreed to and using very illogical arguments to try and get me to pay them. Any advice or people in similar situations out there?"

My boyfriend and I (both 20 years old) just released our first game named Survive OS on iOS and Android. A year ago, while completing a degree in computer science, we decided that we wanted to make games for a living. Therefore, we thought we could create our own video game studio and do what we dream of for a living! 

So, while in our internship, we created a game studio named OS Games where ""os"" is derived from ""us"", because we believe that gamers' voice is really important in the games we make. I remember Nintendo turning their backs on an amazing idea I had for them... 

However, we need your feedback to know if we're on the right track or not as game developers. Therefore, please give us any constructive criticism on any of our work (Survive OS, our website, Youtube channel, logo, etc). We did most of the work by ourselves.

I will personally be here all day long to discuss with you guys! So don't hesitate to post replies of features you'd like us to add to Survive OS or anything you'd like! I will never thank you enough for lending us a hand!

I was an intern for a municipal PD (~150 sworn) and I had asked to ride with the night shift guys for once. (P.S.: Day shift wants to make me tear my eyeballs out.) It was a Friday night in mid-April. We were on the scene of a supposedly homeless individual that was passed out in the grocery store parking lot. No big deal, we got to him, EMS took over and they said they were pretty sure he was gonna make it. I'm taking my gloves off and were about to clear up when another collapsed individual call comes across. It's only a few blocks away so we roll up. EMS is already on scene and already performing CPR. Not a good sign obviously. We get out and start performing crowd control, I'm listening to the officer take statements to figure out what happened. The 20-something female (~350 pounds) was sprinting across the street when she suddenly collapsed onto the railroad crossing (right on the tracks, really strange). At first we thought ""oh okay she just tripped and knocked herself out"" then I remembered they were performing CPR and that didn't make sense. We had been there for about 10 minutes now and EMS is still going at it. At this point, I pretty much knew. I think the family realized it as well. The husband was getting all distraught and angry, luckily he didn't make our job any harder, he walked away and kept going between yelling and balling. Honestly watching the family react was the hardest thing for me and I had to turn away several times because I was afraid I would start and I really didn't think it would be good for anyone to see a representative of the police department crying on the scene. (Even as an intern, many mistook me for a detective or other type of plainclothes officer.) I think in the end EMS did CPR for 30 minutes before calling it. I thought it was a waste but apparently there are some politics involved where EMS won't load a patient they're pretty sure is going to pass because then the death counts against the hospital (local hospital does EMS for the whole county) but if they pass on scene, it's PD's problem. So they broke the official news to the family and that of course went over as you'd expect. So now we're standing around because someone had to get the Coroner out of bed and they can't run code for some reason. They've covered her with the stereotypical sheet and now we're just all standing around a sheet laying on a railroad crossing. A couple of the other officers are cracking jokes and EMS is as well. I completely understand it but it's still really weird to experience. The officer with me is just busying himself with paperwork, he's an experienced officer but he hasn't crossed the point where he's able to joke about it. I asked him a couple questions like ""What if it rains?"" He shrugs and tells me ""You know, you think like me when it comes to respect for the dead and everything."" Obviously he wasn't saying that the other officers were disrespectful, it was just different for him. Anyway the Coroner arrives and does her thing, (poor woman's heart had blown out, literally exploded) now we wait for a special transport suburban to come get the body. Once they load her up, the scene is cleared. We head to a vacant parking lot, he steps out to smoke, and I'm writing his narrative. I found it pretty easy to write in the way that narratives are written and I remembered all the details. He checks it over and sends it on to his super.

The point of this was to ask a question. While it felt surreal and certainly was not a pleasant experience, I didn't get all broken up over it nor did I I have any nightmares. I actually tried to make myself feel sadness about it but I couldn't, at least now in the way that you see a lot of first time stories go. Yes I will probably always remember it but it wasn't traumatic, you know? Am I cold? I know watching the family got to me but I got over that quickly. I really don't know. I expected myself to be more torn up over it but I was able to go to sleep that night and wake up the next morning and move on with life. I guess that's a good thing? But should it be?


I deeply apologize for the jumbledness of this post. I'm writing this on my phone as well as remembering stuff in the middle of typing. I just wanted to get it all out there and let you guys piece it together."

Gibt es da irgendwelche generellen Vorgaben, oder kann jeder, der mal vor die Kamera springt, prinzipiell sagen was er will? 

Mir sind da in letzter Zeit mehrere negative Momente aufgefallen, die ich ziemlich diskriminierend fand. Zum Beispiel von Schröckert in Moin Moin, der meint, dass ja nur Muselmanen mehrere Frauen haben.
https://youtu.be/bmjSCFJ9Ccw?t=2191 (kommt nach  ca. 1 Minute) 

Auch von Eddie kam letzte Woche in Moin Moin die Aussage, dass man ja jetzt nicht mehr Mohrenkopf sagen darf, das heisst jetzt Negerkuss. 
Den Begriff Neger hat Andy auch schonmal kritiklos in einer Kino+ Sendung verwendet. 

Ich erinnere mich an ein Almost Daily, als Schröckert von Streit mit einem Postboten berichtete und erwähnte, dass dieser Iraner sei. Das scheint sogar Eddy gestört zu haben (der ja nicht gerade dafür bekannt ist, Verfechter von Political Correctnesszu sein), der darauf hin sinngemäß sagte 'Macht das irgend einen Unterschied, ob der Iraner ist?'. 
Zu diesem Bild passt, dass Schröckert in seinem Gamepitch von Bars sogar direkt sagt, dass dort alle gängigen Klischees bedient werden sollen. Es scheint ihm also nicht viel daran zu liegen, ein differenziertes und reflektiertes Weltbild zu verbreiten, eher das Gegenteil. 

Daher finde ich es interessant, ob ihr euch intern Gedanken über eure Außenwirkung macht, euch eurer Vorbildfunktion bewusst seid und wie ihr generell zu diesem Thema steht. Was denkt die Community darüber?"

So I have recently gained a lot of weight due to my terrible dietary habits (i.e. stress over finals, and then stress from my summer internship). It hit me after a while how overweight I became, so this sort of snapped me out of what I was doing and I began dieting and working out again. I also decided to wear comfortable and larger clothing to hide my figure so that I don't feel insecure about it while I am out in public.
Recently, however, I found out that my family wants to go on a vacation to Cancun before my semester opens up. While I am very excited about the trip, I am scared about the prospect of having to wear a bathing suit on the trip. I haven't worn a bathing suit in a long time due to always being borderline overweight, but I certainly do not want to avoid swimming just because of my body image. I know this is a deeper matter of self esteem (something I've been dealing with since a child), but how does one cope with or squash these insecurities temporarily and still enjoy a vacation while wearing a body-fitting outfit?

I am a full time student who works two jobs and an internship, all part time. At this job, I am a hotel desk clerk. I work with other students. One girl has worked here 7 months longer than me, we'll call her Carrie, and she is a de facto manager at this point; she often makes the schedule for the housekeepers and sometimes the desk clerks and she trains us.
  
I waffle between being impressed by her and being annoyed by her. She tends to work 40-50 hr work weeks, often doing doubles on the weekends while she's in school so she can get her hours in, while going to school full time. She is paying off debt and trying to do something in the medical profession, which is admirable. I guess she's run into money trouble right now while school is not in session.
  
I came into work today (after making a budget last night because I'm also running into a lot of money problems) and she asks me in front of a customer (who is a regular, and our age, but still) if she can have thursday since I'm leaving for the weekend anyway. I said I don't know, because I only work two days this week, and she launches into how the other girl who works with us went over her head to our managers, changed the schedule, and ended up taking a day of hers this week, and she HAS to have more hours, because she has literally been eating ramen, not washing her hair and rationing her makeup. At first I said, ""okay, let me think about it, I've been having money troubles too!"" 
  
But then she kept going. Talking about credit card debt, paying minimum payments, she just moved out and into a new house, so security deposits too. And I tried to make light, saying yes, I know, I paid my credit card bill the other night and I have nothing too! But she kept going, and I went in back to stock some food in the fridge, and she kept talking about it with the customer. So I came up front and she said ""don't worry, you don't *have* to give me the shift, I understand.""
  
But of course, that is bullshit.
  
I ended up saying okay, because she must have talked for 20 minutes (like she usually does when she has a problem- she does a lot. Usually having to take care of people in her family, or she has a medical issue, or her boyfriend lost his job or something. The thing is- I don't think these things are lies, I just think...like...I don't want to hear about it after a certain point.)
  
Anyway, my problem is not so much the one day. I have extra hours at my internship this week so I was okay to lose $60- and if she really can't eat, I want her to eat!-  but I felt like, guilted and very uncomfortable. But she makes the schedule sometimes- especially during the school year when I'm trying to schedule around full time school, and she is definitely the top person at this job other than our ""managers"" (a wife and husband who own the hotel itself) and I'm afraid of telling anyone that I felt uncomfortable about it because I don't want to make a stir. But I don't want to be guilted into losing my hours again some week I need it in the future, you know?
  
I get the feeling she can be vindictive based on some things she's said about other coworkers. I keep my head down and try not to get involved, but it's worried me in the past.
  
I always try to cover shifts if someone asks to help them out, the normal give and take of a minimum wage job like this, but...I don't know. Is there any way I can avoid this ever again, tactfully? Can I avoid involving my managers? I want to tell them, but I feel like they'll just tell her or something. I don't know.
  
**TL;DR** : My coworker guilted me into letting her work one of my TWO shifts this coming week, saying she only can eat ramen because of money troubles right now while in front of a customer. I let her, but I want to know how to tactfully avoid it happening again, in case I really need the shift in the future. I want to tell my managers, but I don't know.

I want to be healthy, and I want to have a good body, and to live a long life.  The demands of law school and a high-stress internship that requires an hour-and-a-half commute, each way, have me feeling like I can’t take good care of myself.  By the time I get home, and have finished studying, I am too tired to cook something healthy, or exercise.  I’m definitely not getting enough sleep.  I want to give up smoking cigarettes, and cut way back on smoking weed, but I’m afraid that I’ll go crazy from nicotine withdrawal and do miserably at my internship, or in my classes.  It doesn’t help that I recently went through a painful breakup, and that I’m grieving the untimely loss of a friend.  There are so many lifestyle changes I want to make that I am overwhelmed and I don’t know where to begin.  I hate that I allowed myself to get into this trap of unhealthy patterns.

I have been a long time lurker but this is my first post ever, so I chose this subreddit because it is my most viewed.

My question is regarding a possible venture into the world of brewing, beginning with a possible internship of sorts. There are tons of breweries in the area in which I live (Asheville NC) and I have always been curious as to if I could possibly intern and apprentice under someone, even though I'm underage(19). I am really interested in beer and beer culture and would really like to, but am very hesitant to enter one of these places because of just the automatic ""you're not at least 21 years old so get the f*ck out of here"". But since wort is not illegal to make underage I still wonder if they would have a possible use for me as I can learn to brew commercially under them. Especially since I hope to open my own microbrewery one day. Thanks in advance!"
3d2fuj,4,2015-07-12,[ROLEPLAY] Return to Sender,[deleted],worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/3d2fuj/roleplay_return_to_sender/,"*Chang had been been bitter and angry all last week upon hearing of the Army's defeat in Lithuania. Officials were trying to avoid him, as he looked as if he'd snap at any moment. His own secretary was emailing him everything. Make no mistake, he may  be a 115 pound, 5'3 Chinaman, but people knew he was still a dangerous mofo. He was just going over some papers when...*

""Sir, sir! It's urgent!"", said an intern who came rushing in the office.

Chang looked at him in disbelief with a slightly open mouth for about 10 seconds that he would actually come into this office to dare speak to him in person.

""Yes... what is it?""

""The military is back, and they brought Raudonas with them.""

""Very well. Bring in Raudonas and the commanding officer at once.""

A Chinese general and a considerably bigger Lithuanian man entered the room. The former much more diligently than the latter. 

""Raudonas, old buddy old pal, so good you could make it! Please, have a seat on the couch there."", said the Chairman in a very relaxed and cheerful tone.

""Thank you, Chairman Chang. It is so good to be in your fine country. I never much cared for Lithuania anyway. The people there never truly believed in our glorious ideals of communism! Perhaps here, things will be different."", said a travel weary Premier Raudonas.

Immediately after, he stiffened and put his hands behind his back as the general stood scared.

""Now, I understand you came into some probrems. What's the deal with that? Han, buddy, maybe you can help me out.""

""Th- There were too many, s- sir. We weren't p- p- prepared enough...""

""Goddamn, speak up Han. I can't fucking hear you, now what were you fucking saying?""

""I said...""

""Shut the fuck up, Han. I heard exactry what you were saying. It's a joke on account of you sounding rike a fucking pussy. Goddamn, Han, open your fucking ears. Dumbass.""

""Y- Yes, sir. Sorry sir.""

""You know this is really funny.""

""What is, sir?"", asked a very confused and frightened general.

""Well, you army guys are always like ""DID I FUCKING STUTTER?"" and now, here you are, stuttering. Cruel irony, huh?""

""Heh, y- yeah...""

As Raudonas was watching this display, he was barely holding in chuckles. He did the exact same thing to his own men on many occasions, but he was usually bigger and more intimidating than the person he was scaring. The fact that this little man was putting so much fear into these men who are looking down at him was incredibly amusing. What could he possibly do?

""Got a famiry, Han?""

""Y- Y- Yes... *sniff* sir..."", General Han Guozhi said as his voice was breaking.

""That's nice Han. That's very nice."", Chang said as he casually sipped some juice.

""Mmmm. Good OJ.""

Chang jumped up and smashed the glass of orange juice on the general's head. He would have been protected, if he hadn't taken off his hat and bowed his head in shame. Han screamed out in pain as some of the glass went into his forehead and eyes.

""THAT HURT? *THAT HURT?* Yeah, doesn't feel so good, does it? No, huh?""

The Chairman broke Han's leg with a single precise kick to the side of the knee. Chang grabbed him by the collar and started striking the poor general in the kidney as he continued screaming for help. After a few punches to the neck, Chang grabbed him by the collar again and slammed him into the floor. 

""Yeah! That's what happens man. Yeah, that's what happens.""

Han tried crawling to safety, but Chang started kicking him mercilessly in the side, likely damaging a few organs and cracking some ribs. He knelt down on one knee, pulled the General up and started punching him right in the face, unable to defend himself. 


""Where's my tanks? Where's my tanks?!""

When Chairman Chang decided he had enough face pummeling, he walked over to pick up a bamboo stick from a display on the wall and started expertly crippling Han's limbs with it. Even Raudonas was a little disgusted by the crunch of bone that Chang was making with such a seemingly small and lightweight piece of bamboo. 

""Yeah, you like that? That feel good?"", taunted Chang.

The Chairman went over to a display case and pulled out a sword. As Han desperately tried inch away, Chang put the sword to his neck.

""Yeah, you think you can afford to waste tanks in battle, huh? Yeah, yeah, how many tanks did you lose in the fighting?""

""217"", the General struggled out weakly.

Chang pulled a pistol from his belt and shot Han in the right knee.

""GYAAAAAHHHH! Listen, you just gotta give me more time **BANG** AAAAAAHHHH!""

Han shot him in the other knee.

""Don't make a fool outta me man, don't make a fool outta me, I want my tanks."", Chang said as he pistol whipped the General on the floor. Then he started walking away.

""Chairman, this is crazy, you just got- OH MY GOD!""

Chairman Chang had a flamethrower in his hands, and the fuel tanks on his back. Raudonas was so busy watching the General that he completely failed to notice that Chang had a fucking flamethrower on his wall. General Han wailed and screamed his last for a few minutes and died a fiery death right in the Chairman's office. Luckily, marble doesn't catch fire well. Nevertheless, two soldiers came in with Fire Extinguishers to put out the fire and were shocked by what they saw.

""Well what are you standing here for?! Get him out of here!""

The men awkwardly picked up the crispy general's remains and tried to sweep up what fell off as quickly as humanly possible. When they were done, they rushed out. Once they were finally alone, Chang turned to the Lithuanian and said:

""Well, Raudonas, welcome to Yunnan."""
3d2k9f,5,2015-07-12,"So, I got a job, and I wish I could be more excited about it.",TaliaLackey,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/3d2k9f/so_i_got_a_job_and_i_wish_i_could_be_more_excited/,"After applying for over a hundred jobs, I finally got a job offer last week. The job pays really well, has opportunity for advancement (I can be promoted within my first year if I play my cards right), is in my field, will challenge me adequately, and will potentially give me tuition assistance for grad school. I'm super excited about the type of work I will be doing and who I will be working.

The catch is that I will have to travel just about all the time. I'll be on the road potentially 9-12 months out of the year and will have to be away from home for weeks or months at a time. 

I'm completing an internship right now 1,000 miles away from my home and my boyfriend. I've been away for five months so far. When I left, I told my boyfriend that it would be just for a little while, and that a few months were nothing compared to the rest of our lives together. I'll probably work this job for at least two years before I can apply for a promotion within the same organization that will give me a job where I won't have to travel so much. I absolutely hate the fact that I will have to be so far away from my boyfriend for so long. I'm also afraid that I will be lonely when I travel. I know I'll probably make friends at work, but I'll miss my friends back home. Mostly I'll miss the the kind of life I built with my boyfriend before leaving for this internship: long snuggles in bed on Saturday mornings and tv and Chinese food takeout on Friday nights. It makes me sad to think about having to live in a hotel room. It will feel so weird and empty when I come home at the end of every day.

Sorry for ranting so much. But thank you for reading this. Anyone have any advice?

3d2lkr,9,2015-07-12,M/26 (NZ/HK/US/KZ/TH) - I've spent most of my life running away from cubicles,wundermoose,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/3d2lkr/m26_nzhkuskzth_ive_spent_most_of_my_life_running/,"When I was 16 years old, I had to decide what I was going to do for the rest of my life. Like many 16 years olds, I had no idea what I wanted to do. But one thing I knew for sure is that I hated the idea of sitting in front of a computer in a cubicle, wearing a suit, and writing accounting software every day from 9 to 5.

I had always been interested in programming, since a family friend gave us their old 386 computer. I regularly borrowed the only 2 programming books I could find in my Christian school's tiny library, and spent hours making little QBASIC games and animations with ASCII stick figures. I had attended this private Christian school from the age 5 until the age of 18. I actually finished my last year of school with a group of friends that I had known for 13 years, although we've since lost touch. We were taught creationism during our biology lessons. I reevaluated a lot of things when I discovered Reddit, although I'm still subscribed to /r/Christianity for nostalgic reasons.

I was adopted when I was born, because my birth mother suffered from mental illness and couldn’t look after me. She was not married to my birth father, who passed away from a heart attack when he was in his early forties. I only met him twice, and I only met a lot of my cousins and Uncles at his funeral. But I always knew my birth mum and Grandma. Christmas's and birthdays were great.

When I was 16, I was asked if I wanted to move to a public school, which could offer me classes in programming or IT. I could have even left school, which many of my classmates did, and would have been the right move in hindsight. But I wanted to stick with my little group of friends. One time some friends joked about how we might have a class reunion, and I would be the one who turned up as a homeless drunk. I was kind of the class clown, I guess. I was shy and quiet, but there were no real bullies. There were only 7 students in our last year of school. I remember 5 of those students coming back after having a lunchtime meeting where they had just been appointed ""student leaders"". I guess the teachers didn't see too much potential in me and that one other guy who were left out. I really stopped trying during my last year of school. I would rather stay up all night programming than studying. I got 45% in my final math exam, and 30% in chemistry.

I obviously wasn't working towards a university application. So I thought it might be fun to study piano and guitar at a Christian performing arts college. My audition piece was [Classical Gas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S33tWZqXhnk), which I had taught myself after someone dared me to learn it. My final exam piece was also Classical Gas, because I messed around that year and didn't learn anything new. For some reason, I was accepted into their touring team, where we would spend a year spreading the Word around schools and churches with music, dance, and drama. I played the keyboard in the band, and also did a bit of acting.

We spend a year traveling around New Zealand, and we stayed with different host families every week. One time I almost died during an asthma attack because my bed was covered in cat hair. I had a crush on one of the girls, and spent so much time with her, only to have my heart broken when I found out that she was a lesbian. Everyone knew (about both the crush and her orientation). I got seriously drunk for the first time. A few girls on the team got pregnant. We saw a lot of teenagers give their hearts to Jesus.

I don’t think I had any plans after the tour. Music wasn’t really doing it for me, so I went to work for a company that recycled parts from old computers. One of their locations was an abandoned meat works. I remember taking parts down a passageway that was dimly lit with a single lightbulb, and storing palettes in a dusty, shadowy space filled with bags of what I assumed to be rotting cow guts.
 
I heard that we were going to be taking our tour to Germany, so I started saving up for flights. I did a drug trial to raise a bit of extra money. They cut out 6 holes in each of my thighs and tested a drug that was supposed to speed up the healing process. I don’t know if it worked, but I still have those 6 scars in each thigh. Kinda looks like I was unplugged from the Matrix, but it was the fastest $6,000 I’ve ever earned.

We went to Germany for 3 months. When I came home, I still really didn’t know what I was going to do. But my Aunt invited me to Hong Kong, where she was volunteering at a charity. She actually found out about this charity when she came to see one of my tour performances at a local church. Someone had given a presentation about the charity before we got on stage, and she decided to go and volunteer there a few months later.

So I volunteered at this charity, initially only planning to go there for 3 months. They put me in the website department, since my Aunt had told them I was “good with computers”. So I started an impromptu internship and learned how to make websites, which is something I had never even thought about doing before. They had decided to use a framework called Ruby on Rails for their new projects.

I met a girl from Kazakhstan, and we started spending a lot of time together. I returned home after the first 3 months, and she visited me for my 21st birthday. We went back to Hong Kong together a few weeks later. 2 years later, we got married, and we decided that we wanted to leave the charity and live in my home country of New Zealand.

I found a job working for a small startup, and we rented a little apartment. That startup ran out of money after 6 months, and we had to move in with my parents for a while. My wife was working as a barista at various cafes. I sent off another job application, this time to a startup in San Francisco who was working on some web-based payroll software. They only had 3 founders and 2 employees when I applied. They brought me on as a contractor while we prepared our visa application so we could get to the US.

It took us 6 months to put the visa application together, including a 15 page application letter and 8 recommendation letters, and it was rejected once with a “request for further evidence"". But after all that, we were on a flight to San Francisco.

I woke up one day, and I realized that I was now a professional programmer, who sits in an office, and works on financial software.

But it wasn’t how I thought it would be. Startups in San Francisco do crazy things to attract programmers. Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which were all catered and healthy. My daily commute was a 5 minute walk to the office. The company covered a chunk of our rent since we lived close to the office. No suits; just a t-shirt and jeans. We had awesome company “workations” where we would all travel someone to live and work there for a week. Company ski trips to Tahoe. We had a ping pong table, and a $3,000 espresso machine.

We were also encouraged to work pretty long hours. I think that’s part of the reason for catered dinners, so they keep you in the office. We also had an open plan office, where everyone’s desks are out in the open. I’ve come to realize that those are actually WORSE than cubicles, because it can be difficult to focus, and I had no privacy.

We lived in San Francisco for about 18 months. I started to get stressed and bored with the work, and my wife was bored from the start. She was there on a dependent visa, so she was not allowed to work at all. She started volunteering at the SPCA, but it wasn’t fulfilling to walk dogs and clean up poop. She enjoyed playing with kittens to “socialize” them, though.

I got an email out of the blue one day. It was from a guy who had a cool idea for a mobile app, and he wanted to meet up for coffee. 2 weeks later, three of us had started a company, I had quit my job, and my wife and I had moved to Kazakhstan.

My wife and I lived with her Mum and sister for 3 months while I worked on this app, and she found a job teaching English. I had to leave the country every 30 days to renew the visa. We were almost kicked off the train when I flushed the toilet in Kyrgyzstan. I forgot that it flushes straight onto the tracks, and apparently it’s illegal to do that if you’re waiting at a train station. The police were intimidating, but they seemed to forget about it pretty quickly. We also left that train station a little bit poorer.

After I had maxed out my tourist visas, my wife really didn’t want to go back to being a barista in New Zealand. She stayed in Kazakhstan while I spent about a month living in New Zealand with my parents again, and trying to get another visa. We finally decided that my wife could do a TEFL course in Thailand, and look for an English teaching job. She studied English at a university in Kazakhstan, but it would be difficult to find a job without a TEFL certificate.

So we ended up in Chiang Mai, where she did a one month course. I kept working on my app, and found some really cool coworking spaces where lots of other people do freelancing and remote work. On the last day of my wife's course, we were informed that we would be moving to a small town called Uthai Thani. This school really needed English teachers, and they trusted this TEFL course, so they didn’t even bother with interviews. We found out about the job on Friday, took the bus to Uthai Thani on Sunday, and my wife started work the very next day.

We’ve been here for 3 months now. We live in a little community of houses with some of the other English teachers. We often have dinner together, and we get together on Mondays to watch TV shows like Game of Thrones and True Detective. I was messing around on my skateboard at an abandoned warehouse, and some local skaters turned up and told me to get on their scooter. They didn’t speak any English, so I had no idea what was going on, but they took me to a spot by the river where they breakdance and skateboard every night. So now I hang out with them and go skateboarding for a few hours every day. We love it here, and it’s funny how we’re feeling a lot less alone than we were in San Francisco.

So I don’t know if this app is going to work out, but it’s been fun, and we’re going to launch it soon. But even if it doesn’t work out, I still have some stock in that startup I worked for. They have hundreds of employees, and are worth hundreds of millions now.

Whatever happens, I’m looking forward to the next few years. I need to stop spending way too much time on Reddit. I need to read more books. I need to keep up with the skateboarding, eat less, and keep losing weight. But life is good.

3d2sar,9,2015-07-12,Why should I get a Mazda 3 instead of a Subaru Impreza?,pattheslat,mazda3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mazda3/comments/3d2sar/why_should_i_get_a_mazda_3_instead_of_a_subaru/,"I'm posting this to both /r/mazda3 and /r/subaru in hopes of getting responses from owners of both cars. Hope that's alright with everyone.

I find myself in need of a car.

I currently drive a 1994 Mercury Grand Marquis.  It has 155,000 miles, it needs brakes (pads and rotors), the cruise control doesn't work, the rust is growing, the turn signals don't work when it's cold, it gets 19 mpg highway, it needs an alignment, the check engine light has been on for 80,000 miles, it idles really rough and sometimes stalls, and the air bag light flashes.

I'm less than 10 months away from graduating college with an engineering degree. I currently commute 120 miles per day, 5 days a week, to a (paid) internship.  The fuel costs and reliability/maintenance concerns with my current car are killing me.  My internship wants to hire me back part time (3 days a week most likely) starting in January, then hopefully full time in about a year, at which time I would move closer.  So basically, I drive a LOT right now, and will be driving a lot in the winter, but that should decrease significantly a year from now.

I'm looking into doing a 36 month, 45k mile lease.  I've narrowed it down to a Mazda 3 sport hatch or a base model Impreza wagon.  Costs between the two are close enough that they might as well be identical.

The Mazda of course is rated for better fuel mileage.  I also hear more reports of people actually achieving the quoted mileage numbers on the Mazda.  I thought the Mazda had slightly more comfortable seats, a nicer interior overall, and was a bit quicker and more fun to drive.  Ride quality was about the same, both surprisingly good for small cars. The Subaru had much better visibility, and has a back up camera, which the 3 sport doesn't have.  The Subaru is of course AWD which will be great for the 120 mile commute in January.  I'm not a fan of the CVT in the Subaru.  I also hear murmurs of oil consumption issues with the Subaru, though it looks like that's been remedied for the 2015's.  I liked that the Subaru seemed to have a little more cargo room and a bigger hatch opening, since the roofline doesn't slope down like the Mazda's does.  The Subaru's back seat is absolutely miserable to sit in, it's almost totally flat like a truck back seat, but I obviously don't sit in the back so maybe not a huge deal.

I liked the Subaru dealer a ton better.  The Mazda salesman was great, but the sales manager came at me with some high pressure sales BS when I went to leave, which I didn't appreciate and found to be unpleasant, to the extent that I drove an hour and a half away to a different dealer when I wanted to do a second test drive.

Hopefully this type of post is allowed here.  I'm just hoping to get some input from Mazda 3 owners, because I'm 100% torn between the two cars.  What do you like, what do you not like, and if you looked at the Impreza when you were shopping, what made you decide against it?"

Before that, I did not give a single fuck in life, singing in front of large crowds, dancing in the hallways, doing the most ""embarrassing"" things in front of anyone. Basically, I *was* at the nirvana where I had no fear of doing whatever I felt was right. All because I knew in my head that I had a bright future no matter what I did - I didn't depend on others' subjectiveness.

In adult life however, if someone doesn't like you, they can ruin your life. I had that realization the moment I began disagreeing with a boss during an internship. My idea was good (the other boss agreed with me), but he didn't care about that, only that *his idea* was the one chosen. I almost failed that internship with the bad reviews from that guy. I'm sure you've all had a moment like that.

I don't know about everyone else, but it's like a momentum thing. The moment you lose that IDGAF momentum, everything else begins crashing too. I began to give a fuck outside my professional life too, except with truly close friends.

I do rejection therapy now to get over this, so no need for tailored advice, but I'd like some general input on how to stay professional (politically correct, in today's world) while maintaining your personality?"

My goal from the get-go has been to internally transfer so I've been taking all the necessary prerequisites. I studied Microeconomics and Calculus I during my first and second semesters, and I'm planning on studying Intro to Marketing, Management and Organizations, Linear Algebra, and an internship CAS class for the upcoming fall. 

Additionally, I plan on taking Financial Accounting and Statistics for Business Control and Regression/Forecasting Models during the spring semester. And I'm taking Macroeconomics this summer. My cumulative GPA is a 3.82 (3.65 and 4.0) and with a 4.0 next semester, I'll have a 3.89. 

So my question is, do you guys know any friends who were able to successfully transfer? And what were their stats? What do you think about my chances? I'm pretty scared after reading posts online where people were saying that internally transferring is super hard.  My guidance counselor, however, has advised me that the average gpa for internal transfers was a 3.65 last year. Anyways, thanks in advance!!!"

I have an internship this summer, and I plan to save about $5000. I want to put some of it in a savings account, and invest some of it in a Roth IRA.

I'm considering Wealthfront, Betterment, and Vanguard target date funds. 

Wealthfront is appealing because it has no fees for accounts under $10,000. I won't be investing more than that, so I'd have no fees with Wealthfront. But, I'm not really sure how Wealthfront works. It looks like Wealthfront decides your allocation based on your risk tolerance. Does it also take into account the time horizon of your goals, like Betterment and Vanguard do? Does it change your allocation over time?

Betterment looks like it's the easiest to get started with, and probably more motivating because it has goals built in. Could someone with experience with Betterment weigh in on whether it's worth the higher fees?

Thanks!"

She just graduated and I'm going into my senior year. I don't plan on staying with this company or even staying in this line of work after this internship. I'm just doing this internship because they're paying me a lot (for a college student).

I've never interacted with J., but have seen her around. I told my sister to have J. call me and we could talk about what she's interested in.

J. and I set up a time to speak over the phone and she never ends up calling. She texts me the next morning that she had something that came up. I didn't mind and we rescheduled for later that night. She doesn't call again.

I'm kind of annoyed now since I had to move some things around with my friends to accommodate her. The things is, I can't flat out say ""No, I'm not helping you."" My sister and J. have been best friends since middle school and I know I'm going to be seeing her around.

When I asked my sister what's up, she said she (and J.) thought this was just an informal thing. To that, I said yeah, but if we set a time to talk and she doesn't call, it looks badly. 

What should I do guys? My plan is just to get her resume, but not send it in my contacts at the firm.

tl;dr: 

- Sister's best friend (J.) wants to work where I'm interning

- J. and I set a time to speak on the phone

- J. never calls (this happens twice)

- Don't want to make things awkward between me and her since I see her a lot

- Just going to get her resume but not send it in to HR since I think she's really unreliable"

I'm 19, and in college now, my junior year. I have no idea if I even like my major, I didn't get an internship for the summer, I rely on others to help me get through my classes, I've never had a real relationship and I'm still a virgin. 

I think my problems come from my social anxiety due to a concavity I have on the left side of my chest. I don't feel comfortable in my own body most of the time. It's a constant reminder that I'm not normal.

Not having a girlfriend also keeps me from being 'normal' in the eyes of my friends. At this point it's a real indicator that I'm a loser because all of my friends are in relationships. I'm always the odd numbered person whenever we go out.

If this is really the best part of my life then the rest of life must really suck. I don't think I'll ever find meaning or purpose in my life, I'm destined to die alone. Life sucks so much, and I feel like if I was just normal I would feel so much better and I would be in a better place in my life. Why can't I be normal?"

When I was in college i got arrested for a petty crime, and now my mugshot is all over the internet. Thankfully, the case was dropped, but my internet reputation is not fairing too well.  I just graduated college, and am currently staying with a family member.  I can't stay with them anymore, and will be homeless with about 1k in savings.  I graduated college with a bachelor's in IT.  I have sent out between 50-100 resumes and cover letters in multiple cities, and have not heard back from any of them.  I've had one internship while working close to full-time in school, and I'm not sure if I would get the best recommendation because I was unhappy that the internship was basically 6 months of shadowing a help desk environment. I should have been a bit more professional there, but I honestly I might be able to list them as a reference. My hunch is that my past mistake is hurting me the most.  I don't have any other family that is willing to help me, and I've already received a lot of help from friends in the past during rough times.  I'm not sure if I can continue to lean on them, for most of them are also in transitional periods of their lives.  

Anyway, I'm not exactly sure what to do.  I'm willing to go anywhere, or even to a different country to work.  How can I make this 1k stretch, and work? I'd like to start fixing my life, aside from the arrest record ordeal, during college I turned into a somewhat awkward dude (I'm uncomfortable a lot). I'm also a hard-worker, pick things up fast and have a knack for technology. Just trying to be realistic, play to my strengths and figure this thing out. Any advice would be helpful, I need to figure this all out asap.  "

I am sedditthrowit, and I have decided to run for the position of **MP for Jurong East**, under the banner of the PAP.

---

As a resident of the West District for many years, I am well-suited to tackle the issues the we **West Side Singaporeans** face. Things are developing like crazy in the west, and really, the West is slowly becoming one of the most developed areas in Singapore. That is not without a reason. The PAP has good policies and they have benefited the West District, just like the rest of Singapore.

Hence, I ask that you **vote for progress, vote for PAP and vote for sedditthrowit**.

---

My personal views and policies are simple.

**1. Opportunities for the youth**

Let's get the youth more involved in today's world. Whether they end up as engineers, teachers, managers, nurses or service staff, there WILL be a place for them in the Singapore society. Youth lack opportunities to discover their talents. Currently, there are many specialised schools and I think that's a good thing. What we can do, moving on, is to introduce more hands-on learning within the school system. By that, I mean more internships, more job training and more specialised learning programmes.

**2. Secure economy and jobs for the working population**

The working population are the ones supporting Singapore. Without them, we cannot progress or improve. I believe we should continue our investments in science and technology and push for the development and launch of more startups in Singapore. We must also maintain Singapore's position as a regional hub for MNCs seeking expansion. Our unique position in the region must be used to our benefit. In addition, workers wishing to learn new job skills should be given the opportunities to do so. Our current jobs landscape shows the success of the jobs training schemes, and we must look into how we can improve the existing schemes to complement the changing jobs environment.

**3. Assistance for the ageing**

The ageing population cannot be neglected, especially in Singapore, with a growing greying population. Elderly-friendly facilities must continue to be introduced in public areas, and more homes for the elderly should be built. Beyond that, elderly workers must be given support for their jobs and the retirement age should be reviewed as well. Job skills training should also apply here, and the elderly must be viewed as able contributors to society, despite their age.

That's about it! If you do have any questions regarding my personal policy and views, do make a comment and I will respond as soon as possible."

3d4kjx,9,2015-07-13,"I[27 M/] just broke up with my gf [24F] after 8 months, She says she cares about me, but will never love me. Sees no future with me",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d4kjx/i27_m_just_broke_up_with_my_gf_24f_after_8_months/,"We were together since November. We clicked from the beginning and never had any issues except one: From the start she made it clear it wasn't a forever thing. Me being the stubborn and romantic guy I am vowed to change her mind. I mean I knew she wasn't going to be my last relationship either, but I atleast wanted it to go as long as possible without some looming expiration date. Otherwise the relationship was perfect. We never fought, shared alot in common, and were very affectionate and loving towards each other.


In March she moved (from NYC) to Virginia for an internship opportunity in her career field. With the help of her dad she secured a place out there and set her roots. This began the lost distance phase of things. It wasn't so bad. I spent the month of April out there with her. I felt our relationship growing and getting stronger. At the end of the trip I asked if she loved me and to my dismay she said ""not in the way you love me"". This hurt, but I decided to just keep going with things and hope her feelings grew. Besides it's not like she treated me with any distance or weirdness. I would just have to keep trying.

Fast forward to this weekend: Right now my career prospects can lead me to moving to Virginia with her. She said I could stay with her for awhile, but eventually I'd have to find my own place. To some people 8 months might be too soon to think about moving in, but it was an intense relationship. We constantly talked about how it felt like we'd been together much longer than we had and we had steadfastly keeping the relationship healthy and alive through daily talks on FaceTime.  It was a big step, but I felt we were ready for it. 

So after asking many questions I got her to admit it: Her feelings still haven't changed from before. She ""loves me, but isn't in love with me"". Her feelings have plateaued and she feels she'll never love me. This is in stark contrast to myself who's been actively telling everyone she's the love of my life. So I dangle the idea of breaking up and she jumps on it. After tears on both sides I tell her how much I hate this feeling of not having her and want to get back together, but she rather remain broken up. She tells me that if she kept going out with me, she'd eventually feel depressed because she wouldn't have the chance to fall in love with anyone.

She said it had nothing to do with attraction, personality, or how good of a bf I was. She just never got that feeling of loving me.

Right now I'm devastated. I loved this girl more than anyone I ever encountered. I was single for 4 years from my previous relationship before I decided she was the one I wanted to give a chance. I feel like I was just a fool for caring so hard about someone who never felt the same way about me.

Idk if I'm looking for advice or what. I just needed to get this off my chest. I feel like I've been kicked in the guts. She warned me, but I didn't listen.Before all this we planned for her to come back to NYC next weekend to spend time with me. Now after all this, with no hopes of reconciliation, she still wants to come see me. And I desperately want to see her. Some part of me hopes I can still get through to her. 


   
**tl;dr**: My gf of 8 months isn't capable of falling in love with me, but still says she cares. Says she wants to be with me, but eventually needs to leave me to find ""a better fit"". I offer to break up now and she jumps on it. She might be coming to stay with me next weekend. Reconciliation seems impossible, but my heart still wants her."
3d4m5t,0,2015-07-13,I [22M] met a girl [21-23F] at a farmer's market a few days ago and got her number. How do I get the date now?,BurnTreesPlease,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/3d4m5t/i_22m_met_a_girl_2123f_at_a_farmers_market_a_few/,"On Saturday I was working at a farmer's market and there were quite a few pretty girls there so I wanted to definitely leave with a number. I had my eye on this girl two stands down who was selling meats because she seemed really cute but the girl who helped make and sell cheese came up to me first.

[Before I go any further I just want to let it be known these are not typical behaviors for me. At these markets I usually keep to myself but I know how good it is of an opportunity to become more comfortable around strangers so I'm trying to make myself uncomfortable especially because of how bad I struck out the day before in a similar situation.]

Anyway cheese girl at my stand and we're just chatting having a nice, chill conversation. There is plenty of smiles and some laughs being shared. Overall the interaction was good but still very platonic. Her stand gets busy so she leaves.

From that little boost of confidence I walk around the market eventually getting to meat girls stand. At first I can tell she's seeing me as a potential sell because of how I started the conversation but as the conversation is getting more comfortable/personal we both loosen up and definitely smile and laugh plenty of times. [Her story is she's around here for a few weeks for an internship then going back back home. She's a little lonely and seems to want to branch out a little bit.] I leave my stand to help a customer and I bring her back a trail mix I made her at my stand and she seems to appreciate the sentiment.

For the remainder of the market I could catch her glancing at me periodically which could honestly mean nothing.

Nearing the end as we were packing up we're just making jokes and laughing here and there. I thought she had been looking at me again so I wanted to catch her gaze and essentially let her know I was noticing her noticing me if that makes sense at all and I looked up at her and caught her gaze and it turned to a flirty side eye and she laughs and says ""Don't look at me like that!"" and kind of turns around to walk away while holding eye contact and walks a little more slowly and still looking back at me. As we both finished up packing asked her how her trip back was looking like. Then I asked, ""Not to be weird but I was wondering if I could get your number so maybe we could do something soon?"" And she said, ""Yea, it would be fun to make friends in [my state].""

I waited around 20ish hours and text her asking her about work stuff since that was how we originally got talking. She said she meant to text me yesterday thanking me for my mix but forgot about it and responded to my question. I let her know I enjoyed where I worked but I was missing her tent meaning missing her company and she said she missed my ""special mix"". I said aw I didn't know it was a Special Mix now and she just never responded. Was she just being nice and she's actually not interested? I'm not surprised by this, most women I show an attraction to usually end up responding like that but I'm wondering if there's anything left I can salvage?

I also work around 30 hours at week between two different jobs. One job is a front-desk position at a local gym. I'm constantly being pressured into taking hours for other people and it often gets in the way of doing homework or housework. My apartment is such a mess right now due to me never having time to clean it that sometimes I feel like I might panic as soon as I walk in the door. 

Yesterday, my SO and I went out of town to get brunch/browse around a different shops in the area. Halfway through brunch I notice that I have several missed calls and a flood of texts from three different people at work. The person who was supposed to open the gym forgot and went out to the lake for the day. Instead of telling her to come back and open, they called me wanting me to take her shift. 

I told them I was out of town, but I couldn't really enjoy the rest of the day off, feeling like I was obligated to come in, though I know that's not true. Most days when I'm in town and I end up stopping what I'm doing, even if it's important, and rushing to work. This seems to happen without fail at every job I've taken and has led people to rely on to always cover shifts.

Part of this is due to the fact that I got fired from my last job for not being able to work as many hours during finals week, and I'm afraid of that happening again once I start my internship if I don't ""show initiative"". 

I want to stand up for myself and make it clear that I can't always be on call, but I'm afraid of getting fired again."

I already had a dog before this, but they get along fine so that's not the problem.

The problem is, this dog is terrified of me (20M) and my brother (22M). I live at home right now because i'm doing an internship that is closer to my house than it is to college. But anyway, the dog runs from us, avoids us, if my parents are around it doesn't leave their side. As far as I know, neither of us did anything to scare it at all. And my parents take great care of the dog and my grandparents weren't abusive towards it, they just couldn't take it out for walks and stuff like that so we thought it would be best to bring it to live with us. So the first problem is that it is terrified of us. On to the second problem.

The second problem is the barking. I know, dogs bark. But not like this. The dog usually sleeps in my parents' room which is upstairs. If i even turn the hallway light on upstairs she barks for like a minute, I try to sneak around but it doesn't work. If I walk in the house and the dog is near my parents, she barks, but if no one is home, she doesn't bark. 

Is there anything I can do to make it not scared of me like this? I try to pet her and stuff like that to get her comfortable around me but it doesn't seem to work.

It's weird, because I'm not sure I've ever said out loud that I'm a smoker. I am writing this post to tell my story and to do something with my hands on my second day of not smoking :P 

I have only been smoking daily for the past nine months. Prior to that time, I would smoke occasionally on weekends at parties or bars. However, it was usually just one or two and not even every weekend. I called myself a ""social smoker."" This was for the last two-and-a-half years of college. 

I received my undergraduate degree last year, and I also got an internship in Germany starting last August (I'm an American, age 23). Unfortunately, there are a lot more smokers in Europe than in the U.S., and the stigma is not as prevalent. To deal with culture shock and stress, I began having one cig a day. Sometimes I would skip a day and not really think about it. However, due to the stress of applying for visa extensions and just general life issues, it escalated to about half a pack a day. 

Until recently, I had little to no desire to quit. I had lurked here, but I thought I wasn't ready. What changed for me was Saturday night - I smoked almost an entire pack of cigarettes while I was at the club with friends. Now, many of my friends here are smokers, and a pack a day is pretty normal for them. But I smoked that much in less than 12 hours, and I woke up with the worst headache I have experienced in a while. It was not an alcohol hangover - I know what that feels like. It was most certainly a cigarette binge hangover. 

I think when a smoker is in their first year, they don't even think about why it's disgusting or they just don't have any desire to stop. I'm trying to change that for myself and mold the best version of me to set an example for others. I realize that because smoking is a newer thing for me, it's easier to do this than it is for many of you, and that's why I'm doing it now. I commend those of you who are choosing to let go after several years or decades. I read your stories, and they make me think: I don't want to struggle with quitting even more than I am now.

There is nothing that makes cigarettes worth it for me. It makes me lethargic and lazy. I can't breathe or sing like I used to. I hate the way it makes my hair smell. My skin has never been worse. I feel like a more disgusting person because of it. If my friends and family from the U.S. saw me now (pretty much all of them non-smokers), they would be appalled. 

Now, I can be perfectly honest with myself and others about being a non-smoker. If you're reading this and you're wondering, ""Am I ready?"" I can tell you that I've never and will never have more reason to quit, and I've only been smoking for 9 months. The best time is now.

Edit: screwed up my flair. I've only got one day under my belt ;) Just resubmitted"

My FH works from home, so he doesn't actually have any relationship with his coworkers, and won't be inviting anyone.

I have been at my job since I was an intern and have been working here for four years, so a total of six years in one capacity or another. We're a pretty small office, with different departments that don't necessarily work alongside each other every day. I'm running into a problem with the decision to invite people from work or not.

Here's the situation: I'm an editor, and my team is made up of six people (myself included), so inviting them wouldn't be a big deal, but I have a closer relationship with our team of graphic designers, five guys who we work alongside every day. So that would end up being 10 people with plus ones, and 20 people in a 120 person wedding is a lot of people! Then because I'm an editor I work alongside the sales manager pretty closely, but my magazine only has 3 sales people so I'd have to invite all three or it would be an issue. And then I would feel like it would be an issue if I didn't invite my two bosses, and the two staff members I worked with before my promotion, and the 3 people in our accounting office who we have weekly lunches with. So that's another 8 people, 16 with plus ones, totaling 36 extra people. And I don't even really like my job that much-- in fact I'm looking for new ones!

My solution is to not invite anyone from work-- my parents are helping pay for the wedding so I'd much rather give them the option to invite an extra handful of friends than have all those people there. But my problem is that people keep asking me how the planning is going, asking about the wedding, just being thoughtful and checking in. I'm kind of uncomfortable giving a real response and knowing that they aren't going to be invited and I don't really know how to respond. It's not like I can say we're having a small wedding-- 120 is pretty big-- but my family along makes up half of the guest list. I'm not the type of person to be bothered by office gossip, I just don't want to offend or hurt anyone I work with every day. Am I overthinking this, and if not how can I avoid these conversations without appearing rude? "

Not that it snows where I come from. My Dad used to move around a lot for work, and for a while we moved around with him. Until we had to settle down for school. My Dad continued to work in odd cities, while my Mother, Sister, and I moved closer to my Grandparents. My parents' siblings and parents all lived accross the street from each other. This was a short period in my life, but it may be the most important. I know some people have shitty families and would never agree with me, but during this time I learnt that family is everything. And if no one else, your family will always have your back. Maybe that's what fostered the naive fearlessness in my personality, the many street fights with an army of cousins behind me. 

I was eight when we moved to Canada, there was four of us by that time, I had two brothers. It was right before my Birthday, but I knew I wouldn't get anything. Not that I had asked, my Dad was selling newspapers. I remember I froze most of that first winter, no jacket and snow boots. My teacher must have noticed me a few times, standing and shivering against the wall outside. She took me to to the lost and found and gave me a jacket and some snow shoes. She was the first person to show me kindness in Canada.

I didn't speak English so I got a lot of hate from other kids the first few years, but I fought everyone that ever stepped up to me. That's how I was thought to earn respect. Years went by, we moved around, I made friends, assimilated into the culture, went to High School and found a girlfriend (in another school). She was an year older and it was time for her prom. I didn't have a job or a suit, but I had to make her happy. I went in to The Bay, scoped out the place, got fitted and told them I'd be back. Went back a week later when someone else was working, picked up a $350 blazer, $70 Van Heusen pants and $49 dress shirt and walked out the back door near the childrens section (there're no cameras in that section). Walked around, re-entered the mall and walked out with a $60 tie. Took a risk with this one because I had to walk out through the mall as there was no back exit. But it was the only place with a matching tie.. We still fought that day though, I forgot to steal a Corsage. 

Fast forward a few more years, we've been together for six years, I'm in third year of my university paying 11k a year for a program I've learnt nothing from. I'm not going to make excuses and blame the system, but university was just never for me. I found it hard to pay attention and learn anything in that environment, more than anything it hindered my progress. I always managed to pass my courses, but my grades were shit so I didn't qualify for the internship program. My girlfriend was pressuring me for marriage, we had broken up a few times and were miserable together. But I still loved her. So I took an year off from University and managed to impress the hiring Manager at IBM enough to give the student job over others with MUCH better grades. He didn't regret it, I was hard working and doing more work than a lot of the permanant staff on the team. He said in several meetings that ""we don't pay you enough OP"". I was making 50k an year and had a 16-month contract. 

But it wasn't enough, I picked up contract work that I did in the evenings and worked the weekends at my Dad's gas station (this was mainly to help him out so he can rest, I gave the $50/day he gave me to my Mom). I was working 75-80 hours a week. After about 12 months of denying myself any pleasures and helping my parents out with my sisters wedding (10k), I managed to save about 20k to get married myself. I was ready. But life had other plans, I found out my girlfriend had been having affair with a married man at work. For 4 months I tried to cope with it, tried to get over it, but I couldn't. I asked her to quit her job, she refused. I asked her to switch to another location and she still refused, even though it was actually closer to her house. Maybe that was selfish of me, or I was insecure, but it was what it was. I couldn't convince myself that she still loved me so I walked away. Two months later she gave me one last present. A box full of darkness. Torn pictures, burnt cards and love letters. I cried for a while, but then I picked myself up. I stuck my money into a savings account, and bought myself a motorbike. I had wanted one since seventh grade.

My contract ended, I went back to University for my final year and used my savings to pay for tuition in full and to cut down my student loans from previous years. A month in to it, I met another girl. She was beautiful, but more importantly she had the same heart as I did. We connected like the straps on a snapback. I never thought it would happen, let alone this fast, but I was in love again. She was everything I wanted and everything that was missing from my previous relationship. My friends tried to tell my that this was a rebound, and I was trying to pick up where I left off in my previous relationship. But I didn't care what anyone said. I had one semester left, I decided she was the one, so I went and got a job with a 6-month trial period at 60k p.a. and 65k thereafter. Five months after we got engaged and life's better than it's ever been.

I had one month until graduation and I decided I need a better paying job in order to get married, buy a house, and settle down. I applied for a bunch of Senior Developer positions. I didn't have the experience, but I had the skills and solid references. I landed a new job two weeks later and jumped from 60k to 80k. But I wasn't happy here. I loved the team, but I was having personality clashes with the Boss and wasn't getting  respect I deserved from him. 

After watching me be miserable for two months my Fiance convinced me to start looking for another job. I applied for a few jobs, and last Wednesday I got the perfect offer. We decided that I would take it. I'd be making north of a 100k USD and they would give me an additional 10k to help with relocation to a beautiful new city where it's nice and hot all year round. With only about 2 months left until our wedding, this would be like a permanant honeymoon for us. But life had other plans.

I've always been a fighter.

I wasn't scared when I got a knife pulled out on me during a brawl trying to help my friend. I stepped up to the him while he stepped back. In hindsight, it's clear that I was stupid - but I wasn't scared. 

I wasn't scared when I went up against someone three times my size for referring to me with a racial slur. He picked my up and smashed me on the concrete floor. I walked away bloody, but with my respect in tact. 

I wasn't scared when one person dragged me across the basket-ball court while three others attacked me with extendos and thick tree branches. 

I wasn't scared when me and about 15 of my friends got chased down the road by over 50 people armed with axes, hammers and just about any other tool you can think of. Eight of my friends got arrested and picked up charges that day. I got lucky. 

I went out of sequence and jumped back a few years there. Those were my high school days. But fact of the matter is that I've known sorrow, I've known helplessness, and I've known shitty odds. But I haven't really known fear, it wasn't an option where I grew up.

For maybe the first time in my life, I'm scared as hell. And I wish it was something that I could get off my chest, but it's inside my chest...

TL;DR - no."

I am one of 6 children. I'm an early-20's male.

My parents are both Ns. My mother has diagnosed depression, which she hasn't treated in years. She also may have bi-polar disorder, though I don't know. All of my siblings and I were home schooled our entire lives, with some dual-enrollment at the local high school. That meant that we would see her breakdowns, while she was teaching us, though it got worse as we got older, and my oldest siblings escaped a lot of it. I remember in my senior year of high school, I was getting ready for work, and my mother was teaching my 9-year-old sister math. My sister couldn't understand the concept, and my mom had a meltdown. She decided the best time to do laundry was RIGHT THEN, went upstairs, slammed the washer door, broke it, and then blamed my sister and I for making her upset. 

When I was younger, I always felt neglected, but I never brought it up to my parents, because I knew they would deflect it. Then, one day, I said it. I told my mother how I felt. Her response? ""Well, your dad lost his job when you were younger, and so we were too busy to care. So yes, we didn't care about you as much when you were younger.""

She told me that. On the way to the dentist.

My father is much more subtle. But we owe him for raising us. Which is funny, because I don't remember asking to be born. I'm paying for college, but god forbid I ask for help with rent when I have unexpected expenses. He reminds me of me borrowing $10 from him 10 years ago. And I'm ungrateful if I argue with him. I've got an internship this summer at a VERY prestigious company, I'm farther than he's ever gone career-wise, and I've still got 2 years left of college.

That's not the point of the story, though.

When my little sister was born, I was 9. My two older brothers, both in high school, had bedrooms in our basement, where my dad also had his office. I had a room on the second floor, and my sisters shared a room on the second floor. The decision was made for me to move to the basement so my sisters could have different rooms, and then one would share with my little sister. I thought I would be rooming with one of my brothers.

I was wrong.

My room was a hallway. It had three doors. One led to our utility room and the stairs to the first floor, one led to my brothers' rooms, and one led to my dad's office, where he worked from home.

My room was as wide as my bed. I didn't have a dresser. I didn't have a bookshelf. I didn't have room for toys, or anything. But that's not the worst part.

I had no privacy. I had nothing. My dad's work clients would WALK THROUGH MY ROOM. I'd wake up and see middle aged men walking through my room in the early morning. 

***And I thought it was normal.***"

I have 3 main big ones with high interest rates (20+ % APR)

Cap 1 - 2500
AMEX - 2000


I can pull a 3500 loan off my 401k with a 4% interest rate (paying back out of paychecks). I am 27. Given the interest rate is much lower on the loan should I pull the 3500 and payoff one / throw another grand and payoff the cap1 and amex?

I'm a college student that has a 2 hour drive between college and home so I'm familiar with two different agencies (home SO and college city PD). I was an intern with college city PD for a semester and made excellent connections there. I've ridden with an officer at home SO and also know one of the patrol supervisors. They had an explorer program but as soon as I got into it, it got put on hold due to lack of interest (man I was pissed). They have a policy of no more than 2 ride-along's per year (was waived for Explorers, but since the program has since been shut down, I have no clue what's going on with that).

So now my question is, is it likely that either agency may be willing to just take me on for ""regular"" ride-along's? I don't know if that's a thing or not. College city PD doesn't have an Explorer program or I'd be all over that. I don't want to become a burden on officers or on the agency, I don't want to soil my contacts there by being a constant presence, etc.

Any tips appreciated.,[deleted],networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/3d6kbb/frustratedbeen_trying_to_get_into_networking_any/,"I'm 26, currently living in NJ. I graduated with a BSBA in MIS from Drexel University. Around my final year, during an internship with GSK as a junior networking analyst I decided to pursue core networking full time because I really loved the field, what my seniors did, and basically loved studying the science of networking/TCP/IP. 

I wrote and passed the CCENT a month before I was about to graduate. After graduation I tried hard to find a networking gig in my area, even if it was tier 1/entry level/helpdesk. I couldn't find anything pure networking, but eventually took up a Tier 1 MSP job, where I got a lot of hands on with Windows servers and general windows troubleshooting and centralized management platforms (Kaseya, some VMWare). 

I was at the job for a year when I decided to quit (it was a start-up firm with extremely bad management and lagging paychecks). I had to visit India due to personal reasons, my stay was extended there so I decided to pick a job there too. I couldn't find anything in networking (I still only had the CCENT), but found a job with IBM as tech support for one of their clients. This again was basic computer/app troubleshooting. By February, I studied for and passed the CCNA (the honest way). 

Currently I'm back in NJ and been applying to any entry-mid tier networking job I see on DICE, Monster, Careerbuilder. Its only been about 2 weeks but, but I'm having absolutely no luck. I am just getting some calls for MSP Tier 1 positions again. I'm quite frustrated and don't know what to do. I'm quite desperate to break into networking and begin my climb towards really advanced knowledge/skillset (CCIE-tier) but I don't know where to even start. I've broken my options down:

1) Pick the MSP job. Try to advanced to Tier 2 within the company within 2 years and get an MS cert (not really interested in servers) or somehow manage to get CCNP while not really working with any enterprise networking concepts at the MSP. However, this path will delay my entry into networking. 

2) Don't pick the MSP job. Just keep applying for core networking jobs while studying full time for my CCNP, practice labs on GNS3. With full time study, I could pass CCNP Route, put myself down as a candidate for CCNP in my resume which could maybe get me more noticed. This sounds to me a better than option 1, at least I'll be doing what I love. 

3) I know all of you will not like this but I still wanted to get an opinion. I've been contacted by a firm which pretty much fakes your resume and puts down 6-8 years of experience, markets you out nationwide and places you. I really do not want to do this as it greatly violates my values. But at the same time, they're promising me pure gold. I really believe in building a good base and not embarrassing myself and getting fired. But they tell me they've placed several freshers in networking this way and they managed it just fine who now have full time networking roles. They pick their skills up on the job. Honestly - the simple thought of getting a job where I'm forced to learn networking, hit GNS3 labs hard and absorb advanced TCP/IP troubleshooting, Wireshark, Design and CCNP-IE tier books night and day sounds absolutely refreshing as I've been so damn starved for such an opportunity. Its hard to study and be motivated when networking is not what you do at your job. But again, this is like making a deal with the devil.


I'm not fussy, I'm willing to relocate on my own funds to anywhere in East coast (or if opportunity presents - anywhere nationwide really) to find an entry level Networking gig. Even if it pays minimum wage/internship but it helps me get down some hands on experience with Cisco...I will get the platform I need to exceed. But I'm just not seeing it. Very sorry for the long post. I guess I just wanted to vent. 

Btw here is my resume, please feel free to critique it:

3d6o8h,0,2015-07-13,"""Why have I never taught a Jewish child?"", asks man who's been teaching in the UK for 36 years",Derbedeu,exjew,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjew/comments/3d6o8h/why_have_i_never_taught_a_jewish_child_asks_man/,"Some of the more salient points:

&gt;I spoke to a London headteacher about the number of Jewish children in his 1000 strong school. The school had many Jewish children until the opening of a nearby Jewish Free School at which point all Jewish children left. If we segregate children by religion are we surprised they become segregated socially and that elements of separatism will pervade?

and

&gt;In July 2013, a state-funded orthodox Jewish girls' school in north London was admonished after it was discovered that students had their GCSE exams censored, with questions about evolution deliberately blacked out of science papers. The OCR examinations board found that 52 papers in two GCSE science exams sat by pupils at Yesodey Hatorah Senior girls' school in Hackney had questions on evolution obscured, making them impossible to be answered.

Also

&gt;The Catholic Church has refused to open further academies until the government changes its policy on a 50% cap on the control of admissions. This cap on single faith control of admissions upset Jewish community leaders, too, but the government says that, “new faith schools established with taxpayers money in areas where there is a shortage of good places will be available to all who need them.” (Telegraph 15-11-2013)Why wouldn’t faith schools, all built upon such positive principles want to attract others to their moral outlook?

I find faith schools to be abhorrent. It's effectively promoting segregation from a young age, and the fact that it is (ostensibly) voluntary doesn't mean that there won't be problems as the kids grow up and have no idea of not just educational matters (as cited regarding evolution) but about the people in their own neighbors in society. How can segregating kids at a young age engender trust and familiarity within a community?

Dawkins has a great documentary on faith schools (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulX8nZjeCXE) and it's appalling to see the lack of education and the amount of indoctrination that goes on. It's scary how the science teacher in one of the Muslim faith schools doesn't even know what evolution is. And her students want to be doctors!

What was your schooling like? Looking back on it can you say you are content with your schooling? Or would you say that you feel somewhat cheated with the level of education that was afforded to you? Was it a thorough education? For example I was lucky enough to attend a (good) public school, and we had art classes, an orchestra and a band, AP classes, various sports (wrestling, basketball, baseball, football, lacrosse, etc), theater department, good health and sex-ed classes, numerous clubs (chess, math, reading, etc), extensive language courses (you could choose from French, Italian, or Spanish), mandatory phys ed (aka gym), and a special advanced science program where we were given opportunities to intern at nearby colleges in order to do research and enter the Intel Science Project. And obviously none of these classes were segregated on gender, except gym, and also sports where the women had their own teams and leagues minus a few sports like football and wrestling (though I recall at a wrestling competition once the visiting school actually had a girl on the team!) I honestly was spoiled because when I went to college I was shocked to learn from my college friends how bad other schools were (including plenty of public ones in addition to religious ones). For some naive reason I thought that all American public schools shared the same curriculum and had the same offerings. 

If your schooling was at a religious school, how does it compare? Was evolution even broached as a topic? Did you have a health and sex-education class? What was the emphasis on? Religion or core subjects like math, science, history, and lit? Where AP classes or IB courses offered? What about the arts? How did your primary education influence you in your approach towards higher education (getting a bachelors, masters, PhD, etc)? Or your choice of career?

So, I would like to give something back by making a short biography of my country's (Portugal) hero from WWI.

----
**O Soldado Milhões (The Soldier Millions)**
----

[Aníbal Augusto Milhais](https://i.imgur.com/ISKVxGc.jpg) (09.07.1895 - 03.06.1970) was born in the village of Valongo de Milhais, in the North of Portugal. There he lived all his young life until the age of 20 (1915), when he was drafted to the army. 
In February of 1916, following a British request, Portugal interns German and Austro-Hungarian ships in Lisbon. This action was followed by a formal declaration of war by the German and Austo-Hungarian Empires. In July, General [Norton de Matos](https://i.imgur.com/nwCsw95.jpg) and General [Tamagnini de Abreu (on the left)](https://i.imgur.com/A5W7m0z.jpg) establish the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps (*Corpo Expedicionário Português*) with 30 000 soldiers. Milhais was on of these men.

Just six months after its formation, in January of 1917, [the first contingent of the PEC is sent to France](https://i.imgur.com/mzLujKm.jpg), with the second following shortly. The Portuguese troops were stationed in Flanders and saw action for the first time in April. During this year, more and more Portuguese troops reach the front, first under British command and the under their own, being given responsibility over a sector of the front.

By 1918, due to German offensives and lack of reinforcements, the Portuguese soldiers were forced to serve in the front for long periods of time. Exhaustion among these soldiers became such a problem that the British decided to send the PEC to the rear to reorganize. This action was supposed to take place in the 9th of April. Unfortunately, that was also the day that saw the start of Ludendorff's Georgette's offensive (known as Battle of La Lys in Portugal). Outmanned, outgunned, exhausted and demoralized, the PEF loses over one third of it's fighting men. But on Portugal darkest moment of the war, a man stood as a beacon of courage. Armed only with his Lewis machine gun, Milhais held by himself the advancing German troops and allowed the retreat of both Portuguese and British troops. For five days, Milhais fought alone, eating nothing but peanuts. On the 14th, joined by a Scottish officer, he retreated.

When tales of his achievements became known, Commander Ferreira do Amaral told him ""You're Milhais, but you're worth millions"" (*""És Milhais, mas vales milhões""* - a pun), which ended up being his nickname - Soldier Millions (*Soldado Milhões*). His actions earned him the [*Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada, do Valor, Lealdade e Mérito* award](https://i.imgur.com/LJIHqt3.jpg), Portugal's highest national honour. 

------

There are records of him narrating this experience, which I'll try to translate bellow:

[**Part one - Soldier Malha-Vacas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB7S5aiJGlE)

«On the 8th [of April] I left the lines and dreamt about my village's patron saint. The day after I told my friends ""I'm happy with the dream I had. I've dreamt about my patron saint and she was smiling to me.""

I was drinking coffee when the fighting started. I picked up my machine gun and there we went to the front.

I arrived at the top of La Couture, but only one soldier had accompanied me. His nickname - they called him - was ""Malha Vacas"". There we were, behind a house that was burning. Everything was on fire. To that soldier I said: ""Look, Malha Vacas, our battalion has ran away. Let's get out of here. Poor fella, barely run. He had moved about 10 meters when a grenade hit him and pulverized him. I kept on running.»

[**Part two - Fighting in La Couture**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O061y_KpfSc)

«I entered the shelter and saw no one. I could only see fire around me. Later, the Germans started advancing over the fields of La Couture. The fields were crowded with people. On the front line they came dressed as Portuguese. They had captured our soldiers and were using their uniforms. 

As I wasn't sure, and I had seen five Scots, I went to ask them to do some reconnaissance. Then I ran back to the shelter. When I arrived, the soldiers already were at the top of La Couture, on motorcycles and with tall helmets. Then I was sure they were German.

I opened fire and the invaders fell. An hour later another invasion. Again I opened fire, before they could even reach their previous position. A machine gun fires a lot. But later, another invasion came. It wasn't as big. I cut it down too.

I didn't see Germans after that.»

[**Part three - Helping comrades-in-arms**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80QpvEVtuY)

«I saw a soldier in the trenches. I ran to him with my pistol - I didn't know if he was German or anything else. He was a boy from the 15th [battalion]. I asked him: ""So, you're here too?"", ""There are many of us here, but we're surrounded.""

I went to call the Scots and showed them the Germans that were surrounding us. They told me we were all prisoners for sure. I told them that we weren't.

I sent them down the road. Meanwhile I had stayed back and was watching the Germans. Some of them were getting up. When they did it, I cut them down. They got up and fell, where they were where they laid. Our [soldiers], when they saw them fall, started running away. I ran too, I ran in hopes of crossing the bridge. And I did. Ten minutes later the bridge was gone.»

**[Part four - Meeting the Scottish officer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG-Wk0xB_qw)**

«I took shelter on a shack that had been a Portuguese gas deposit. There I stayed until the 14th [of April], firing across the canal so that the Germans couldn't make bridges over it. I fired one or two hundred meters from the shack, because wherever I fired from, the Germans attacked with artillery.

On the 14th, around 11 o'clock, I saw one man coming. I didn't know if he was German. I shot three times over his head and firmly held my pistol pressed against his chest. With my left hand I searched him. Then I told him to be at ease, and he asked: ""Boy, has it been you who has been keeping on firing here on La Couture?"", ""It has been me alone"", ""Yes, I know you are alone. Have you got anything to eat around here?"", ""I have my food, peanuts.""

I gave him peanuts and he ate them too. He had been in the German prisoner camp, and was all torn from the barbed wire. He had crossed all that, jumped into the canal and swam across.

We fell back together until he found his own. To me he gave a letter and, with a pencil, wrote down the roads that I should follow.  All of them. I found my own without having to ask for more directions.»

[**Part five - Saving a child**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9XOCE77F-Q)

«At nightfall, while passing by a small village, I hear crying. A child in a house, lying on the floor. I felt pity for that child crying so much. I crossed the debris, found her on a corner and pulled her out. She barely walked, but she could climb. I was over encumbered due to all the stuff I was carrying. If it was today, I wouldn't have carried so many things.

I carried the girl over my shoulder, over the machine gun, until I reached the rear, where I found civilians. I met two beautiful girls that started asking me where I was going. I told them I was coming from La Couture and ended up on the bridge of Saint Venant, but that the child was from somewhere else. I told them the name of the village she was from and described the house where I had found her. They looked at each other and asked me to hand over the child to them. I told them ""Of course. I don't want to keep her"". I was hoping they would take care of her. They said they knew the girl, that they were neighbours. So I went and she stayed.

When I regrouped with the 15th Battalion, I celebrated with my commander and with the rest of the guys.»

I dated a much older guy for about 4 months last summer, but we broke up when I left for college across the country. I was completely and totally in love with him, but he wasn't really looking for commitment, and looking back, it wouldn't have worked out anyway. Things ended with him in October, and I've been single since. I've gone out on many dates, mostly from Tinder, and I've also had my fair share of hookups.

I fell into a pattern of hooking up with someone new and getting really excited, and then getting really disappointed when something inevitably went wrong. Because of this, I stopped hooking up for a while. I've been going on dates and have hooked up with a few guys, but I can't seem to find anyone I come even close to liking. All I want is to be in love. I think about it constantly, and it's really hard feeling so alone and unloved all the time.

The most common advice I've seen/heard is to focus on improving other parts of my life, but I've done that. I go to one of the best colleges in the US, I have a top-tier internship in NYC this summer, my relationship with my family is great, and I have many friends whom I love and trust. I'm tired of casual sex and really want something serious. I want to be loved and love someone back. I miss taking care of someone and feeling a real connection.

I keep trying to meet guys, but nothing is clicking. I don't know what I can do to find someone I really connect with. It feels pretty helpless and out of control. I guess I'm just looking for realistic advice on what I can do better to find something real."

Long time lurker, first time poster. Quick summary of why I’m posting is I’m looking for some advice on how to break into sales in the Boston area, specifically SaaS. From what I’ve read here this seems like the most interesting field to me and it's what I’d like to pursue. Now what I’d like to know is what can I do to increase my odds of being hired? For my background I have a degree from Umass Lowell in Finance and International Business. For work experience I was a Server at an Outback Steakhouse, Data Research Intern with Kronos for about a year, and as of now I’m a Fund Administrator doing Private Equity Valuations with one of the largest Financial Services companies in the country (so basically no experience sales related). To conclude what I’m specifically asking is below:

1.)	Do you think I’d have a decent chance getting hired as a BDR within a SaaS company with my experience? Of course I’d rather apply as an Inside Sales rep but with my lack of experience the BDR route seems the best route for me to learn and grow within the field.

a.	If so, could you point me to some online references for what to focus on cover letter/ resume wise? I’ve google searched a few and got lost with all the results suggesting different methods.

2.)	Other than glass door and career builder how have others found jobs in this field? I don’t have any connections working in this industry unfortunately so networking isn’t an option.

a.	On the topic of networking, are there are networking groups which you’d recommend in the Boston area? I plan on joining toast masters within my current company this month however I’d like to expand my network outside of the Financial Services industry. 

If there is any other information I could provide please let me know. In addition I’m sorry for being the 1000th person to ask this similar question on this subreddit, I just haven’t been able to find anything for the Boston area with the search function. Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Some background:



I'm an Australian pharmacy intern (just passed my written exam- sort of the halfway point). In my pharmacy, there's 2 interns, one who looks after the webster patients (dose administration aids packed in-pharmacy) and the other looks after the banking.



I am the intern with the most experience (7 years pre-graduation) and as such was put in charge of websters. There's roughly 150 of them and it's a reasonably high-responsibility job.


I have 2 part-time webster packers so they get the packs done. One is fantastic, easy to getalong with and very efficient. She also presents any problems she forsees in a respectful but direct manner.


The other one has been working in the pharmacy for 11 years, and is currently in second year of pharmacy at uni. From the day we met, she has had a clear issue with me, partly I'd say due to the fact that I am 5 years younger than her and an intern and partly because she doesn't want to have to run things by me when she needs to. She possibly feels like she is more highly qualified than I. As such, she is quite rude to me and snaps when I ask her to do something.
However, despite working in pharmacy for roughly 4 years less than her, I have worked in several pharmacies and helped operate/manage some smaller pharmacies whilst at uni.



She is also rude to other pharmacists- she once told a pharmacist to ""do it yourself, you have two hands"". A few of us have spoken to the boss and he's said to sort it out ourselves.
I haven't had a problem with anyone else in the pharmacy- the manager and the boss, assistants/DTs and I get along quite well- it's just her.



I'd just like some advice on how to deal/communicate with her or perhaps I need a new perspective. I feel a bit strange being ""in charge"" in this regard, especially as I feel very aware of my being younger than her. But, younger/fewer years in pharmacy aside I feel she needs to respect my role."

I'm almost into my last year of college in computer science, and am currently an intern in a large company. Twist is, I don't like my course. Don't get me wrong, I'm doing well in it but my heart is really set out for writing and esports. I just had to proceed to a science-related course or I'll risk losing my scholarship which is the only reason that I could afford a college education. I hate that in the future, I may land in some big-ass corporate job someday, but I will still hate it because that's not what I really like to do.


And this way I hate my family, too. Sure, I can drop out of college and pursue my dreams but I have the feudal thought that hey, I have to repay my parents of all the hardwork they did to put me in this place right now. So I have to do well and get a good job to get us by.


I'm also currently in my 3rd year in the student council and am hating every aspect of it. The pressure, the publicity, and everything else that goes along with it. It seems to me that it has become more of a job than a hobby and is really taking its toll on me.

My SO is also being a very annoying person. We're currently in an LDR and she annoys me by having to skype with her everytime (before I go to my internship and after). I'd like some alone time for myself, maybe playing some League or shit that actually cheers me up, but she gets angry about it so I really can't go against her.

And I hate that I can't talk to anyone about it, and seriously am considering suicide atm.

3d7k07,1,2015-07-13,Best way to go about getting a small car loan,throwawayvolvo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3d7k07/best_way_to_go_about_getting_a_small_car_loan/,"Hey PF,


I have recently come into a situation of needing a new car. Long story short, bought a car from my girlfriends dad (great relationship with the whole family, he owns a mechanic shop and got me a good deal), I bought a 2007 Nissan Sentra from him for $100 a month towards a $4500 amount (no interest). 


Today the transmission blew, easy fix right? Wrong. CVT transmission costs about $3400 to replace (and thats the shops straight price, it's normally $3900). Now due to the car having 174,600 (bought with 168k on it) miles on it, and having minor body damage (scratches and dents from previous owner, not me) I'd say the car may be worth somewhere around $5000 if it was perfectly mechanically sound and I sold it on craigslist or somewhere to that extent.


This leaves me needing to buy a new car, since I owe $3700, and it'd be $3400 to repair, I'd be $7100 into a high mileage car that isn't worth more than $5k at most.


Now my girlfriends dad is being a great guy and said he'll just take the car back, call us even, and donate it somewhere or rip out the engine etc. Which is an amazing, amazing thing. However this leaves me with the need to buy a new car.


Sadly around 16-17 I wasn't the greatest of drivers and got in two wrecks and one speeding ticket, I'm now 19 and have had one speeding ticket in the past year (I know, I know, I suck) but this means insurance is a huge player in my buying.


I am currently a full time student (IT with concentration in Sys/Sec, going into Sophmore year, gpa of 3.8ish), and work part time (25ish hours) during semesters, and during the summer I work full time. I have a great job as IT Admin and Sales rep at a paint business (started as an intern IT junior year of highschool, graduated, old main IT guy quit, got promoted (super small level IT/network/customer database and POS stuff though, not really IT Admin but they gave me the title so I'll take it) at $11 an hour, started going on paint estimates because I thought I could do alright (I'm a people person) and I did, so they said 5% of each job commission (not bad considering I get 1-3 jobs a week at $800-$5000, it varies greatly) so I make around $500-600 a week median (sometimes $350, sometimes $900) this will probably go down to $300-$500 during school time.


Being a sales rep I drive probably 100-300 miles a week (again, varies greatly) and I get reimbursed 50 cents per mile. So a good, reliable car is a big deal for me, my job and school.


Random other info, I rent an apartment that is split between me and two other roommates, my cut is about $550 a month. I spend about $600 in gas a month, and $400 in groceries/living costs. I have a 720 credit score, never been late on any payment, never been worried about job security, and I'm a pretty solid student thats pretty okay with money (not great, but I like to think I don't ridiculously waste money either).



So to the main point, my girlfriends dad has an awesome car (albeit a grandpa car), 2004 Volvo C70, 26,000 miles, driven by an old lady and its in mint condition, plus he stands behind it and knows it (which I take into a huge account considering his massive help with the sentra). He's selling it for the old lady and we got her down to $8000 out the door (originally asking $11000). However I, nor anyone I know has $8000. I have about $2200 in savings, $150 in my bank account, and $200ish in bitcoin depending on the day, I get paid weekly so I'll prolly wind up with $2500 savings and $300 in my account for this week.



Where could I get a good car loan for $8000 with a decent APR and that would give a loan for a 2004 car. My dad will co-sign with me (great credit score, makes about 85k a year) so that will help I'm sure. But I need this loan tomorrow morning, I was forced to take off work half a day today, and I took off tomorrow to try and secure everything, but I really need to be back in by Wednesday. Is there a good bank to go to or one recommended by most? I'm trying to be careful and look around but times not on my side and I feel like this is the best car I can get to best serve my needs for the next 6-8 years. I would get a cheap $1500-3000 car but I feel like with the amount of driving I do (mostly highway) I'd be fixing and replacing and breaking down more than its worth.


Any knowledge or advice would be greatly appreciated but I need it ASAP as I am currently without any kind of car at all.


Also I live around downtown Atlanta if that helps.

TL;DR I need an $8000 car loan, for a 2004 car with 26k miles. I'm a 19 year old student with not much money, and need to get the loan ASAP"

SO, I rebuilt my life, and I applied to graduate schools and got in to a very good school for MFA acting (Should point out I'm an actor...which makes life difficult....I'm aware. &lt;---not to sound douchy but so many people go OMG WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT...so trying to have that out of the way&lt;---

I don't want to do anything stupid, also don't want people to get that impression either.

I'm scared I guess, on top of being depressed feeling like a waste.

I dunno why I'm writing now. I just feel so alone and scared.

I'm leaving for the UK to visit the girlfriend (who is getting her MA over there) in 7 days, which most people would be excited about..and I just feel like I should be here working/not being a complete fuck'all of life.


...thats it.

3d7ki5,2,2015-07-13,My entire life has felt like one big fight. Writing about my thoughts.,bishop556,abuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/3d7ki5/my_entire_life_has_felt_like_one_big_fight/,"Hello, everyone. I'm really feeling down in the dumps today and I would like the opportunity to express my story. First, I know that people have had much more rough than me, but I feel I have no where else to turn to. Let's begin.

My childhood was pretty good, I would have to say. I had loving parents that sheltered me from the world. However, when I came to middle school I was bullied tremendously for three years. I was in the gifted program. I was a shy, gentle kid. Socially awkward, but I always tried to be amiable with everyone. In my classes (gifted students stay together in the same classes every year), there was a boy named Patrick who I tried to befriend on the first day of class. I thought we got along the first day, but soon after he would torment me. He would curse me out, tell me I was worthless, tell me I was a fag, that I was a gay prick that no one wanted to be around. If it was one person, I could handle it. I could have fought him, I could have defended myself. It didn't matter though as all my classmates except a select few tormented me. I remember trying to strike a conversation with one of them in 6th grade to only be told that ""just because I will talk to you doesn't mean I am your friend"". Hell, I remember the teacher joining in one time. My own science class teacher told me to stop acting ""so gay"". Everyone laughed. So, this continued for a while and it got worse and worse. I learned to stand up for myself. I got in a few fights, but it still continued. I never really knew what I did to my classmates. It got to the point that in my 8th grade dance I busted out crying to my mom, telling her that I wanted to kill myself. She soon got therapy for me, but besides this my parents were not there for me. I don't blame them, my mom's father passed away during this time, so she was drinking herself to death to cope. Oh, the times she passed out in the bathroom. So lovely.

Enter high school. Due to my trauma, I had difficulty connecting to people. I took a lot of drugs to cope. I did more or less everything, especially opiates. Opiates are wonderful things. Living in Broward Country, they sometimes were cheaper than Weed and felt 10x better. Whenever I was on them, my problems would drift away. I used to hang out a group that eventually was caught stealing guitars from one of their father's house so they could pawn it for drug money. I did not partake in this as I already knew how stupid it was. This was the breaking point for me to realize I needed to have a better life. I reflected on that if I did not leave now, I might end up in prison someday due to their idiocy. 

I had one really good friend, Alex, an illegal immigrant from Chile. He was the only one who was there for me when shit hit the fan. I remember when I doing drugs that he would tell me I was screwing up my life, that I had potential and I was making bad decisions. He was the only one who cared enough to help me when I decided to quit doing drugs. He was there for me when I tried to pick myself up from the hole I dug. I owe him more than I can ever give for believing in me.

Fast forward now, I am in college studying Astrophysics. Hell, I am having a string of good luck now. I got an internship at Harvard to do research over the summer with them. I remember walking down a quiet hallway once I heard the news that I got in and felt like crying. I came to the realization that I could make something of myself, that I prove everyone who treated me terribly that they were wrong. That I was worth living, that I was worth a damn.

It is still rough though. It leaves a lasting impression. For example, I still have difficulty talking to women. For a while, I felt a stinging pain when I would see people interact in a flirtatious manner with women. I always felt so dejected that it would lucky if a women ever saw anything in me. I know these thoughts are irrational, but after having years of experience of being told by women you are hideous and ugly it gets to you.
Overall, I am trying to love myself more. 

Thank you for listening to what I had to say. I really needed to vent today."

3d81a5,1,2015-07-14,"How do I[F30] tell one of my best friends [M28] of 10 years, who is also my boss, that I want to pursue an education resulting in quitting my job that he offered me when I was in debt.",Bossfriendthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d81a5/how_do_if30_tell_one_of_my_best_friends_m28_of_10/,"Obligatory throwaway account because I am so embarrassed by this situation and I want an outside view that is not in my circle of friends.

So I met Neil when I was in University. I met him in my second year and he was also in his second year. Neil was two years younger than me. Our mutual friend introduced us when we had to study for a brutal Neurology. Neil is really smart and he is super friendly. He is super goofy. When I met him he was this geeky guy, skinny and just plain friendly.

My relationship with Neil for the most part has been strictly Platonic. He has joked the only reason we are friends because I am good eye candy. I loved his humor and the fact that he never took shit from me. These past ten years has been him being the best guy friend a girl can ask for. To highlight our relationship, I want you guys to know how it developed on why this is such an important issue. All this time I had an SO who is great and always supportive. He is nothing like Neil who is decisive and has borne leader qualities. My SO is laid back and just super supportive of every decision I make. Sorry for the length.

When I first met Neil, I asked him if he could tutor me in the neurology. He said yes, and with that we spent a lot of time. We also spent time talking about things we had in common, things we didn’t have in common. When he asked what I wanted to do, my dream has always been to become a doctor. When I asked him what he wanted, he said, “I don’t really care about money or being wealthy or famous. I care about power” And we left at that. I never really asked him what he meant but I admired his ambition and stuff. 

After that we became close friends. He was there when my cat died, came to my graduation and was overall the best friend I could have as I could confide to him and know that he will never tell anyone. He also went through dramatic changes. Over the years he worked out a lot, did power lifting tournaments, ice hockey. After 4 years being his friend, we went to the beach and I noticed he had a model rugged body. I guess I always knew he was fit but honestly, I never knew it was that much. A lot of my friends were interested in Neil and he just brushed them off because he was dating other girls at that time. 

Around this time, he told me he got into the best medical school in the west and he is taking the program. I went with his family and his other best friends to his ceremonies. We spent a whole two weeks just partying and getting to know city. Whenever I was in town, he was always letting me stay over no matter if he had exams or clinical. 

During Med school though we had lost our daily contact. I was pretty sad that he was so busy but I chalked it up. While he was there I was redoing a couple of courses to get a better mark and also taking extra courses to have a backup for med school. I also took the MCAT twice and did poorly the first time but better the second time although not enough. When I got rejected to Med school I was super sad, luckily Neil was back and he spent a lot of time for me, helping me out with my courses and just being an awesome friend by taking me out.

After Neil finished his internship he landed a really high paying job that literally paid about 3 times more than both my SO and I. Neil’s father retired shortly after from his job and transferred all his properties into Neil’s name. Neil than gave his two of those properties after renovating them to his sisters (both married) but he still had a couple left that he had to manage. After a year at his job, Neil purchased a couple of downtown, high-end, apartments. I didn’t even know why he was doing it since he had a really nice apartment close to the hospital he worked at anyway. 

Then one day Neil calls me up and asks he wants to have a meeting with me. At this point I have not seen Neil in person for 1.5 years since he has been so busy with work and him being in another state. I was super excited that I will be seeing him outside of our texting and our monthly Skype conversations. So I see Neil and we have a great time at a comedy show with dinner. It was really fun and he looked SOOO professionally. He was wearing an expensive suit, all those years working out had paid dividends. A lot of girls were staring at him and he just didn’t care when they approached. Literally threw the papers out with the numbers on them. 

At our reunion, we went back to my place and my SO was home from work. Neil talked to him about miscellaneous life stuff and then sat both of us down to talk. Neil offered me a job managing all his properties as he was renting out the two houses and using AirBnB for the apartments. He gave me a package of papers of how I would be getting paid and such, the budget, legal details, and such. He knew my SO and I were having trouble getting ourselves off the ground since we moved out. After he left, my SO and I talked about it and we decided to take the job which he made sure that I got a lawyer to look at the contract so that I am protected and that his lawyer was doing his job properly too. Side note: Neil also got me a pre-nup when I married my SO, although my SO was unhappy, Neil said I needed to protect myself and my family’s assets. 

I have been working for Neil three years now and I have to say I love this type of job. I like wearing business causal outfits and I love the travelling I have to do. I get paid about (3 times more than my previous job) 60k a year and the last three years Neil added three more properties each year since I have been making profits. What I do is I manage each property, make sure the cleaning is done on time, the furniture is tip top, screen potential renters and users. Overall I love that I can take my job with me on my laptop and phone while travelling to the places. Neil bought three extra properties in high populated, tourist destination areas. So I have to travel a lot from my home city to the properties. 

Neil as a businessman and as my best friend has been great the last three years. When we talk business it is only business. Every time I am at his house for a party or we are just getting together for dinner, he never mentions the job once. His parents practically treat me like family and I am the Godmother to his Daughter who I absolutely adore. His wife loves talking to me as she loves our stories and always asks me for advice for things to buy Neil. 

But while all this I have been upgrading my courses, and I took the MCAT one last time last year and did really well. I applied for some universities and I got into my dream med school. I never told Neil about this because I don’t want him to be mad at me for ditching this job just to pursue my dream. I do love this job but I also always wanted to go to med School.  But I am worried that by resigning his position I will hurt our relationship.  I might not even like be a doctor and I would love to have this job as a backup. Also, since I have taken this job, my personal life with my SO has been great, I have paid off all my student loans, insurance and finance is not an issue, and all in all this job is super secure and pays well. While if I pursue med school, I will have to quit making us single income household and also holding off on having a family.  So I am here for your advice, what do you think I should do and how should I approach Neil?

**tl;dr**: I got accepted to my dream med school. I want to pursue but will end up quitting my job. My boss is my best friend of 10 years who offered me the job when my SO and I were having trouble laying out a foundation for ourselves. Should I become a doctor and how should I approach my awesome best friend?"

3d8du5,29,2015-07-14,"I've had a horrible day. Please send hugs. (really long, sorry)",aerydotcalm,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3d8du5/ive_had_a_horrible_day_please_send_hugs_really/,"So. I woke up this morning nervous. The trunk of my car was open, which may have been an accident, but it made me worried because it's a brand new car. I didn't have anything valuable in there, but my god if something happened to it, I would feel horrible. My boyfriend bought it after we sold my old neon because it was falling apart and gave me the ownership of it.

Then this afternoon I had an intake appointment to start some weekly counseling. Last time I did counseling sessions was before I was diagnosed and the student counselor didn't listen to me at all. I explained I was having panic attacks and could barely leave the house, and he just wanted to talk about my family and history instead of giving me intervention help. For today, I showed up early, filled out a form, then waited. And waited. 20 minutes after my appointment, she finally comes out, even though I filled out the paperwork 30 minutes before the appointment started so I was on time and ready. So I had the time waiting to think of every worst case scenario that could happen. She will think that I'm being dramatic, she won't believe that I have anxiety, she will tell me that the wait list will be too long and I won't be in until school starts even though I'm trying to get some tools before school starts. Well. The appointment starts, and I KNOW she was just doing her job, but I felt interrogated and that I had to do more than just explain my anxiety, I felt like I had to justify and defend it. I KNOW I was oversensitive because of being nervous and snowballing/worst case scenario freaking before the appointment. I felt like the intake counselor I had last time was much softer, more empathetic and understanding. I felt like this counselor was more like a job interview - like if she doesn't like me, I won't get counseling, even though I have 6 more sessions free with my degree. When it came time to the ""male or female counselor?"" question, I said I didn't care either way, BUT I wanted to make sure that I didn't get a student this time. I talked about it with my psychiatrist last week and he said it's totally within my right to ask for a fully registered psychologist for a counselor. Did I mention this intake counselor was an intern? As soon as I said that, it was like I offended her. She started defending the students and the need for openness with having a student counselor. I said that I understand (I'm a psych student myself hoping to go down that road!!), but I'd feel more comfortable with someone who has more hours under their belt. Then she asked me about interns instead of students. At that point I just basically said whatever and I just wanted to leave. She had to ask me if I was okay with video taping (I did it last time, it's just pointed on the counselor, only my voice is included in the tape). I told her not at this time because I think I'd be more worried about what I was saying than being honest. Well THAT was the wrong answer and she gave me a speech about how it really helps them and it doesn't make it worthwhile to have a client who refuses videotaping. I wanted to cry. Eventually I was able to leave, and I ended up in tears in my car. 

Not long after I left, I got a call from my parents saying that my grandparents' home had been broken into. They left for an hour and someone or a group of people had kicked down the door, stole several family heirlooms, my great grandmother's jewelry, the entire Swarovski crystal collection with some passed down from my great grandmother after she passed away. These figurines have HUGE history in our lives. As kids we would pick out our favourites and we would stare at them totally amazed at how beautiful they are. My grandfather's professional camera was taken. His watch. Some cash he had in his drawer. They opened my grandmother's clarinet and left it in pieces on the floor. Just absolutely heartbreaking. I ended up crying again because of my connection to many of the things as I was very close with my great grandmother, but was next in line after my grandmother to receive many of these sentimental pieces. Then I realized that their door was locked, kicked in and everything was gone within the hour that they had left the house. Someone had to have been watching their house. It's now 2:30am and I cannot sleep because I'm terrified that it could happen to me. At least 2 other instances in their area (not far from me) have been reported this week. I have dogs, which is a good thing, but that doesn't stop someone from watching your routine. I'm terrified and panicking.

If that wasn't enough, on my nightly walk with my two dogs and boyfriend, our newest rescue who had recently just had surgery to remove porcupine quills got loose of my grasp and chased a rabbit. We knew she loved them, but she had never been so aggressive with wanting to chase one before. She chased it all around the field and it was not a ""hey this is a lot of fun!"" chase, it was a ""you look like dinner"" chase. The rabbit lead her across a fairly busy road (keep in mind, it was almost 11pm when we were out and mostly dark except for street lights and she is a dark GSD/Black Lab X), where a car nearly hit her. I was a mess. I had grabbed our other dog's leash from my boyfriend immediately as she started running and he chased after her. Then I ended up kneeling in the grass, completely hyperventilating and crying because I thought I was about to lose my dog. Even now I'm getting really worked up. My boyfriend was able to tackle her finally and everyone is okay, including the bunny. Every time I start thinking about how close I was to losing this silly, amazing dog I feel like I'm going to fall apart. I spend more time with my dogs than I do any other person and they mean the world to me. They are my rocks, they calm me down when I am losing it with hugs, kisses and resting their heads on my lap. I can't imagine losing one.

I'm sorry for the long post, I guess I just needed to rant and beg for empathy. You have all been so wonderful before, I could really use you now."
3d8i6u,1,2015-07-14,I'm in way too deep with lies,lyingtoeveryone,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3d8i6u/im_in_way_too_deep_with_lies/,"I don't know what the hell happened. Six months ago I was on the cusp of graduating college in a field that I'm deeply passionate about, all lined up with my first job offer, and madly in love with my girlfriend. Now, its all slipping away. This is going to be long, so I'll add a tl;dr at the end for those of you who, like myself, wouldn't bother reading this long-winded melt down. 

Just to help frame this, I'll give you a quick personal history. I was a terrible student my whole life. When I graduated high school, I was accepted to a large university based solely on my ACT score (~2/5 GPA, and bottom 25% of my class). I didn't change overnight like I thought I could, and failed out after one semester. I then went on to fail out of community college. Somewhere in there, I got drunk with my best friend one night and we decided to join the Marine Corps infantry. Went to boot camp, got to my unit, married a girl I met in college, deployed to Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, needed combat-replacements, tough deployments, and finally discharged. This was my wake up call. I enrolled back in community college, got all A's and transferred to one of the top 5 universities for computer engineering.

I think this is about the time things start to fall apart.

My wife gave up a job in a major city and moved to a small college town with me. She resented me for not working, as all of her friends (and everyone else our age) were getting jobs and starting their lives. My grades start slipping. I was an asshole and was insensitive to the sacrifices she was making for me. We grew apart. She found comfort in a co-worker. I find very damming fb and text messages. People change a lot between 20 and 30, and our differences were great enough already, that I decide to just use this opportunity to get a divorce.

Throughout this, I am still infatuated with the subjects I am studying, but I never took the time to develop proper study habits. My grades are now in free fall. I move in with a few good friends during the divorce, and eventually move in to my own place. While living there, I meet a girl. We fall for each other, hard. Very explosive relationship, but we manage to survive, and are better for it. At some point I adopt my neighbor's cat and the little kitty and I become best friends. Living by myself, I start missing class, and falling in to habits I had when I failed out of college at 18. I am holding on by a thread. Somehow I land an internship at a large company last summer and crush it. They offer me a position the week that I got back to school.

All I had to do was finish my degree and I would be on with my life. Instead, I slipped into what I assume was a mildly depressive state. I didn't go to class, I bombed exams, I felt pinned to my couch and watched myself fall apart. I went to advising. Ever since I was young kid, I realized that I was graced with aptitude for winning people over with charm, charisma, etc. It has served as a horrible source of positive reinforcement. Being able to talk my way through just about anything is great when times are good, but it won't earn me a degree. I was able to stay in the college, and got the company to extend the job offer until the summer. Again, I bailed myself out, but this time I am not holding up my end.

I've always prided myself on my honesty, but at one point I lied to my girlfriend about my status in school, and then the flood gates opened up. I failed 2 out of 3 of my classes last semester, and am now just 2 classes from a degree. I am enrolled in one online class that ends on Friday (which i've only started the first chapter). I'm enrolled in the other course at community college, but I have yet to attend a single class and its already over half way through. I am signing a lease tomorrow with my girlfriend for an apartment near the company that has offered me work. The company was gracious enough to let me work as an intern until I finish my degree ""at the end of summer"" (which is not going to happen). But she is in the dark about all of this, and I feel horrible. I love her so deeply, and she has been an angel through these messed up times. She has been patient with me, given up opportunities in order to move with me, and I've betrayed her trust. And I don't know what to tell either of them. I feel like coming clean could be the last straw for her, and I honestly wouldn't blame her. I truly believe that this will all blow over in time, but I can't expect her to feel the same. I am so wrapped up in deceit and guilt, its making me physically nauseous. I don't know what the fuck to do, and I am terrified that its all going to come crashing down soon. 

About a month ago, my kitty bitty ran away. I just want her here with me. 

I'm scared shitless, and for the first time in a long time, I don't really see a clear route out of this mess I've created. 

tl;dr - Got job offer contingent on a degree. Now I am wrapped up in my own lies to the company and to my amazing girlfriend about being able to get the degree by the end of summer. My kitty ran away, and I could really use her little furry face for some comfort right now.

Advice welcome. Thanks all."

3d922o,490,2015-07-14,'13 Grad 50K Student Loans Paid Off (23 Months),PFThrowawaySLoans,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3d922o/13_grad_50k_student_loans_paid_off_23_months/,"Hello PF! (Using a throwaway since I'll include all my financial info) I (24/m) wanted to tell my story to the community that's helped me dig out early so other recent grads (and students) can get started on the right path early!

I graduated in 2013 with $50,000 in student loan debt with a BS in Mechanical engineering. I attended a private college for 5 years which includes 3 mandatory 6-month paid internships. I felt these required work periods were crucial in shaping my immediate post-graduate opportunities. I would highly suggest pursuing several summer internships if this is not built into your university's program. I had some help from my parents (neither are college grads, they had saved approx 30k in my college fund) and some academic scholarships which required me to keep above a 3.0 GPA. 

I took a leap of faith and moved 250 miles from home to a state where I had no friends or family for my first job making $64k. This gave me a really big shovel to dig myself out with, I know. I was hired full-time by the 3rd company I worked for while I was still in school. It is a fortune 500 company. 6 months after I started, the site went through a major restructuring and my schedule was changed from M-F 8-5 to a rotating 12 hour shift schedule. Although this took away half my weekends and forced me to work days and nights, I was eligible for shift premium pay (approx $500 per month) in addition to regular overtime pay (approx $450 per 12h shift covered). I worked like a madman and threw everything I made at my student loans.

I felt very burnt out after a year of shift work and overtime so I applied for a promotion to a daylight position. This increased my salary to 73k but I am no longer eligible for OT or shift premium pay, so I am making a little less overall than when I was on shift.

My current budget looks like this:

Monthly Take Home - 4000

Total Monthly Expenses - 1688

Rent - 500 (live with GF)

Internet - 40

Cell - 70

Car payment (275) 9k left @ 2.45%

Car Insurance - 70

Food - ~500

Gasoline - 100

Electricity - 125

I'm still mostly living like a college student. I don't make many purchases over $100 and we don't take extravagant vacations. I see my 20-something coworkers buying BMWs, renting $1500/month apartments, and having 30K weddings. I would like some of these things eventually, but I am striving to be in a place where I can pay cash for a wedding, cash for future cars, and live within my means. 

This year I hope to pay off the rest of my car note - 2012 Mazda3 that I bought new before graduation and fully fund my Roth IRA. I have always put 6% into my company's 401(k) which gives me the entire match. In the next couple of years I want to build a ~60K downpayment for our next house. I feel like too many people my age, good careers or not, are putting the cart before the horse and are putting themselves in huge holes before they're even 25. 

tl;dr: Paid off 50K in 2 years by working my ass off, living like a college student, and living well below my means

But since I'm just a graduate with an internship at Morgan Stanley and level 2 CFA candidacy and pretty good at math. I thought of the MFE route. Since typically an internship in finance would cut it 
 And plus my coding experience would help me get a good university in this field. I was hoping to get a MFE degree work as an analyst/associate for a few years. And then plan my MBA in finance to get into IB ?

Enlightened bankers will this approach land me a job in IB? Or there is another route to it. I'm open to suggestion"
3d97vr,3,2015-07-14,How to deal with in my in laws?,_Fap_Dragon_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3d97vr/how_to_deal_with_in_my_in_laws/,"So here's a bit of background. My wife (female) and I (male) are both 23 and have been married for about 2 months. We live in the US. She graduated this past spring. I graduated a year ago and have been working for just under a year. I make good enough money (not great) and we are pretty secure financially even without her working.

We live on the opposite side of the country from her parents (mine too, but that's not really relevant). Her parents paid for our wedding - partly out of generosity, but also as a way of controlling it (evidenced when we said we didn't like something and they came back with, ""well, we're paying for it"" - please note that we were requesting to NOT have something, this making the wedding less expensive).

Anyhow, my wife's parents bought her a car when she was 16. When I moved cross country, they offered to give me one of their old cars (newer and more reliable than the car I had) so that I could drive and not have to worry. 

I accepted, as it really helped me out and I was very grateful. The deal was that they would give us that car as an early wedding gift. Then, after she graduated and moved to where I am, they would take back ""her"" car. I use quotes because it was NOT her car. Her parents bought it. It was registered in their names. It was their car that they were letting her drive during college so she could go home.

Anyhow. Prior to the wedding, they said we ""needed"" the money, so they would sell that car and give us the money. I declined and said that money should go towards the wedding since they already gave us a car and we did not NEED the money. I found that statement very disrespectful and insulting.

Anyhow, they dropped it and it didn't come up again. That is, until a few weeks after the wedding, when they told her they were working on selling her car and would be sending her the money. She declined and said she wouldn't accept the money since it wasn't her car. Not to mention they had already given us a car, paid for our wedding, AND given us a $1000 wedding check.

Again, they dropped the subject and we thought it was over. This morning, we woke up to her having an extra $2000 in her bank account - her parents sold the car, then snuck the money into her account, KNOWING that we didn't feel comfortable accepting it (otherwise, why wouldn't they have sent a check? Or told us they were going to deposit the money?)


I find the entire thing extremely insulting, since it clearly stems from them believing I am incapable of providing for their daughter (them saying we ""need"" that money - they don't know my fucking finances, nor should they).

I also find it worrisome, knowing how much they want to control their children. When my wife was 21, she told them she applied for an internship 4 hours away and they said no (Wtf. She wasn't asking, she was stating). 

Her dad told me that I ""had"" to buy her a car as soon as she got here. I said no, we weren't going to buy a second car until she has a job, there's no reason. I was told that I didn't know what I was talking about and that she ""needed"" a car even if she wasn't working. Which is odd, since her and I agreed it was silly to by a second car now, just for it to sit in the parking lot.


I don't want the money, because I don't want them holding it over our heads. Her parents aren't exactly in amazing financial shape (maybe because they throw around money like this?). Normally, that wouldn't be my concern, except they talk about how they expect their kids to take care of them when they're old.

That's cool, except for the fact that they should be able to take care of themselves. But they won't be able to, because they'd prefer to throw money around rather than save for retirement. So I'll be on the hook for their retirement, which in turn will erase any chance I have at retirement because I'll be too broke from supporting them.

So basically, what do we do with the money? Obviously, I want them to take it back, but based on how things have played out thus far, I don't see that happening. I could write a check, but they'd never cash it.

My wife says she will call them today, but I don't know how effective that will be. I'd like to tell them either they take the money back, or we're writing a check to st judes.


TL;DR: in laws secretly deposited money we repeatedly declined in order to hold it over our heads forever."
3d9m2z,14,2015-07-14,It's time for a change....,CharlesClutcherson,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3d9m2z/its_time_for_a_change/,"Drank heavily by myself last night even though I had to be at work early this morning. Woke up this morning at the time I was supposed to be in for work. As usual when I drink heavily to the point where I black out, I pissed myself. I couldn't find my glasses or my phone which made me even later for work. Ended up finding both out on my front porch. From what I gathered it seems like I passed out on my front porch and somehow my drunken blacked out self decided to go inside. Left my front door completely unlocked all night. I have no idea if my roommates know what happened. I'm guessing not since I slept on the couch and not my bed. Plus, the door being unlocked. I drunk dialed my best friend last night and gave him the usual ""I'm opening up to you about stuff that is going on in my life because I can only talk about my feelings when I'm smashed"" talk. He was worried because I passed out while talking to him. Not at all proud about my actions last night.

I have a history of drug abuse but was able to over come my pill addiction and haven't had any for 6 years now. However, I have just replaced one substance with another. I drink by myself a lot. Not just when I'm sad, if I have extra money chances are I'm picking up a sixer or some tall boys. I've tried AA a couple times and it just doesn't seem for me. I think the program is great but I just have a hard time trusting the people I've met at the meetings.

I need a change. I'm sick of waking up without knowing what happened or if I offended someone. I'm sick of leaving parties early in the morning and praying that no one saw that I pissed myself. I'm sick of going strong for a couple weeks and then hitting the bottle again because I think ""It's ok, just be responsible."" I've done some pretty dumb stuff while heavily intoxicated. I'm sick of being the guy at parties that always flips out or does something really stupid. My family is worried, I know this. I'm sick of letting them down with failing to stay sober. 

I'm not trying to play the pity card. I'm sick of only feeling this way for so long and returning to my usual shenanigans. I'm in my mid-twenties and I feel like if I don't get a handle on this now...I never will. I have a good job and am currently going to school. I even have an internship. I always tell myself I don't have a problem and support it with my accomplishments. It's quite pathetic and I realize it.

I'm sick of letting people who care about me down...and most importantly, myself. I'm sorry for the rambling but I just needed to get this off my chest. I know have a problem and I don't know why I just can't dedicate myself to stop drinking. 

EDIT: After posting this, I read some other posts and joined the IRC chat. Thank you everyone for the kind words and advice. Today is Day 1!"
3d9m3i,1,2015-07-14,He did not even react! Just a rant.,[deleted],BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/3d9m3i/he_did_not_even_react_just_a_rant/,"Juuuust a rant about the guy I'd been dating for 5 months. I thought he was a super cool, super nice guy, and we got along well for the first few months as we were both super busy. As we went along we had all these big plans that we were gonna do together and I got really excited that he wanted to experience all these things with me!


Cue to around a month and a half ago, when I had to move temporarily to another state for an internship. We never texted much while we were in the same city, but it was worse when we were entire states apart. I started to feel neglected and felt like I wasn't actually in a relationship. I spoke to him a lot of times about it, how communication was important and that I needed to feel like he cared about me even through something as simple as a ""hey babe, I love you!"" text.


Last week he did not contact me at all. The only contact we had was me calling him up for 2 minutes to say that I loved him and was thinking about him. He was completely absent during the weekend. I got extremely frustrated and decided to break it off. He simply wasn't showing enough interest in me, and brushed off my upset texts.

He called later that night, and I broke it off, saying that it wasn't working and that I can't do this anymore. I don't like feeling like I'm 0 priority in his life. He simply said ""ok"". There was no fight, no argument, no apologies, nothing.


I'm regretting it now and want him back, but part of me is saying that nothing will change. Do I really want to fight for a relationship entirely by myself?

I graduated with a 3.5 GPA and have research experience for a year in a chemistry lab but no internships or other types of industry experience. 

I was planning to find a job in industry before deciding if (and also where/for what) I want to pursue a masters or PhD. So far, I have applied to several different types of jobs (including ones where a bachelors isn't even explicitly required) and haven't received so much as a call back. It seems every entry level science based job is only looking for biologists and chemists. Or I investigate a posted ""entry level"" position only to discover they mean entry level for recent Masters/PhD grads. 

Needless to say, it's really starting to get to me. I have to start paying back student loans in a few months after my grace period ends and need a job to do so. I'm getting really anxious and depressed over all of this, the thought of interest piling up on my already sizable student loans while I continue to be unemployed makes me want to hang myself. I feel like I just wasted 4 years and a lot of money for absolutely nothing. It feels like shit.

Do I need to just start applying to graduate schools? I still have no idea what I would want to go for other than knowing I don't want to go for pure physics. I was thinking about materials science, some type of engineering, or computer science mainly.

If you are a recent physics bachelors grad who found employment, either in a science industry or otherwise, what did you do to figure it out? "

We had been dating 7 months prior to moving in together and had known each other basically since preschool. 
About a month and a half ago she received news that she had received a  clinical internship out of town that she was super excited about, she wants to be a doctor. So as we were discussing this she  starts to  tell me how she cant be fair to me in the relationship and that I put in so much work and she cannot hope to reciprocate the work. I tell her this is fine I understand that this dream that you have had is super important  to you and I back you up fully.

So to understand something about my girlfriend, Channelle, she has projects going on all the time as of right now she has  this clerical internship, she has a research project required for it, she has to teach a class for it, she is studying for her MCAT, she is living in a new city, she has me, and she is  stressed out about  things back here in our town such as a premed club she runs, she works for a professor doing research, she has a normal job, and not to mention upcoming classes. In other words she is super stressed out.

Well a few weeks ago she managed to come home for a  long weekend and we got into a discussion when I asked her  how things were going. She was super excited about the internship, she absolutely loves it the only thing is she is insanely stressed she works 14 hour days at the clinic and has  to  study for her MCAT. She then proceeds to tell me that she has started to lose feelings for me ever since we moved in together  about 3 and a half months ago and that she thought at first that it was just premove in jitters, after quite a long  time of talking and many tears she manages to tell me that we can wait until after she  finishes her  internship and then we can  try and work things out.

Well yesterday was hard for me, I recently broke my hand at work and can no longer work which means  long days of sitting around doing absolutely nothing at the house, Im super depressed and sad and hadnt heard from her in two days. I  send her  a long text explaining that I miss her  and love her and   would really appreciate just getting a text saying hey miss you every day or something along the lines of that because it would mean the world to me.
It doesn't go over well she tells me that she is working  14 hour days she inst near her  phone half the day it will be 10 times worse over the next few years as she tries to become a doctor and if I'm unhappy that maybe we shouldn't be together. She  tells me that maybe I dont think about what she needs and to be honest she never tells me Im there 100 percent to support her. 

Later that night I text her and apologize for bringing this up I know she is super busy and super stressed out and that I love her and she proceeds to say that she she doesnt think it is appropriate for her to say it back.
I dont know what to do she will be gone for another 3 weeks and in that time who knows if I will still have my girlfriend or not. She is  my  first real girlfriend I have had maybe thats making it hard for me to give up but I hate to give up on anyone I care about especially someone as special as she is.

Reddit help me please.

__TLDR__: Girlfriend is super stressed out and says she started to lose her love for me about 3 and half months ago. I dont know what to do to win her back or how to move on helppppppp.

I started collecting coins when I was about 7 years old, and remember getting my first ""valuable"" (for a 7 year old boy at least) coin from my uncle one christmas. It was a silver eagle. I collected all the old U.S coins I could find as well as some foreign coins up until about 12 years old, then really fell off of the hobby. I had a pretty decent collection for a 12 year old kid who didn't inherit any coins, but looking back, it's not as large as I remembered. Just recently, I've landed a pretty nice internship and finally have the money to invest into the hobby again. It's time to pick a coin to specialize in, and try to complete my first real set.

Naturally, I think the silver eagles would be a great choice. I love the look, enjoy the fact that they're also a silver investment, and that coin is the single reason I ever started collecting.

So far I have a 1994, 1996, 2001, 2002, 2004 and I just ordered 15 2015's (going to keep one or 2, but mostly as a silver investment since I got them for 19 a piece)

I understand that 1996 and 1994 have the lowest mintages, which is why I sprung on them first, but how should I approach collecting the rest now?

Does anyone with expertise in this series have any advice? Best places to find coins? What minimum grading should I be looking for? 

Any help is appreciated. "

I'm a 22 year old, 2015 graduate with a B.A. in Business Administration and Political Economy from a small private liberal arts college. I have about 41,000$ in federal loans. I'm in grace with estimated 450$ a month payments starting in November. I recently started a 6 month internship where I receive full benefits. I earn 15$ an hour and usually work about 45 hours a week. 

Four weeks ago I ended up in the ER, since my health insurance is a high deductible I owe 2100 for this visit. I ended up having to get a tooth pulled, and am planning on getting an implant in 6 months. My dentist told me they average around 3500$ which I will need to save up before the procedure. I also have 5 cavities (about 300$) and all of my wisdom teeth (to be removed) to have taken care of in the next few months. 

My car is a 2006 Subaru with 165,000 miles, no payments. The insurance is 680$ (in Sept and March). 

Even though my debt seems manageable I get kinda overwhelmed by it at times as it just seems like it just keeps growing. I'll break down all my financials below for you so you can get a good idea of my situation. I'm just hoping for some advice on how to work through all of this while also trying to enjoy life. Sometimes it seems as if my only option is to just hole up in my house until everything is paid off.

Now I'm back and everything is bad again**

* *June 2013 - June 2014*
In 2011, I got into a college and met a lot of friends. In June 2013, I decided to change my course (from Biomedical Sciences to Pharmacy) and went to a new uni. I got into classes from the middle of the course and almost didn't make any friends.

I was also dealing with a bad internship at that time and waking up early, not having time for friends, actually not having any new friend made me incredible depressed. I thought about killing myself SEVERAL times and the only reason I didn't do it was because I spent all my time sleeping, taking sleeping pills.

I like my family but I hate my sister. She is a narcissist, evil, egocentric girl and takes all my family money. I don't know how to deal with her.

I hate to live by myself at that time, nothing could cheer me up and I wanted to cry all the time and sleep. I was seriously depressed but never gone to a doctor because I was also ashamed and didn't want to tell my family about it.

* *June 2014 - June 2015*
I did a study abroad year to Australia and had to life by myself. I end up living with girls I liked, had good times and met a guy which is simply the most amazing ever. We spend 5 months together and those were the best of this year, I had company all the time, I liked my uni and had a good routine.

* **July 2015**
Now I'm back and I'm alone again, spending time with my family in a city where I stay almost all time at home, in a countryside (without Internet sometimes for hours). I was trying to choose my units at my home unit but there is a pre-requisit system which is only allowing me to choose 5 units when I want to do at least 8, so I can finish my course as soon as possible.
My boyfriend is in a city which is 4 hours by plane away from me and I don't know when we're going to meet.

I truly don't know how to cope with all these problems and have a happy life again. I don't see a bright future where I don't have my push myself to the limit to be happy again.

3dasjj,3,2015-07-14,My quarter-life crisis: How do I decide what next steps to take in life when nothing sounds interesting?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3dasjj/my_quarterlife_crisis_how_do_i_decide_what_next/,"So here's my story:

Growing up, I was the stereotypical overachiever/perfectionist/nerd type. In high school, I became very interested in environmental issues so I decided to major in Biology/Environmental Science in college. I guess I wanted to save the world and whatnot. Fast forward to an internship after my sophomore year, and that's what started the disillusionment. I hated my job, and I started to hate the entire environmental field for a variety of reasons: the low pay, the feeling as if you can't change anything, the apathy, and the stigma of being ""an environmentalist,"" among many other reasons. Add in a long-distance relationship with someone who never even visited me and living by myself in an apartment, I lost it. 

Doctors diagnosed me as a ""highly sensitive person"" with depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. I went through about 5 medications my first semester of my junior year, all of them either giving me crazy side effects (think bruising all over my body) or simply not working. I tried some therapy as well, and most of it would end with the therapist asking me what I wanted to do if I could switch fields and me responding with, ""Honestly, nothing sounds interesting anymore."" I stopped medications and therapy cold turkey around Christmas time. I moved back home with my parents and commuted to classes (many of which I skipped).

Second semester of junior year went slightly better. I was able to deal with my classes better (all A's), I broke up with my boyfriend, and I mostly went about each day trying not to deal with anything that would set me off.

Fast forward to now, the summer before my senior year, and the stress has been worse than ever. I thought of switching to a new program that just started at my school - Environmental Engineering - to give me better job prospects, but I'm still afraid of being trapped in consulting/permitting/compliance work. Since I have no clear goal to work towards, I have very little motivation, and as a result, extremely low self esteem. Relationships have become empty to me; I feel almost nothing if a guy shows interest in me, and have even developed a ""hook up"" type relationship with my ex, something my former self would never have done. I feel very numb, lost, and hopeless. Any others having a difficult time figuring out where they fit in life? Support/advice/encouragement is greatly appreciated.

Although I've been a heavy user of the internet &amp; various computer platforms everyday since probably 1992, I don't have any official, hands-on tech-based job experience to speak of and I'm looking to change careers into something tech-related. I'm not 100% decided on which aspect of it I want to focus on for a career path yet but I'm leaning towards cybersecurity and doing my best to soak it all in (I know the odds are stacked against me.) I know I'll need at minimum some certifications to get my foot in the door for an internship and eventual job. 

My question is: do I need to begin with the A+ certification if my goal is cybersecurity? I feel like I could use the basic training inherent in the A+ but if it's more worth my time to jump into Sec+ or Network+, or something else (as has been suggested to me) I'd rather do that and use my time efficiently. I already have the A+ and Security+ study guides but have not yet scratched the surface of either. 

[edit: (as mentioned below) I may need to relocate to a different city next year which may force me into searching for an entry-level ""computer job"", so I was wondering if I'd have a chance at something like that with whatever I've learned in school so far and Security+ or Network+ materials. I'd be more than happy to find something entry-level that doesn't necessitate repairing computers, if that even exists]

Anything else I should be focusing on? (I'm not much of a programmer yet either except for an intro C++ course I took.)

Any input would be appreciated. Lots of variables and I just want to make sure I'm investing my time and efforts wisely. Thanks!"
3db6tb,2,2015-07-14,Absolutely frustrated with trying to relocate to Dubai. Advice?,xandrosss,dubai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/3db6tb/absolutely_frustrated_with_trying_to_relocate_to/,"So, I've visited Dubai twice, once during Ramadan and once during the regular time of year. I have friends there who moved there from my country and I've got to admit, I've fallen totally in love with this city. It's a hidden jewel.

I truly admire the UAE's passion, pride and ambition. I had an amazing time with my friends and for the first time in memory, I was really sad to return to my home country. 

It's not big and sprawling like NYC yet at the same time it's huge. The malls are out of this world, the transit system is super clean, convenient and amazingly useful, taxis are literally every where you look at any time of the day and I cannot get over how safe I felt while I walked about at 1am just exploring downtown Dubai and the beautiful Marina district. The cost of living isn't that bad and the weather doesn't bother me at all. 

Professionally, it's also a nice location as there are countless Fortune 500 and other exciting local companies like Emaar to work for who offer opportunities that simply aren't available elsewhere. 

Emotions aside I made up my mind that I will relocate as it will be a huge boost for me professionally for my career and financially as well as I'm young, single and unmarried and I ought to take advantage of that. 

I've been trying feverishly since October 2014 to get a job that provides Visa, proper housing (not like the camps for construction workers with shared bedroom, no AC etc) with a minimum of $7000AED per month. 

My work experience background is academic, government-related administration with a hint of IT and HR and marketing/sales. I presently work in the government sector. 

I spent more time as a full time student, as jobs are hard to come by where I'm from anyway. I have a BSc and a MSc in Business and I'm currently working on a few professional certs. 

Is it simply impossible for me to get a good job in Dubai? Should I just add some years of work experience before seriously attempting it? 

I'm cognizant of the fact that there is massive competition in the job market from workers of neighbouring countries who are willing to accept lower wages. I also realized that there are hardly any ""starting"" or junior level jobs where the company will accept ""any combination of education and experience"". 

I've been hitting monster, LinkedIn, bayt, dubizzle, gulfrecruiter, indeed nadia and numerous other uae based job sites pretty hard every single day. Also registered with a few recruitment companies and made personal contact to no avail. It's incredibly frustrating and it makes me wonder if I'm just trapped here. 

What advice can you give me? Should I have cold-visited companies while I was there as a tourist and just spam as many walk-in interviews as possible? I'm even willing to be an intern if that's what it takes to get a foot in the door, but even that seems out of my reach.

3dbgh3,210,2015-07-14,Help a deserving Man U fan,dinonsoul,reddevils,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/3dbgh3/help_a_deserving_man_u_fan/,"Posting on behalf of a friend for her husband and outstanding man. Please give this story a chance and help a dream come true. 

""Dear Manchester United,

My name is Alexi and my husband and I are going to be at the Man U game in Seattle this Friday night (7/17). I'm trying everything I can possibly think of and I'm not sure who I should contact, but I have a special request: My husband has loved Manchester United for his entire life. He is a remarkable young man who gets up as early as necessary to watch the team play on TV and has spent countless hours watching highlights on YouTube. He even played on an indoor soccer team of the name Man-chest-hair United. He really loves you guys. I know this is asking a lot, but if there were any way he could meet the team this Friday, I would be forever grateful. If his devotion to the team is not enough for this request to be met, please read about why I believe he deserves this once in a lifetime opportunity. I promise it will only take a few, short minutes of your time.

At 16 years old, I started showing symptoms that went undiagnosed for months. After many tests, procedures, and hospital visits, I was diagnosed with Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis, Endometriosis, and Ulcerative Colitis (Neil has also informed me that a former Man U player, Darren Fletcher, is also a fighter of Ulcerative Colitis). When I was 17, I met Neil at a high school youth group. He did not care that I was diseased and decided I was worth pursuing. He has loved me with the most unconditional, unwavering love. When we were 19 years old, we felt that God had brought us together for a reason, so we got married. We both were attending Oregon State University at the time and we were able to live almost normal lives as I had seemed to be cured after a year and a half of no symptoms. 

However, things took a turn for the worst in early 2014 while on a mission trip to Sao Paulo, Brazil. It was my senior year in college and Neil was a junior studying Civil Engineering. I became very ill while on the mission trip and had very severe flare ups of my Vasculitis and Colitis. We were devastated to learn that I was not cured, but only in remission. My Vasculitis makes it nearly impossible for me to walk. Neil has always taken it upon himself to physically carry me wherever I need to go whenever I flare with the Vasculitis. My colitis had been very mild for the first 5 years since I developed symptoms, but since Brazil, it started to become more and more severe.

I was able to finish my degree in Human Development and Family Sciences in the summer of 2014. That Fall, I started working as a preschool teacher to help support Neil as he continued toward earning his degree. However, that Winter, I ended up being hospitalized twice and was forced to quit my job as I am now on a medicine that, in short, shuts down my immune system. This makes me extremely vulnerable to catching illnesses which can then make my diseases even worse. Neil had just gone on another mission trip to Brazil and Skyped me as often as he could to help me cope and make difficult decisions. 
Earlier this year, I ended up being hospitalized two more times with a 10 day ""break"" in between. I spent a month in the hospital this time. The second hospitalization was a desperate attempt to save my life. Due to my Ulcerative Colitis, I ended up losing over 20% of my body weight in a matter of months and was no longer able to even feed myself. Keep in mind, Neil was still in college at this time. He was with me every chance he had, even if that meant he had to drive a few hours in the early morning to make it back to his classes in time. I cannot count the times he stayed over night with me and getting next to no sleep because I needed so much help with basic tasks. I ended up having to get a tube placed in my arm that extended to my heart. This tube required many sanitary precautions so that I could receive nutrition therapy without getting an infection. Neil learned all of those precautions and took care of me in our apartment as I had the tube in my arm for an additional week after I was released from the hospital. 

Not only was he in college while dealing with this, he took up work in our church to help with bills as I was no longer able to provide for us financially. Since then, he has graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, earned an internship at an engineering company with offices worldwide, and been accepted into the Master's program at Oregon State University for Structural Engineering. His only goals have been formed by making sure he will be able to take care of me. 

His love is my best medicine. Today, I am almost in remission with my diseases and I owe so much of that to him. I know that there is nothing I could possibly do that would repay him for his sacrifices. However, meeting the Manchester United team would definitely be unforgettable for him!

I know you must receive requests like these all of the time. But, here I am, begging you to honor my husband for his incredible character and devotion to not only soccer, but to his family and the Lord. 

P.S. We are also going to the game to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary and his 22nd birthday. What a gift that would be!!

Thank you for considering my request""

They were able to get in contact with the team tour manager, I believe, and received two passes along with about 25 other guests to meet with the team. They were able to meet with the team and get a bunch of pictures. 

Thank you all for your support and ideas. Getting in contact with the Supporters Club was what then lead her to get in contact with their tour manager.  

They are so grateful to all whole helped. Truly a once in a lifetime experience.  "
3dbksn,0,2015-07-14,What should I do?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3dbksn/what_should_i_do/,"Hey everyone, I was fortunate to get an internship at a B4 firm and I like the people, activities, pay and benefits but honestly, I don't like the work. I'm a little confused with it (which may be because I haven't had auditing in school yet) and it is also kinda boring to me. I get the point to the work we do in public accounting but it just doesn't seem like what I am going to like to do full time (assuming I get an offer for full time). Everyone acts like if you don't do time in public, you get stuck in the same position in corporate until you retire (more or less). I'm just not sure what to do or if I haven't had enough time in public to have such an opinion. Should I just give it more time since an internship isn't much to base a decision off? Will it get better when I start as a staff? Am I screwed if I don't go B4 for a few years? Thanks for any advice and your time.

3dbt5d,1,2015-07-14,Speeding up an old late-2011 MacBook Pro,FR_STARMER,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3dbt5d/speeding_up_an_old_late2011_macbook_pro/,"Hey so, I've been using my work computer (an early 2013 15-inch retina MacBook Pro) over my personal computer because it is so much nicer and faster. However, there really isn't that much of a difference between the two besides the processor being an i7 over an i5 (speeds are the same on each.) 

I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to speed up my personal computer, because at the end of my internship this summer, I'll have to hand the laptop back, and although I'd love to get a new laptop, it's currently not in budget.

I was thinking of wiping the hard drive, which worked for me to speed up old Windows machines way back when, or installing an SSD, which my personal laptop does not currently have.

Thoughts?"
3dca1l,5,2015-07-14,Corn Snake Adoption,slowdownraisinbran,snakes,https://www.reddit.com/r/snakes/comments/3dca1l/corn_snake_adoption/,"Alright /r/snakes, this is gonna be a long one. I apologize in advance for the length and potential disorganization. 

This summer I have been interning at a science museum for children as an animal care intern. My favorites of the many animals we have are the corn snakes, and that was my assigned area of focus. 

A few weeks ago, one of our corn snakes, a female, began acting aggressively. I am the one who feeds her, so most of my encounters with her are on feeding days. One day, when I was taking her out of her tank and putting her into her feeding bin (I understand there is controversy about this, but it's the museum protocol) and she wouldn't let go of my hand like she normally does. I went to set her down and get her off with my other hand and she whipped around and tagged me, drawing blood. I shrugged it off since it didn't hurt. I was just surprised since she had never done anything like that. She was normally a very calm and gentle snake that was even easy to handle on the floor with museum guests touching her. She was sometimes a little territorial of her cage, but had never done anything like this. 

Fast forward to the next time. If I remember correctly, it was between these two times that she was moved to a new enclosure due to exhibit change over. The new corn snake exhibit was focused on genetics, so she was not included. She was being passed off as a wild morph to visitor, although she clearly isn't (though I'm not sure what morph exactly she is, I'll probably post a picture later to help ID her) so she didn't fit into the morphs for the current display. Anyway, her new tank is much smaller and is located in an area that receives much more light. Her hide is also not really adequate in my opinion, and her temps were a little high. While I help take care of her, my boss has the ultimate say in what goes on so she continued to live under these new conditions. Next feeding time rolls around and I get bit again. I realized that somehow, her chart was accidentally switched and she wasn't being fed as often as she should for her size/age. So I fixed that, hoping that would solve her aggression problem. It didn't. 

I have been bit by her at least two times, maybe three if I remember correctly. It doesn't really bother me, but it isn't exactly preferable for a children's museum. She has also tried to bite me a few more times, but has instead bit herself or just plain missed me. She's just really on edge. 

I've been working with her a little bit more and this last time she seemed to be doing a little better. This evening I got an email from my boss stating that another volunteer had been bit while trying to access her habitat (to check temps or something) and he bled too. I didn't realize bleeding was a big deal and I apparently didn't make it clear that I bled when I told my boss about my previous bites. I must have just down played it since it didn't really bother me and I was just worried about the snake. 

Since the incident with the volunteer, the director now believes that a snake known to bite has no place in the museum and should be rehomed. My boss asked me if I was interested in adopting her. I'm considering it because I believe that this is all due to some husbandry issue and I think I can get her back to her old temperament. 

I currently do not have any snakes of my own, but since working there I have been interested in getting some. I had plans to acquire a male and a female hatchling from a breeder in the fall. That's the main reason I am hesitant to take this one on. I'm not so sure I want three snakes just yet, but I don't want her to be moved to a bad home or worse. I also don't want to adopt her and then her temperament never change despite what I may do. 

Can anyone think of any cause for aggression that I may be missing? Or any ideas on how to remedy this? Do you think I should take her or not? Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for you help. 

EDIT: I in no way want to make it seem like this museum takes shitty care of their animals. This is not the case. They're an awesome non-profit, they are just limited in space and resources, and have to do what is best for their visitors and the animals. "

3dcjun,3,2015-07-15,[NeedAdvice] I have no idea how to set up / commit to my own goals.,[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3dcjun/needadvice_i_have_no_idea_how_to_set_up_commit_to/,"**TL;DR:** unless if there is a very real deadline/punishment, i don't put an effort into anything.

Throughout my life, I've never been good at setting goals for myself. I've been lucky to never really have to pace my studying, homework, or school assigned essays. All i had to do was wait until the last second and the pressure to work hard was all i needed to secure b's and a's. 

Now i'm moving into my Sophomore year of college and i've noticed that i've fell into a massive trap. While i'm not really concerned about my grades, i realized i've went an entire year and didn't really make a lasting impression on any of my teachers, i'm not in any clubs, and unlike all my (realistically 90% of them)  friends in my major (computer science), i dont have an internship( mostly because i couldn't get myself to apply to any, let alone talk to people at my schools career fair).

Before the school year ended, i convinced myself that id try to learn a course on coursera to make up for lost time. and i've yet to complete more than a couple of lectures before i move on to a different MOOC.

heck it took me about a week or two to convince myself to write this here.

In the end i feel the point is :unless if there is a very real punishment for NOT doing something ( i.e. bad grade), i feel no incentive for doing it.


I understand the whole ""just do it"" mentality, but my mind always says things like  ""ehh why go to office hours, you know most of the material already"" ,""you're not *really* qualified for that internship"", ""whats the point of going to that club meeting? You're not really that interested in the stuff"" etc.

Crap this really was a ramble, sorry guys,

any help is appreciated.

3dd50t,2,2015-07-15,She used to be very sweet.,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/3dd50t/she_used_to_be_very_sweet/,"I am the oldest of three daughters in my family and this is the story about my middle sister.


Just to give a little background, my family and I lived in an island owned by the United States. My sisters and I were born there, and my dad is a native of California and my mom a native of the Philippines. It was a small island, and almost everyone knew each other. We were widely known because my sisters and I would always appear in the newspaper (for school plays, piano recitals, Chinese festivals, etc) and my dad was “the” accountant to go who had businesses on the island and California.


My mother loved the attention towards our family, and would always dress us in matching outfits. It was unusual for a family to have just three daughters and family friends and strangers would always call us “les tres marias.” Before anyone comments on how my mother “exploited her children,” she was a strict Catholic and very overprotective over us but it made her happy that her children were doted at.


When I was about 6 years old in 2003, my dad was robbed of his fanny pack (that had his wallet inside). We lived in an area where it was safe enough for us to leave our doors unlocked if adults were in the house, but always locked before we slept or if we left the house empty. This was not the first time we were robbed. In 2002 someone stole my dad’s wallet off the cabinet across from the door. I don't know if this was the case, but I didn't think my parents rook the 2002 robbery as serious until the following incident. 


The different between the two robberies was that the first one happened in the day and there were no witnesses. The second robbery happened at night and there was a witness. It was my middle sister, who was 4 years old.


My youngest sister (who was 2 or 3) and I were kept in a room with our live-in maid who refused to let us out until the police was gone. The story was, my middle sister was in the living room alone  (I don’t know why she was there) but a man came into our house from our front door, took my dad’s fanny pack. 


Our maid was curious about the front door noise, went outside to the living room, found my sister against the wall, staring into space. She then realized that our parents were in the shower and that my sister was in shock, for she only pointed to the cabinet that held my dad's fanny pack. Our maid called the police.


The police questioned my family, interviewed my sister, etc. To this day I don't even know if they caught the guy. A few months after that, we moved into a gated community, much more safer than our old house. Plus my parents started locking the door more often.


In 2012, my youngest sister found home videos of us. She and I watched a video of our middle sister before the robbery, and I swear, she was much more different than what I remembered her to be when we were that young. I'm probably going to sound like an asshole, but I really thought it was my youngest sister (they both looked alike).


In the video, she was smiling, goofing around, and asked a lot of questions. Oh and a bonus was, she was actually nice to me. She would hug me, kiss me, and always ask me to play with her. Watching those videos made me internally cry, for my middle sister and I never got along when we were growing up, both of our faults.


All I could remember from living in that island with my sisters was that at one point my middle sister and I were close, and she started changing. She was more quiet, serious, and demeaning. She was nice to her friends and their families, but always acted out to our family. If things did not go her way, she would cry and make a scene. My parents started treating her differently than me, and I was jealous that she was treated more laid-back than I was.



We moved to the United States in 2005, and we became close again. I was a bit wary, due to the fact I went through that weird awkward ""scene/emotional"" phase, and I had two cheery and bright younger sisters. I would always hate it when my middle sister would yell across the playground with her friends, telling them I was the best older sister in the world.  I was just so pessimistic about life, while she was very optimistic.  She was doing well in school, getting A's, while I had a bit of trouble. 



It all changed when in 2008 while my family and I went to watch the Hannah Montana 3D concert movie, that my dad received a frantic call from my grandmother that their house was robbed.  The suddenly overnight, she became a living hell. She became moody, always targeted me for being ""too sloppy"" or ""too lazy"" and her grades started slipping into a B/C average. I honestly thought it was just a phase pre-teens go through, but it also followed my sister into high school.


A few weeks ago, I was messaging with my god mother through snap chat. I complained to her about the inequality treatment I would receive from my parents in comparison to my sisters. I would always get called out for wearing ""revealing outfits"" when my sisters would wear the same thing. I received the most pressure about my future while my middle sister was never pressured to look for internships, etc (she's an incoming college student).  


I commented their behavior to the incidents that occurred with my mentally unstable ex-boyfriend. However, what she revealed to me nearly gave me an anxiety attack.



Before the second robbery, a few native islanders (note that the natives/non natives didn’t usually talk with each other) approached my dad in his office and warned him of a man who wouldn’t stop talking about his daughters. He had seen a photo of my sisters and I in an article about Chinese New Year and believed I was a reincarnation of his daughter. 


My dad, being the not-too-worried type of person he is, didn’t take it seriously enough. Then the second robbery happened a week after. According to my godmother, what had happened to my sister during the robbery would scar her for life.



When the man went into the house, he saw my middle sister just standing there. He kneeled in front of her, touched her face, and whispered something along the lines of “You’re lucky you are here and not your older sister, or else I would have taken her away from you and your family” stood up and kept staring at her until he left. 



And a few years later, my dad found a photo taken behind the gates of our new neighborhood and reported it to the police. It was never mentioned in the newspapers because my dad had connections with the press and the press was respectable enough to not run a story on us.


After my godmother’s revelation, I started connecting things together. We moved to California in 2005 and once we started attending public school, my mother would always warn me (just me) about how people can just grope me out in public. Yes, it was strange, and also embarrassing when she would force me to cross my arms in an “X” across my chest when we were out in public.



I was never allowed to go hang out with my friends unless an adult was present (until I was a sophomore in HS) while my younger sisters were allowed to do so. They wouldn’t let me apply to colleges that were more than an hour away (luckily my college is 45 minutes away) yet they would encourage my sisters to go far away. 


My middle sister was probably traumatized by what happened to her when she was 4.  And since the man had mentioned me, she would act out her anger at me, especially when there was no reason to get mad at.


I'm too scared of telling my parents about what I learned. I think they moved away to put the past behind us. I don't even know if I would ask my sister about that night, because she was young, and I don't want her to act out again since she's showing signs of in dependency and planning out a successful future.



To that sick son-of-a-bitch who touched my sister and scared her by non-nonchalantly threatening my life, I hope you rot in hell.  I'm a little bit glad that you had not physically harmed her, but children should never feel unsafe in their living environment.


EDIT: grammar 



UPDATE: I messaged my god mother this story, and she gave me a bit more information. 




According to what my sister had told a child psychologist (I didn't even know she had one) she described the man as ""dark skinned,"" dirty and overweight man. He had a moustache that kinda resembles ""pornstache"" from Orange is the New Black. What frightened her the most was the look he gave her. 



His eyes were wide and a little blood shot and from what my god mother had believed, that the man considered taking my sister along with him instead of me. My younger sisters have a lighter complexion that I do, for I am more darker. It's frightening to believe a man can be delusional enough to believe a girl from the newspaper can be a reincarnation of his daughter (if he even had one). 




I'm having thoughts about what would've happened if my sister wasn't there. Would he have searched the house for me? How the fucking hell did he find out where I lived. 



Come to think of it, a few years ago two sisters were declared missing in our hometown. It was reported that they were walking to school and disappeared without a trace. It has been feared that they are either dead or sold into trafficking. I really hope that incident wasn't in relation to mine.

3dd77z,4,2015-07-15,Looking for info on ABTech's comp sci courses,lavendersuga,asheville,https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/3dd77z/looking_for_info_on_abtechs_comp_sci_courses/,"Hello,

I live in Morganton and have been wanting to continue the web development degree I was pursuing before I moved down here. I've attended another community college in a different town and the classes haven't been very satisfactory. Not much choice in mid/upper level courses and some lazy teaching that really upset me. At the rate it was going it would take years just to get a certificate.

I called ABTech earlier in the week and talked to someone that was supposed to be a department head or in the computer technologies department, but she sounded like she was too busy to talk to me and couldn't give me information about # of students in the program, graduation rate, chances of internship, etc. It wasn't what I expected. Disappointing, actually.

So I'm here wondering if anyone can give me the skinny on ABTech's programming courses, especially Web Technologies, and if it would be a good place to learn and network with other students or if I'm better off taking Treehouse courses and hoping I can get out of the hills one day. 

I also want to know if they help you with job placement or have any extracurricular tech oriented activities like lectures or clubs. I don't know anyone here except elderly family, and to get a job I need experience and networking. 

At this point I really want to give up. Asheville is the only city of size near here and it's an hour or so drive, but if it's a good place to learn I'll figure out a way to get there. 

Thanks for any insight you can give."

I am the oldest of three daughters in my family.



Just to give a little background, my family and I lived in an island owned by the United States. My sisters and I were born there, my dad is a native of California and my mom a native of the Philippines. It was a small island, and almost everyone knew each other. We were widely known because my sisters and I would always appear in the newspaper (for school plays, piano recitals, Chinese festivals, etc) and my dad was “the” accountant to go to.



In 2003 someone stole my dad's fanny pack, that contained his wallet. We lived in an area where it was safe enough for us to leave our doors unlocked if adults were in the house, but always locked before we slept or if we left the house empty. This was not the first time we were robbed. In 2002 someone stole my dad’s wallet off the cabinet across from the door. I honestly felt that they did not take this robbery seriously enough because they still didn't lock the door when they were in the house.



In the first robbery, it occurred during the afternoon and no one witnessed it. In the second robbery, my middle sister Stephanie, who was 4 years old at the time, was unfortunate enough to witness is. 



Our youngest sister Lorraine (who was 2 or 3 at the time) and 6 year old me were kept in a room with our live-in maid who refused to let us out until the police were gone. The story was that Stephanie was in the living room alone (I don’t know) then a strange man walked into our house from the UNLOCKED (!!) front door, stole my dad's fanny pack from the same damn cabinet and left.


After it happened, our maid was curious to why she heard the front door slam, especially during night time and went outside to the living room to check. She found Stephanie against the wall who looked like she was staring into space. Our maid asked her if she was the one who opened the door and all Stephanie did was point at the cabinet. Our maid called the police.



The police questioned our family and maid, interviewed my sister, etc.  A few months after that, we moved into a gated community, much more safer than our old house. Plus my parents started locking the door every time it was closed.



In 2012, Lorraine found videos from our childhood.  We eventually found a disc with an interaction between Stephanie and I, and I can assume it was before the robbery, because this was not the Stephanie I experienced growing up.  


In the video, she was smiling, goofing around, and asked a lot of questions. The strangest part was the treatment she was giving me. She was hugging me, kissing my cheeks, and always asking me to play with her. It was one of the most confusing events in my entire life, and I know that that night after scourging through old photos and more videos, I cried in my sleep. 



My mother would always point out to me that Stephanie and I used to be close. I could not remember that at all, except when she started ""changing."" Out of the blue, she became more quiet, serious, and demanding. She was nice to her friends and their families, but always acted out to our family.  If things did not go her way, she would cry and make a scene. My parents started treating her differently than me, and I was jealous that she was treated more laid-back than I was.



After our sudden move to the United States in 2005, and Stephanie and I became close again.  However, stupid me went through that dumb ""scene/emotional"" phase during middle school, and would push away my two cheery and bright younger sisters. In middle school, whenever Stephanie would see me, she would loudly scream out my name, and tell her friends (she's very popular) that I was the best big sister in the world. I was just such a pessimist on life, while she was the opposite.  



In 2008, my family and I were watching the Hannah Montana 3D concert movie when my grandma frantically called my parents to report a burglary in their home.  It was as if overnight, Stephanie became a living hell. She became extremely moody, rude, and emotional, always targeted me for being ""too sloppy"" or ""too lazy"" and her grades started slipping into a B/C average. I honestly thought it was just a phase pre-teens go through, but her dreadful attitude toward me followed through in her high school years.


Recently I had been chatting online with my god mother through snap chat. I complained to her about the unequal treatment I received from my parents in comparison to my sisters. I would always get called out for wearing ""revealing outfits"" when my sisters would wear the same thing. I received the most pressure about my future while my middle sister was never pressured to look for internships, etc (she's an incoming college student).



I commented their behavior to the incidents that occurred with my mentally unstable ex-boyfriend. However, what she revealed to me nearly gave me an anxiety attack.



Before the second robbery, a few native islanders (note that the natives/non natives didn't socialize with each other) approached my dad in his office and warned him of a man who wouldn’t stop talking about his daughters. He had seen a photo of my sisters and I in an article about Chinese New Year and told one of them that I was a reincarnation of his daughter. 



My dad being the not-too-worried type of person he is, didn’t take their words seriously. The robbery happened the week after the natives visited him. According to my god mother, something did happen to my sister, when throughout my life, I was told nothing too serious happened.


The man was big and burly with a deep tan and wrinkly. He walked into the house and saw Stephanie in the living room, and she was frozen in fear. He took my dad's fanny pack and walked over to my sister and kneed in front of her. He touched her face and told her something along the lines of ""You're lucky you are here and not your older sister, or else I would have taken her away from your and your family."" 


Stephanie told a child psychologist (I didn't even know she had one) that the man stared at her. His eyes wide, and his lips slowly turned into a smile. He got up and kept that same look on his face, and kept that same look at her until he left the house. 


And a few years later the incident, my dad found a photo taken behind the gates of our new neighborhood and reported it to the police. It was never mentioned in the newspapers because my dad had connections with the press and the press was respectable enough to not run a story on us.



After my godmother’s revelation, I started connecting things together. This explained our abrupt move to the United States. Once we started attending public school, my parents went on all out ""lock down mode"" on me. My mother would make me cross my arms across my chest if we were in a crowded place. I was never allowed to go hang out with my friends unless an adult was present (until I was a sophomore in HS) while my younger sisters were allowed to do so. They wouldn’t let me apply to colleges that were more than an hour away (luckily my college is 45 minutes away) yet they would encourage my sisters to go far away.



It came to my conclusion that my sister's anger towards me stemmed from that event (no shit).  I immediately began to feel guilty for all the mean things I had said to her in the past. I used to call out my sister's bad attitude to my parents who treated Stephanie like a little puppy.  I was angry that my parents never told me the REAL reason to why my sister acted that way.  If they had from the beginning, I would have understood and treated my sister much nicer.



I'm too scared of telling my parents about what I learned. I think they moved away to put the past behind us. I don't even know if I would ask my sister about that night, because she was young, and I don't want her to act out again since she's showing signs of in dependency and planning out a successful future.


As I am writing this, there are so many questions that are running through my mind. How did this man find out where I lived?  Was his main purpose just to steal or to actually get to me? If he actually wanted me, he would have at least tried getting me (THANKFULLY HE DID NOT). And also, what ever happened to that man. Is he dead or still alive? And if our island was small enough for everyone to know each other, WHY COULDN'T THEY FIND HIM.

3dduzd,8,2015-07-15,"i'm new, been lurking for a few months now. here's my story for those interested. (LOTS OF TEXT)",FatherJ2692,opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3dduzd/im_new_been_lurking_for_a_few_months_now_heres_my/,"i've been lurking here for a few months now, and i finally decided to make an account and post. this is an introduction to me and my story, for those who want to waste some time and for those who are relatively interested.

2009 - in the beginning of my senior year in high school i had gotten a toenail pulled. my father, being prescribed lortab 7.5/325s took pity on the pain i was in at the time and gave me one. this was also the day halo 3: odst released and i remember playing that game in awe at the colors and the feeling that took over me, along with the numbness that followed. i asked him for another that night and promptly fell asleep. now, i had used pot and alcohol at this point but nothing harder, so i was no stranger to getting high or drunk. however, i had never felt anything like this. a few weeks later i stole from his bottle which he always left out in the open (ahhh, the good old days) and he passively accused me of it though of course i didn't admit to it. i didn't touch it from october of that year until the following year.

2010 - at this time, my family lived in an apartment with the landlords living in the area beneath us. during snowfall and blizzards i'd help shovel and get paid a few bucks for my time. well, one day in february i moved wrong and tore my back up pretty bad and exacerbated the scoliosis i was diagnosed with about 3 years back. my father again took pity on me and gave me some of his shit, but this time it hooked me unlike the last time. every day before leaving for work, or for school, or to go chill with my friends, i'd grab one or two and eat them and feel fucking great. this got worse when a potential relationship with a girl fell through, and one or two turned into three or four at a time. 

at this time, i wasn't smoking much pot due to a panic attack so the lortab offered a high that was calming yet intense and was always the same no matter what. things were consistent through graduation and the summer, i started smoking again as well. august of that year i had my first buy from a friend's leftover stash from surgery and was taught about insufflation and i began to use that method whenever possible because it hit me harder. 

however, my father started noticing more and more and i was clashing with him more often. he got more creative with hiding spots that took me weeks to find, or hiding keys that took me weeks to find to open the lock blocking my way to the goodies i wanted so bad. when i wasn't using, i was smoking pot i bought off a coworker from my deadend retail job i worked at the time. 

as a freshman at my community college with a full scholarship, i met a girl who i fell head over heels for. we courted for a month and a half, dated for 2 months, then she ended it with barely any reason. she knew about the drugs and didn't care, but later on i found out it was my inflexible and manic personality that got to her. i suffered from a lot of mood swings and outbursts and it pushed her away. i was absolutely crushed, and asked my pot dealer about buying pills along with a good friend of mine who shared the same habits. turned out they both sold, and i was introduced to the wonderful world of oxycodone. i remember the first time was using 20s, and it blew my mind. then i got some endocet 10/325s (which became my absolute fucking favorite) and it was over. the claws were set in.

2011 - at this time, my drug usage was privatized and downplayed. it wasn't a problem or a big deal. my best friend from high school knew, and a friend i met from a class the past semester knew. let's call them B and A. B is a musician, and needed a drummer to start a band. A was a drummer, and so i introduced the both of them. it wasn't long until we all started chillin for band practices that i sat in on high as fuck and they began to use as well.

i got the girl i met in late 2010 back, but my habit furthered. i only took my dad's stuff when everyone i knew was dry (out of the 3-4 connects i had in early 2011). she had addiction problems herself in her life and said that if i kept shit reasonable it would work out. then we started getting high, and between spending money for my own drugs, for her drugs, for us to do things together while we were on drugs, paying for her gas (i didn't drive then and still don't now)... the financial aid refunds i received from my school that were about $5000 were gone in 6 months. the drugs caused fights, we couldn't go to NYC for st. patty's day, i almost got arrested when we did go to NYC for a rusko concert and i got patted down entering the venue. it was looking bad and she ended it in may 2011.

at that point i fucked up my schooling. my first semester i was super average (always an A and B student in high school), the second i just didn't care and ditched class and lied to my parents about classes cancelling etc. eventually i failed all but one class i passed with a D and my aid got suspended, forcing me to tell my parents everything. i was put into therapy and under anti-depressants, and this allowed me to get my financial aid back over time. my bank account was monitored by my parents as part of the conditions for staying home and not going into rehab. i couldn't find my father's stash either, so what did i do? i stole from that dead end job i mentioned earlier, got arrested and escorted out in front of my ex-girlfriend who was picking me up that day to work things out. luckily i was released with just an appearance ticket but all the ""trust"" i built up by manipulating and playing my family was gone and i had to start from square one again, this time with being broke and not having a job and school starting right around the corner.

this effectively ended the relationship between my ex and i, despite my trying and her trying. things were too far gone. my friends reacted oppositely. A got in trouble for something and we bonded immensely, meanwhile B remained very much critical and stayed away from the situation. A and i leaned on each other, and we formed a plan using one of my contacts that got rid of endocet 10/325s at $5 each. we both save money, we cop in october, we hold till thanksgiving and celebrate the hard work. we got up the night we copped, but did manage to save the rest. now, this plan happened after i got a job at a grocery store where i got paid more than minimum and got decent hours so i brought in a lot of cash and saved most of it. between that and the financial aid money, i had about 4 grand saved up. things were good.

then i met a girl, my current girlfriend of almost four years, and things were great. money in my pocket, habit under control, love in my life, grades were back, trust regained. i could control this, i know i could.

2012 - nope. A and i kept close while we distanced from B, and he spiraled out of control, eventually getting pulled over by a drug detective and almost getting locked up one night. his connects became my connects through him, and slowly my money shriveled up as prices went up and my morals went down. by the end of the spring semester i was broke again and i had introduced another to the life: my girl. thankfully i have been able to keep her out of using up to 100mgs a day and she does about 10 mgs to be happy and satisfied, but this was yet another introduction.

B mended fences with A and i, and we expanded our group, eventually adding 4-5 more people and throwing monthly ""glass table nights"" where we'd robotrip, smoke, drink, use pills, etc. this only lasted a little bit though because of the eventual bullshit that occurs in a group full of drug addicts: shit-talking each other.

2013 - i'm also a womanizer, and a cheater. A and i tag-teamed a girl i knew back in the day, and this formed a rupture with our friendship. he felt i was a bad influence, and i was. B latched onto this, never really meaning his apology from the year before. everyone else from the group stayed away except one kid who eventually ghosted on me anyway. i was in my own boat with my drugs and my girl, and that was it.

this broke me, and i became angry. using more to get away, stealing money to get up, stealing my dad's shit. it was all about getting a fix. some coworkers and friends from high school, M and T, were sources for me at this time. T had his own script of percs, so i was fucking happy with that. the plan was each month, M and T and me split it 3 ways and i paid $150 for 30-40 of them. M got greedy, tried cutting me out, T told me, i spoke to M, and somehow afterwards we were friends once shit got patched up. but we all fed off each other and enabled each other.

at this point in school, i was supposed to graduate in 2013's spring semester. my personal issues along with my usage made me no show and call out of an internship, i was placed on probation for the internship, and got fucked over by a technicality based on weather and not getting to the seminar class. i took another semester of a different major just to stay in school but at the end of the fall semester the rules changed and the title IV appeal i could've done to get aid back (by saying hey i need these classes i can get this done now) were no longer offered. 

2014 - my family moved from town/city border of the city we were in to another town about 15 minutes away. things got difficult at this time because due to not driving, i had to plot and scheme to get into my hometown to cop from my connects. now, when my family was doing all this, i loaned them 1500 and they gave me back 1750 the day after we moved. it lasted a month, doing 150 mg a day and paying for people's shit added up. i was also taking my dad's on top of this to use it to hold me over and keep me less sick while i figured out how to score on that given day. 

dad got crafty this time, confronted me, we laid down some rules for me to not get kicked out, and he put a padlock on a door in the new room. now i was broke and withdrawal was setting in and i wasn't happy. luckily i took an opportunity at that grocery store i worked out and started making $200+ a week instead of $120 or so. money started adding up. 

M and T were my boys, we were chillin all the time and getting high and suffering when we couldn't. my boy A started dealing and eventually he got popped. i was a client of his for a few months, and i saw him about 2 hrs before on the night he got arrested. i felt guilty to a point.

T was on probation for a prior charge. he was told his time was done and he was good to go. he never notified them of a change of address and they considered him in violation of his probation. M and i were shook knowing 2 ppl we were close with were in prison or jail in a matter of months. we got closer and became partners in crime, scheming how to cop, how to rip kids off, how to make side money, the works. 

T got out towards the end of the year, and i landed him a job at my dad's work place along with M who i did that for earlier in the year. i work there occasionally, helping with inventory as temporary help. well, they started distancing and before i knew it i didn't speak to them for a month. turns out M had some petty issues and didn't want to talk about it. once things were patched up i told him to just keep me in the loop and be honest. the friendship was always more than the drugs to me.

2015 - M sobered up, T violated again and is back in jail, A came out of prison and got off free and is dealing again, B and i are tight again, and my girl and i are still together. i continue to lie, cheat, and steal but passively and not as badly as i once did. i am broke, despite taking out loans to support my habit. i'm trying to get back to school and to learn to drive but between being high and spending money i don't know if i'll do either and i have about a month left before i need to begin paying student loans/get to school to defer those loans. through it all, i've still never used dope, though i've had other friends that have and ODed and died or it ruined their lives. 

i guess it feels good to type everything out, and for those who read it all i salute you. i'm looking forward to being a part of the community, and i apologize for the long post. i'd rather be more than a faceless name on here and if this helps you all get to know me better then so be it."

Hey Mustangs! We love our SMU alums here at the office and we’re looking for two interns this year (if you can use this for credit, even better as I will assist in forms or any reviews needed). If you don't fit what I'm looking for, forward this on to someone else.

I head up the IT &amp; Digital Marketing staff here at CoVerica, a local insurance company. We’re located near Preston &amp; Campbell in north Dallas (about 20 minutes from campus). I'm flexible on time off for school but I do need people to be here about 25-30 hours a week during our core business hours (8am to 5pm).

##IT Intern

I need someone to help me with IT support duties for a 60 person company. We use a helpdesk system and it ranges from ""My phone isn't working"" to ""I need my hard drive replaced"" so we would need to have the OS reimaged. We have remote staff that occasionally have VPN issues but I need someone that has some strong Windows desktop knowledge and doesn't mind learning some Microsoft Active Directory and possibly some Microsoft SQL for data pulls. 

##Social Media Marketing Intern

In the grand scheme of things, we're a large, small company (or maybe that's a small, large company). We're the 3rd or 4th largest insurance brokerage in Dallas. We're almost at the point to where we could bring someone on full-time for a Social Media Marketing position but I'd rather start small and bring an intern or two in. I need someone to help me with this as I'm great at coming up with the direction we need to head to but I tend to get pulled a thousand different ways and our social media is the first thing to get neglected. I need someone that can dream up ideas and help us implement ways to engage with first, our existing customers but second, prospective customers across social media platforms. We're dipping our toes into all social platforms as well as video and (for another business we have) podcast production. We will be creating content together as well as editing so anyone with writing, illustration, and video editing experience would be amazing.

For either position, please email me directly at leif.hurst@coverica.com.

For instance, if your boss compliments you on a job well done at your internship in front of the other interns:

""Great job! Didn't expect you to get this task done so quickly.""

And you think about what you would say or do as a heel to get heat from the other interns:

""Well, maybe if your other interns were as competent as me, you would know to expect a little more.""

Or your face turn:

""I definitely wouldn't have been able to get it done without help from the entire team!"""

I should start off by saying that I’m a huge fan of Ben Simmons. I lived in New Orleans as a young kid, I recently graduated from Tulane, and I’ve loved LSU athletics for years. One of my fondest memories was watching Tyrus Thomas and Big Baby Davis beat [Duke in the NCAA tournament](http://www.tarheeltimes.com/photos/funny_unc_photos/photo.aspx?image=JJ%20Redick%20Crying%20After%20LSU%20Loss.jpg). Fast-forward to my junior year of college, when I studied abroad in Sydney, Australia. 

While traveling around Australia, we learned of the Australian Institute of Sport. For the uninitiated, the AIS is exactly what it sounds like: a government institution that finds and develops Australia’s best amateur athletes. Founded in part due to the “national embarrassment” of not winning a gold medal in the 1976 Olympics, I thought the whole concept was pretty awesome. I thought about what it would be like if the U.S. funneled its athletes into an institution like that, and I started to consider the hypotheticals. What if the United States replaced AAU with a federal program for developing basketball players? Would LeBron be playing goalie for the USMNT right now? Would Portland have been the 4th seed? Anyways, my love for LSU sports and my firsthand exposure to Australian basketball led me to Ben Simmons pretty early on. Long story short, I’m sold on the guy.

***The Man-Child from Down Under***

[*SIMMONS*](https://nbccollegebasketballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ben-simmons-2357.jpg)

*Hometown*: Melbourne, Australia

*School*: LSU

*Age*: 18 (7/20/96)

*Height*: 6’10’

*Weight*: 240 lbs.

*NBA position*: SF/PF

*Wingspan*: 6’11’’

I’ve said this elsewhere in /r/nba, but I think he’s the next big thing to hit the NBA. Comparing amateurs to established stars is always touchy, but if there’s anyone to compare him to, it’s LeBron James. Simmons is 6’10’’, he’s got a sturdy frame, he’s a [fluid athlete](http://gfycat.com/SpitefulEmotionalAntelopegroundsquirrel), and he’s most comfortable with the ball, [making plays happen](http://gfycat.com/SkinnyTepidAltiplanochinchillamouse) and finding his teammates. It seems like the label “point-forward” is thrown around pretty liberally, but when I think of what a point-forward is – a forward who can literally assume a PG’s responsibilities for a whole game – they seem to be a pretty rare occurrence. Magic and LeBron are the two easiest examples.

Living up to those two is a tall task, but when you watch Simmons play, it’s hard not to be reminded of LeBron. Despite his incredible frame and strength, Simmons’ most impressive skill is his [passing ability](https://twitter.com/Mike_Schmitz/status/615724813345161216) and [court vision](http://gfycat.com/BlackFeminineBunny). He’s unselfish, and he appears to understand how important it is to get the whole team involved if you want to be successful. He’s got an immaculate basketball pedigree (the Simmons family lives and breathes basketball), and maybe most impressively, he seems legitimately down-to-earth. Every blue-blood program in America recruited him, and he ended up choosing LSU – to be near his god-father (assistant coach David Patrick) and to avoid the media frenzy at schools like Kentucky. He chose a football school that – outside of Shaq and Pete Maravich – doesn’t boast much tradition in the way of basketball, because [he wants to focus on his game, and nothing else](http://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2014/11/no_1-ranked_recruit_ben_simmon.html). Also, and this is obviously without much basis: [Simmons simply has the look of a stud](http://gfycat.com/SneakyValidBedlingtonterrier). It’s in his face, and the way he acts on the court. Like he treats the opponents with respect, but the look on his face is like “I know how much better I am than you”.

It should be obvious that I think Simmons is the total package. Going up against established pros like [The Brow](https://twitter.com/CJMooreBR/status/615623791369166848) and [The Beard](https://twitter.com/nbadraftnet/status/615724923315576833) at the Nike Basketball Academy, Simmons more than held his own. I’d be comfortable deeming him the best prospect to enter the draft since Anthony Davis, and one of the [top prospects of the past decade](https://twitter.com/BSU_Tigg14/status/616028944442224641). Considering his position as the #1 pick in most 2016 mock drafts, I don’t think my evaluation of him is that outlandish. He should be a no-brainer for whoever lands the top pick. But I’m also not calling the shots for any of next year’s lottery teams, and watching Karl-Anthony Towns dethrone Jahlil Okafor over the past year showed that NBA teams are willing to invest in potential and style-of-play over tangible basketball skill. That brings me to Skal Labissiere, and the reason why Simmons could lose his claim to the #1 pick.

***The Haitian Revolution***

[*LABISSIERE*](https://nbccollegebasketballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/skal-labissiere-2354-e1403553995675.jpg)

*Hometown*: Port-au-Prince, Haiti

*School*: Kentucky

*Age*: 19 (3/18/96)

*Height*: 7’0’’

*Weight*: 216 lbs.

*NBA Position*: PF/C

*Wingspan*: 7’1.5’’

When I started poking around the internet, looking at 2016 mock drafts, I was initially shocked. DraftExpress is my go-to for draft information – they’re typically pretty reasonable and informed – and they had Ben Simmons ranked 3rd in next year’s draft class. Flabbergasted, I feverishly researched the two players ranked ahead of him. And after my research, I can say these two things confidently:

1.	A DX intern must have made a mistake when formatting the mock draft, as no sane man would rank Jaylen Brown ahead of Simmons.

2.	Simmons should be ranked #1. But if there’s anyone I can imagine usurping this spot, it’s Skal Labissiere, the lanky Haitian big man.

DraftExpress has since learned the error of their ways, and moved Simmons ahead of Brown. But that still leaves Labissiere, who has an amazing story. Born in Port-au-Prince, Skal grew up playing soccer, and he was in Haiti when the [earthquake hit in 2010](http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2014/7/28/5941837/skal-labissiere-recruiting-memphis-kentucky-ole-miss). His house collapsed on top of him, and he was saved by his father after being buried for 3 hours with the rest of his family. The natural disaster provided a humanitarian basis for his migration to the United States. A charity – called “Reach Your Dream” – helped Skal get to Evangelical Christian High School in Memphis, and after being denied a high school transfer he was deemed ineligible to play his senior year. In response, merely days before the season started, Labissiere announced that he’d be playing for Reach Your Dream Prep (RYDP) – a “prep” school created with the [sole purpose of allowing Skal to play basketball](http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2014/10/27/7081065/skal-labissiere-recruiting-memphis-kentucky).

He then committed to Kentucky, and one look at the guy says that he’s a worthy replacement for Karl-Anthony Towns. He’s a legitimate 7’0’’, with a great frame for adding bulk and [impressive agility](http://gfycat.com/UnrealisticCreativeElephantseal). He’s drawn comparisons to LaMarcus Aldridge, due to his [incredibly sweet jumper](http://gfycat.com/EverlastingAccomplishedHeifer). Skal has great range for a big man, and he’s shown impressive playmaking skills for a player his size. Not many big men can create their own shot, but [Skal is one of them](http://gfycat.com/AccomplishedPepperyApe). He’s also got great defensive instincts and potential. Long story short, he has the look of the kind of modern big man that NBA teams fawn over. If, for some reason, Simmons experiences a rough transition to the college game, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Labissiere receive interest for the first overall pick. An impressive season playing for Calipari is often enough to significantly inflate one’s draft stock.

***Why You Should Watch The SEC This Year***

After researching Skal, I still think Simmons is a no-brainer for the top pick in next year’s draft, and I think everyone else will realize this once they see him dominate college basketball. However, I’m no longer naïve. I can envision a scenario where a team (probably the Kings) might decide they’d rather have the sweet shooting 7-footer instead of the 6’10 forward with a less-than-reliable jump shot. Do I think this will happen? No. If it does, is that team making a huge mistake? Yes. But considering the amount of over-thinking that seems to go into preparing for the draft, I wouldn’t be totally shocked.

Until next June though, everyone should sit back and enjoy the newly competitive SEC. LSU has Simmons and Antonio Blakeney, Malik Newman made the surprising choice to attend Mississippi State, and Kentucky has another blue-chip class with Labissiere and Isaiah Briscoe. I haven’t been this excited for LSU basketball in years, and I can’t wait to watch Simmons and Labissiere face-off knowing there’s a little more than usual on the line."

A bit about my position right now: I know two programming languages, C++ and Java (still relatively a novice in the latter). After taking my placement test, I've found that I have been placed in the highest math class possible with just this test (Math 221).


I have a bunch of questions regarding my subject of major and just about academics in general in our college, the internships, pre-requisite tips, which classes to take for easy credits, etc.

I would deeply appreciate it if a Computer Science major in college right now could contact me (by either commenting on this or by PM) and could offer to put some of my queries to rest. I truly appreciate your time so I would only be asking questions which I think are REALLY important to me. Thanks you so, so much! This will make me a lot better!"

I should start off by saying that I’m a huge fan of Ben Simmons. I lived in New Orleans as a young kid, I recently graduated from Tulane, and I’ve loved LSU athletics for years. One of my fondest memories was watching Tyrus Thomas and Big Baby Davis beat [Duke in the NCAA tournament](http://www.tarheeltimes.com/photos/funny_unc_photos/photo.aspx?image=JJ%20Redick%20Crying%20After%20LSU%20Loss.jpg). Fast-forward to my junior year of college, when I studied abroad in Sydney, Australia. 

While traveling around Australia, we learned of the Australian Institute of Sport. For the uninitiated, the AIS is exactly what it sounds like: a government institution that finds and develops Australia’s best amateur athletes. Founded in part due to the “national embarrassment” of not winning a gold medal in the 1976 Olympics, I thought the whole concept was pretty awesome. I thought about what it would be like if the U.S. funneled its athletes into an institution like that, and I started to consider the hypotheticals. What if the United States replaced AAU with a federal program for developing basketball players? Would LeBron be playing goalie for the USMNT right now? Would Portland have been the 4th seed? Anyways, my love for LSU sports and my firsthand exposure to Australian basketball led me to Ben Simmons pretty early on. Long story short, I’m sold on the guy.

***The Man-Child from Down Under***

[*SIMMONS*](https://nbccollegebasketballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ben-simmons-2357.jpg)

*Hometown*: Melbourne, Australia

*School*: LSU

*Age*: 18 (7/20/96)

*Height*: 6’10’

*Weight*: 240 lbs.

*NBA position*: SF/PF

*Wingspan*: 6’11’’

I’ve said this elsewhere in /r/nba, but I think he’s the next big thing to hit the NBA. Comparing amateurs to established stars is always touchy, but if there’s anyone to compare him to, it’s LeBron James. Simmons is 6’10’’, he’s got a sturdy frame, he’s a [fluid athlete](http://gfycat.com/SpitefulEmotionalAntelopegroundsquirrel), and he’s most comfortable with the ball, [making plays happen](http://gfycat.com/SkinnyTepidAltiplanochinchillamouse) and [finding his teammates](http://gfycat.com/AgreeableShabbyAnura). Simmons is simply a [smooth](http://gfycat.com/SlowMealyAmericanwigeon) and gifted offensive player. It seems like the label “point-forward” is thrown around pretty liberally, but when I think of what a point-forward is – a forward who can literally assume a PG’s responsibilities for a whole game – they seem to be a pretty rare occurrence. Magic and LeBron are the two easiest examples.

Living up to those two is a tall task, but when you watch Simmons play, it’s hard not to be reminded of LeBron. Despite his incredible frame and strength, Simmons’ most impressive skill is his [passing ability](https://twitter.com/Mike_Schmitz/status/615724813345161216) and [court vision](http://gfycat.com/HugeRevolvingEmperorshrimp). He’s unselfish, and he appears to understand how important it is to get the whole team involved if you want to be successful. He’s got an immaculate basketball pedigree (the Simmons family lives and breathes basketball), and maybe most impressively, he seems legitimately down-to-earth. Every blue-blood program in America recruited him, and he ended up choosing LSU – to be near his god-father (assistant coach David Patrick) and to avoid the media frenzy at schools like Kentucky. He chose a football school that – outside of Shaq and Pete Maravich – doesn’t boast much tradition in the way of basketball, because [he wants to focus on his game, and nothing else](http://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2014/11/no_1-ranked_recruit_ben_simmon.html). Also, and this is obviously without much basis: [Simmons simply has the look of a stud](http://gfycat.com/SneakyValidBedlingtonterrier). It’s in his face, and the way he acts on the court. Like he treats the opponents with respect, but the look on his face is like “I know how much better I am than you”.

It should be obvious that I think Simmons is the total package. Going up against established pros like [The Brow](https://twitter.com/CJMooreBR/status/615623791369166848) and [The Beard](https://twitter.com/nbadraftnet/status/615724923315576833) at the Nike Basketball Academy, Simmons more than held his own. I’d be comfortable deeming him the best prospect to enter the draft since Anthony Davis, and one of the [top prospects of the past decade](https://twitter.com/BSU_Tigg14/status/616028944442224641). Considering his position as the #1 pick in most 2016 mock drafts, I don’t think my evaluation of him is that outlandish. He should be a no-brainer for whoever lands the top pick. But I’m also not calling the shots for any of next year’s lottery teams, and watching Karl-Anthony Towns dethrone Jahlil Okafor over the past year showed that NBA teams are willing to invest in potential and style-of-play over tangible basketball skill. That brings me to Skal Labissiere, and the reason why Simmons could lose his claim to the #1 pick.

***The Haitian Revolution***

[*LABISSIERE*](https://nbccollegebasketballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/skal-labissiere-2354-e1403553995675.jpg)

*Hometown*: Port-au-Prince, Haiti

*School*: Kentucky

*Age*: 19 (3/18/96)

*Height*: 7’0’’

*Weight*: 216 lbs.

*NBA Position*: PF/C

*Wingspan*: 7’1.5’’

When I started poking around the internet, looking at 2016 mock drafts, I was initially shocked. DraftExpress is my go-to for draft information – they’re typically pretty reasonable and informed – and they had Ben Simmons ranked 3rd in next year’s draft class. Flabbergasted, I feverishly researched the two players ranked ahead of him. And after my research, I can say these two things confidently:

1.	A DX intern must have made a mistake when formatting the mock draft, as no sane man would rank Jaylen Brown ahead of Simmons.

2.	Simmons should be ranked #1. But if there’s anyone I can imagine usurping this spot, it’s Skal Labissiere, the lanky Haitian big man.

DraftExpress has since learned the error of their ways, and moved Simmons ahead of Brown. But that still leaves Labissiere, who has an amazing story. Born in Port-au-Prince, Skal grew up playing soccer, and he was in Haiti when the [earthquake hit in 2010](http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2014/7/28/5941837/skal-labissiere-recruiting-memphis-kentucky-ole-miss). His house collapsed on top of him, and he was saved by his father after being buried for 3 hours with the rest of his family. The natural disaster provided a humanitarian basis for his migration to the United States. A charity – called “Reach Your Dream” – helped Skal get to Evangelical Christian High School in Memphis, and after being denied a high school transfer he was deemed ineligible to play his senior year. In response, merely days before the season started, Labissiere announced that he’d be playing for Reach Your Dream Prep (RYDP) – a “prep” school created with the [sole purpose of allowing Skal to play basketball](http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2014/10/27/7081065/skal-labissiere-recruiting-memphis-kentucky).

He then committed to Kentucky, and one look at the guy says that he’s a worthy replacement for Karl-Anthony Towns. He’s a legitimate 7’0’’, with a great frame for adding bulk and [impressive agility](http://gfycat.com/UnrealisticCreativeElephantseal). He’s drawn comparisons to LaMarcus Aldridge, due to his [incredibly sweet jumper](http://gfycat.com/EverlastingAccomplishedHeifer). Skal has great range for a big man, and he’s shown impressive playmaking skills for a player his size. Not many big men can create their own shot, but [Skal is one of them](http://gfycat.com/AccomplishedPepperyApe). He’s also got great defensive instincts and potential. Long story short, he has the look of the kind of modern big man that NBA teams fawn over. If, for some reason, Simmons experiences a rough transition to the college game, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Labissiere receive interest for the first overall pick. An impressive season playing for Calipari is often enough to significantly inflate one’s draft stock.

***Why You Should Watch The SEC This Year***

After researching Skal, I still think Simmons is a no-brainer for the top pick in next year’s draft, and I think everyone else will realize this once they see him dominate college basketball. However, I’m no longer naïve. I can envision a scenario where a team (probably the Kings) might decide they’d rather have the sweet shooting 7-footer instead of the 6’10 forward with a less-than-reliable jump shot. Do I think this will happen? No. If it does, is that team making a huge mistake? Yes. But considering the amount of over-thinking that seems to go into preparing for the draft, I wouldn’t be totally shocked.

Until next June though, everyone should sit back and enjoy the newly competitive SEC. LSU has Simmons and Antonio Blakeney, Malik Newman made the surprising choice to attend Mississippi State, and Kentucky has another blue-chip class with Labissiere and Isaiah Briscoe. I haven’t been this excited for LSU basketball in years, and I can’t wait to watch Simmons and Labissiere face-off knowing there’s a little more than usual on the line.

I've decided that I want to leave my position at a small accounting firm (3 partners) and find a job at a Big 4 firm in NYC after the extension deadline.  I was hoping to get some advice from you wonderful people.

A little about me:  I recently passed my CPA, and I am just waiting on the paperwork (Pennsylvania).  I have been with my firm since I was an intern in 2013.   We dont have specific titles at my firm, but I imagine I have many of the responsibilities of a senior (I assign and review work for interns and other staffers).  My experience is mainly in tax.  Our focus is on higher net worth individuals and businesses.  I also have experience with multi state returns.  Concerning college, I made good marks (3.8 GPA). 

My plan is to start applying to experienced tax associate positions at the NYC offices of the Big 4.  I do, however, have some questions and concerns that I was hoping you could help me resolve.

Will having only small firm experience hurt my prospects of getting hired?
What salary should I expect as an experienced associate in tax in NYC?
For those of you that moved from a small firm to Big 4, how much of a shock was the new workload/environment?  
In general, how do you like working in tax at Big 4 NYC (or any other office)
Do you have any tips/advice for me in obtaining this position and making this transition?

Thank you so much for your help!"

Then ""disowns"" me.",[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3delpq/vent_father_doesnt_want_to_help_me_pay_for_school/,"To sum it all up for you; I'm 25 and was accepted to a REALLY good university and received a few scholarships and grants after just completing community college. My father refuses to help me pay even though he told me to accept their offer and waive the more affordable option with the local state university. The school I was accepted to also has internship programs and 90% of graduates are employed within 6 months of graduation. 


So this whole summer, I've been working 60-70 hour weeks to cook up some cash to move with. As the first paragraph says: I was accepted to a really nice school and super excited about it. My father the N is notorious for saying one thing and doing the other. In fact, the first time I went to college right after high school I was so miserable and depressed that I dropped out and came home to work in a pizza shop because of his negative attitude that he had for me to ""study business or it's a waste of my time"". (My father never went to college, he's a high school drop out. Was a heavy drinker to the point that i think he might have brain damage or something, and is mentally ill with I think bipolar disorder. I've only seen his medication but never confirmed it with him).


My mother who's also an alcoholic narc has always told me that he ""loves me in his own way"" but it's clear to me that I'm not much more than an economic liability to him. I know that the $12,000 per semester is very expensive and I'm willing to do as much as I can.. But this man goes on 4 or 5 vacations a year and is constantly buying things he doesn't need that just collects dust. My mother also seems to have some brain damage from drinking and mental illness. She was just looked at by a psychiatrist recently because her house is being foreclosed and I think she's trying to get section 8 or some kind of hook up.


I just feel so helpless and powerless right now. Here's my golden ticket to a stable living and an environment I can thrive in, be pushed in, and work toward excellence.. 


And I can't be there because of my situation.


This morning, I was to pick up my father at 5:00 AM to bring him to work because he was catching a flight later to go on vacation. I worked a double yesterday (12 hours) in my restaurant and didn't leave the place until 9:30 and didn't get to bed until 11:00. I missed the alarm clock but still woke up and showed up to his house 20 minutes late. He did his usual scolding, but I decided to yell back. He fake-attempted to hit me twice so I punched him in the mouth, slammed on the breaks and pulled over. We got in an argument on the side of the road and he told me to bring him home. He said that after I hit him he wants nothing to do with me anymore that he's cutting me out of his life. 


I'm not blaming my parents here.. I just get so bummed out that my own well being and ""pursuit of happiness"" is affected because of my background. I'm just a poor working class guy from a notorious ""bottom of the barrel"" type of white trash town. I've wanted to escape from here all of my life. I got my ticket at 50% discount and still can't foot the bill.. All while some kids go get trashed, develop a drug addiction, then develop some bitchy whiny entitled attitude when they realize their diploma isn't a ""one free job and middle class salary"" ticket. 


I guess this post has more to do with the economic hardships and set backs of having N parents. My father refused to help pay my tuition because he was still on child support my first year of college at 17 so I had to drop out and work full-time in restaurants while doing my gen-eds part time for a few years. 


I'm 25 now and just want a fucking degree and a career. I know I'm fully capable of doing anything and everything someone with a B.A. can do. I have the work ethic of a thirsty alley mutt on a hot summer day, but negative family members like my parents set up some real tough obstacles. So in return I'm the idiot who's taking undergrad classes at 25 without having served in the military at some point. 


There's always the option of going to the state school which is super affordable; but it's still in my hometown and not New York City. Its program is good but not great. Definitely not as great as the other school I was accepted to. There's always private loans too but my mother took those out and wasn't even able to pay them back working as an attorney for 8 years.

3delv2,2,2015-07-15,Drawing tablet pen question,imatschoolandimbored,stylus,https://www.reddit.com/r/stylus/comments/3delv2/drawing_tablet_pen_question/,Hey so I recently started an IT internship at an animation studio and they asked me to look up some good replacement drawing tablet pens. Most of the drawing tablets they have are Wacoms but I'm wondering about compatibility issues. Can I buy a cheap replacement grip pen and it'll work on any tablet? or do I have to buy the expensive Wacom grip pens and will those work on any drawing tablet or only Wacoms?

We had been dating 7 months prior to moving in together and had known each other basically since preschool. 
About a month and a half ago she received news that she had received a  clinical internship out of town that she was super excited about, she wants to be a doctor. So as we were discussing this she  starts to  tell me how she cant be fair to me in the relationship and that I put in so much work and she cannot hope to reciprocate the work. I tell her this is fine I understand that this dream that you have had is super important  to you and I back you up fully.

So to understand something about my girlfriend, Channelle, she has projects going on all the time as of right now she has  this clerical internship, she has a research project required for it, she has to teach a class for it, she is studying for her MCAT, she is living in a new city, she has me, and she is  stressed out about  things back here in our town such as a premed club she runs, she works for a professor doing research, she has a normal job, and not to mention upcoming classes. In other words she is super stressed out.

Well a few weeks ago she managed to come home for a  long weekend and we got into a discussion when I asked her  how things were going. She was super excited about the internship, she absolutely loves it the only thing is she is insanely stressed she works 14 hour days at the clinic and has  to  study for her MCAT. She then proceeds to tell me that she has started to lose feelings for me ever since we moved in together  about 3 and a half months ago and that she thought at first that it was just premove in jitters, after quite a long  time of talking and many tears she manages to tell me that we can wait until after she  finishes her  internship and then we can  try and work things out.

Well yesterday was hard for me, I recently broke my hand at work and can no longer work which means  long days of sitting around doing absolutely nothing at the house, Im super depressed and sad and hadnt heard from her in two days. I  send her  a long text explaining that I miss her  and love her and   would really appreciate just getting a text saying hey miss you every day or something along the lines of that because it would mean the world to me.
It doesn't go over well she tells me that she is working  14 hour days she inst near her  phone half the day it will be 10 times worse over the next few years as she tries to become a doctor and if I'm unhappy that maybe we shouldn't be together. She  tells me that maybe I dont think about what she needs and to be honest she never tells me Im there 100 percent to support her. 

Later that night I text her and apologize for bringing this up I know she is super busy and super stressed out and that I love her and she proceeds to say that she she doesnt think it is appropriate for her to say it back.
I dont know what to do she will be gone for another 3 weeks and in that time who knows if I will still have my girlfriend or not. She is  my  first real girlfriend I have had maybe thats making it hard for me to give up but I hate to give up on anyone I care about especially someone as special as she is.

Reddit help me please.

__TLDR__: Girlfriend is super stressed out and says she started to lose her love for me about 3 and half months ago. I dont know what to do to win her back or how to move on helppppppp.

Or self as the case may be, but its boring to write to myself, so I'm going to assume that I am writing to a reader. Or perhaps my cat. If she could read. At any rate, hello. I'm Eliza, and I'm fat. Not just chubby, or pleasingly plump, honest to god, BMI 43, class 3 obese, fat as fuck fat. And I don't like that. So we're gonna change that. Well, I'm gonna change that. But I'm hoping that writing, and talking to people about it will help, because I love reddit and I need help. Changing isn't easy. And I've 'done it' once on my own before and lost 50 pounds (yay) but then I backslid and regained it all (boo). So I'm hoping a few cheerleaders, theoretical or otherwise, could help hold me accountable.

My story is pretty damn typical--I was always chunky growing up (I remember the Dr saying I was overweight in kindergarden) and did a  few diet and exercise programs, medically supervised and with nutritionists, in high school with family support and participation. But since I wasn't the driving force behind them, I didn't see how important they were, and I'm not sure if they helped or hindered me. 

Anyway, in senior year of high school I got sick. As best we can tell looking back, it was some short-term autoimmune syndrome, which is fortunately in remission. At the time, they thought it was rheumatoid arthritis. I was put on steroids to suppress the inflammation. Of course, that kind of steroids has another effect--messing with your appetite and making it really, really easy to put on weight. Add in a lot of stress eating, and I went from 180 pounds or so to 220 pounds in a year. I was miserable. And at the time, I assumed all of the new aches and pains were due to the disease progressing, so I moved less and just ate more to comfort myself. Yeah, bad move. 

Things got better in college--Sophomore year I changed doctors to Dr. Asshole. He insinuated that maybe part of why things hurt was because I was fat, and part of why I didn't feel well was that my diet was lacking. Being a rational human being and finding those insinuations rude--I knew my nutrition damn it--I decided to show him he was wrong by tracking my calories. And well, shit. I was eating okay, but too much by far. Oops. Dr. Asshole was right. Really right. As I lost weight, my joints felt better, even non weight-bearing joints. And exercise made an even bigger difference. I went from 240 or so to 187 pounds. It was awesome. 

Then came the summer after Junior year. The weight loss stalled, and the gym hours were reduced since the gym was through the school. My internship got busy. And things just, well, slipped. And then as the year got underway, slipped further. I lost a cousin to cancer complicated by mental health issues, and saw my mother with lymphoma as well (though it now turns out a type that usually progresses very, very slowly--we're talking average 4 years diagnosis to treatment, and average time of diagnosis 10 years after where hers is at, thank goodness). And what did I do when stressed with this and my two majors to complete? Yeah. I ate. And ate and ate and ate. All 50 pounds back.

So here I am, 237 pounds again, and ready to change things for good. This time I know I need help to make it stick. I've been working on my binge eating issues but good, but that's just a start. Right now I'm too big to really exercise--my knees hurt just walking around too much, and if they don't my lungs start to sting. I can feel my joints getting creaky again. This makes me angry and determined as fuck, because I got myself here again, and I sure as hell am not gonna stay like this forever. Health is not the absence of disease. It's more than that. I miss being able to hike, swim laps, and I want to try out running more than I can express. At 190 I could jog, and it felt terrible in the best way. 

**TLDR: Grew up fat. Had health problems. Got fatter. Got Pissed. Lost some weight. Got stressed. Found it again. Got really pissed. And determined.**

Doctor's appointment is tomorrow. Wish me luck. "

3df249,10,2015-07-15,Me [20 M] with my SO [20 F] of 2 years. porn and insecurity issues,pr0nthrow123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3df249/me_20_m_with_my_so_20_f_of_2_years_porn_and/,"Hello, I never thought of posting on here but decided to after reading this post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3de9ex/i_22f_found_out_my_bf_18m_was_watching_porn_when/

Please read the linked post for context, as my SO uses the exact same reasons verbatim as the OP.

I've been with my SO for a little over two years now and we were friends prior to dating. We watched porn before we started going out and for the first few months of our relationship. We even watched porn together and everything seemed fine at the time. After a few months into the relationship, SO stopped watching porn and would get very upset if I told her I watched porn and stated a lot of the reasons that were said by the OP in the linked post (such as: ""Why am I not enough?"" ""Why don't you go for a girl with bigger boobs like the pornstars?""). I explained to her that her insecurity issues are unhealthy and that I love her physically and emotionally, but agreed to give up watching porn thinking that it would help her insecurity issues. Fast forward to 1.5 years later and she is still very against me watching porn. Due to us being back home for the summer and my internship, we only see each other once a week and have sex that one day a week which is very infrequent for me. Whenever I try to bring up the idea of me watching porn again, she instantly becomes upset and assumes that I am losing attraction for her and I want other women. This is certainly not the case as I just have a fairly high libido and it's hard to masturbate without some sort of visual stimulation. She is also very insecure about her breasts even though I LOVE her titties. She has small boobs and always compares herself to other pornstars/women with big jugs, but I've always told her I love her boobs and don't care about the size! Is there anyway to talk to her about my desire to want to watch porn without making her feel unattractive? Muchas gracias

**tl;dr**: insecure gf does not like it when I watch porn but now I want to watch porn without lying behind her back."

3df6y4,2,2015-07-15,Perpetually anxious over contacting others/correspondence.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3df6y4/perpetually_anxious_over_contacting/,"Hi all,

I’m new to this sub and after browsing around I thought that this might be a good place to voice concern and hopefully get some feedback on what I can do about this particular issue.

To start off: I am a 23-year-old female. I have health insurance but am not seeing a professional at the moment because I used to see one through my university, but can’t see her anymore since I am a graduate and I haven’t found a new therapist in my price range yet. I have had significant issues with anxiety for most of my life, although I did not really realize it fully until a few years ago. I should also mention that I was in an abusive relationship a few years ago and although it definitely didn’t help any of my issues, I don’t think the particular issue I am here to write about is affected by it. I am not on any medications for my anxiety, although I used to be on 10 mg of Citalopram(Celexa), and I sometimes take herbs for my anxiety (lavender, valerian root, magnesium, etc).

It’s kind of hard for me to describe what makes me anxious, but a definite trigger is corresponding with people, either electronically or in writing. I have been known to take up to a week to respond to a text; Facebook messages can take up to a year, sometimes. Phone calls aren’t that bad, but if I miss a call and then it goes to voicemail, it might take up to a month or longer for me to check it. It is much easier for me to not open mail than it is to open mail. It doesn’t help that people tend to make jokes about my reputation as a “slow responder.”  It doesn’t really seem to matter who they are – loved ones, friends, strangers all get the same treatment. I would say that the exception to this rule is my boyfriend(not the one that abused me), I never really have trouble responding to him; I’m thinking this is because I feel like I can come to him for help if I need it and he won’t judge me, is always there for me, etc. When I don't respond to people, they understandably get upset, which augments my anxiety greatly. It makes me feel like they hate me and that there's nothing I can do to make it better; I'm a failure. I've had some very toxic friendships in the recent (last 5 years) past and I think this may play a role. I have absolutely zero problem talking to people face-to-face. It’s hard to say how long this problem has persisted, but I would definitely say that it developed over time and it got really bad during my first year of college.

I should also mention that I have a very busy life: I’m a college grad seeking a job that I am qualified for that will also pay me well (not the job I have right now), I am an unpaid intern at a non-profit 2x a week, and I sometimes work on the weekends (meaning that I sometimes work 6 days a week and the last day of my week is spent sleeping/recuperating and doing chores). I also have pets and try to maintain an active social life, which inevitably stress me out a lot sometimes. I have a good relationship with my family and boyfriend, and I seem to be well-liked by my friends, when I don’t take two weeks to respond to a text. Conversely, if I am not busy enough, I quickly get bored and depressed, and it can be hard for me to come out of that.

I know that I should speak to a professional about this, and intend to do so. But for right now I just wanted to get some basic input. What do you guys think? Any ideas on how I can try to get better at doing something so simple as sending a text within a reasonable amount of time without wanting to cry?

Thank you so much for reading! :)"
3dflt4,2,2015-07-15,"My (f25) bf (m25) is very busy in gradschool while also studying for the CPA. He claims he doesnt have time to spend with me, but makes time for other people.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dflt4/my_f25_bf_m25_is_very_busy_in_gradschool_while/,"My boyfriend started taking his grad school classes about 2 months ago. He is also studying to take his CPA exams and he is in an internship. I know he's busy, however I dont like how he is prioritizing his time.


1st incident: 


My grandma passed away; I found out sunday and her funeral was planned for the following monday. I told my bf right away and asked if he could make it. He told me he'd try but couldnt say for sure because he had to study.


the weekend rolls around and he told me he had to go to his cousins graduation. He said that he wouldnt be long, and didnt plan to go to the party after because he needed to study.


Well 6 hours passed before he eventually comes home. I asked what happened and he told me he felt obligated to go to the party and it didnt feel right leaving right after the ceremony. 


The next day I leave to go stay with my aunt because we were figuring out my grandmas estate. I asked if he would be attending the funeral and he said he would try but that it was a ""huge time commitment"" and he needed the time to study.


to his credit the funeral was an hour and a half drive so it wouldve eaten up at least 5 hours to attend, but I was still hopeful he'd show up.


Well he didnt. at first i was understanding. but the more i thought about it the more upset I became.

He was able to MAKE 6 hours out of his ""study"" time to go to a graduation. He went to that because he was ""obligated"". but he didnt feel that obligation to attend a funeral with me? my event wasn't important enough to make time for?


Well we discussed just that. I let him know I was annoyed that he didnt come, and would be understanding if he hadnt just spent an entire day before at a party. 


He told me I need to understand the pressure he's under and that as much as he wanted to go, he just couldnt. 


I eventually let it go.


Event #2:


My dad passed away 2 years ago on my birthday. My birthday is this weekend and my family is having a small get together to celebrate it/be together on the sad anniversary of his death.


My bf has known about this small gathering for weeks. He's said he'd ""try to make time"" for it.


Last weekend was his friends milestone birthday. My boyfriend spent all friday night out with him, getting drunk, then all day the next day golfing.


I reminded him that my birthday is this weekend. He told me he wouldnt make it because he needed the time to study. He is really far behind and needs to spend time catching up.


and now I am upset.


The issue I am having is I KNOW he needs time to study. I know hes under alot of stress. I am perfectly fine with him missing out on things because he needs to focus, however, hes only missing out on MY things. 


He made the time for his cousins graduation, infact he spent 6 hours at it. He made time for his friends birthday, an entire night and day. but when it comes to my birthday/anniversary of my dads death, nope, he just cant find the time. 



I have talked this out with him. I explained in advance how important the funeral was. It was the first funeral I would be attending since my fathers, and I let him know that I really needed him there. After he didnt show, I told him how disapointed I was and how I felt like it wasnt fair.


Yesterday I tried again to express how much I wanted him to be there on my birthday. That it was going to be difficult for me because I was going to also be grieving my dads passing, and how it would be nice for him to be there to help. 


The issue is I dont want to guilt trip him into doing stuff with me. I dont want to use ultimatims or force him. I want him to WANT to do these things and be there for me. 


I just dont know if I am being too overly sensitive about this, or what. 


Maybe there is another way for me to approach the subject with him, because it seems like no matter how many times I say ""but you can do x, why cant you do z with me?"" he doesnt get it.


TL:DR; Boyfriend is very busy with grad school. He is able to make time to hangout with cousins/friends but cant make time for me"

So i'm graduating from college in 4 weeks! (Yay, I've finally made it!) I've been finishing up four classes and working 40 hours a week as an intern for a company in which (I hope hires me full time upon receiving the diploma). I've been into poleing for about three years now, so much so into poleing that at one point was I was training to compete in a Florida competition... Unfortunately, a few months leading up to the event I was injured very badly (last May) and was bound to a wheel chair for 8 terribly depressing months until being able to walk again this past December.. I was able to start rehab in February and now, over a year later I can run again and even play sports. It saddened me to see how much I had regressed due to my injury when I tried to hit the pole recently.. I still seem to have the ""technique"" and muscle memory down but working on building up my strength again to do these tricks will be a great challenge. I'm still determined to train, get back in great shape, and master the art of poleing.. i'm determined to get back into competition mode and be an inspiration to others who may have to overcome life changing injuries. So my question to all of you pole addicts our there is, where can I find a relatively affordable XPole. I'm hoping to purchase a used one off the internet as a graduation gift to myself and a little motivator to get my arse back on track!.. I want to compete and I hope that by purchasing a pole, and having more free time, i'll be able to get back to where I was strength and technique wise a year ago in hopes to sign up for a competition within the next year. Anyways, thanks for reading this and feel free to share any inspiration below. &lt;3 thank you. xo

If you are selling a pole, or come by any craigslist posts, please reach out to me!

3dfwtl,704,2015-07-15,the parcel guy hates me,theparcelguyhatesme,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/3dfwtl/the_parcel_guy_hates_me/,"This whole things started like 12 years ago (i’m 25 right now). Back then, I was kind of the kid who was bullied by the “cool guys”. I never had the best grades, but never had much friends, maybe I just wore the wrong clothes, I don’t know.

There was one guy especially who never let a day pass without insulting me until he left the school for what ever reason.

Some years later, I was 20 at that point. I managed to finish school and worked for an design agency as an intern. Everyday we get a lot of stuff via parcel service. Basically we design stuff for clients and let it produce by what ever company gives us the best offer. All this stuff comes to us first, so we can take a look at the quality and send in to our customer. This stuff can be heavy. Our rooms are located in the second floor, so it’s standard procedure that the parcel guy rings the bell and one of the interns goes down, opens the door and help the underpaid guy to bring the stuff all the way up.

Time goes by and every time the parcel guy rings the bell, I went downstairs to help him carry that stuff up.

Until one day. I opened the door and there he stands. This waste of organs an blood who never let a day pass without making my life hell back in school. He looked at me without recognizing who I am, telling me he has some stuff for us and if I mind helping him to bring the stuff upstairs. I signed and instead of helping him bringing this two dozen packages of ordered paper blocks upstairs (and believe me, paper can be fucking heavy) I just told him the way, stepping outside and lit a cigarette, while telling him where he should carry all this shit. He was not really happy to do all this on his own. After delivering the last package, he passed me standing outside, while smoking my third cigarette in a row (normally I don’t smoke that much, but I had to look cool :D), just waiting for that moment when he passes me to go back to his car. The moment he passed me I said: ‘Maybe you don’t remember, but Karma does…’.

He turns around and looked me straight in the eyes and in this one moment I could see in his eyes that he recognized me. He walked straight to his car without saying a word.

After that, I saw him every other day since. And when ever he is the guy who delivers all that stuff for us, I stand outside and smoking a cigarette.

This went on for another two years. He never changed a word with me, nor did he looked me in the eyes. Since than I’m working there full-time and we have another interns. The first thing I teach them, whenever this one guy rings the bell to bring us our delivery, don’t even think about helping him, just sit outside and watch.

Sorry for my english, I’am not a native speaker, hope you enjoyed this anyways!"

1. I did a bad thing (not illegal just bad) and it could very well come to light in the next few weeks and ruin my living situation (no details, obviously) i.e. I could get kicked out.
2. I need an escape plan to move out of my parent's house ASAP just in case they ever do find out about The Bad Thing.

Here's my specs: 

1. I am a legal adult
2. I have no credit history
3. I have no debt (credit/loans or otherwise)
4. I own my own car, paid off but old (could be costly in maintenance in the near future)
5. I have a little more than $10k saved in the bank plus a $1K emergency cash fund. Zero Retirement.
6. I currently have a min. wage job that is full time right now, but is not guaranteed hours all year. Not a consistent paycheck.
7. I have 2 potential living situations: First, with a supportive family member who says I can move in immediately but temporarily on the cheap and another that's more permanent, expensive and could take time to work out the details of the arrangement
8. I have a polished resume, 4-year degree from an accredited University, several internships and positive recommendations (however have only had 1 actual job)
9. I have never paid a bill in my life and need help dealing with finances, in case I am suddenly on my own. I am extremely frugal but I know its still hard to save $ when you're on your own.
10. I live in a very expensive area. I can move to a more affordable area but I would have to factor in commute costs regardless of what job I get. 
11. I am frightened and alone. I do not have a big support system of friends. If this blows up I could very well be on the streets in a few weeks. I am not asking for handouts, and I don't want to buddy up to acquaintances just because I am in need. That's using people. 

Can you guys help me form an financial plan in case I am kicked out suddenly with little to no warning? What are my top priorities to keep myself out of debt (aside from mortgage), even when I'm paying my own bills?

Can you help me form a long-term strategy to move out? (so I can plan it quietly and move out when I am ready to buy my own house)"
3dger3,1,2015-07-15,how do I pay student loans and live?,coolgamertagbro,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3dger3/how_do_i_pay_student_loans_and_live/,"I have been deferring my student loans as long as possible and, while it might be possible to continue to do so, I would like to figure out how (even hypothetically) I could afford to pay them off. I'm going to give a bit of background information first.

I am a Marriage and Family Therapist intern working for the government making $70,000 annually. Post taxes and everything that equals out to about $3,300 to $3,500 a month (I live in the Bay Area of California). Let's say $3,400 a month for simplicity's sake.

With that $3,400 a month I have to pay $1,500 a month in rent leaving $1,900. I have the internet at my house, use electricity, etc. so I have about $150 in bills each month leaving $1,750. My old car died recently and I had to get a new one to keep my job so I am now paying $350 a month on car payments and about $80 a month on car insurance leaving $1,320. I have a credit card that I'm barely covering the interest on by paying $100 a month leaving me with $1,220. I unfortunately have to eat to stay alive though I try to eat as cheaply as possible, less than $5 a day if I can help it although sometimes I splurge when I eat with my girlfriend and spend as much as $20 - let's say an average of $10 a day leaving me with $920. My combined student loan payment for my undergrad and grad school loans are $800 a month leaving $120.

Working a full time job for the government and paying back my student loans leaves me with $120 for any emergencies plus, you know, if I ever want to do anything fun that costs money. I have recently gotten signed up to be a Lyft driver and have done that the last two weekends and am trying to figure out how to make a couple hundred bucks a week with that and think I am getting the hang of it. If I can do about $150 a week then I will have an extra $600 a month.

So my question is, /r/personalfinance - is this the best I can do? Can anyone suggest life hacks, extra ways of making cash, advice on student loans, etc.? I would really like to ask my girlfriend to marry me but I couldn't afford a ring for her right now, let alone even think of starting a family and I am not getting any younger. I feel scared, frustrated, and honestly pretty hopeless.

Thanks for advice or support in advance."
3dgije,4,2015-07-15,[Help] I [21/f] am trying to stay positive and help my bf of 3 years [21/m] keep himself together after an unexpected turn in school. **Wall of Text**,hopeless93,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3dgije/help_i_21f_am_trying_to_stay_positive_and_help_my/,"Alright, ... so I am turning to reddit because my bf is really embarrassed about what has happened and I have no one to talk to about all the anxiety that it has caused. 

**Background** 


So we are about to move in together, everything was okay until a few months ago he found out he failed every class last semester... yup every class. It was a really bad semester, he had been doing pretty okay the rest of the year. 


We were on vacation when he saw the news and he decided he was not going to contact anyone ASAP per my suggestion that he should really call his adviser and figure out a course of action... but he was just kinda ashamed and doesn't deal with failure well. (I should also mention he is Asian and he has been feeling some of the ""traditional"" pressure from his parents, like getting into grad school, do well in school, and they began comparing him to me, etc.)



**Anxiety Begins**

Now shit has hit the fan. He finally decided to check out his school email and he has been academically suspended for a year... sigh, which puts him a year behind and now risks the benefits of the internship he's currently at because they tend to offer full time jobs at the end of the internship for whenever you are scheduled to graduate. He will be talking to someone about this soon and hopefully can still get an offer but I am a little skeptical now...

&amp;nbsp;

I'm losing it inside. I am trying to put up a good front and hold my shit together for him because this has seriously broken him. At first I felt bad for him, but then I felt angry. I thought to myself if he had just called them earlier maybe just maybe he would be on probation instead and this whole shit storm of risking his degree and job offer wouldn't be happening. 

&amp;nbsp;

We were really relying on that job offer. It is out of state and we wanted to relocate because cost of living is lower and it would be a new place but now that seems to be shrinking. I feel like if I was his boss I would not want to offer him a job if he couldn't pass his classes..but that's me... 

&amp;nbsp;

I just want to know how I can support him but not enable him to sit around for a year. I told him a few days after the news that I expect him to stick to a positive routine of some sort. I expect him to get up Monday-Friday and do something productive. 

&amp;nbsp;

1)I want him to go back to the gym (because this makes him really happy and helps keep his mind off things)

&amp;nbsp;
 
2)I want him to check out taking a few elective classes at the community college to just get the last of them out of the way (he's been a little hesitant about this one, but I really wanna try to push this more in a polite way)

&amp;nbsp;

3) I also told him that I would like him to find a job or internship in his related field. He doesn't need one that pays because he is fine financially, so he could really do anything. I just want him out of the house every day for a few hours. 

&amp;nbsp;

4) I also would like him to help more with household chores, originally I would have been a little more involved in that but now that he won't be in school and I'm starting grad school I would just like the extra help so I can focus on studying. 

&amp;nbsp;

He's open to most of these things that I want him to step up and do. I told him I'm here for him and that we will get past this speed bump, so I'm trying not to come off rude about his situation. I really want to sit him down and talk about our future and what this means in terms of career and graduation timelines. I also want us to develop a schedule together that reflects stuff he likes to do and stuff he should do. I just don't know how to do this without him shutting down. He has a hard time talking about this and prefers to sometimes drop it all together than deal with it. Any suggestions would be great. 



**TLDR, bf suspended from college for a year, trying to keep him positive/busy/productive for the year. Have some fears and anxieties and goals that I would like to talk to him about but sometimes he shuts down because of how stressed it makes him.**

Thanks everyone. "

Not just because I have ADHD, but I'm also an atheist and I don't drink or go out like other college kids. However, I am very genuine and a pretty interesting person (if I do say so myself :P) once you get to know me and if you can relate to and/or accept the different things about me.

I have 3 semesters left in college, majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently working as a software development intern. I can be kind of nerdy when it comes to computers (and I spend a fair bit of time playing a PC game), but I'm definitely not the stereotypical nerd. I'm always seeking to improve myself in regards to health, personality, how I dress/present myself, etc. and I don't fit the typical nerd mold.

Anyway, I'll stop talking now. If you're interested feel free to PM me your kik username. It can be purely a platonic thing, or we can get into some dirty stuff eventually too if that's what you're looking for. Looking forward to hearing from you!"
3dgt5s,8,2015-07-15,"My [21 F] best friend [21 F] of 6 years, is being controlling because of her new boyfriend.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dgt5s/my_21_f_best_friend_21_f_of_6_years_is_being/,"My best friend S and I met this guy D 1 year ago. We all took a small class together in college and got pretty close as friends. D fell in love with S but she shot him down and he stopped talking to her as much since it was hard being friends with S while still in love with her. D and I continued being good friends throughout the year.

 At the end of this school year, S broke up with her boyfriend to be with D because she claimed she was in love with D. I knew D still had feelings for her, so I encouraged her to tell him. They started dating the week of school ending.

 All 3 of us have summer internships. D and me have different internships in the same city, however S is a 5 hour drive away. I am in a city where my only friend from school is D, so I met up with him for coffee to catch up a month ago since we hadn't seen each other since school ended. S told me it was fine to go see him but at the last second flipped out. She said I betrayed her and that when she changed her mind 30 minutes before I was supposed to meet D, I should have cancelled even though I was at work and couldn't. And I had asked her multiple times if she was ok with it and she told me she never wants any guy to get in between us and that of course it's ok. She was furious and insulted me by throwing my past mistakes in my face and telling me ""now she knows where my loyalties lie, with myself"". She fought with me for a week over how I betrayed her and didn't care about her feelings and how dare I go on a date with her bf. I apologized to her and tried to explain to her that I couldn't cancel since I am not allowed to use my phone at work. I saw him for coffee for 1 hour.  D was thankful I encouraged S to confess her feelings.

I forgave her for this fiasco, telling her I understand she was feeling jealous, but she needed to control her emotions and see that I am her friend, not someone trying to steal him away and that I understand she feels left out. She apologized for getting so angry and that she brought up my abusive ex. She told me she was unreasonable and didn't want to be controlling and she wanted me and D to be friends. She said she's just unhappy with her internship and told me that next time I see him she'll be fine. 

It's been a month and I asked her if she minded if I meet with him to catch up again. Our internships are at competing companies so we do the same type of work and it's nice to have someone to discuss it with. D and I were friends the entire year him and S didn't speak. He is one of my closest friends at school so catching up with him wasn't an unusual thing for me to do. I decided to tell her about my intentions to see D to catch up. I thought she realized that what she had done last time was completely inappropriate and hurtful. However, she got mad and asked if it's ""ok if I go on coffee dates with your future boyfriends"" to which I responded that if they are friends then I have no problem with it. She also knows I am very interested in another mutual friend of ours and I told her that if I started dating him, I don't expect her to stop being friends with him. All of us are friends! We all hang out together. S has always had a problem where she would completely exclude her previous bfs from her friend circle and then get mad at me when I didn't want her bf around since we weren't friends. She told me she wants D to be different and that she wants all of us to continue being friends, but she's not acting like it!

She got mad and said I'm hypocritical and selfish and I don't empathize with her. She then said she doesn't want to deal with this and she is getting too emotional and that she'll deal with me later. But I do empathize with her because I know what it feels like to get jealous. I just don't understand how she can be so cruel, instead of actually talking about her feelings with me and explaining to me what she wants me to do. She will tell me to do what I want and that it's fine, but then will blow up at me!

Guys, this is my best friend and this is SOOO completely out of character for her. I've never been friends with her past bfs and that could be why we never had this issue. She claims she trusts me but it doesn't feel like it. I love her so much and she just keeps hurting me by refusing to be reasonable and throwing insults in my face whenever I try to talk about the problem with her. I would really like to talk to her and get to the bottom of this issue without insults or emotions.  I know I wasn't the perfect friend in the past so I'm trying to be patient but it isn't getting better and I feel controlled and manipulated. I just want her to stop treating me like the enemy and telling me it's ok when it's not.  We have gone through hell together and she is like a sister to me but I can't get through to her! What do I do? I want to be friends with her but I refuse to be treated like this. Help.

3dh0kp,3,2015-07-16,"Me [29 F] have been with my bf [32 M] 10 years, off and on, doesn't seem like the relationship is going anywhere. **tl;dr**: He's unemployed, lives with me and hasn't paid rent in years. Should I break up with him?",dasawkwardpenguin,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dh0kp/me_29_f_have_been_with_my_bf_32_m_10_years_off/,"I started dating John, my boyfriend, when we were in college.  We had a passionate, awesome relationship for several years, but we eventually broke up while we were in a long distance relationship during grad school.  The breakups hit me hard.  He was very immature and sometimes didn't treat me well (ex: comparing me to other women).  And he's never admitted to it, but I think he crossed a line or two with other women while we were away at different graduate schools.  He definitely sowed his wild oats while we were broken up.  

Nonetheless, I loved him and wanted things to work out.  So, I did what everyone says to do when you break up (worked out and moved on), and he showed up again.  Of course, I thought after a tough few years and a changed outlook, we would be ready for a real relationship that would progress towards marriage.

After law school, we moved to the same city, where I worked for many years.  Unfortunately, he did not have very good job prospects after graduation.  When internships and high-paying full-time jobs didn't pan out, he never really tried to get a job in his field again nor did he take any of the unpaid apprenticeships and fellowships that were common for not-yet-employed people in his field.  Instead, he worked some temp and low-paying jobs but tended to be unemployed for lengthy periods between gigs.

During that time, I had some suspicion he cheated but could only prove it once.  I began to withdraw and worked on myself.  I think this was the first time he really felt like he might lose me forever, so he shaped up and became a better human being.  

In the last several years, he has become a much better person.  Not only is he more caring, but he helps around the house and tries to show support in intangible ways.  But during that time, I noticed that he was mostly with me at my apartment rather than at his place.  At some point, he moved in. It was a blur for me because he had spent almost all of his time at my place even though he had his own apartment, and he didn't exactly declare his intention of moving in so I don't know exactly when he crossed over from boyfriend to live-in boyfriend.  But at some point, he fessed up to no longer having his own place and moving in without asking.  Yes, I'm a fool for not noticing or saying anything when I did notice and yes I'm still beating myself up for it.

Fast forward a few years.  I moved to a new city for work.  He lasted a VERY short time in our old city before he followed me to my new place.  He hadn't been working for at least a year when I moved and he didn't have anything lined up when he moved to my new city.  

Equipped with the knowledge of how things had gone in the past, I asked him to pay rent if he was going to stay with me.  Given that he didn't (and still doesn't) have a job, I asked him to pay only 25% of the rent.  He scrapped up the money exactly one month but **hasn't paid rent the rest of the time.**  

On top of that, **I'm starting to feel like I'm in a dead-end relationship with no likelihood of marriage.**  And I sometimes question why it would be rational to marry him given our history and current situation.  I think about these issues most days and hate how resigned I've been feeling lately.  

He didn't always treat me well when life was rosy, hasn't established a real career in half a decade and just seems to be dabbling in different (non-paying) projects.**  He loves me, yes, but some days I feel like screaming before coming back to the feeling that I would not want to be cast out if I were unemployed.  Then again, being chronically unemployed or underemployed for over half a decade seems extreme and indicative of long-term problems.

**tl;dr** **I feel like a fool for dating my struggling guy for so long, especially in light of how he has treated me in the past.  Yes, he loves me now but I'm starting to wonder whether he will ever propose and whether he is only motivated to stay with me so he can live for free.**  Am I a fool for still being in this relationship or should I give him more time to get his act together?

Because i have started my internship, i spend all of my day out of home and as it wasnt enough i started to go to the gym as well hahahahaha, so during the week i just dont have any time to play anything.

Another reason is those updates, i know that 1.9 is going to take a while, but we are playing in 1.8 for too long, almost a year and i do have ideas, but i dont have patience to play. Also August is the month that i'm going to come back to my beloved and caotic country, so i have no idea whether im still going to play there or i'll stop definetly. Anyway, for sure, untill the end of this month i wont play, maybe the firsts weeks of August i'll play a little bit, but nothing for sure. I hope that it is not a problem and keep posting photos and ideas anywhere, i do read them and maybe it could motivate me to play once again with you.

I finished my music industry degree last year and straight out (november 2014) scored an Internship at an independent label. That finished a few weeks ago. I've been applying constantly for industry and non-industry casual jobs whilst interning and have got nothing. I scored an interview this week for a music publishing job and waiting to hear back.



But I feel so strongly in finding a job in the music industry that I'm rejecting everything else. I was offered a full time position at a clothing store - became all hesitant and turned it down. Then today I was offered a full time position for 4 months being a stand in for a tv show and just said the wrong thing and screwed it up. It was a 50 hour work week for 4 months, that also madE me hesitate. I didnt 100% want both of those jobs but just having something to do wouldve been good? If they were part time I wouldve jumped right on board. Is this bad thinking? I currently work casually at a supermarket (1 shift a fortnight) and doing extra roles for film and tv (1 shift a fortnight) so why didn't I take those full time opportunities? I do nothing else with my days, unless I occasionally see friends when they are free. What the hell is wrong with me?



THen I also have a problem with saying something and never following through. For over 6 months I've been saying I want to go learn another language, found the school but still never went a did it. Same with a short acting course. For god sakes I've been wanting to play a sport for the last few years but I've never doing anything about it!! How can I change this? is it because I want to do so much? I have talks with my parents about wanting to change all this, feel motivated for a day and then the days roll by and I'm back where I started.. having the talk again.



And I've been meaning to meet a girl but every time I see one out I get scared and say I'll approach next time and it never happens. I've had things with girls but nothing serious and nothing that last more than a few months. I feel like all my friends and doing such amazing things whether it be going overseas, having constant work and going out while most of the time I'm just stuck at home bcos I dont know what do/too lazy. I just feel so low that Im not achieving anything. Any help would be so appreciated."

Help me make sense of this crazy situation I've gotten myself into. This will be long, but I'll try to stay concise. Please forgive me, as these descriptions do neither incredible and wonderful men justice. 


I dated Alex for 2 years. We lived together, and broke up when he got a good job offer in another country. I'm in school, so moving away is not an option right now. 
Our relationship wasnt going great at that point anyway. We were always a good couple but I never got the impression we'd be together forever. I did get an impression we'd always be friends. We have a lot in common, lots of mutual friends and interests, and our career goals are very similar. We are great friends. I didn't feel especially close or connected in our relationship, communication was lacking, and things were just gently getting worse. So he let, we stayed in touch, and I happily moved on. 
Alex was great, I'm great, and I was ready for something deeper. 



A few months later, I met Jay. 
My time with Jay was been... just what I always hoped to find in partner. We effortlessly connect, we have lots in common, we both seem to love each other deeply, and sparks fly everyday. He fills me with that passion and drive to write poems and sonnets, and I feel so good and so at peace by his side. I feel right. It feels right. 
We both seem to feel the same. How lucky are we to have found each other, right?!




We dated for a year, but it was off and on, because of me. 
Unfortunately, we don't verbally communicate well, so issues come up over basic misunderstandings. He is a great guy, but immature and unrefined in some ways. He can act like such a teenager, especially when it comes to expressing himself to in handling a situation. 


Also, last summer, a month into dating Jay (one incredible, cosmic, beautiful month), I left for a month. I traveled with Alex and a few other friends abroad, and at the end of the trip Alex confessed he had serious feelings for me. He felt I was wonderful and amazing, and regrets not taking us more seriously. He wanted to be together, but was remaining abroad for another few months... Maybe up to a year. He wanted to know if we could try a relationship again when he returned, whenever that was. 
I was flattered, and I do love him. It blindsided me though, and I did not know what to say. I had just spent the last few weeks telling him and the rest of our friends all about Jay. 
I always felt Alex and I would be close friends, and at that time, I was very excited for Jay. It has always been easy to identify how I feel for Jay. It's undeniable. 
I left Alex without giving promises outside of being his friend, and being honest. 



When I came home, I struggled with Jays maturity. Alex was a great partner, was very responsible, and really challenged me to be a better person.  I had gotten used to a fast paced relationship, and didn't realize how much of me has changed because of Alex. 


Jay would have been perfect for 23 year old me. I feel like I've outgrown the patience and tolerance for some of his behaviors, habits and attitudes. Within a few months of dating Jay, despite my deep feelings for him, I was back and forth about taking a break. He drives me crazy. 


He's not financially stable.
He never maintained a job, and worked odd jobs under the table. 
He did start school after we met, after I motivated him to, and he's doing well in it. It was never a full time school schedule though, and there was no excuse not to find a decent job. He's also chronically late and chronically in trouble with the admin. 
He doesn't have a lot of drive or motivation.  He wants a lot of things, but there doesn't seem to be a real drive.
He was reliably unreliable, though he always there when you needed him. 

Lastly, he lived with his mom. He had been living in another state and moved back to this state and in with his mom right before we met. The plan was to find a job, save money, get a place... But it never happened. 


We never got to a serious point on our relationship. I didn't feel like I could really depend on him in an adult way, as much as both of us seemed to want that with one another. I couldn't let myself go that deep with him. 


I love him so much but he clearly has some growing to do.
However, I couldn't get enough of him for that year. We didn't just fall in love; it was like we had always known each other. If it were up to him we would have been committed after a few months. 


So 2 months ago I left home for a 10 week internship abroad. This had been planned for a while, and Jay was unhappy but nevertheless very supportive about me going and furthering professional opportunities. He knew I'd also be seeing Alex, and knew how Alex feels about me. 
We didn't talk much about me leaving, but verbal communication was never a strong point for us. It worth mentioning though, we always got our points across well when we needed to, and we usually understood one another well. We had more or less discussed not trying anything long distance. 
It was more than that though. I wanted to give him space. I needed to see some change. Some growth. Growth without me. 



I am now traveling with Alex. He's convinced he's going to sweep me off my feet and we'll fall in love.
It's tempting. My time with Alex was been amazing. We've had a beautiful time together. We've really grown individually and get along perfectly now. Any issues from our relationship are in the past.  He wants to plan a future. I want to plan future. I want a nice home and good friends and a career and love. He wants a lot of the same things. 


But I can't open myself entirely to him just yet. I am still so in love with Jay. But what future do I have with Jay?
I have been going back and forth for months, for maybe the last year, who would be better for me, and who I would be better for. 
 

So, here is where I am struggling. I want and trying to look at this objectively, from all angles.
 

Alex is very driven. He's smart, talented, and professional. Hes very charismatic, engaging, and everyone likes him. He introduces me to the world in a way I love. He loves food, culture, entertainment, and stays busy. He's got plans, and I like them. He likes my plans. We have a lot mutual friends. His family is very nice, but very religious. We are both not religious and never would be. Our lifestyles align very well. A life with him would never be dull, and I'd probably never want for anything. I am not in love with him right now, but it wouldn't take long if I opened myself to it. We are both in the same place in life. He does not want kids. Wanting kids is a likely a deal breaker for Alex. 

*(I had always planned to stay professionally good friends with him, and if we didn't work out romantically, we'd likely still be associates and work together.)*




So now for Jay. 
Jay is talented. He is warm and loving, he's very insightful and thirsty for knowledge. He's got a great family, though his friends are a little hit or miss. He's sweet and thoughtful in the same ways I am, he'll eat anything I cook, he's not judgmental or critical, and is infallibly supportive of anything I do. Our lives align ok, but there would be come adjustment and negotiating. Jays lifestyle is a little different from mine, but ultimately, he's happy to go along with me when I want to do something, and I usually feel the same. Jay would make an amazing father and a great spouse in regards to raising a family. I'm not sure what I'd prefer though. Babies sound great, but not having a baby also sounds great. 
I feel something about Jay I can't or don't ever want to let go of. It seems he feels the same. Simply put, soul mates come to mind. 


In planning my future, with my SO being a mystery, I have basically planned for a life with Alex. I feel like choosing Jay would out me down a different path, with more hurdles and obstacles. Life has already been pretty difficult; I don't want any more wacky drama. Jay does not have his life together. Alex does. Alex has nearly everything I want, but so does Jay doesn't fall far behind. 



I like the idea of having kids about as much as I like never having kids. It would ultimately co,e down to my SO; I'd probably never have kids with Alex, and would likely have kids with Jay. 



**Alex and Jay both know how I feel.** Alex knows more overall. He knows pretty much everything I've said hear about Jay. 
Jay and I are in contact, and plan to meet when I'm home in a few weeks. 
Alex wants to be together, he wants to find an apartment together, and run off into the sunset. 
Jay also wants this, and seems to be working to prove he can be the more responsible guy I need. 
Jay has gotten a job and graduated from his school/ program since I left. It's only been 2 months though. He still has a lot to sort out. 



I could go on and on about them but I'll stop here and hope for some insight. I want to go for it with Alex, but my feelings for Jay are holding me back. I need some rational feedback! 



Lastly, please don't recommend I spend some time alone to figure things out. I have spent time alone. And now I've spent quality time with each of them. I know the answer is within me but I'm struggling to find it. I thought it would have come to me by now. 
(Or the answer has come to me, and it's been here all along, and I don't want to listen. Choosing Jay would be a hard choice in a lot of ways.)



Have I expressed this dilemma well at all? I'm confident about a future with either guy. I can't keep dancing the fence between the two though.  They both definitely want more. I don't know how to justify the choice. 

**TL;DR: I feel torn between 2 wonderful men. I feel it comes down to nature or nurture: do I choose the guy I feel naturally meant for, or the guy I've nurtured myself to attract? How can I chose one and forgive myself for losing the other?
If one is my soul mate but his lifestyle doesn't match with mine, should I chose the great guy with the great lifestyle, whom I also love? Where you do draw the line between feelings and rational choices?**

3dhjjs,1,2015-07-16,Question: Sunscreen and seborrheic dermatitis recommendations,[deleted],AsianBeauty,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3dhjjs/question_sunscreen_and_seborrheic_dermatitis/,"Just to start, this subreddit is amazingly welcoming and encouraged me to de-lurk after a loooong time. Big love &lt;3



After I got into taking care of my skin, I helped my mother out with her issues, which turned out to be dry skin, wrinkles and seb derm. She's AHA-ing and loving evening primrose oil BUT she's not applying sunscreen as she says she barely gets any sun exposure (sits in front of a window all day though). Yikes. 



I’ve been using the pink Missha all around safe block sun SPF 45/PA +++ and it leaves me a shiny mess. So I’m looking for something else (thinking about trying the biore watery gel next). And as my mother has seen my shiny face, she’s reluctant to wear it as well. Do you have any recommendations for a sun screen that would work well for her (and me with my desert face)?



Also, I’m going to be hauling soon (YAY for paid internships) and wanted to pick something up for her. Any tips on seb derm-friendly AB goodies?

3dhrwh,27,2015-07-16,An outsider looking in,litehacker,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/3dhrwh/an_outsider_looking_in/,"Hello all,

I am a software engineer working in the financial district in Manhattan.

I have a new girlfriend, who is going through her 1st year of residency.

Through her experiences, I've been open to this whole new world of stress and no sleep that many people in medicine are almost *expected* to go through.

Let's start off with me - I received a bachelor degree of science. I have worked at several different jobs in New York and New Jersey. This included a paid internship in my computer field, which I did when I was in High School.

All of these jobs, whether I liked them or not, had the following qualities:

1. I had to work 8 - 9 hours a day, except in some really rare curcumstances.
2. During these 8 - 9 hours, I had a full hour of lunch that I can take any time I want, as long as I get my work done.
3. If I give at least a month's notice in advanced, I can choose any set of days in a year that I want to go on vacation.
4. Any time I switched to a new job, I'd get a higher pay since I had new skills from the previous job.

Now, let me compare this to my SO:

1. She is expected to work at least 12 hours a day, but usually it goes on for 14-15 hours.
2. She usually has no time - She can get interrupted at any time with her pager and is forced to drop everything she is currently doing to address the current issue. This means potentially, no lunch.
3. She does not have a stable schedule - Residents who have been in the hospital for more years than her, set the schedule, for some reason.
4. All of her vacation days have been set up in advanced before starting the residency. (If you get sick, you have to ask a friend to cover for you...)
5. She can't switch jobs. There is no alternative.

After understanding all of this, I quickly realized a few problems. But here is the major one:

Some time ago, a restriction was put on the amount of hours residents should work.

However, the hospital did not cut the amount of work required to be done. Hence, the hospital expects you to work faster. Doctors blame themselves when they cannot finish work as fast as has been set up for them. They lie on time reporting, to make it look like they finish everything within the legal limits.

I've been trying to find the cause of all of this... Why do residents get so much work? Why is are there so few residents working at a the hospital that there are no free people available to pick up if someone goes on vacation? Why is it so hard to find a hospital with open internship spots?

I've done a bit of research on this, and eventually found this lawsuit:

[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/us/medical-students-sue-over-residency-system.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/us/medical-students-sue-over-residency-system.html)

Apparently the whole medical match day system is responsible for artificially limiting the number of doctors that can work for a hosptial for some reason, plus they set the amount of money anyone receives, and how many hours they should work. Pretty much, they control the whole system, just like they used to do in the soviet union.

*EDIT: It looks like everyone is focusing on my example solution, instead of the problem. So, I'll cross the solution out, as that wasn't the point.*

~~The lawsuit was trying to get lots of money in compensation, and ultimately lost.~~

~~However, I'd propose something different that would not necessarily cause financial harm to anyone?~~

~~Increase the number of residents per hospital, but pay them less.~~

~~For example, if residents currently get $40,000 and work for 16 hours each, double the number of residents per hospital, and pay each $20,000 and work for 8 hours each.~~

~~This is considered continued education as opposed to employment, hence the pay would be considered more like a stipend.~~

~~The 8 hours would be less stressful. Plus residents wouldn’t have as hard as a time to find a hospital to work in.~~

~~That is just one solution.. but anyway,~~

The stuff doctors have to go through is really stressful, and I believe most people outside of medicine are unaware of the indentured servitude doctors have to go through.

If more people were aware of the difficulties that doctors have to go through, there would be reform going on.

It's just that doctors have been trained to follow directions, and that is what they do - even if it affects their long term health, wealth, and social life negatively."

3di14o,14,2015-07-16,People want the McPherson extinction story because real collapse is boring and sucks,builenbrand,ranprieur,https://www.reddit.com/r/ranprieur/comments/3di14o/people_want_the_mcpherson_extinction_story/,"I think one thing that makes the McPherson extinction theory so attractive is the fact that it offers us a way out of having to deal with the real collapse. John Michael Greer was probably the first to notice that. 

I suspect that part of the appeal of McPherson is for people like me, who thought that collapse would be exciting, but while waiting for the collapse began to figure out that the collapse is already happening and it looks far more depressing than we were expecting it to be.

The real collapse doesn't seem to look like MadMax, total anarchy where you move from place to place and are at continual risk of being brutally murdered. That's what I've hoped for all my life, but I'm starting to think that probably won't happen.

Instead, when you look more carefully at what has happened, we didn't get chaos or anarchy, rather, it seems that the government and the economic structure that rule our world stays in power and new money is to be made by dealing with the consequences of the collapse. 

Half the houses in a street may be deserted, but they're administered by corporations on behalve of their formal owners so you can't move into them and if you do, the frightened neighbors call the cops anyway.

You will still need to eat and if you're poor or unemployed people still think of you as a loser, even the other poor and unemployed, so 90+% of people still won't want to interact with you. What happens to jobs is that they become more boring and ethically disgusting. Instead of having a chance to become an artist, there's a massive surge in employers looking for debt collectors, or 3 dollar an hour jobs as waiters.

Instead of moving out of the city to a remote space to grow your own food, the land is made more unaccessible than ever before, used to grow biofuels or trees that are used as ""renewable energy"". You're forced to stay stuck in the city, because that's where jobs are and you can't afford transportation anymore.

Instead of land or buildings gradually going to waste and being overgrown with plants, the government ""creates jobs"" by paying people to maintain infrastructure that's no longer needed, to turn the place into a potemkin village and attract investors.

Instead of people feeling more liberated and caring less about what others might think, they become forced to be ever more obedient, because leaving any bad impression anywhere might render you permanently unemployable if someone photographs you and uses your real name on the internet. ""Oh that's Sarah O'Connor!"" as a line anonymously commented somewhere on the world wide web under some picture of a woman dumpsterdiving is enough to force her into an endless series of minimum wage jobs.

You might think I'm exaggerating, but this is simply what happens. Shock-blogs in my country post pictures of some drunk student who urinated in a train. Bad behavior obviously, but most of us have done bad things while drunk, without having our face plastered all over the internet for millions of people to see. Note the important part here: His friends published the photographs. Why? Well, if you're permanently impoverished, giving some shitty weblog a scoop will net you a few hundred euros, which becomes more valuable than your friendship and self-respect.

People become unemployed, but it doesn't give them free time to figure out meaningful experiences for themselves. Instead, they find themselves ""volunteering"" or doing unpaid internships, to build up ""experience"". If they do this long enough, they're allowed to work somewhere for a bit.
 
Collapse so far appears to result in centralized control not dying, but rather, being internalised by the population itself, government itself becoming part of ""the cloud"". There are even programs to financially reward people through use of Bitcoin who anonymously report pirated movies on the internet. It is as if we all become part-time mall cops.

Thus, in light of what collapse actually looks like, I can't blame people for hoping that the oceans simply boil off instead."

This is a story from a couple of years back I thought I'd share. I was working as an intern at [local computer shop] with the owner and two other interns to fulfill my uni's requirements for hands-on experience.

This shop bought old desktop pcs and laptops formerly leased by various businesses that didn't need them anymore. After the shop acquires them, they go through a thorough check and they are scrubbed and prepped for immediate client use.

I'm in charge of the floor during one of the warmer days we get around here up north in summer as a middle-aged man (MAM) busts in from the door with his two 7-9 year(ish) old kids.

&gt; MAM: Which one is your fastest laptop?!

*Oooh, lovely. He's in a hurry. Smells like trouble.*

I proceed to guide him to the item requested.

&gt; Me: Here we go, this laptop is th-

&gt; MAM: Can it run SimCity 3000?

&gt; Me: Yes, I'm quite sure of that.

*Don't go cutting people off like that... And why SimCity 3000 of all things?*

&gt; MAM: It's not exactly top-of-the-line, now is it?

&gt; Me: Uh, no Sir. After all, we *do* sell used computers.

&gt; MAM: 270 is pricey.

*Oh god here we go*

&gt; MAM: You can take off a 100 from that price.

*100 off 270?! ARE YOU F'ING KIDDING ME?! Go back to whatever farm field you grew out of.*

&gt; Me: Sir, our current prices are as low as we can put them.

&gt; MAM: As if. How much **can** you lower the price.

*Oh FFS.*

&gt; Me: Sir, as I said before, we cannot lower the prices any lower than this.

&gt; MAM: Of course you can.

*This dude isn't even listening, is he?*

&gt; Me: I'm sorry, we really can't. I can offer a bag for the laptop and an optic mouse to go with it for free, though.

&gt; MAM: No, I'm not interested. I can find cheaper and better laptops on [online auction site].

*THEN. WHY. ARE. YOU. HERE?*

MAM prepares to leave, obviously the final attempt to make me lower the price.

*Eh, I've got nothing to lose here. Let's go with a reality check.*

&gt; Me: I'm sure you can, Sir. I'd also like to note that our computers are clean inside and out and, unlike [online auction site] you mentioned, we can offer a guarantee for your purchase.

MAM stops on his tracks, and thinks for a second.

&gt; MAM: Fine, FINE! I'LL BUY IT. Jesus you're annoying.

*Thanks! If it's from you, I'll take that as a compliment.*

The shop gets the money, he took his stuff and the receipt and storms out of the shop with his kids who've been awfully silent the whole time.

**VICTORY**

Before I went back to my stand-by post I took a quick look around the floor to check that everything's still in place.

Then I noticed that the section where peripherals are is a complete mess. Mouses on the floor, some had their cables in weird and complex knots, keys off keyboards, cables not where they aren't supposed to be, etc., etc.

Gears begin to slowly turn in my head...

*THE KIDS.*

I spend the rest of the day cleaning up the mess they'd made.

Feels more like a Pyrrhic victory.

TL;DR: Man thought he could bargain but couldn't. Instead, his kids ruined my day for him.

So please bear with me if I messed something up 'cuzz I am a little bit nervous about making this post. I wasn't even sure if it was a good idea, however a friend of mine who got to read it encouraged me to share it with you guys.

I started making this article( the first of many I hope) because I really enjoy reading esports content about  League of Legends and unfortunately I find most articles on lolesports.com underwhelming and lacking substance considering those are articles written by pros who are paid for their work. I one day hope to get an internship at Rito in this field and prove than I can make more entertaining articles for people like you to enjoy reading.
I really enjoy constructive criticism so I will be eager to see the feedback I will be getting.

Things to have in mind before bashing me ^_^ : 1) I am not a native English speaker so I guess you will find some grammatical mistakes. ( please PM me about them so I can correct them ASAP)
2) I would like to give credit to the user "" gkardos"" for the streamables he created for the Fnatic vs Origen match that I used in this article. I would try to create my own in the future.
3) Just as I was typing this I realized that the pictures and charts won't appear in this post ...

Without further ado ....


 

Watching the entirety  of the League of Legends scene and how massively it’s competitivity has evolved in the recent years you may think is hard, almost impossible to break new records.
Despite all of this, the European kings of spring split have managed to secure for themselves the biggest winning streak record in the entirety of LCS, going an impressive 14-0 . Whats even more  impressive is that they managed to achieve this success in the most challenging week for the them in summer split, they having to face both of the runner ups: Origen and H2K.
Going into the week 7 EU LCS the question of everybody’s mind was : “Will this be the week in which Fnatic will take their first loss or will they go undefeated and will they set up a new winning streak ?”.

Round one : Enter H2K
 
Throughout the summer split the team coached by Neil “Pr0lly” Hammad has certainly made a name for themselves for their fast map rotation and lane swapping, H2K adopting a slight koreeanesque style of playing, slowly chocking their opponents out of resources until they are left dry.
Even at the Picks &amp; Bans you could clearly see that H2K came up with a sound strategy against the undefeated Fnatic by targeting Kim Reignover Ui-jin’s champion pool and negating him all of the tier 1 jungle champions including Olaf, something that only Reignover has managed to master to become a tier 1 pick for himself.
Leaded into the Summoner’s Rift by Raymond ""kaSing"" Tsang the support and shotcaller of the team which pulled an unexpected Shen support, H2K really wanted to stop Fnatic’s winning streak at all costs.
The early  game turned out be unlike anyone even imagined, with H2K getting the best possible start with a 2 kill advantage on Andrei “Odoamne” Pascu Gnar after a failed invade attempt on Fnatic’s part near H2K’s  red buff area. All of this was possible thanks to an ingenious ward on the botlane tribush which got a glimpse of 4 members of Fnatic’s team. After this it was all a matter of  waiting into the fog of war and collapsing upon the unexpected Fnatic which resulted in the death of Reignover and YellOwStaR and over 1 thousand gold avantage to H2K even before the minions started to spawn on the map.

H2K’s gold advantage continue to grow after Reignover’s gank top lane around the 8 minute mark. Though a good idea in itself, to try to hold back the already fed Gnar, the gank was falterd thanks to kaSing’s Shen ultimate who just reached level 6 a few seconds before Gnar could be put down.This miraculously Stand United completely turned the fight around resulting in both Reignover and Huni’s deaths, thus expanding the lead to 1,7 thousand gold and making the H2K fans in the stage scream for the “ kaSing effect”.
The situation was becoming dire and dire for Fnatic as H2K continue to pressure them by taking some early towers and after another confrontation on top lane which went awful for them because of Huni’s missclick on Zhonya way earlier then he should have, they got another 3 deaths on board and expanding the gold lead for H2K to 3,7 thousand at the 17 minutes
This pace continued for a few other minutes and at 20 minute mark  Fnatic found themselves looking at a 8-1 score and almost 5k gold advantage for H2K and even the casters began to wonder if 13 will be the unlucky number which will break the chain of wins.
But then it happened, Fnatic did what they do best. They’ve managed to find an opening for a favorable fight in the corridor above the Baron pit by catching Jean-Victor ""loulex"" Burgevin off-guard and they just collapsed on him and the ensuing team of H2K who came in his help.               
Thorough the confident shotcalling of Fnatic’s veteran and leader Bora "" YellOwStaR "" Kim the rest of his squad managed to time and execute their part flawlessly securing an Ace for themselves  fallowed by a Baron and just like that Fnatic were back on board for their 13 win a row.
From there onwards things started to spiral out of control for the H2K team as Fnatic gradually started pushing them back more and more inside their own base. This happened partly because of no pink wards on the map for the blue side team thus they couldn’t really contest Fnatic’s vision control on one hand and on the other they  couldn’t find an opening to flank Fnatic’s carries in the backline with a Shen’s flash + taunt combo or a Gnar in mega form due to Fnatic’s superb positioning which earned them the unnoficial title of the best fighting team in Europe. 
After another teamfight at 34 minute mark which resulted in the second Baron and almost the second Ace for Fnatic courtesy to Fabian ""Febiven"" Diepstraten poke damage, who the public and casters alike  dubbed him “ The European Sniper “ for his spot on skill shots, YellOwStaR’s team seemed to hit the final nail in the adversaries coffin.
Two minutes afterward Fnatic won decisively the last teamfight of the game, brought down their enemy’s Nexus and managed to keep their undefeated title.
 

Looking at the chart bellow concerning gold lead between the two teams you may think you are looking at the financial collapse of 2008.
 

Coach Prolly’s team has managed to secure a lead for themselves even before the laning phase could begin, especially Odoamne who couldn’t ask for a more better start.
And even beyond that, their advantage keep rising slighty until de 22 minute mark. Unfortunetly for them they couldn’t raise it to a deciding point or even keep it which could have been more easier to do if Odoamne would have used his early gold to rush a Black Cleaver and started to split push right after the laning phase ended because none of the Fnatic members that time could have defended 1v1 versus a fed Gnar so early in the game. Instead they got baited into a teamfight in which Fnatic got the upper hand despite being behind in gold.The moment Fnatic got the lead in gold they just snowballed out of control and secure the win against one of their two greatest competitors.

Round two : Once close teammates, now  heated rivals
 

For the second game in the week 7 of EU LCS Fnatic had to face-off for the second time against two former iconic members of Fnatic: Enrique xPeke Cedeño Martínez  and Paul  sOAZ Boyer who have departed from the Fnatic organization after Season 4 World Championship and started Origen with xPeke as the owner of the team.	
While their first head to head match-up was clearly in favor of Fnatic back in week 4, now both teams realized that it will be a total different ball game.
Martin Rekkles Larson said in pre-game that “there will a lot of blood to be spill “ in this upcoming  Game of the Week. 	
Going into the pick and ban phase, Origen coach Titus ""Ducky"" Hafner tried to emulate the early game success of H2K from the previous day by completely denying Reignover all of the tier 1 jungle picks and picking for themselves a comp with quick pick potential with the tp of Ryze in the top lane and Twisted Fate ultimate from the midlane who along with their jungler can quickly overwhelm any stray targets.
Louis Deilor Sevilla on the other hand opted for a “ Juggelista “ team comp whick put Rekkles as the main carry of their team, heavy backed up by YellOwStaR’s Janna and  Heo Huni Seung-hoon’s Lulu in the top lane.
As the both teams took of the rift, the audience present at the studio in Berlin started to cheer for what will probabil become the new “ El Classico “ of Europe LCS.
The first bit of action came at around the 5 minute mark when Maurice ""Amazing"" Stückenschneider’s Gragas came bot lane for a gank. Unfortunetly for Origen so was Reignover who not only managed to stop the Gragas threat on his teammates but also securing First Blood for himself with a Nunu’s snowball on max range on Alfonso ""Mithy"" Aguirre Rodriguez.

The next brawl between the two teams didn't let itself be waited too long after that as  Fnatic tried a daring dive on the enemy bot lane turret.While the dive failed and the Fnatic team managed to disengage to safety not the same could be said about Huni, who was ganked on the other side of the map by sOAZ and Amazing in a “ camp Huni” fashion which will continue for the majority of the game.

Origen managed to get a noticeable lead against Fnatic after a chase which started from the mid lane all the way to the botlane tribush which resulted in Reignover’s death despite YellOwStaR’s best efforts to save his teammate from the Origen onslaught.

The “camp Huni” stratagem mentioned earlier proved to backfire when sOAZ and Amazing stayed more than they were welcomed for near the inner top tower in a desperate attempt to kill Huni’s little yordle who somehow managed to keep himself alive until the arrival of his teammates, who sent xPeke running away with Ghost and quickly dispatched sOAZ, Mithy and Amazing.

The first real turning point in this game was when Fnatic disrespected Origen’s burst potential on the dragon skirmish 22 minute into the game. Despite securing their second dragon of the game, Origen succeded in  acing them and after a Baron rush they obtained 6 kills and over 5 and a half thousand gold lead over the number one rank in the standings.

Origen took no time and went straight for Fnatic’s inhibitor turrets, wanting to take full advantage of that Baron buff and they chose mid lane as the point of their first assault. While they managed to accomplish the objective they had in mind, they made the same mistake they did earlier and overstayed which is something you DO NOT do versus a team which has so much movement speed potential on their carries from the Lulu, Janna and Nunu buffs. This mishap was punished by Fnatic and got  3 kills on the scoreboard including the shutdown on xPeke, the player who was the most influential on Origen’s team since the start of the game thanks to his gold cards. 
http://streamable.com/3pxv
Seeing Fnatic slowing coming back into the game Origen opted to pull out one of EU LCS most iconic moves : the Fnatic death brush, a move so simple and yet so effective that casters across regions have named it after this team. But it just goes to show that  you can’t use a Fnatic death brush againt Fnatic themselves, as what started as a perfect ambush for  Origen turned into a recipy for disaster in a matter of seconds.Origen’s initiation didn’t go down as smooth as they hoped and with a superb zoning by Reignover casting Absolute Zero on a beefy Nunu they got their carries split up and Fnatic got a clean Ace over they adversaries with a quadrakill on Febiven’s Viktor.With such a dominating display even heavy down in gold Martin Deficio Lynch couldn’t help but call Fnatic’s coordination in teamfights “ just insane”.
http://streamable.com/bp31
After that explosive confrontation the 5 thousand gold advantage that Origen still had over Fnatic just completely evaporated, bringing the two teams on an equal standing again but Fnatic didn’t want to stop there, they wanted the lead for themselves and after a Baron rush at about 32 minutes into the game they got it even though at the same time xPeke got the tower and inhibitor at the top lane.
Four minutes later another teamfight started at the dragon pit after Origen got their second dragon and engaged into a desperate 3 way approach against Fnatic however it didn’t work out for them as xPeke just got insta-deleted by Febiven. And what makes it even worse is the fact that Origen still wanted to make a play when they were already two men down. Amazing tried to pick off Febiven with a flash+belly combo ,but unfortunately didn’t calculate the distance correctly.Febiven was still taken out eventually with the assistance of Niels and sOAZ but with a huge price, Fnatic got their second Ace of the game.A price so big that Origen couldn’t afford and it will be cost them the game in the minutes that fallow.
http://streamable.com/69g6
With Fnatic sensing the smell of victory they forced another teamfight in the river with a fully buffed Kalista running them like an unstoppable juggernaut. A fight that Origen couldn’t and shouldn’t have taken because 3 members of their team just got destroyed without being able to do basically anything. After that they’ve settled their eyes on the enemy Nexus and charged right towards it.
In that time the audience got rewarded with another treat that probably sent shivers down their spines as they recall it. Seeing as his team’s chance of victory were almost zero at that point, xPeke tried to replicate the backdoor trick that he used at IEM Katowice back in 2013. A deed that will probably live on forever in infamy in the League of Legends scene and gave the daring Spaniard the nickname of “Backdoor King”. However this time around, xPeke had a lot more daunting task ahead of him, not just the Nexus itself as it happened in Katowice and his Twisted Fate simply could not compete with the Fnatic’s team dps, especially with a blood boiled buffed late game Kalista as the two team tried a base race.
http://streamable.com/9hpl
As the Origen Nexus exploaded the crowd exploded in cheers for one of the most entertaining game in the summer split of EU LCS 2015.
 
 
Looking at the gold distribution on the chart above for the two teams you can see a much more tighter match-up than the one versus H2K one day before. There was ups and downs for both teams trying to get a lead over the other instead of a continued lead and then a total collapse from one of them. Origen’s gold spikes were at the times when they were making picks across the map thanks to the sudden appearance of both Twisted Fate and sOAZ togheter with Amazing who was always on the lookout of an easy target while Fnatic’s coincided with well executed teamfights.
Origen like all the other teams in Europe who have tried before them can’t seem to find a dent in Fnatic’s teamfighting synergy even when they have a massive gold lead in their advantage.
As Henry Quickshot Trevor always says : “ give Fnatic an opportunity to take an inch, and they will take a mile” proved to be true in this game again because when the dust settled down in this intense match-up Fnatic were standing yet again and with this win they achived a stunningly 14-0 winning streak which is the longest win record in both NA and EU LCS.
 Now with their hardest week successfully behind them and with just four more games to be played Fnatic is setting their eyes on that perfect 18-0 season or as the  fans call it “ the dream”. And if the old saying :” In Europe LCS everybody battles everybody and in the end Fnatic wins” is anything go by, then Fnatic have this one in the bag.

3djiis,1,2015-07-16,I [24 F] broke up with my bf [28 M] of 4.5 years right before he was going to propose to me. Now 4 months later I'm living with a different guy [25 M] because I can't stand to be alone.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3djiis/i_24_f_broke_up_with_my_bf_28_m_of_45_years_right/,"I'll try to make this as concise as possible. I left my boyfriend of 4.5 years out of the blue, right before he was going to propose to me. Over the years there's always been this naggy feeling in the back of my head that we aren't meant to be together. He's a good guy, he cares deeply for me and I knew that, so I always pushed those feelings away. 


I started an internship at the beginning of this year and it's as if something in me snapped. After a long period of depression I was suddenly overly happy, ""drunk on life"" if you will, and he was getting in the way of that. He didn't want me going out all the time and we started to fight. All these happy feelings made me feel like I had the courage to up and leave him, and just like that I did it. 


As soon as I left him I went a little crazy. I went on a million dates and slept around with complete strangers. It was like I couldn't be alone. If life stopped being exciting for one minute I was going to lose it, so I acted recklessly. 


All of this was very short-lived, though. It got old fast and I stopped going out so much. While I was going through all this, I met a new guy and over time we got closer and closer. I started to see him more and more and before I knew it I was sleeping with him every night. 


It's a strange relationship, though. He said from the beginning that he didn't want a girlfriend and we agreed to a friends-with-benefits relationship. I think the main reason I keep coming back to him every night is because I can't stand to be alone. 


We've started to fight a lot over stupid things. In theory fwb sounded like a great idea, but in practice it feels unnatural. When we have sex it's very passionate and emotional but then at all other times we don't show any affection to each other in that way. We don't kiss or cuddle or do anything that normal couples do, he says it's to prevent either of us from ""falling in love."" 


For whatever reason, I think this whole arrangement is making me resent him. I don't mean to feel this way, it's out of my control. I have explained to him how I feel, and why I've been so abrasive towards him. He asked me how can we fix this, but I don't know the answer. 


I don't want to be in a relationship with him, and I don't want to be alone, but I don't know how to make this work. Or if making it work is even the right thing to do.  


My ex has maintained contact with me since we split. It took time to separate all our stuff of course. He has asked me time and again to try to fix our relationship. He said that he's willing to do whatever it takes and told me how much he loves and misses me. I've just given him the cold shoulder through all of this. It breaks my heart to see him hurting but I didn't want to give him false hope by responding to his pleas. 


I agreed to have dinner with him last night. It was the first time I'd seen him in awhile and for the first time since we broke up I felt like I made a mistake leaving him. The way he looked at me was just so full of love and affection. He told me how much he missed me. Even though I miss him and the thought of reconciling is appealing, I can't help but think about all the things I've done since leaving him. I couldn't possibly tell him that I've been sleeping around, and I'm practically living with another guy for christ's sake. I doubt he would even want me back then. 



I'm hoping for some advice on how I should handle all this. 



**TL;DR Left my bf of 4.5 yrs out of the blue and couldn't stand being alone so I slept around and acted recklessly. I met a new guy and started seeing him every night, we're now in a fwb arrangement. He's been a good friend and we've grown very close. I like being around him, I like having sex with him, I don't want to date him, but this whole fwb situation is making me resent him. I saw my ex last night and he still misses me and wants to try to get back together. Even though it's really tempting and I feel I may have made a mistake leaving him, I don't want to end up leading him on and hurting him more than I already have.**"

I made a mistake and now my whole future is in jeopardy.",based_cupcake,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3djjs4/feeling_powerless_alone_and_empty_i_made_a/,"So, to start off by saying, I have zero support from my family in any way.  About a year ago, I went NC with my NDad because I stood up to him in the face of his financial abuse. He is also abusive in other ways but the particular things he was doing money wise to me was just the last straw.  I think that my mom is also either an N or very toxic BPD who lives to serve her alcoholic bf and enable him and my brother in his severe drug addiction. So both of my parents have made it clear that they could give less of a crap about me, career-wise, personal life wise or emotionally.  In fact, they did not even congratulate me on graduating from college or grad school.  My mom didn't even tell any of our extended family members, a fact I found out about during a rare family event in a way that made it obvious she didn't care/wasn't proud or whatever and it was very embarrassing. 

Anyways... the problem: 
I accepted a job that requires a professional title that I need to apply for and receive through the government. I fully expected to complete the requirements of receiving the title when I accepted the job, though I did let them know that I had not yet completed them. They hired me. 

The professional title I am seeking requires passing certain standardized exams.  Yesterday I messed up big time because the exam required use of advanced math and difficult computations but in a previous exam I took (from the same company and same subject) the calculator was provided to me by the testing company. at this test, the calculator wasn't provided because I was meant to bring my own and I was made to do the exam without it. Since the questions were mostly things that you can't do without a graphing calculator or number charts. While I won't know my score for several weeks, I know I bombed it big time. This was my last chance to take the exam in order to receive my professional license before I start the job I accepted. 

I really haven't been able to function since this happened.  Because I know that once my results come back, I will no longer have a job lined up and finding a different job is going to be very difficult. I have been working so hard for so many years struggling through college and grad school and I have had to deal with so many horrifyingly bad situations that most people never have to deal with. Once I got this job offer I felt like ""WOW finally I am going to be OK.""

Now I am back to having to deal with this financial insecurity all over again. I just feel so helpless. I know that life is not easy but it just feels like I am constantly struggling, in a way that when I look at others lives, they are not. anyway, I know this sounds childish. 

When I called my mom to confide in her, she screamed at me and told me ""I can't believe you screwed this up!"" Later she stopped by my place and started in on me again. As if I needed to hear that! I had been crying all day! 

Am I wrong for wanting someone to just comfort me??? I wish that I had a close friend that I could call but I really don't anymore. Many of my friends have drifted away since I've been so incredibly busy with my studies and internships. I feel like I have no one to turn to. I guess I could just use some kind words.

3djn94,0,2015-07-16,Why I don't support Planned Parenthood,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3djn94/why_i_dont_support_planned_parenthood/,"I should start by saying I was raised conservative Roman Catholic. Not just Catholic, but hardcore, daily rosaries, five siblings, homeschooled to shelter from me evil public schools Catholic. I do admit to being coerced (with donuts) to stand outside of Planned Parenthood with a sign pleading, “Pray for an End to Abortion”. But my lack of support for the organization does not stem from a deep rooted moral opposition to abortion access for women. It stems from a moral opposition to the overall approach of the company. Let me explain.


Right after graduating from high school, I moved/was kicked out of my parents house. I was working a fulltime job barely over minimum wage, living paycheck to paycheck. While I was still on my parent’s health insurance, I didn’t dare use it to try to get birth control in fear of their retaliation. fortunately, I saw an advertisement for a teen center offering free STD screenings and birth control. On an afternoon off, I timidly stopped by the center to ask about my birth control options. 


I was able to meet with a nurse and after going over my medical history and taking a pregnancy test, gave a three month supply of a low dose birth control pill to try. She gave me the contact information for the state run reproductive health clinic to call when I needed a refill. I thanked her and went on my merry way.


I went bat shit crazy. Bat. Shit. Crazy. The worst acne I have ever had and completely uncontrollable mood swings. They were so bad, I was scared to go to work for fear of an emotional meltdown. 


I called the state health clinic and made an appointment. In a non-descript cinder block building, an intern took my blood pressure. After talking with the OB-GYN, we decided the best option for me would be to get the Paragard, the only non-hormonal form of birth control besides barrier methods. Because my income was so low, the costs of the Paragard and insertion were waived.  


It was perfect. For nine months. The IUD ending up literally falling out, something not uncommon for women who have never had children. After speaking with my primary care doctor, she informed me that if I wanted, I could give the IUD a second try. There was a chance the first insertion just wasn’t high enough in my uterus to “stick”. Not wanting to give the pill another try and missing the security of my IUD, I made another appointment at the reproductive health clinic. The doctor looked over my charts and said she would love to get another IUD. 


But she couldn’t. See, the clinic had previously been given a grant from Title Ten funds. However, between the time I had gotten my first IUD and the time I went back to get a second, new grants had been written and the local Planned Parenthood had received the funds over the state run clinic. The doctor offered to put me on a waiting list, but she couldn’t give me an answer when she would next have the Paragard available for me. 


I figured this would be fine. I’d just go to Planned Parenthood and talk to them about birth control. So I made an appointment, showed up at the manicured office, and waited in the chic waiting room under a poster of two tattooed girls gazing into eachother’s eyes. I sat down with the doctor and explained my situation: I had a poor experience being on the pill and I had previously had a Paragard and was looking to get another one. The doctor explained with animation how great it was that they would be receiving this grant in a few months to give out free birth control. She wrote me a prescription for a generic brand of a different pill and told me to come back in two months to get an IUD. Without insurance, the new pills were only $9 a pack and they cleared up some acne issues I was having. I did gain a few extra pounds, but going into winter, my activity level was also dropping so I figured it was fine. 


I came back two and half months later, waited under the same glamorous lobby poster, had my vitals checked by the same animated assistant, and waited patiently in the examination room to speak with the doctor again. A different, but just as cheery doctor waltzed in, looked over my charts with enthusiasm, and asked what she could do for me. I again explained my situation. She strolled over to the computer, tapped a few keys. She asked if I had health insurance. I told her I did not (I didn’t have the energy to explain to her that I did, but if my parents found out that I had used it at Planned Parenthood on birth control, they would literally skin me alive). She turned slow to me and said, “Well, with your income the insertion fee would be waived, but you’ll still need to pay for the device, about $550.” 


I was floored. They were receiving the same grants the state run clinic had received. My income had not changed. Where was the grant money going? The lobby fountain? 


I told the doctor that wasn’t really in my budget. She offered to get me an in-clinic free refill on my birth control pills. I told her I would appreciate that. Turned out, the clinic didn’t receive my brand of pills or anything pharmaceutically close, so I ended up declining, not wanting to subject my body to a new pill when I was content with my current prescription. The woman checking me out asked if I would like to make a donation to Planned Parenthood. I curtly told her that I would not. 


I am not unsupportive of Planned Parenthood because I think birth control is immoral or abortion under any circumstances ever is murder. I don’t refrain my support because I don’t think all women should have access to high quality healthcare. I definitely don’t refrain support for Planned Parenthood out of entitled bitterness for not receiving free birth control. 


I don’t support Planned Parenthood because I don’t believe they are doing what their mission states they intend to do. If a state run clinic can provide birth control to low income patients for free as well as quality STD testing and treatment, why can’t Planned Parenthood do the same with the same grants in addition to the generous private, tax exempt donations? If the goal is affordable, high quality healthcare, with the help of Title Ten, what’s standing in the way?


With the recent allegations against Planned Parenthood (See: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/house-republicans-to-investigate-planned-parenthood-over-fetal-tissue.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0 ), my social media pages have been a war between my family posting articles from conservative new sources in arms about the horrific deeds Planned Parenthood has committed and my liberal college friends in arms about these ridiculous conservatives trying to shut Planned Parenthood down. 


I’m up in arms, too. Not because of the babies and certainly not because I fear the conservatives taking away my rights to my body. I’m up in arms because very few people are asking what the recent allegations mean for the health care of women. Dr. Arthur Caplan, the director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, was quoted by the New York Times: “You cannot, must not, alter how or when you do an abortion simply to obtain tissues you want. Basically, the only concern is the health and safety of the mother.” 

This is the heart of the issue. This is where I think Planned Parenthood is lacking. Yes, Planned Parenthood needs investigation, not because “Save the Babies!” or because you don’t deserve the rights to your body. Planned Parenthood needs investigation because I do deserve high quality, affordable health care and I’m not sure Planned Parenthood is really providing it.

About two months ago, I started to look for a new job, as I'm currently not making as much as I should. For example, my past two employers paid me about $80k a year, and my current job only pays $33k a year. I have the current job because I moved to a new city in a different state (from CA to TX), and there aren't many positions open in the part of Texas that I'm living in for what I do (Web Application Engineering/PHP Programming).

This past week I got offered to interview with two different companies (one in Austin, the other is a remote position) and Friday, I'm driving down to Austin to interview for a new job with an $85k a year salary (and from what I can tell, an awesome work environment). I just finished the remote position interview yesterday, and I'm waiting to hear back from them as well.

To be honest, I'm super excited. It's a new adventure and, with everything I hear about Austin, I'm more inclined to take that job, if they offer it to me.

The problem is, with my current employer, I'm part of a three person web team that just lost our web designer, as tomorrow is his last day. We have interns, but they don't do much of the heavy lifting. So, basically, it's just me and my manager, who is starting to become like a big sister. It's causing me some anxiety, because I can't post about it anywhere (cause they all follow me on social media) and I have this massive need to tell people about this exciting news. I also fear leaving my boss in a bind because the lack of development talent, but the 50k+ increase in salary is so I can support myself and my wife and start our family together.

I'm not looking for advice (but if you have some, I will welcome it), but I just wanted to tell someone who isn't my wife or my mom."

It didn't hurt much, but it was chronic, often aching during and after playing football. We discovered it at the end of 8th grade, and through the summer prepared to have surgery. They couldn't however, have the surgery done before the school year. The ortho's schedule simply didn't allow. 

So, 3 weeks into freshman year, I went under the knife. I went to a vocational school, and the way it works is we'd have 2 weeks of academics, then 2 weeks of shop. The first 3rd of the year for freshman is devoted to helping you find what shop you'd be taking. My first 2 were offset printing and electronics. Well, I missed offset's shop week because of all this. They swore to me that it wouldn't affect my evaluation(which dictates whether you get your first choice shop or not). It did. I wanted Computer Information Tech. I wanted to learn websites, code, network engineering, all of that. Instead, I ended up in an electronics shop caught between old school through hole and analog tech and new age surface mount and digital tech. I spent 3.5 years in high school in a shop that should prepare me for my life after high school. Instead, I got caught in the bullshit. 2 shop teachers who hated each other, and devoted their energies to discrediting each other. 

Now, I tried to make the best of it, got an internship to work at a news radio station during high school. That got me out of the shop some, gave me experience I'd eventually need. I went to a broadcasting school after high school, found a job at a news/talk station. Now, 7 years into that job, I have no upward mobility and I'm making shit, doing something I hate more and more everyday. Everyone is miserable in my business corporate has sucked the life out of it all. Now I'm just another paper pusher. 

I can't help but wonder, what would've happened if I'd followed that original passion? Even if it was after high school. My brother is 4 years younger than me, has a more stable job that pays a 3rd more than mine does, in the IT field. 

I'm stuck. I can't just go back to school, I don't have the resources to support my family and learn a new trade. It all tracks back to a stupid surgery that I probably could lived without. "

Not just because I have ADHD, but I'm also an atheist and I don't drink or go out like other college kids. However, I am very genuine and a pretty interesting person (if I do say so myself :P) once you get to know me and if you can relate to and/or accept the different things about me.

I have 3 semesters left in college, majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently working as a software development intern. I can be kind of nerdy when it comes to computers (and I spend a fair bit of time playing a PC game), but I'm definitely not the stereotypical nerd. I'm always seeking to improve myself in regards to health, personality, how I dress/present myself, etc. and I don't fit the typical nerd mold.

Anyway, I'll stop talking now. If you're interested feel free to PM me your kik username. It can be purely a platonic thing, or we can get into some dirty stuff eventually too if that's what you're looking for. Looking forward to hearing from you!"
3dkb3f,44,2015-07-16,"[Discussion] Can't buy every shoe you want because you aren't made of money? Well, I have too much time on my hands so I made this math formula for determining what shoes to buy",xDeezyz,Sneakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/3dkb3f/discussion_cant_buy_every_shoe_you_want_because/,"I've been having some difficulty deciding which shoes to buy in recent months. Being a college student, I can't be spending a ton of money on shoes, so I try to limit my sneaker budget to ~5% of my wages from my internship. So I need to be smart with my purchases. As a result, I decided to make this equation to help me pick out my purchases. But before we get started I'd like to make something clear: **This is intended to be directed at high schoolers/college students/low wage workers. If you have a well-paying, steady job this most likely won't be useful.**

It's fairly simple, and it goes like this:


    n = rating on a scale of 1-10, how badly do you want the shoe? 
Honesty is important here, and it's the only way the equation works.

    p = price
The assumed units here is USD, so I don't know how well this will work with other types of currency.
The actual equation is:

    ((2n^2)/p)*100
That's it! Just plug the numbers into a calculator and it'll usually spit out a number somewhere between 20-100, although sometimes they can fall outside of this range. You can use this to determine if a purchase is worth it, or compare two possible purchases. For example, the Bordeaux 7's are releasing this weekend. Let's see if I should get them...

    n = 7.5
    p = 190
    
    ((2(7.5)^2)/(190))*100 = 59.2

I like to use this range logic for a single purchase:

    0-55: Don't even think about it.
    55-75: Think really hard; is it worth it?
    75-90: Consider the future, but it's likely worth it.
    90+: You should have already gotten these.

Therefore, I really need to consider whether or not the Bordeaux's are worth it. I missed out on the Bred 11 Lows and the Grey Foams which were my top 2 targets this summer, but the summer isn't over yet. I'll have to decide soon.

In practice, I've never gotten a number above 90, most of the time they fall in the 60-75 range. I'd also like to reiterate that this is targeted at younger people/people with lower incomes. That is why you'll find that n=4 @ $70 &gt; n=7 @ $250, and why shoes $400+ are pretty much out of the equation.

That's all! Thanks for reading. If you got something out of this, great! If you think this is stupid, you're probably right, but hey it works for me.

3dl8hl,2,2015-07-17,"Me [20M] with my currently long distance GF [20 F] OF 1.5 years, she's blocking me out but we have a trip planned in 2 weeks.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dl8hl/me_20m_with_my_currently_long_distance_gf_20_f_of/,"I've been with my girlfriend for 1.5 years, we first met our freshman year of college and are now heading into our third year. Everything had been going fairly well until Valentine's day. 

The night of the February 13th, we both got drunk and had a drunken but truthful conversation about our future. We knew we'd be long distance for some time because we both have internships on opposite sides of the country this summer, and she has a co-op this fall, while I'm returning to school. So yeah, 8 months long distance. We decided, or rather, found out we agreed that we should shift to an open relationship while long distance, as we're both just 20, 8 months is a long time, and college is college. 

Later that night after she fell asleep (I stayed on her couch so I wouldn't have to drunkenly wander back to my own apartment), her phone buzzes and it's from her sister. The message preview mentions my name, and I check it out. Turns out she'd told her sister that she planned on telling me we'd be in an open relationship and then just eventually break up with me. We came incredibly close to breaking up over this on Valentines day, and looking back I guess I probably should have. She lied to me about what she envisioned our future was to give me false expectations. Well, we kind of worked through that, but it's been rocky since. 

So here we are now. She is moving from one internship to her co-op in two weeks, and we knew this was coming up so I got plane tickets to go on this trip with her. It's a 2000 mile drive. I'm flying out to where she is now, we drive for 3 days having fun along the way, then I fly back. Her mom was originally going to go (instead of me), but she'd rather work, so she purchased half my tickets for me. It has costed me $250 for airfare, it'll probably cost roughly $120 round trip in gas for me to get to the airport I'm flying out of, and I'm taking 2 days off my internship (opportunity cost of ~$250 after taxes). So in effect this is a $600+ trip (the plan was for my gf to buy hotel and gas for the 2000 mile drive, as she knows she needs to do this drive anyway and that I'm kinda short on money). This is to happen in two weeks.

The problem? She's recently blocked me out. She's made sure she's so ""busy"" we haven't talked on the phone since late June. Last time she texted me with any sort of affectionate words was early July (over two weeks ago). I lost my texts from before late June (new phone), and since I still haven't gotten a single ""I love you"". My affectionate texts are ignored. We used to have long, funny snapchat conversations. Over the past 3 weeks if I send her one, she opens it and never acknowledges it. If I try to make conversation she'll respond in one or two word answers. 

I sent her a long text about this last night. She responded at lunch that she's been needing space because she wants to be more independent (even though we're already in an open relationship). She says she wants to ""concentrate on her own happiness"" and that I should do the same. But that she is ""excited for our trip."" 

I responded back saying there's no reason we can't be both in a relationship and independent at the same time. No answer. I tell her I'm still excited about the upcoming semester as she is her co-op. No response. I tell her the last thing I want is to be ignored. No answer.

I'm this close to just canning it. This is all playing out like she told her sister that night before Valentine's day, only I have money involved and I both love her and hate her at the same time. I'll take the $250 sunk cost of that airfare and be done with it. No trip. She can drive her fucking self. Convince me otherwise. Or don't. I guess this is more a rant, but I'd appreciate your advice nonetheless. 

TL;DR currently long distance GF and I have rocky relationship at the moment, we have a cross country trip coming up that I've already put $250 into, but she has become incredibly distant and withdrawn from communicating with me over the past 3 weeks. "

Most of them hate clinical and only want to get a clinical job for now until they have experience to go into counseling or something else. I want to do clinical as a building block to become a CNSC and focus completely on nutrition support. It bums me out that some of them have already gotten clinical jobs and I'm getting turned down when clinical is totally my passion. I would really like to work at a teaching hospital with a trauma center, and there are a few near me that I have applied to, and I've been turned down by one and I'm waiting to hear from another. (I'm in the southeast Pennsylvania area). I was wondering if anyone had any kind of advice or suggestions of locations or types of hospitals to apply to? I was at a small community hospital for the majority of my clinical and I requested to go to large city hospitals and I really enjoyed it there. I really don't want to go back to a community hospital and see nothing but CHF exacerbations, DKA and demented 90 year olds with PEGs and watch as all of the cool patients get transferred out to the bigger, better hospitals. That sounds kind of terrible but I really don't want to do that. Being at a bigger teaching hospital with all of the variety and the wealth of knowledge being shared all around was a great experience. Suggestions? I'm feeling kind of bummed even though I probably shouldn't because it's still early..."
3dlhqj,3,2015-07-17,"I [20/F] made a dumb mistake with my ex? [20/M] and now he refuses to talk to me, and now I'm homeless. Help",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dlhqj/i_20f_made_a_dumb_mistake_with_my_ex_20m_and_now/,"Hello Reddit. I don't know if I'm posting this for advice or just venting, but I just feel kind of hopeless right now. So I guess I will just back this up to the beginning, bear with me here.

I met this guy back in January 2014. We met in class, he asked for my number and said we should study some time. So we end up talking, and we go on a walk later that night. We were talking, and getting into some deep conversation. For some odd reason, I just felt something, like he was ""the one."" 
Before you all get mad at me or whatever, I never believed in soul mates or any of that crap really. If any of you have watched 500 Days of Summer, I have very much been a Summer my whole life, until I met this guy, we'll call him Bob. As soon as I met Bob, my whole perspective on love very much became like Tom's. I felt so optimistic about life in general. Bob was wonderful, we shared so much in common and had common goals in life, but we were still different, which was so fun in getting to know him. 

Now, I had gotten out of a very abusive relationship the September prior, and I was still shook up by things, so I was not ready for a relationship. Bob also stated that he was not ready for a relationship. We ended up becoming a FWB type deal. But even then, there was so much emotion involved. 

I never really planned on saving sex for marriage, but I definitely wanted my first time to be with someone special. I ended up losing my virginity to him, and it just felt right. We still continued on as FWB, and I think this was our biggest mistake. Towards the end of the school year, we decided that once we got back, we would become an official couple. We were already saying ""I love you"" and doing very couple-ey things. One time, while together, I happened to glance over at his phone (unintentionally) and  I saw he had sent this message to another girl talking about how much he enjoyed eating her out. This threw me off. I knew we weren't together, but we had talked about it, we were telling each other that we loved each other. It was just a very odd situation. I was extremely hurt by everything. I didn't say anything though, as I didn't want to cause problems.
So summer starts, we go to our respective home towns, and we are now six hours apart from each other. The insecurity of our relationship gets to me, and we have our first argument. I end up bringing up the stuff that happened with this other girl. Long story short, we end up officially being a couple. Well, we already started off on the wrong foot, and we were long distance. Our communication was off. I would say one thing, and he would interpret it s different way, and vice versa. This continued on into the following school year, now being together in the same town. We never really ever got over that hump we started off with, and I think that was our biggest mistake. Along with that, I was going through a lot of issues at home, with my parents not supporting my life choices and where I want to go in my life. I was dealing with becoming completely independent from them. I was dealing with a lot of stress from classes and work. I took it out on him, and it just became too much. That is all my fault, I know that. But at the same time, I feel like a relationship is supposed to be supportive in helping overcome those, and I felt like I was constantly being tossed aside to his video games. Instead of being a support to me, he would say he's had enough, and he wouldn't want to spend time with me or any of that.

Well, this past April, I left to go across the country for an internship that will last until August. He decided to break up with me. He didn't want to do the distance with all the arguing we've been having. I was devastated. I got into a bit of a depression. I was having suicidal thoughts. Not over just this, but all the stress in my life in general. I start my internship, it's rough, but I manage. I begin talking to Bob. Things are a little rough, I'm still heartbroken, but I'm trying to stay strong. He tells me that he'll give me another chance when I get back. I finally get over all those stresses and I learn how to manage on my own. I've definitely changed for the better, and I was becoming the person I used to be. I was no longer in my funk. Things go great between Bob and I. He promises me commitment to our relationship. Things were wonderful. Somewhere down the line, we end up getting back in our old routine of arguing and he decided to break his promise to me. I'm, of course, devastated. But I try and show my maturity. While still upset, I don't yell, I don't argue, I simply say ok, and just keep on living. I told him that I was done trying to force this. I wasn't worried. Things would work out between us in due time, I was sure of it. Well, we get back on our good track. As we're talking about things happening when I get back (I'm supposed to be staying with him for two weeks because my lease for my new apartment starts later than when I need to be back home), he talks about making me this shot that you light on fire. Long story short, it turned into a trust issue and it was a much bigger argument than needed. It felt like all we built up just got thrown out over some stupid argument. Well today comes around, I try and mend things. He tells me he wants to be left alone. Fault of mine, I push it too far and keep him talking. In my head, I'm just trying to say goodbye on a good note, but to him I'm just being a bother. Eventually we come to an agreement, I leave him alone. I go to work, and on my break I see a snapchat from him. I open it, and it's him with some girl saying ""chillin with bae."" I freak out, and end up texting him and getting angry. It was childish of me. After calming down, I text him again, apologizing. Stating that I was completely in the wrong and asking for forgiveness. Well, a few hours later, I get a Facebook message saying he's blocked me on everything. I just feel at such a loss right now, we were making so much progress and all because of one dumb minor thing that I let get over my head, we've come to this. I'm just completely at a loss. I don't know what to do. I was so looking forward to going home and just spending our time catching up and hopefully moving forward in a nice, healthy, mature relationship. I just feel like it's completely immature to just drop me like that without at least discussing things. He refuses to talk to me over video chat, and I know if we can just converse face to face, we would be able to resolve this in a better way, but it's impossible to do that with him. Like, I don't even know if this means I can't stay with him. If that's the case then I am completely homeless for two weeks. I have no where else to stay, but I can't figure out if I'm staying with him or not because I'm blocked. I'm just so shocked at this point. I feel like everything built up has been completely shattered. I feel sick. I don't know what to do. I don't even know what advice to ask for, I'm just so utterly heartbroken and upset and hurt and scared and I'm completely lost at what to do.

TL;DR
Boyfriend breaks up with me due to problems and distance, says we'll try again when I get back. We improve on our relationship, dumb arguing leads to me being blocked and homeless. Help."
3dliug,2,2015-07-17,Possible immigration scam,scamthrowaway89,Scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/3dliug/possible_immigration_scam/," This is my first time posting here (throwaway account) and I don't know if this is the right forum, but I needed some advice. I was speaking with some international students who are visiting my home town for the weekend. They are friends of my coworker. They arrived to the US only recently and I was making small talk,  asking how they like the country and college life so far. From what they described of their program and college  it seems like a giant immigration scam. I know this because I have dealt with international students before when I was at university and know the paperwork they require to be legal students. 

1. They claimed that their program allowed them to complete 50% of their coursework in 8 months! And that they would complete a semester's worth of coursework in a single course in a  month. This would be for one computer science course. So a semester's worth of coursework in a single course over a month

2. They were promised that after completing the first 8 months they would be given curricular practical training (CPT) privileges. Now CPT, for those who that don't know, is actually for students to have internship experiences to count towards their degree. But this 'university' would allow them to work on an 'internship', and take remote online classes for the rest of the program. The placements for these 'internships' is arranged by this 'university' through shady agencies. All this is done with the promise of a job. In fact students are brought over from South Asia with the explicit promise of a job after graduation.

3. The students then have to pay off their tuition ( which they haven't been paying for) and other expenses with interest after they find a job. 

This entire process seemed like immigration scam to me because the school seems to be misusing the F1 visa program for international students, promising them jobs after having them complete a fake ass degree. It is a money making scheme misusing the immigration rules we have place in this country.

The 'university' I am speaking of is based in Fairfield, Iowa and I live in another state. I checked the USCIS website about reporting a scam and it took me to the following link.

http://www.uscis.gov/avoid-scams/report-immigration-scams

So I was hoping if someone could tell me how to proceed and whether  I should report it at all. Some of the links for the state of Iowa seem to be outdated. I wanted to leave an anonymous tip for USCIS but at the same time I want them to look into this university. "

So tl;dr I had an intake appointment with a horrible, judgy intern. I left the appointment in tears and freaking out. I got a call that I was next on the waitlist for a weekly counselor, and guess who I was paired with? Horrible, judgy intern. 

When I got the call and they told me I'd be with her, I froze. I ended up just saying okay to everything, hung up and then panicked. It took me all day to get the courage to send an email, saying that I had a) asked for a full psychologist and not a student/intern and b) felt like we did not click well and I would like to be considered for someone else. Well, now I'm just nervous that I'm horrible, that I won't be able to be paired with someone else, that the person I sent the email to isn't even the right person, etc.

I guess, this is what I said? Not that I can take any of it back now, but I don't know. I feel like a wet noodle.

""I called earlier today to book my appointment and found that I was paired with ---. I took the day to think about it, and unfortunately I find that we do not click well. I do have an appointment set up with her for tomorrow, but I would really like to cancel this as I do not feel like this match will be successful for me. Unfortunately, at the time of booking I got very anxious and did not express this opinion. I had also requested not to have a student or intern for my counselor, because I did not find my prior counseling experiences with a student at SU Wellness to be effective and this includes the experience I had with --- for the intake appointment.

If I need to contact someone else about this request or if you have any questions, please let me know!

I appreciate your help.""

Ugh. Yeah. So that happened. Also my dog is finally recovered from her surgery (we've only known her as an injured dog as we rescued her), and oh - surprise, she's destructive out of no where. If you had a chance to read my previous post, yep the one that chased the rabbit and almost got hit by a car. So amidst all this happening, I have to try and focus on training this dog so she doesn't destroy our house. I'm at the point where if one more bad thing happens, I might explode.

Thanks r/anxiety for being here. I don't know what I'd do without you guys.

For thirteen weeks I've been a part of a summer-long ""leadership program"" in Montana. For thirteen weeks I've stuck through all the bullshit and (mostly) kept my mouth shut, but something happened today that finally sent me over the edge. 

I've been having consistent issues with one of the directors of this program. All throughout he's been adamant that I have trouble trusting older men, that I'm unteachable, and that I simply think I'm smarter than everyone else. He's completely read me wrong, to the point where other directors have disagreed with him and defended me, and he's still refusing to budge in his vocal judgements and scrutinizing of every word that I say or don't say. If I even so much as contribute to discussions where I can bring up a relevant point, even if he's not part of the discussion, he'll yell ""Oh look, Smartass has something to say,"" when in reality I keep my mouth shut most of the time. When I've tried asking for opportunities to talk to him about it he's refused.  When I've defended myself he immediately throws his hands up and says, ""Yep, Ormr is right. It's always a right and wrong thing for you, isn't it? Well here, I'm not going to argue with you, because you've won!"" I've tried talking to the other directors and they've told me to just deal with it,

Tonight was the final straw. At the start of our evening meeting they were encouraging us to make better use of the time that we have left by not spending time on our phones or watching television, that we should be networking and building community amongst each other instead. I **innocently** stated, when the group was asked if we had any comments or questions, ""Actually I think even if we maybe spend a little too much time on our phones, I'd like to encourage the group because I've really appreciated the discussions we've had later at night after these meetings.""

By the expression on his face you would've thought that he had just found out his wife had cheated on him with me. This man stands up and begins a rant against me saying ""You fucking punk. All I ask of you is some confirmation that you're actually taking what we say seriously instead of just shitting on what we're trying to accomplish here. We know you have discussions after these meetings, do you think we're fucking stupid?""

I stood up, walked out, went to my room, bought a plane ticket, and tomorrow I'm going to shock everyone by leaving a full three weeks early. They're going to be off doing their intern jobs but I'm just going straight to the airport after I get packed. I have learned a lot of the summer and I'm going to miss a lot of folks that I got to meet and spend time with but I'll be damned if I'm spending one more week with that guy.

I've been with my FWB for over 6months we got along well really nicely, I believe she's an amazing person and she likes me too. We been meeting for almost everyday and spending alot of time together , and this is not a typical FWB relationship because we kinda are dating just not something official as she does not ready for that commitment. She calls me nicknames such as 'baby' and wants to cuddle with me, we really treat each other like we were in a relationship.

Now since she went to her new internship we barely talk on the phone at weekends and barely meet, we text during the day sometimes but that's about it. She told me there was a guy on there that told her he likes her, and about 2 days ago she texted me she wanted to be honest with me and the guy kissed her in the cheek ( I know this is nothing but it got me abit jelous ). She's now confused with her feelings regarding me and him , but on the other hand she does care alot about me and does not want to lose me.
I made her know that if she starts dating the other guy I will be gone as it would hurt me to see her with another guy and I wouldn't be able to keep a friendly conversation with him, and she was very sorry about it and said she could not control it as she spends 8hours on the same room with him and she might end up liking him but she said she does not want to hurt me ever regarding her decision.

She's really confused and thinks it's her fault that she took that internship and it killed 'us', and I told her it was not her fault at all she had to do it.
Now I don't know what to do about this, I let her decide what she wants to do with her life as I'm not going to force her to like me but on the other hand I think I might force her to keep me arround cuz I said I would be gone if she choose the other guy? I don't wanna sound like a dick but I could not live with myself living like that, I know that she has feelings for me and it makes no sense because she does not wanted a relationship.

What do you guys think I should do ?"
3dlwcf,3,2015-07-17,How get a Short-stay visa + Work permit (TWV)?,fagnerc,thenetherlands,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/3dlwcf/how_get_a_shortstay_visa_work_permit_twv/,"So, it's my first post in Reddit! I hope not to screw things up here.
First of all, my english is not good, because of that I will try to be as brief as possible.

Ok, basically I receive a job offer from a IT startup from Netherlands and I don't know anything about the whole process to get a visa to work there. 
When they send me a email saying that the ""job was mine"" they told me to get a tourist visa and at my arrival they would start a MVV procedure. The problem is that after talking with a Dutch representative from the Dutch Consulate in *São Paulo*, Brazil (yey, I live in Brazil!) he told me that I can't work in the Netherlands with a tourist visa &amp; that my employer needs to apply for a MVV at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) in NL. 
So, knowing that, I return the information to my employer that didn't like that very much and said that after getting some information at the IND I can enter with a tourist visa and work as a intern but only receive 300 EUR (I don't want that O.O).
After all that BS (sorry) I saw that I can get a short-stay visa and ask my employer for a work permit.
My main problem is that I don't want to stay there for a long period of time because I'm don't know if I'm going to adapt well (it's my first time traveling abroad after all). That's why I'm asking for a short-stay visa. 

**My questions**

* What process should I take to get a short-stay visa + work permit?
* Can I get a start a Provisional Residence permit (MVV) procedure inside the Netherlands in my short-stay visa?
* What you guys personally recommend, based on our life experience and my case?

Thank you! :P

I'm a 22 yo french developer, finishing my master's degree in computer science (4th year of the 5 years program). We do a bit of everything, but mainly software development and information technology. 

To give you an idea, here is the languages we studied : OCaml, C, Java, C#, Prolog, Smalltalk, HTML, CSS, SQL, JS, C-Shell... and the concepts : N-Tiers, network protocols, OO, SOA, systems security, IA, MVC, design-patterns... 

I have been lurking around down here to find some informations about how to find a software internship in Berlin (stackoverflow, berlinstartupjobs, hackspaces, company sites...etc) but that would be awesome to have some input from Berliners.

I'm looking for something else than J2EE to discover other jobs/technologies/frameworks, and if i could choose, something paid that implies music. 

Few informations :

- I love mathematics, music and IT.
- Went to Berlin 2 times allready, and i fell in love.
- I don't speak German, but ready to learn it ASAP.
- I did 2 J2EE Internships (HTML, CSS, JSP, SQL, GWT)
- Deeply interested in music and willing to pursue in a CS/music thesis (live-coding, IA, music recognition...)
- 10 years classical guitar, composing through Ableton, vinyl-mixing...
- I'm available from Feb. 2016 for 3 to 6 months (can be more).

So here is my questions : 

- Any prefered websites to find IT internships ?
- Any companies/laboratories where i could apply for something implying CS and music ?
- Anything i should know about interviews/CV which are specific to Berlin/Germany ?
- General advices for foreign students looking for an internship there ?

Thank you for your time."
3dma19,4,2015-07-17,Possible Immigration scam,scamthrowaway89,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/3dma19/possible_immigration_scam/,"I had posted this on /r/scams but only posters with a certain karma limit are allowed to post there pending mod approval. This is a throwaway account and I was hoping someone would advice me. What I posted is below:

 

This is my first time posting here and I don't know if this is the right forum, but I needed some advice. I was speaking with some international students who are visiting my home town for the weekend. They are friends of my coworker. They arrived to the US only recently and I was making small talk,  asking how they like the country and college life so far. From what they described of their program and college  it seems like a giant immigration scam. I know this because I have dealt with international students before when I was at university and know the paperwork they require to be legal students. 

1. They claimed that their program allowed them to complete 50% of their coursework in 8 months! And that they would complete a semester's worth of coursework in a single course in a  month. This would be for one computer science course. So a semester's worth of coursework in a single course over a month

2. They were promised that after completing the first 8 months they would be given curricular practical training (CPT) privileges. Now CPT, for those who that don't know, is actually for students to have internship experiences to count towards their degree. But this 'university' would allow them to work on an 'internship', and take remote online classes for the rest of the program. The placements for these 'internships' is arranged by this 'university' through shady agencies. All this is done with the promise of a job. In fact students are brought over from South Asia with the explicit promise of a job after graduation.

3. The students then have to pay off their tuition ( which they haven't been paying for) and other expenses with interest after they find a job. 

This entire process seemed like immigration scam to me because the school seems to be misusing the F1 visa program for international students, promising them jobs after having them complete a fake ass degree. It is a money making scheme misusing the immigration rules we have place in this country.

The 'university' I am speaking of is based in Fairfield, Iowa (easy enough to guess from this) and I live in another state. I checked the USCIS website about reporting a scam and it took me to the following link.

http://www.uscis.gov/avoid-scams/report-immigration-scams

So I was hoping if someone could tell me how to proceed and whether  I should report it at all. Some of the links for the state of Iowa seem to be outdated. I wanted to leave an anonymous tip for USCIS but at the same time I want them to look into this university. "

I have an A.S. in Computer Programming and I am now getting my B.S. In general I.T.

**Current:**
I am currently doing two separate paid internships. One as a web/application developer, the other as a remote service technician.

**Issue:**
My boss at the remote service tech job keeps telling me that they can't afford to have me work there part time. My boss wants a new full time employee and when my internship is done he wants me to either work there full time or leave. It is a good job, kinda easy, and I do love working in my underwear, but It is not really my field. I only took the service tech job to get on the job general I.T. training to broaden my skill base and to put another bullet point on to my resume.

On the other hand my boss at the web/application developer position said he wants me to stay as well, but only part time. I know that is not ideal but I am using them to get experience in the programming field since it is so hard to find entry level jobs as a programmer.

**TL:DR**
I can't decide if I want take a full-time job as a remote service tech or keep working as an developer part-time to get more experience, especially since that is my field."

We have a solid relationship and rarely fight. We have had moments of infidelity (she made out with a guy blackout drunk and I did the same with a girl), but we persevered. This summer, she had an out-of-state internship for 6 weeks back in her home state. Initially, we agreed that we would have an open relationship for the summer, where we would be free to see other people. Come time for her internship, I expressed my discomfort with the idea and we agreed not to do anything with any other people. 

Yesterday she came back from her internship and is visiting me for three days. She has been partying every weekend at a large college with her cousin and his fraternity, so naturally I am suspicious. Having been cheated on twice before, I decided to read her text messages last night when we were drunk. Did not see much, but one message to her best friend said ""definitely second guessed myself hooking up with multiple guys this summer.""

She doesn't know I have seen this, and I gave her the opportunity to admit anything she did over the summer, but she denied doing anything. In the back of my head I knew this would happen, but it still hurts. I love her so much. What should I do? Should I end things with her? Should I tell her I know about her infidelity? Should I wait and see what happens? I can sympathize with her situation because had I not been busting my ass at my job while I have no summer classes, I probably would have drunkenly hooked up with girls as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

tl;dr: I am in a college relationship, and my girlfriend cheated on me while at an out-of-state internship. How should I proceed?

3dn6nr,22,2015-07-17,"[Update] Me [20 F] with my bf [19 M] of a year and a half, he confessed to being disloyal to me",flyawaya,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dn6nr/update_me_20_f_with_my_bf_19_m_of_a_year_and_a/,"Previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xia43/me_20_f_with_my_bf_19_m_of_a_year_and_a_half_he/

I know this didn't get much attention but I thought I would give an update for the people who commented, either with tough love or support.

TLDR: We broke up, but not for the reasons listed in the other post.

After I posted my now ex went to several therapy sessions to work on his issues with his sexual attraction to weight gain and fat girls. Now, originally, when he confessed to texting those other women, he told me it was because he has an addiction to fat and he loves seeing women who are also fat. (See my old post about the weight gain kink)

I had nothing against this and told him I would support him as much as I could, as long as he got therapy. I also went back to therapy to work out my issues with communication and stress. Around April, we got into a fight where he told me he didn't believe that I would follow through on gaining weight like I promised because I asked to wait a month before starting (I was busy with school and didn't want to ask my parents for extra money before school ended anyway). And that he had already followed through on his end by going to therapy. In retrospect him only going a few times probably should have bothered me more, but I didn't want to push it.

After school ended I started my internship and started gaining weight. He loved it, sex life improved a *ton*. Like I didn't even realize how different it was until it started changing. We got along, all was good for a while.

Around June, I started thinking about the amount of money I was paying for food, potentially the money I'd have to pay for new clothes, as well as the health issues around obesity. This was tacked on to the fact that

1) My mother is Asian and calls me fat as it is.
2) My dad works at a hospital and I grew up hearing about health issues surrounding obese people.

I went to my ex and told him sincerely that I wasn't comfortable gaining past 200 lbs. Maybe to 230, but that was it. His response was disappointed and he said he would think about it. We almost broke up at this point because I pointed out I didn't want to gain weight and then have him tell me it wasn't enough, because I was pretty much changing my lifestyle for him. But we kept going and decided to give it a shot. We celebrated his birthday (so we're now both 20).

Then, this past week, I went to his house to stay there as his family left on vacation. This was with their permission, because staying there for a week meant I had a shorter commute to work for that length of time, which I appreciated. It was a good time, everything was fine, and then two days ago he told me we needed to talk. He said that he had spent that past week thinking about it and he wouldn't be satisfied with me stopping at 200 lbs. He wanted at least 300. He was going to refrain from telling me until the end of the week, but felt it wasn't fair to me to pretend like nothing was wrong when he already decided it was over.

I cried so hard. I was a mess. I was planning to ride out the week to keep the short commute but I just couldn't handle him totally ignoring me. I think the breaking point was when I called out of work the next day to collect myself, and after he got up I could hear him singing happily to himself. Like, he cried with me the day before, and now just the day after he was totally fine!? I get that he'd had more time to mentally prepare, but that was it. I was done. I packed my stuff, bid him goodbye, and left. I cried my heart out in the car and cursed him out, and when I got home my friend welcomed me back and I let it out all over again.

It was hard at first. I think, honestly, that this relationship was doomed to begin with once he told me about what happened in the previous post. A part of me was probably still broken and resentful of what he'd done. Not to mention he also blamed it on long distance, which in my opinion is not an excuse any more. My parents did it, hundreds of people manage relationships like that every day without cheating.

There were also other issues, looking back: he was passive aggressive when he was angry (I would prefer a confrontation), he had a lot of trouble communicating with me (see: how he thought about this for a week before dropping the bomb), his parents spoiled both him and his sister and their family has never had any financial hardship. He never really checked out stuff that I recommended to him, even though I often tried out things when he did - games, new music, movies, you name it. To add to all this, I think the point at which I also seriously started to consider breaking up was when he complained about having to travel for an hour to come see me, when he only ever came back once a month, and all other weekends I went to his place. Not to mention, I make a commute that's *2.5 - 3 hours every day* to get to work! I was so upset when he said it at the time, but looking back I'm just angry.

I'm doing okay now, I think. After I poured my heart out my friend and I went shopping and I came back to play hearthstone. I gained 30 lbs. in my time with him that I'll need to lose again, but I think I can do it. My friend is also planning to lose weight, so we can be diet buddies!

As for my relationship with him, he wants to stay friends, but said he would do whatever I was comfortable with. Honestly, I don't know. I probably won't see him much on campus but we're both officers of the same club, so we do need to be on speaking terms. I think in a few months I'd be fine to talk in limited amounts again. It may be cold of me, but he was my first ever relationship - he was a lot of my firsts, actually - so I'm probably taking it worse than I otherwise would. But in the end I guess we'll see how things go. I can say in the end that by giving it a shot, I got more closure than I would have otherwise. Again, thanks to those that gave advice!"

3dn9j1,3,2015-07-17,I'm lost. Completely lost.,[deleted],TBI,https://www.reddit.com/r/TBI/comments/3dn9j1/im_lost_completely_lost/,"Hi everyone.  Almost exactly a year ago i tried that thing called suicide by jumping off a parking garage.  Why?  Because a girl I'd fallen in love with, taken out to drinks, and had a good relationship with, wasn't responding to my texts.  We both live in NJ and were juniors in college at the time, and both had full - time internships. I'm an only child and have always gotten what I wanted (I guess spoiled, to an extent). BUT my home was absolutely broken and fucked up.  Like really fucked.  My parents fought physically and verbally, i'm 22 rn and I can remember their fights back until I was 5 or 6.  They cursed each other and punched each other all the time, right in front of me.  My mom was thrown to the ground and couldn't get up when I was like 9 or 10.  Dad called the cops to report a domestic.  So I had to answer the door for the cops when I was 9, with my mom laying there, and I was crying hysterically and didn't know what to do.  no brothers or sisters to talk to.  After that, I've always had major depression, but it didn't always make itself known.  

Last August, I woke up in the hospital with no recollection of what I had done.  I knew who my parents were, and that I was in the hospital, but was still heavily sedated so was still in a dream world. My TBI was closed-head. I was in a coma. Medically speaking, it was a severe brain injury. I don't think I feel the effects of a severe brain injury, and it's definitely impossible to tell for strangers, but I still feel the effects: I don't feel ""normal"" at all and I fear I'll never be ""normal"" again, I have difficulty focusing, I feel depressed (on top of my pre -existing depression), withdrawn, anxiety, worthlessness.  I think this event happened at the absolute worst time: I had just turned 21, had plenty of friends to go out with and have fun with, was never bored, had a well paying job, had a good and successful future within reach, was in very good shape physically, I'm ""good looking"" and have always been a ""ladies man"", essentially I had a very good life.  But that ended when I decided to try suicide.  and now I have nothing, and have to deal with the attempted - suicide stigma for the rest of my life, no friends(they've all graduated and moved away, or don't want anything to do with me)~suicide stigma.  I had crippling physical disabilities that confined me to  a wheelchair, then crutches, then CAM walking boot, but now I'm all better and the same physically as I was pre-incident.  But I don't know what to do, and have 0 friends to talk to (and now i'm pretty bad at talking), can anyone give me suggestions about how to live?  It's like I'm dead, or not a human being anymore.  I have a TBI, all the symptoms of a TBI, am still recovering (physical therapy) from ""fatal"" injuries, and have to deal with the attempted suicide thing for the rest of my life.  What more could be wrong with my ""life"" right now?  I'm still treated the same way I used to be by my mom, which is fine, but it isn't fine because of my perception of it due to my brain injury.  I can't live my 20s the way I wanted to live my 20s, at least right now.  I'll be done with school (double-major) in December, but my gpa is kinda shitty so idk what that's going to do for me.  I definitely need to recoup all my social skills if I want to lead a ""normal"" life.  I had big dreams, really big dreams, and they were all obtainable, but now they aren't.  I'm 22 years old, have (or had) a type-A personality, what can I do or take to help the process of returning to my normal self?  I'm just trying to find happiness. I'm not expecting many (if any) replies but I just wanted to type this out and post it, because I've hidden real reason why ""I am what I am"" today, from most people.  I have the most intense and awful mood swings.  When I'm feeling down, I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. I just feel alone and sad.  I know it's normal to have the feeling of uncertainty when you're nearing the end of your undergraduate education, but I'm having a real difficult time dealing with this feeling.  

I guess one could say ""If you're recovering from a severe TBI, have pre-existing major depression, and got your TBI from cracking your head open upon landing from a suicidal jump, you're gonna have a bad time!!"""
3dna9n,24,2015-07-17,U.S Specific: Getting To a Doctor (Without nParent Support),CooperArt,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3dna9n/us_specific_getting_to_a_doctor_without_nparent/,"So, I am not a professional. I would love it if people would add on more information and make this a great guide for all. I'm using what I learned from, at age 17, sneaking behind my nParent's back and getting Mental Health care. I've heard the question come up a few times on ""how do I get this done?"" and I want to explain exactly what I've learned about the medical system from my experiences. Anyone else who has anything to add, I will edit the main post to include your information.

**Under 16:** I'm sorry. You're out of luck. Unless you have a supportive  person willing to play guardian, and are willing to forge some forms. (Forging forms, when I did it, was incredibly easy. They had me take the form home after my first appointment, and told me to have my parents sign it. I signed it for them. Illegal? Yes. But necessary? Yes.) You also still need money and transportation. You need to keep on keeping on. If things get super serious: 
1. visible bruises, and  obvious neglect of serious illnesses should get CPS' attention. (I don't have personal experience with this.)
2. The ER HAS to take you if you are really sick, no matter what age you are. They will call your nParents.

Age 16-18: At this age you can legally (at least in my state, Michigan, but I suspect this is a federal thing, can anyone confirm?) go see a doctor on your own for limited things. I was told, by my clinic, that I could see a doctor for ""psych and sexual things."" My general practitioner (GP)'s clinic made me forge the form anyway saying that my parents agreed I could go by myself, but when I was referred to a therapy clinic, they didn't need anything of the sort. I signed HIPPA with my therapy clinic, and was told by them that this meant NOBODY could see my medical records. I looked this up, and it looks like it varies state-by-state on what age your parents are blocked from seeing your medical records. But at 18, it is guaranteed HIPPA kicks in and they CANNOT see your medical records legally.

18: At 18, if you are being blocked by nParents from medical care, but are still living with them and under their thumb, I strongly suggest trying to get on medicaid. This gives you total medical freedom. Only give Medicaid your income. (After all, only you are going to cover your medical expenses.) Medicaid likes to kick up a fuss for me on painkillers most frequently (but I still get them, I just have to plan for the fuss-kicking) but otherwise they fully cover everything so long as a doctor gives justification. 

**doctor specifics**

Look into low-income clinics for therapy and psychology, and call around to see if any therapy clinics have interns (they should not charge you for interns), or will take you on pro-bono (free) if they know you are being blocked from treatment by your parents. Your GP should do this for you, but if they don't, take charge of your own life.

Now, N-specifics:

You need to plan for some things, depending on your parents level of n-ness.

My parents never were able to keep track of where I was at any given time. When I decided to start having appointments? I would just make some remark about how I went to see a movie or went to the library, if questioned. (which was once.) they never cared, never asked specifics. They can't seem to comprehend my existence if I'm not standing in front of them. 

But if your nParents are paranoid enough, start planning way ahead of time. Get friends willing to corroborate your fake story. (Maybe they'll also be your ride, if you're car-less and you need a car. [I'm rural, and a car was totally necessary for my journey.]) Start trying to set up a routine that you can get your doctors to stick to. 

You need to try and get a job, someone to fund you, or money squirreled away if possible. (I have no idea how medicaid will react if you report no income at all.) This helps especially if you're underage, so you can get the journey started sooner. My doctor cost me $120, prescriptions $8 a month until I aged into Medicaid. (Medicaid will back-pay 3 months, as an interesting, notable fact here.) 

You might have to get even sneakier with prescriptions. Put your prescriptions in normal looking bottles, for instance. Whenever I get my prescriptions mixed up somehow (I have two that look damn near identical except for the numbers carved on them) I can google the numbers carved on them and see what they are. So there's not a huge danger of storing them all together in say, a big advil bottle. 

And of course, the faster you get out, the faster you're free. 

**What happened to me?**

I was discovered fairly quickly. I didn't hide my prescriptions well enough, and got caught. (I think I wanted to. I held onto hope my nParents would realize that my going to these lengths to hide getting antidepressants said a hell of a lot about how they treated me.) Things got mildly worse for me. They accused me of being a hypochondriac, and of actively manipulating the doctors (munchausen's, but more malicious.) Dad pushed me about illegal drugs until I admitted it. It's been three years and they have admitted three times I'm sick, and nothing has changed.

My nParents are fairly mild. They're survivable. They won't attempt any physical actions against me. They're just emotionally toxic. (Just, hah.) 

Anyone have anything for me to add to the list?

I've read a bit on the NASA site about graduate programs and internships but I'm curious what other steps can I take to start taking now to help achieve this? Anyone on this subreddit have any advice? (or some general College advice too anything helps)





Thanks a lot for your responses in advance.


And for others who are curious here are the links I found regarding internships and KSC Recent Graduate Program

3dnbui,6,2015-07-17,Me [21M] struggling with break,damnthisredditheart,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3dnbui/me_21m_struggling_with_break/,"Struggling with break UP. also 24M, she was 21F. my bad.

Sorry to bitch, Reddit. I just need guidance really badly right now.

At the beginning of June, my gf of nearly 3 years (both first loves, we also lived together) and I drove across the country to get her to a summer internship. I flew back and planned to go back for her in Aug., but two weeks later she broke up with me because she felt i was too negative throughout our relationship (this is totally fair, i struggle with anxiety and depression and didn't work on it enough, but still was shocked and felt blindsided).

anyways, it sucked, i tried everything to get her back; didn't work. she is very attractive and it turns out she got tinder three days after i flew back home to ""meet people"". 

I've since found out that she actually asked a guy out the day after she got the app, a week and a half before she broke up with me. She kept sending me normal ""i miss you/i love you texts"", and when she did break up with me, i asked her specifically if she had been talking to other guys and she said ""no dont' be ridiculous"".

I just feel betrayed and used. Obviously all the hooking up she is doing now that we are broken up is her business, but man, it hurts in the feels to know she was starting off BEFORE she broke it off with me. We were so, so in love and obviously she fell out of love over the past few months or however long, but it hurts so much to think about how much things have changed.

Again, she is very attractive and its been easy for her to meet all these other guys - but for me, I'm average-ish looking (although im having doubts now) and although she thought i was handsome, im just worried she had low standards or something and i got lucky, because ive tried tinder out the past few days and had very little luck.

I just feel worthless and unattractive. What the hell am i supposed to do? I want to distract myself and hook up with a bunch of girls, but that doesn't seem very realistic at this point. 

tldr; girlfriend effectively cheated on me before she broke up with me, she's hooking up a lot now and im average looking and cant get anyone....how to cope?

3dnhik,3,2015-07-17,How to make time for the sexy-time for 2 type-As when uber stressed?,BucolicLove,olderlesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/olderlesbians/comments/3dnhik/how_to_make_time_for_the_sexytime_for_2_typeas/,"I figured you folks may have some tips here. The short question is: how on earth do we make time for sexy-time?

My wife and I have been together for 8 years. We’re both type-A personalities, and have issues unwinding. We were both also raised as fundamentalist Christians, resulting in spiritual abuses that have taken years to slowly deconstruct, such as seeing all forms of pleasure as nonessential and unimportant. All of this leads to us not being very fun…

We’re under a lot of stress as a family. We’re doing a slow move this month between 2 places, my wife just graduated university and got a job at a place that’s also moving, and she’s in charge of that move. I’ve got two projects (a thesis and an intern job mapping poverty) to wrap up this summer as I finish university. It’s been chronic stress more or less for three years for us - wildfire, homelessness, going back to school to get ahead, commuting weekly hundreds of miles to go back to school, moving across a state to get closer to that school, dealing with unsupportive family, dealing with horrible landlords, health concerns, PTSD diagnoses, poverty, etc. It’d been *insane* and I don’t say that lightly. 

All this stress is so chronic, it has become the norm. WifelyOne and I are both the types to place ‘fun’ on the backburner. We definitely both do this with the sex. It becomes something I just shut off, and I think she does, too, but I can’t speak for that. It just doesn’t become a priority when all the other things take precedence. 

It’s not like I’m not attracted to her, or vice versa, but when sexual contact isn’t made priority, the relationship also takes a backburner, and I become emotionally detatched. I just do that to prevent feeling to ‘struggle on’ amidst extreme stress. I think we both try to make time for it, but it doesn’t work out too well.

A classic example occurred today: I tried to suggest making room for the sexy-time this evening, and my spouse said, “Well, it depends. Our (former) landlord texted and wants us to move out of the apartment faster to lease it sooner. We have to talk about that.” This was the first I had heard of this, and it’s just another thing taking precedence over intimacy. 

I think it’s becoming a bigger issue the longer it’s not getting addressed, and neither of us seem to know how to not be type-A and prioritize all the never-ending fear-crap before the funtimes. Until I’m out of school, we’re a bit too economically strapped to see our therapist as frequently as I’d like. So I’m relying on the collective a bit! Do you all have any tips? 

TL;DR: Two type-A former religious types with (likely) internalized homophobia coupled with seeing sex/fun/pleasure as nonessential, resulting in larger issues of unfunny coupled with sexual stagnation.

3dno6t,7,2015-07-17,Countering misleading headlines in the media,kljaska,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3dno6t/countering_misleading_headlines_in_the_media/,"For the sake of not having this individual feel the wrath of Redditors since they did the right thing, I'll leave the journalist and publication anonymous for this post.

About an hour ago, I came across an article comparing Sanders and Hillary campaign donations that appeared in of the major and most-trusted news outlets in America. Despite accurately reporting the differences in the story itself, the headline did not make that distinction and glossed over the paltry number of small donations to Hillary Clinton.

I wrote the journalist on Facebook, a national correspondent, and complained about the misleading nature of the headline. This individual agreed without hesitation that it ""missed the point"" and told me that a junior writer generated that headline. The correspondent promised to have it changed and, in fact, that did occur with 15 minutes to something much more honest and one which actually prompts the reader to delve into the details. You can't ask for anything more than that if you are a Bernie supporter.

One thing to consider is that during July and August news outlets are heavily staffed with summer interns. Some of these poor headlines can be attributed to inexperience and, as today's incident shows, the journalists themselves are well aware of the potential for the standards to slip especially during these summer months. I can't say if this was the case here, but that has certainly been my experience elsewhere.

Having said that, if you see a misleading headline or story then don't be afraid to contact that journalist/publication. While most are likely being purposefully deceptive, some are simply the product of laziness or trying to be unnecessarily impartial.

Let's face it, we have some power here as Sanders' Redditors. Establishment media types do not want their comment sections or Facebook pages being blown up by the Sanders army. You have more power than you think to make a change. Be respectful, point out erroneous headlines or text, and make your voices heard.

I have screenshots of the two headlines, before and after, and I will happily send you the link if you PM me. However, I kindly ask that they not be re-posted to Reddit or elsewhere. This journalist recognized the error and took immediate action to rectify this mistake. I don't want this individual to receive any undue criticism. I'm willing to take them at their word that this was an subordinate error and the quick resolution suggests they are being truthful."
3dnqq5,2,2015-07-17,Need advice converting USD into CAD before I move back to Canada next month.,roninViking,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3dnqq5/need_advice_converting_usd_into_cad_before_i_move/,"Hey everyone,

I'm moving back to Canada next month to finish my undergrad after a year long software internship in the Bay Area and was hoping I could get some help. I wanted some advice about the best value conversion method from USD to CAD. The exchange rate is really good right now at 1.3 CAD for 1 USD. I currently have a TD Canada Trust account in Canada and a Wells Fargo account in the States. I should mention that I'm planning on returning to the States for employment after I finish my undergrad. Some options I've come across are:


1) Open a TD US account, put my money in there and withdraw from ATMs in Canada free of charge. This doesn't seem to take advantage of the great conversion rate though.

2) Go to a bank to convert the money and get ripped off.

3) Go to a money exchange company and potentially get slightly less ripped off

4) Use bitcoin. I don't directly know anyone who's converted this way but it seems like an option. Please let me know if you've done this!


I really don't have much experience in this especially for this scale of money. I've seen friends lose big chunks of their money to banks by converting through them and I can't help but think there must be a better way. Thank you in advance :)"

Not just because I have ADHD, but I'm also an atheist and I don't drink or go out like other college kids.

I have 3 semesters left in college, majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently working as a software development intern. I can be kind of nerdy when it comes to computers (and I spend a fair bit of time playing a PC game), but I'm definitely not the stereotypical nerd. I'm always seeking to improve myself in regards to health, personality, how I dress/present myself, etc. and I don't fit the typical nerd mold.
Anyway, I'll stop talking now. If you're interested feel free to PM me your kik username. It can be purely a platonic thing, or we can get into some dirty stuff eventually too if that's what you're looking for. Looking forward to hearing from you!"
3dpbpq,1,2015-07-17,Training the next generation.,triharder21,InfoSecNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfoSecNews/comments/3dpbpq/training_the_next_generation/,I just wanted to pose a question to the infosec community. With the need for more advanced security in many areas how do we as a community bring up the next generation. Private sector needs more talented specialists as well as the government. How can we partner to train the next generation? What do you think about training new members in the military. I propose training from the bottom up a calling to large companies like google apple cisco netflix oracle etc. to go in and help with the dilemma they are not oblivious to the governments current difficulties with internet security. The only way to fix the current issues is not from within the government but from outside. Get large companies to not solve the problem but to help train the future by extending a hand i.e.  internships for new active military e-4 and below training pipelines. Target this group you help the gov you help these service members the majority of which will be getting out of the military and going on to pursue jobs in tech. win win in my mind. We need to start thinking long term and providing solutions for the future not just our own but for the future of America.

I am somebody who has traveled across the globe and have been given an endless amount of opportunity throughout my life (I am 22, for clarification). I just failed out, for the second time, of what was supposed to be my last semester in art school, and I was working toward a graphic design degree (which I will presumably have to complete online, since this second incident of failure marks the termination of my student visa). I will now in the future return to living with my mother, who currently resides on the opposite side of the globe.

Why did I fail out? Honestly? I don't know. All I know is that toward the end of my third year I got out of a really unhealthy relationship that prompted me to change the way I live my life. I became more engaged and focused in school, I started exercising and eating right, I lost a ton of weight, i became more socially engaged, and then... it *really* started. I became utterly, totally, hopelessly depressed. I became so disenfranchised with the way my future was looking that I began underperforming in classes and drinking an unrealistic amount for somebody my size.

I love everything that is in my chosen career so much, *so much* so that I absolutely HATED seeing every single one of my peers doing well and fitting in and doing normal things and getting internships with corporations and becoming peons for what I perceived to be socially unhealthy messages of capitalism, and, for lack of better terms, turning into a cog, and that terrified me; it began to chip away at my optimism and idealism about life and the way that I believe we should live life, especially with how much I admire and love what my career is. It terrified me so much that I literally could not handle attending school any longer, so I started skipping class (and on days where I absolutely could not, I would show up near-blackout drunk). To this day, it is such a traumatic experience that thinking about returning to graphic design as a professional just makes me break down in tears. Because I truly, deeply love it, and I want to, I *fucking want to so utterly badly*, but I never want to experience what I experienced throughout that time again.

I am an artist. Or, I consider myself an artist, at best. For the people that were supposed to be giving me guidance and academic / career support in an **art school** to tell me, to remind me *every single day* that I am **not** an artist is, I think, what really destroyed me. It's what created a black hole so large inside me that I don't believe it will ever go away, even if I stop being depressed at some point. I will not go into too much detail on how it happened, since I don't feel it's too important, but I essentially began to become so disorganised and so inattentive about absolutely every single detail of my life that, to this day, six months later, I am still picking up the bits and pieces of a life that was shattered close to a year ago. And I still have no idea how I'm going to continue doing it into the future. One day at a time, probably.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will say that I don't think I would trade, in any lifetime, the experience that being truly depressed is.

I have learned so, so, so much, and met people that have so strongly changed the way I perceive life, and accomplished so many things of so much personal value to me. And I have been given some challenges that, in my overcoming them, I become better, more loving, kinder, more compassionate, and, above all, stronger of a person.

Firstly, my family. I love my family, and they love me, but they have never, once in my life, either acknowledged nor respected my need for utter autonomy and independence. Throughout my depression I have had a lengthy battle with a recurring addiction of colourful varieties, one that has on occasion become unmanageable as a result of the excruciating emotional circumstances in which I find myself. I have given my family a few scares, and, since they are all at a distance, they constantly worry about me. But I do not think it is acceptable for them to be constantly intruding into every single waking moment of my personal life, and it destroys me inside that they love me so much that they cannot leave me alone. For as long as I have been away from home they have done this (particularly my father) and it is borderline the most irritating thing, I think, anybody who longs to be an independent individual can experience. It is so irritating that I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that I am not mistaken when I cite my family as a key source of my depression.

I have also come to terms with the facts that 1. my mother is the only person in my family I truly care for and respect, and 2. because my father and my sister both had such high expectations of me throughout my childhood, over time this caused me to internalise them and become a self-destructive perfectionist with incredible performance anxiety. And, though they no longer expect that much of me, I still have not forgiven them for the emotional damage they have done and continue to do to me, despite my best efforts to do so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently began therapy, and though I no longer have the means to continue attending, I discovered through an extensive self-analysis that I am in possession of a VERY bad case of ADHD (though I still lack a proper diagnosis). It explains an unbelievable amount about my life, my attitude, my skills, and my beliefs. Coupled with (and leading to) depression, self harm, and addiction, it continues to worsen every day and make life more unbearably difficult for me and those who love me. But I digress.

Socially, I need friends. I need acquaintances. I need constant, recurring social validation and interaction. But my depression has caused me to become inhumanly withdrawn, and I intensely miss being around many, many people like me. People who understand, people who are interesting, people who have something to say, people who talk back, people who *listen*. I get caught in my own head frequently and it is really scary and things stop making sense; I become trapped in a whirlwind of incomprehensible emotions. Almost every day, this happens, now. But, on the days that it doesn't, I am the happiest human being on the planet, for a few hours.

Artistically, I continue to grow and make music and write and create art. And, really, truly, it does get richer, more beautiful, more incredible every day; so much so that all I want to do is share it with the world. But I am constantly at odds with myself, courtesy of a bad case of performance anxiety. Couple that with being so disorganised I make the average college freshman look like a business professional, and you get a beautiful case of so much artistic talent and creation that I simply just don't know what to do with it or how; for all practical purposes, it is wasted.

And it sucks. It *really*. *fucking*. *sucks*. Mostly because I know if I knew how to give myself a chance, I would succeed. But self-sabotage is just my M.O. now, and delayed gratification—thanks, ADHD—is a process that I am, simply put, neurologically incapable of engaging in.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then, there is emotion.

I faithfully believe that depression is less a curse and more a blessing, because the intense, inescapable sadness that I often experience is frequently matched by an unparalleled, equally intense, indescribable feeling of bliss. I am not entirely sure this is the way moods and emotions are supposed to work, but as I continue to learn about who I am, both from a spiritual and a neuro-bio-psychological standpoint, I fight it less. I fight it less because I have begun to accept this is simply the way I experience emotion, and it is often the case that others (especially those close to me) do not. It is a constant vacillation between utter nothingness and utter happiness, total sociopathy and total empathy; it is a fight between unmitigated hatred and unmitigated compassion. And I am much calmer internally when I just let it be, instead of attempting to control it.

I am not sure why I am sharing my story. Maybe I'm sharing it because it will help others see a bit of the jarring, uncontrollable details of their lives in my own, and maybe that will help them feel a bit more validated. Maybe I am sharing it because I am a self-concerned, egotistical son of a bitch, and I think somebody actually cares. Maybe I'm sharing it just because I like talking about my problems, because it helps me put them in perspective for myself. The inside of my head is a mess, but the words that exit my mouth often make so much sense that it seems, for a moment, like it isn't.

I know not what the future holds, but as of recently, I care a bit less. I care less because it is more meaningful to be happy and present in the moment than to worry about what could and couldn't be, and what was and wasn't. So, really, I'm just trying to enjoy myself, and taking what comes, one day at a time.

One day at a time."

Since she started I have felt a very strong connection to her and have developed a lot of strong feelings toward her.  I am horrible at registering and catching flirting, but I am almost certain she consistently flirts with me when we work alone together.  In addition to this we have conversations like I've never had with anyone before.  We have so much in common it's frightening, to the point where when we finally discovered something different we started making jokes about it since it had taken us working side by side nearly 3 months.

I'm at a loss for what to do.  I really want to date her, however I feel it would be inappropriate given our positions.  At the same time I don't want to let her slip away.  Whenever we aren't at work I'm thinking about her and am losing sleep."
3dr2ma,15,2015-07-18,Sophomore Year (F)un part 6 [fm] long,TheCosmicDust,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3dr2ma/sophomore_year_fun_part_6_fm_long/,"The next day Tim and I decided to enjoy our last day at his families lake house and leave later that night. Tim put on his board shorts while I got into my red bikini top with black bottoms. Tim and I grabbed some drinks and headed down to the dock.

We tanned for an hour or so before Tims family joined us. We all swam for a little before Tim and Greg decided to go out on the jetskis. I headed back up to pack up my things. Not long after I looked out the window after hearing a jetski pull up. I didn't see Tim but there was Greg parking his jetski and getting off. I went back to packing my things and after a couple of minutes I heard a knock at my door. There was Greg. He was standing there shirtless with water droplets covering his tone chest. His board shorts were still wet and stuck to his legs making the outline of his cock even clearer.

""Tim decided to go to the far end of the lake, so I thought I would come help you...pack"" Greg said.
""Im fine Greg really all thats left are my clothes"" I replied.

Greg walked right over and picked up a stack of my dirty laundry. ""Greg really get out I'm fine!"". He sorted through before finding a dirty pair of my underwear. He brought it up to his face and breathed in. ""Greg stop being gross and get out"" I explained as I reached to get my underwear. Greg grabbed my arm and brought me into his arms as he planted his lips on mine and kissed me. I tried to push away but his strong arms kept me in his lock.

He kissed down to my neck again as he ran one of his hands along the waistline of my bikini bottoms on my ass. I hated him so much but he was starting to turn me on. He moved back up to my lips and kissed me once more. I played along. We kissed briefly before he turned me around and pushed me over the side of the bed. I was now bent over the bed in my bikini as Greg stood behind me.

Greg kissed up my spine before kissing my neck again. Then he took my underwear in his hands, took my arms behind my back and tied them together with my thong. ""Greg what the fuck, Tim could be back any minute"" I shouted. Right then he slapped my ass and I moaned out in shock. ""I know you want this, I heard you and Tim in the shower last night"" Greg said as he slapped my ass once more.

He then tugged down on my bikini bottoms, dropping them to my ankles. I felt a cool breeze along my ass and pussy. I was fully exposed to him now. I felt his wet board shorts push up against my ass as his body leaned over my back. He untied the top of my bikini and tossed it off to the side.

I felt him lower his body as he kissed me slowly from my neck down my spine inching towards my ass. He paused as he kissed the top of my ass. He traced his tongue to my butt cheek before giving it a playful bite. He then moved back to my crack with his tongue before moving down slowly once more. The anticipation of him reaching my asshole was killing me. 

He swirled his tongue in circles around my asshole as I moaned out in pleasure again. He spent some time eating out my ass before dancing his tongue down to my dripping pussy. 

""Greg please, Tim could be here any sec..."" he cut me off as he plunged a finger in my pussy as he licked my clit. It felt so wrong but I wanted this so badly. I plunged his finger deeper into my pussy as he continued to eat me out. I could feel my orgasm building. He increased the speed he was fingering me before the first wave of pleasure hit me. My pussy tensed up around his finger as I cried out in pleasure. I came in his face as he licked up and down my soaking pussy. 

Greg backed away from my pussy as he stood up. He flipped me over and walked to the other side of my bed where my head was. I watched him as he towered over me still dripping with water from the lake. He looked damn good. His bulge was pushing against his wet board shorts as he lowered them slowly. His cock sprung out as he took them off. He lowered his dick over my face as his swaying balls rested onto my forehead. I kissed the bottom of his cock as it twitched on my nose and lips. Greg took his hand around his cock and lead the tip of his cock into my mouth. I swirled my tongue around the head before his pushed it down my throat. I gagged as i tried to adjust to the size of his member. Greg eased out before pushing back down my throat causing me to gag again. He eased his was back out allowing me to lick the tip. He pushed in and out slowly as I continued sucking his swollen cock. I started to feel his balls tense up on my head as he increased his speed. He pulled out and jerked himself off before shooting 6 or 7 hot ropes of cum covering my breasts and stomach before the last few drips fell onto my chin. 

Greg breathed heavy before walking around the bed again. ""Please untie me Greg, Tim could seriously come back at any second"". Greg peered out the window down at the dock and said ""We still have time, and I still need to feel that pussy around my cock"". He walked back over to me and picked me up off the bed. He lead me over to the window and faced me so that i was looking out at the dock. He hid me slightly behind the wall just as Tim had. He positioned himself behind me, still with my hands tied behind my back with my thong I felt him slap his now slightly flaccid cock on my ass. He shoved two fingers inside my pussy once more. He fingered me slowly as his other hand reached around and pinched my erect nipples. I slowly grinded against his fingers as i started to feel myself cum again. Not long after Greg had me in his hands like puddy as I came onto his fingers. I panted to catch my breath as Greg kept kissing my neck. He flawlessly replaced his fingers with his now hard again cock as he thrusted hard, deep inside of me. I cried out as I was still on an orgasm high. I looked down briefly at the dock to see that the family was still swimming and Tim was nowhere to be found. 

Greg thrusted in and out of me, increasing his speed as he kept me pinned against the wall. My ass slapped against him as he had total control of me. He fucked me for awhile before I came again on his cock. I was now seeing stars as Greg fucked in and out of me hard. I cried out ""Ohhh fuck meeeeee don't stop"". Greg slammed his body into mine for a few more minutes before He started grunting ""Oh fuck yeah baby I'm gonna fucking cum hard"". 

He thrusted a few more times before his body tensed up and he pumped his warm cum deep inside me. His cock twitched inside me as I squeeze my pussy onto him. We stood there for a few seconds before his cock grew limp. He pulled out of me and I felt the cum start to run down my leg. Greg untied me  before leading me over to the bed where I collapsed onto my back. I was covered in cum as well as dripping cum. I laid there as Greg put on his board shorts. ""Tim was right"" he paused ""..you do have a tight pussy"". He walked out as I laid there confused. What did he mean by that? I managed to stand up and walked over to the window. Tim jetski was parked at the dock but there was no sign of him. Fuck he could be coming up any second I thought. I turned around to run to the bathroom to clean up. Just as I opened the bathroom door, the bedroom door opened once more and Tim stood there. Fuck.

I kept my back to him so that he wouldn't see the cum but the scent of sex filled the air. ""Im gonna shower really quick Tim Ill be right out"".

""Turn around now"" Tim said sternly.
""Im just gonna hop in the shower Tim"" I tried to close the door.

Tim ran over and grabbed it open. ""Let me see what he did to you"". Now I was confused, what did he mean, how did he know?
'He grabbed my arm and turned me around. I looked at me up and down before looking at my fear filled eyes and grinning.

""You look so fucking slutty right now covered in Gregs cum"" Tim explained. Okay what? I thought. Tim kissed me before backing up and saying ""I knew Greg wanted to fuck you, him and I wanted to share you. I guess you were more than enough for him"".

He kissed me again and started making out with me. He walked me over to the shower and turned it on. ""Lets get you clean before I fuck you next."" Tim washed me and fucked me in the shower. I came a few more times before he eventually came. We packed and left the family to head back to my apartment.

We talked the whole thing over and he said that he wanted it to happen. We kept dating for a few more months before we went to visit his family again and things felt weird for me. I broke it off with Tim to take some time for myself. Tim ended up hooking up with my roommate Kaylin a few times before she ended it with him too. We finished up the fall semester and I kept myself pretty tame to get away from boys for awhile. After winter break Kaylin and I grew closer again getting over the whole Tim thing. Kaylin ended up meeting a guy on spring break later that year and spent most the time with him.

We went into summer looking for internships before landing separate internships in town. We moved into a bigger apartment and her boyfriend moved in. The first few weeks of my internship were crazy before I finally met Shawn. And thats where my life started to become amazing."

3drj63,1,2015-07-18,22 [M4F] - Looking for a friend/possibly more. I'm a genuine but somewhat shy atheist with ADHD and I'm always striving to improve myself,[deleted],Kikpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kikpals/comments/3drj63/22_m4f_looking_for_a_friendpossibly_more_im_a/,"I'll admit that I feel very different from other people. Not just because I have ADHD, but I'm also an atheist and I don't drink or go out like other college kids. However, I am very genuine and a pretty interesting person (if I do say so myself :P) once you get to know me and if you can relate to and/or accept the different things about me. I have 3 semesters left in college, majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently working as a software development intern. I can be kind of nerdy when it comes to computers (and I spend a fair bit of time playing a PC game), but I'm definitely not the stereotypical nerd. I'm always seeking to improve myself in regards to health, personality, how I dress/present myself, etc. and I don't fit the typical nerd mold. Anyway, I'll stop talking now. If you're interested feel free to PM me your kik username. It can be purely a platonic thing, or we can get into some dirty stuff eventually too if that's what you're looking for. Looking forward to hearing from you!"
3drk6v,14,2015-07-18,I don't know if I should or how to apologize to a professor (academic relationship),bshbshbsh,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3drk6v/i_dont_know_if_i_should_or_how_to_apologize_to_a/,"I'm a student currently working on my thesis project.

Two years ago I started working on it, and asked a professor (professor1)  that works only one semester a year in my university to be my thesis director. I respect him a lot, and I really admire him. A LOT. His work has international presence, and I quote him in my work very often. 

But after that first semester I worked with him, he didn't stopped on my University because he wasn't teaching. So I went to another professor (professor2) and he started guiding me and helping me with my work. We grew closer in an academic sense, and after a year I was working with him in a research project, and doing my internship. Professor2 has been helping me with other academic and administrative stuff in my university, he even gave me a huge recommendation that helped me getting a grant. So after that, he officially became my thesis director.

Meanwhile, when professor1 came back after a year, he helped me and corrected me in an hour session. He helped me with some comments on the work I've been doing with professor2. Professor1 was very exited about my project, and congratulated me for it. I was very happy about having his approval.

I sent some of my work to professor1 on March to be reviewed, and he didn't answered my emails.  I saw him on my university on May, and he told me he was too busy. I'm extremely awkward with professor1, he's very imposing and I admire him a lot.

And now, as I finished my thesis project, professor2 is officially my thesis director, and in the paperwork, professor1 shows as a reader and juror. 

So professor1 sends me an email, saying that he was very surprised, that he thought he was my director, and that I never told him he wasn't. It was almost resentful.

I admire him a lot, and don't know what to do, what to say. I really want to work in the future with professor1, but he has been absent and the one who has been really working with me was professor2. 

What should I do? And how should I start to apologize?

I feel like I cheated on him, like a liar :("
3drlw7,9,2015-07-18,I'm [27M] trying to rekindle things with a girl [26F] that I went on a few dates with last year,dumbstupidthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3drlw7/im_27m_trying_to_rekindle_things_with_a_girl_26f/,"Throwaway because I don't want this attached to my main account.  


Last year I went out with a girl that I met through an online dating service for a little over a month.  She’s a great girl and I really liked what we had, but unfortunately previous insecurities of mine got in the way and things ended amicably.  The truth is, I didn’t want things to end and ever since then I haven’t stopped thinking about her.  


Prior to that, I had a big fear of commitment.  Having been burned in the past by girls I dated, I built a wall around myself.  I was single for 4.5 years before going on dates with this girl and I had gotten used to the idea of being by myself.  The weekend things ended, my father was put into the hospital.  He has been battling CLL for about 9 years, and he was put in the hospital then because of an infection.  It was a trying time for me and my family, and at that moment, I shut out many people in my life – including this girl.  I hadn’t texted or spoken with her for a couple of days and then she reached out to me to let me know it would be ending because of the no contact.  I told her it was probably best because “I wasn’t ready for a relationship” at that point.  


Many months after that happened, and no contact in between, we bumped into each other while grocery shopping.  I, like an idiot, awkwardly blew past her without saying a word.  It was such a stupid thing to do, but my mind froze and I didn’t know what to say or do.  I’ve replayed that moment many times in my head and I cringe every time.  I should have said hi, or something like that, but I didn’t.  


Now, almost 2 weeks ago, I decided to do something about me thinking about her all the time.  I sent her a message via Facebook (I lost her number) to apologize for the grocery store incident.  She accepted the apology and then we messaged back and forth for a few more days before I asked for her number again.  We texted a little bit after that and I asked her if she would like to grab drinks the next time I was in town (out of town for an internship right now).  She agreed, and we met up last night for drinks.  


The “date” (not sure how she views it) went well.  We talked a lot, got caught up, and I thought we had fun together.  I sent her a text this morning letting her know I had fun and told her I would like to take her out the next time I’m in town (2 weeks) if she’s interested.  She responded that she was interested and would like to go out again.  


Now, here’s where I would like your advice.  It might be too early on, but I don’t know where her head is at.  I’m sure she’s wondering what my intentions are, giving how things ended last night.  Do I explain to her the tough situation I was in personally/mentally and explain to her I’ve worked on myself and would like to try and date her again?  I’m sure she’s guarded herself, but I just want to know if it’s good to provide transparency?  I don’t want to screw things up again because I like this girl.  


TL;DR – Dated a girl for a month last year, things ended amicably.  Reached out to her in recent weeks and went on a “date” with her last night.  Wondering if I should provide transparency about where I was mentally/personally when things ended last?  Still might be too early on, but just want to make sure I don’t screw this up again."

(Pics: http://imgur.com/a/eJcND)

I have recently turned 20 and I am a male. 

To begin, ever since June 19, I have noticed a bit more hair fall out. So at first, I thought it was no biggie, but it has escalated out of my control extremely quickly.

A bit of background is that I am Chinese and I have had thick hair ever since I can remember, but then this is extremely sudden that I have started to lose a TON of hair.

I started a new desk job as an intern on June 11 (my first ""serious"" job ever), and ever since then, my hair and (cystic) acne became a major problem, I pick up about 20-30 hairs every day on my desk at work alone. Even more during the night after I wash my hair (if I do not wash my hair for 1 night, it gets unbelievably greasy). The job is definitely stressful, I basically feel stressed out (almost to a point of crying, honestly) and tired 24/7 now and sleep much more often, but still have to wake up every morning at 6 AM.

I have also lost around 60 pounds starting at February. During that time, I was an extremely poor college student with an extremely poor diet (literally ramen and cereal every day with a pear) because of the lack of money I have. It was not exactly because of exercise I lost weight, it is more that I have eaten around a max of 800 calories (maybe even less, ramen ~400 calories and cereal ~200 calories) 5 days a week, weekends I usually ate out with friends. As you can tell, I was basically extremely depressed while dorming and I just never felt hungry. During the dorm days, I did not have any hair loss at all, only a one or two pimples at a time (now it is 10-20 at a time).

I am currently back home for my internship, getting my diet straight, but ever since I came back, this stuff started to happen.

It began with a bit of recession, nothing big, then it literally all seemed to fall out within 3 days (July 1 to July 3). Now, 2 days ago on July 16, my crown felt weird and it seems that my cowlick on the back of my head has grown bigger (refer to picture 1). Unfortunately, I do not have a base picture to have, but I can guarantee that it was a basic cowlick where it was just a swirl.

My parents both have literally 0 hair loss in their family, my dad just has a mature hairline that never has moved and my mom's dad had the most fabulous hair ever as well (refer to the actor named Rain: the person from Ninja Assassin (movie)).

I have seen that you guys have your doubts about weight loss and hair loss's correlation, and stress's as well, but I still want your guy's input. I unfortunately cannot see a doctor/derm yet because of lack of insurance, but it will get fixed soon, but I want to get other people's opinions on this now. 

Thanks for reading. I really appreciate it."

3dsedp,0,2015-07-18,Could I get enough sleep to function during a public accounting busy season?,895throwaway895,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3dsedp/could_i_get_enough_sleep_to_function_during_a/,"Periodic lurker, first time poster. Here are some facts:

I am currently between my junior and senior years in college and considering recruiting with public accounting firms in the fall (big 4 and regional). This summer I am doing an accounting internship at a mid to large sized trucking company.

I've heard the horror stories of public accounting hours during busy season and I'm concerned about the sleep deprivation this could cause.

I need 8-9 hours of sleep every night to really be at my best, but I can get by for extended periods of time on 7-8. 6-7 per night for more than a day or two in a row and I need large doses of caffeine to function. Less than 6 per night for more than a day or two in a row and I practically become a zombie.

So my question is: Could I get enough sleep to function during a public accounting busy season?"
3dsttw,2,2015-07-18,Surprise long trip with the pops - Ideas?,gammerx,motorcycles,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/3dsttw/surprise_long_trip_with_the_pops_ideas/,"Hey y'all, I've had a few posts in here and daily this sub. Just got my license and bike a couple weeks back and have been loving every second of it. I'm now a senior in college with a pretty good internship but living at a friends for the job and have not told my dad about the bike! He's been riding since he was ~22 and owns a 2005 Honda Goldwing. 

Anyways, I've always wanted to ride with him and now I can finally do it. Currently live in upstate NY and he's in Long Island. So the surprise is I'll show up at his house with the bike, tell him pack 2 days of clothes we're leaving, and then take an extensive weekend trip for some long overdue father son bonding.

Considering we have until Sunday night to get back home, I had 3 ideas

1. Do a loop up from Long Island, through the east coast into Maine, then swing back through Vermont and down the Hudson.

2. Western NY and go along finger and great lakes (Ontario and Eerie)

3. Go south and maybe even as far down as North Carolina. We both have interest in moving down there (me for engineering jobs and more outdoorsy activities, him for the quieter lifestyle).

Any ideas or suggestions? Things to invest in or needed stuff for a long trip maybe? I'm planning on getting a gopro and dual pack sena so I can record everything :]"

3dt1kq,5,2015-07-19,Wanted to share my story,Mystory4495,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3dt1kq/wanted_to_share_my_story/,"Let me just start off with telling you all that I have had a very interesting 7 months or so. It all started on an off campus house near my local university. I and 3 other roommates decided to live together. 2 out of the 3 other roommates are very heavy pot smokers. We all had great grades before moving into this off campus house. The freedom of no RA or local neighbor was amazing. But with freedom comes responsibility. 

Let me say I was never a big pot smoker until these last few months. We all had great grades and we all had internships. All 4 of us never smoked as much as we did until one of my roommates introduced me to dabs or concentrated hash oil. After a couple hits I and my other roommates were hooked. We loved the feeling of constantly being high and it took our minds off of everything negative. It wasn't until we started doing it every three days, and then every two days until it became an everyday event. 

Back in April I lost my first internship because I let myself become a lazy sack of nothing. I would literally go to work for my internship and after work would immediately hit my bong at home. I probably consumed about .5g-1g per day. It was amazing at the time but eventually I got too lazy to want to get out of bed due to my every night bong sessions. I would constantly get weed and hash oil to make sure I never ran out. All my internship money blown on this plant. School work was an afterthought and I was just plain miserable when I wasn't high.

After many night sessions with this plant, I eventually would wake up and call off work and skip class because of how lazy I have become. 2 out of my three roomates both got fired from their internships due to lack of ambition and reliability, the same thing that happened to me. Both of them decided to go to rehab for their mental addiction to marijuana. It's surprising how easily one can become do dependent on it. In just 3 months all of us were on a path to an empty life. 

Just recently, I have decided to quit marijunana all together. I believe the last time I smoked was roughly 1 month ago. I decided not to count the days as I feet it is unnecessary to do so. I finally found another internship position and I am on the road to recovery. I can't say the same for my other two roommates as we barely talk to eachother anymore. Our lease ends at the end of this month and I feel it is for the best. 

marijuana is such a beautiful plant, but allowing it to take control of your life is can lead to such emptiness. Smoking everyday for 3 months, I can say I quit cold turkey. I saw what it was doing to not only myself, but to my roommates also. I hope they are recovering as I am at this moment. i am writing this on my iPad so I apologize if the story is a bit jumbled. There are so many more details I wanted to add but my fingers simply can't take all this tapping..

Anyways, I can happily say I have been clean for one month and have finally got back on the path of finding another internship and I don't plan on touching marijuana for a long long time, if ever. It can be such a lovely thing but can also be your worst enemy if not controlled.  /r/leaves, you have been incredible support for me and I am glad there are forums like these out there."

3dtcd7,5,2015-07-19,Part-Time Job for an undergraduate INFJ?,past_the_post,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/3dtcd7/parttime_job_for_an_undergraduate_infj/,"Hello, INFJs (and others)! I'm looking to find a job that's suitable for INFJs that I could do part-time while in college. 

I'm currently in the food business working in the kitchen, and I absolutely hate it. It gives me so much anxiety and worsens my depression because of the huge focus on being a speed demon and because it requires so much interaction with strangers and coworkers I don't know well (and probably never will). It also requires a lot of repetitive physical work, and I can never seem to make myself into a good robot because I'm weak and timid. I feel totally incompetent. I desperately want to leave, but I have no idea where I would go because I feel like I would hate all of the other jobs available to me.

If it helps, I'm currently studying Computer Science and Linguistics. I adore academia and would love some kind of job there as a research assistant or something along those lines--anything involving school, really, because it's wonderful--but I don't think I'll be able to find anything relevant to my field that isn't an internship. I am a very competitive student and have some close connections with various professors, so I could feasibly have a chance at some of those positions if I knew what I could actually do without a degree there.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this!

TL;DR: INFJ college student looking for a job I won't hate."
3dtczw,1,2015-07-19,[Help] dog mood/time constraints/financial changes hindering my ability to adequately provide for my best friend,eagertoroam,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3dtczw/help_dog_moodtime_constraintsfinancial_changes/,"[tldr: loving dog becoming increasingly aggressive/unpredictable mood swings and I'm not sure how to keep caring for him with Graduate school/work commitments]

My six year old border collie mix has a few medical conditions that require daily medication, frequent blood work and changes in my school/intern schedule are making it difficult to provide consistently good care for him.

Back story - this dog has been through a lot including being attacked by a pack of large dogs when he was only a year old and has been severely beaten by a male family member in relation to an altercation between him and another dog (I was unaware at the time and was informed only months after the fact). These two incidents have left him aggressive to other animals (large dogs in particular) and all men except my husband and dad.

I am having a difficult time mitigating or changing his behavior and have tried walks but my crazy school/work schedule make regular exercise a lower priority than it has been previously. Due to graduate school time constraints, including required unpaid internships, I am no longer to afford his medication and have a much smaller amount of time to devote to him.

To put my time issues in perspective - my summer internship and class schedule have me out of the house from 7am-8pm five days a week, longer on some days and my husband is also going to school while working 30+ hours per week. This coming semester will be even tougher, with school and work having me out of the house 630am-1030pm two nights a week and 630am-730pm every other night of the week.

This unpaid internship in particular is putting a severe financial strain on my family since I've been providing a minimum of half of all bills and 100percent of animal related bills. But even before this, I haven't been able to afford the 200$ bloodwork necessary every six months to keep him on his medication. I worry his behavior changes may be related to medical issues but cannot afford to run a battery of tests on him at the moment, and likely not for several months. 

My husband and I have been unable to have friends over for the past three years due to him lunging at and attempting to attack friends. This behavior had previously been written off as only occasional and due to his sordid history; however, he has recently begun to act aggressively toward smaller animals (we have a large feral cat population around our home as well as a small kitten in the home) and is becoming increasingly aggressive toward strangers and neighbors. His possessiveness and aggression toward smaller animals is highly unusual and is definitely new behavior. He has even snapped at me recently. 

My husband and I do not know what to do about this behavior and are extremely conflicted. Because of his history and medical condition I have been warned he would most likely be put down at a shelter or at the very least be unlikely to be adopted. And also due to his history of aggression is unsafe for me to privately adopt out due to potential legal ramifications on my end.

Can you please give me some advice regarding what to do and how to handle this issue? I am reticent to surrender him due to worries over his livelihood but cannot have an overtly aggressive dog, especially due to family dynamics.

Because he was my dog before we got married, my husband is hesitant to have input in this decision and doesn't want me to feel pressured one way or another. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated."
3dtzcu,4,2015-07-19,Give me 40 total days to do some thinking,Calvin_,GiveMe40Days,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiveMe40Days/comments/3dtzcu/give_me_40_total_days_to_do_some_thinking/,"# **First 20 Days**

I've posted here a few times... with varying degrees of success. I like to analyze why I was or wasn't successful, but I am starting to think that a lot of those factors are external to myself... for example, if I'm trying to stay positive, my mood depends a lot on the people I interact with..

Anyway, for the first 20 days, until August 8, I am going to avoid cannabis in any form (edibles, vaping, and smoking, mainly). I'll check in here every day, with a simple comment ""Day #: Didn't consume cannabis"" or ""Day #: Decided to _________."" I can see a few scenarios (1 or 2 days) where I'd be okay with smoking (I'll be moving within these next 20 days, MAYBE for a going away party or something).

I am also going to write in my journal every day for the first 20 days. I've been doing a lot of soul searching, and I still don't have an idea of what I am or what I stand for. In a lot of my past posts to this sub I've said ""Oh, I'll create something every day."" But I don't know why I think that's the bees knees. I don't *naturally* create something every day. I have a really really logical mind. I like to analyze and sit back and look at the facts and figures before taking action. It once took me over 20 minutes to pick a pack of pens to write in an old journal with... picking between brands is really hard, although making decisions in general isn't as hard (it's more like picking between options that are virtually the same–similar in price, quality, quantity, etc., but varying in small yet substantial ways).

Anyway. I want to write every day to allow myself to do some self-analysis. I have been avoiding that a lot lately. And I've been filling my time instead with a lot of netflix and being high.

#**The Second 20 Days**

I haven't decided yet. I'll edit this post when I know what I might want to do. I want to get to August 9th first, with a clear head and some ideas of how to effectively fill my time for months/years to come.

I honestly see picking a career path (or even just a starting job) as picking between packs of pens. Nothing seems to be like the best option. I'm hoping to gain perspective over the next 40 days; I'm not on a quest to find all the answers.

I have been consuming a fair amount of cannabis. I finished out my time at my internship alright, although I certainly could have been more focused/on task the last few days. It would have made goodbyes less stressful and the ending of my time in a new place sweeter. I don't have many regrets though... I learned a lot about myself.

I did not write every day. Because I didn't say that I would record that (whether or not I wrote), I never added to the daily (or whatever, semi-weekly) comment. I should have. Now I have a few goals:

1\. Complete a to-do list I made in a journal entry from Monday, August 3  
2\. Practice cello every. single. day.  
3\. exercise, somehow, every day (maybe 5x a week?)  
4\. organize myself for the upcoming school year.  
*5\. write in my journal most days*  

a.  (I wrote something like 26 things down that I thought I would be able to complete in 2 days... I'm not even half way done, although most of that is due to lazines..)  
b. I have an audition coming up, I'd like to nail it instead of being semi-lazy and just doing what's expected.  
c. I don't have any problem doing it, except for the part when I do it.  
d. Much of this ties into my to-do list, but I have some other matters to take care of, and as they come up perhaps I shall add to-do lists from my journal to complete.
e. I am not particularly picky about this. What I find is that my best journaling comes when I want to journal. I honestly am not too pleased with the paper and pen approach that I've been trying (I can't blame that for the reason I haven't journaled... but also, I tended to journal inbetween activities on my computer... and I type a lot faster than I write!) Actually, now that I think about it, I'm going to go back to using my computer Journal. It's just so much more me. I'm glad I settled this though. I can still write in my journal if I need to.

Wow... that last point was really just me debating with myself. Well. Good job me. Signing out for now."
3dugcg,2,2015-07-19,Change of professional internship start date?,progress_dad,Disneycollegeprogram,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneycollegeprogram/comments/3dugcg/change_of_professional_internship_start_date/,"Hi everyone,

I have few questions regarding an internship I applied for a while ago (Feb).

It was a summer internship set to start at the very end of May. My application was processed, I made it to the ""in progress"" stage, and even got an email from the head of the department asking for my portfolio. 

Unfortunately the start date came and went and I was still in the ""in progress"" stage. I have been checking periodically and sometime within the past month, it went to the ""Interview Stage"" although I didn't get an email, I haven't had an interview scheduled or anything, and the internship now says it is ""Fall"" 2015.

Its a bit of a weird situation, especially because I met these guys in person only a month or two before and we both knew that I was an applicant for this internship.



Does anyone know of this type of thing happening before? Should I send someone an email?? I'm also worried that I may have missed an interview opportunity since it has been a little bit since I checked my status (I kind of gave up hope..). Does anyone know if there is a way to check out on missed interviews?

Any advice, feedback, questions, or concerns appreciated!"
3dulbk,1,2015-07-19,PHM: Feeling a bit of a sting from love,[deleted],ihearyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihearyou/comments/3dulbk/phm_feeling_a_bit_of_a_sting_from_love/,"Normally I hate to get all sappy like this but recently I've been feeling burned by what little of a love life I have. And the worse thing is is that I *know* I'm taking this out on myself too much, I *know* I shouldn't be hung up on this one girl and I've tried convincing myself of that but I always end up back at square one y'know? 

I met this girl at an intern orientation thing and I wasn't much into her at all but as fate would have it, we ended up working for the same company *on the same floor together* too. It was then that we (or at least *I* feel like) started bonding more and where I became attracted to her. Work was boring as  hell but we talked through our respective work emails (worked on the same floor but on different sides) and we even had a nice conversation in my car when I drove her home one time. We hit it off really nicely in my honest opinion and I believe anyone else in my situation would believe so too. 

However, being the awkward one that I can be around girls at times, I asked her out for lunch on saturday *through our work email!* I sort of justify it because she was at a different building for the day at the time but still, there were many other times I could've asked her in person plus, looking back on it, I probably would've been more comfortable asking her in person. Heck I didn't even have her number yet which I knew was a red flag going in. Anyways, she replied back with some excuse that she had to ask her parents first (FYI: She's 16 and I'm 18 but that's not what this post is about as I was fine with the difference) which I took as a polite way of saying no. Next day, I ask through email again if she could make it and she comes up with a freakin list of excuses to justify not going on the date which I concluded was the nail in the coffin. 

Later on, as we are sort of teasing each other through email again, she says something along the lines of, ""Of course you're too old. Didnt think I needed to hint it that strongly lol"" to which I replied ""I see how it is lol"" Ever since those two awkward encounters, she has *definitely* been avoiding me which really sucks because I actually valued our friendship I mean she made work 10x more bearable for me and I'd like to think I did for her too in some way. Anyways, I was in a room full of interns and she was on the otherside talking to some other intern who exclaimed ""Just talk to him!"" and she replied ""No he's too old..."" I only heard part of that conversation because it was loud and I noticed at the last second but my overanalyzing-brain tells me that they were low-key talking about me. 

And just this week, I invited her to lunch for our lunch break simply because I wanted to set things straight but she replied with another BS excuse of ""Im having an early lunch and I actually have a lot of work to do"" which I know the latter part is false because we, especially her, never have any work to do. She would've normally said yes to a lunch break meetup but again, she's probably avoiding me as we haven't talked at all anymore. 

My brain tells me I'm not hung up on her and that I'm going to college anyways where there are many other girls to meet and I probably won't ever see my co-worker again but my heart keeps slowing me down. I know she's just not that into me but I just feel stuck in this self-inflicted purgatory. I guess, in the end, I just don't know how to move on other than letting ""time"" deal with it.

Only silver lining I can come up with is that she seems very overdramatic on FB, posting those very vague/sad statuses. She doesn't do it all the time but still, it's kind of a high school thing to do imho. Also did a bit of FB creeping and found out she might actually be getting over another guy so there's that. 

TL;DR: Felt a connection to a girl but found out she didn't reciprocate the same feelings back and now we can't even be decent friends like before. Don't know how to move on from this.   "

I was thinking about doing it in September but the application deadline is tomorrow, and I decided to put it on hold until the next intake, in part because I have not looked into it all enough yet.

The thing is, I am starting to have doubts of whether I would actually be a good teacher. I am shy, reserved and hate the feeling of being watched and judged upon. I am not a really enthusiastic person, the thought of presentations fills me with dread and to top all of that off, I have mild to moderate anxiety problems.

Now considering all that together, I just really don't think I'd be a good teacher. I love English language and grammar and I am a genuinely good person with a warm heart, good intentions, morals and empathy. But the problem is, I just don't think I have the typical personality of a teacher and feel that it could be a profession that I would really struggle in.

Are any of you of the shy/anxious type, or did you have similar concerns to me when you thought about being a teacher?

Any guidance and feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks"

She is very playful and has ask me if I'm single and what type of girls I usually date.

3dv1rx,1,2015-07-19,I want out,[deleted],death,https://www.reddit.com/r/death/comments/3dv1rx/i_want_out/,"Dear people of the forum,

To be honest I don't know how to begin.

At this point, it may seem cliche, and I know despite thousands of suicide confessions and how petty many people including myself think they are, I think it's the only way out for me. 


I know it's ridiculous, and I know when I've typed out my life's story that it all seems so petty, so temporary, and so mend-able, so lucky. And yes, I am a lucky and privileged person by all standards, really. I have every decent thing a child could have. So maybe I'll just pinpoint just one thing that made everything a tipping point. I don't know I'll be able to.


Now looking back, I was a depressed kid since I was like maybe 9 to 10, at that point of my life despite the different view of life I had (and still have), I saw no point in studying and I went from a straight-A to a failing student. At certain points in my life I'll improve dramatically because I put effort and then it all rolls down the hill again where I've just lost all motivation again. You know, study hard, get certificate, get job, work and cha-ching. Typical Asian parents.


But my parents refused to give up on me, and said of all the children they've had, they MUST give me a high tertiary education because I was the ""type that gets bullied"". I dragged myself out of a UK university with a 2.2 LLB with honours and I knew I could have done better, but considering the fact that I've done nothing but slept 16 hours a day and slept through so many classes and too dead to even talk or cry, I took it. Graduation didn't even feel like anything to me while all the other classmates that sandwich-programmed with me took like hundreds of photos of them doing things with their gown and graduation hat. 


I distanced myself from any other acquaintances I had because I knew myself and I saw those who didn't understand cringe and get uncomfortable when I radiate this sense of pain and agony in either my speech or my demeanor. I had very few who understood, mostly those who are a bit effed up in the head, as well as some normal guy who just understood. I don't have many friends. And if you need help and I have the energy to give it, I'll do it and I hate small talk. That's about it. But do note that I always self-analyze and I've come to terms that that's about my fate right there so I don't actually mind not having friends that much. I have so many thoughts bombarding my head that I can't get rest anyway. I actually tire easy at ""friend gatherings"". I know myself. Let's just get that out of the way.


Basically, one of the highest places you can go on law academically is to complete the BPTC in the UK, which is in short the license to practice. And because my country is of the Commonwealth, UK's laws are shared with our country's. I was not encouraged to complete the ""practice license"" in my own country because 1. Our country's university sucks and 2. Our country has a racist quota on the passing of that course and I'm not of the favorable race (it's a all-known secret) 3. They want the boost of quality in my qualifications. I don't blame them. I don't know how I got the 8.5 in IELTS to go in that freaking BPTC course, and I think that university was new and short of students so that's why I got in in the first place anyway. Heh. 


The lecturers were nice, and they were professional. But it was the worst year of my life. I don't know how to tell you this. And here's where we all get to the other cliched ""what does it feel like"". Every day was like someone dragged their car tires across my face and skid down my body. Every day and task ahead was like a car accident coming at you the driver in slow motion, and it repeats again, and again, and again while the opposite driver looks you dead in the eyes. Every day without reason I literally get the feeling of a pillar ramming through my gut (the pressure of impact, not pain) and my eyes felt like popping out of their sockets from this pressure (again, no pain) and before long I realize I was crying. There was this long mirror on the wall of my dorm and I would look into it and begged myself to buck up and ""by God if a higher self of me exists, please HELP ME!! I can't fail my parents like this!!"" Yeah. Parents. Asian parents. And there I was, over 25 and still locked to them financing me in my studies, partly because it's the way it is and secondly because I'm not allowed to take any jobs or take in any volunteer work unless it's their club's stuff (because they deem it appropriate) or some kind of course-required work because it will ""obstruct my studies"". So yeah, no experience in societal stuff and I'm always told I have none. Now that I write this out, I guess in a way I'm entitled to feel angry about this, but I guess this is not the point. 


I don't know. Any surge of energy I've got was from my inner torture and maybe a simple burrito or ice cream from the mall. That's it. The closest I've come to telling anybody was to a some kind of outsourced university mental help department located in London while I'm not studying there (that course provider/university has a lot of branches in different areas) and I've retracted myself saying I'm okay again when I'm not after the day I confessed. The other time is that I've hinted to some lecturers that ""I'm not happy"" and they seem to get the deal. I don't know. The worst was when I realized after that failed year, I look back time and again, and find that I don't regret a single thing even though I've failed the course.


Not a single thing.


That scares me.


And now here I am, in my hometown's house, living with my parents (the humiliation and shame), and basically a lot of foreign schools start at September, and I'm here at the end of July not even applying to Australia or New Zealand (I think the UK/BPTC has made it clear that my re-application to redo the course is mostly garbage talk now) while I've lied to them that there's just has been no replies. I just simply couldn't take it anymore. And here I have to make it clear that I do not fear rejection, failure, or any of the sort. I simply do not. I guess what it boils down to is that I don't want to waste their hard-earned money anymore knowing that I won't ever accomplish what they expect me to do (At this point I must explain this is not rebellion either and it's not demotivating myself saying I can't do it. It took almost 2 decades of my life to know this.). I guess one of the subconscious things that was keeping me back was also the fact that I didn't want to sign my parents' divorce papers after I've done the course and called to the BAR or whatnot and have the authority to do so. Their relationship have been straining for quite some time and I know. Now I've come back I feel that more and more and I thought I could be the one taking in their confessions and all but even now the ""psychologist"" me years back was gone. I could do that now by switching to that mentality again, but I'm just out of energy. I couldn't do it. They are getting worse and I have to stress despite their problems it has little and limited influence to the 
overall story and decision I'm making. 


I was an artist by birth. I was not allowed that for fear of not being able to make a living out of it. If anything, it was going to be a ""professional"" or there will be no talk on a further study. They've ""seen too much"" of people not having higher education suffer financially because they love to buy things but not studying thus their predicament etc. I understand. I accepted it. I've not drawn for years, and it's killed me inside but I don't want to draw while in the shared room with my sibling because I'm worried that kid may be getting the wrong ideas. But apparently that kid picked up, and got influenced by a f*cked-up friend and now the sibling's failed his/her own course due to laziness and apparently I'm an example to why he/she failing the course is ok, and basically in short he/she sees me as a lazy ass who made it somehow through university instead of a person who has been and still is actually fighting an invisible enemy to stay alive. And I've talked to my mom once in a casual chat about how about me being depressed years ago. She said she'll send me to the asylum. Like that famous insane asylum, where the actual mental crazy people and criminals go. So talking to them about this? Out of the question. Dad is becoming more and more of a religious nut so he'll say it's unholy and it's an excuse. Mom has worked her ass off from poverty to what she is now and she'll say I couldn't face ""reality"" and it's an excuse. The older sibling who has made it working in the UK will say I'm lazy and it's an excuse. The younger sibling will get the wrong ideas and as smart as that kid is, will use this as an excuse just to be lazy instead of actually using that wit to accomplish something. Seeking professional help? In this country and in this town it's close to impossible. Depression is taboo. A sin. A weakness. A disgrace. A parent's failure. An excuse.


As you can see I'm a negative influence to everything around me. That in itself is not the reason but it's a conglomeration of everything. I'm done. I don't really care how petty you think my reasons are. Soon the lie of not applying to any universities is gonna pop and even now with that thought everytime I click on a university Apply webpage I feel like hurling the laptop across the room and feel like stabbing, stabbing, and stabbing myself to death. I'm in a prison. Such a privileged prison that so many would kill to have. But I can't see anything beyond tomorrow, where my internship employer and my elders ask ""hasn't any university replied yet?"" and have to explain when I eat yet another free home meal when is the university reply coming.


I ask that you forgive me jumping here and there and everywhere in this babbling, it's just hard to take out all the seething volatile concoction in my brain to put them into coherent words. When I was a kid, all I wanted was to make a difference. At this point all I want is just to die. In peace. What drove me to this? I blame no one but myself. I know this all seems so stupid. I've analyzed myself for years. I've tried meditation. I've tried exercise. I've tried healthy-eating. I've tried some secret counseling. I'm smart enough not to try alcohol or drugs or so-called ""medication"". Too many a time I've seen medication being more like a roulette of hit-or-miss. I want to go clean and sober.


This is not a threat, this is not even a cry for help. I'm just done. Maybe it was expectations that hit the tipping point. Maybe I'm weak. Maybe the world's crazy. Maybe everything's effed up. Or maybe I'm effed up. It doesn't matter. My heart's beating but I just don't feel a thing.


I know I sound like an emo glorifying or romanticizing this. I'm not. I know I sound like a whiny privileged kid and so many would kill to have my place. I know. God do I know. I've analyzed myself so much by God I know. 


Just...I'm sorry. And Thankyou for reading. Goodbye."

For a little background: Ann goes to college in NYC. Last summer she got an internship in Alabama where she met Bill. He is 13 years older than her and in my opinion just is using her for sex. At the time I wasn't bothered by the relationship and thought it would end when she went home to NY in the fall. 

But, a year later, they are still together. This is my dilemma, Bill doesn't have his life together. He has a part time job, has gotten a DUI, and doesn't have enough money to even come see Ann in NY. She is constantly flying or driving to see him. He is so needy and constantly calling or texting her. 

I just want what is best for my best friend and this guy isn't it. Unfortunately she is ""so in love"" that she just gets angry with me when I bring it up. How can I show her this relationship will never work?

Tldr: Bill is 13 years older than Ann and a thousand miles away and doesn't have his life together. How do I show my young friend this guy is using her for sex/nudes?"

My wife and I have worked so hard - well not just hard, but smart, to get to where we are today. We came from low income backgrounds, but because of the family structure we were both raised in, we did very well in school, eventually graduating from college (on our own dime), and now on the verge of entering the full time work force after graduate school (Me: almost done with an MBA, Her: final year of medical residency).

When we look at our pay checks it's so depressing, the state and federal government take almost 33% of our gross and I know as we move up in income brackets they will just take more. Then I see on facebook (from my less successful friends) and on the front page of Reddit, all this crap about a $15 minimum wage, or nationalized healthcare, or some other crap, and it blows my mind.

I fully support having some type of social safety net, and I know that there are those who are unable to work, but I don't want to have to give these liberals *more* of my pay check so they can buy more creature comforts while working full time at McDonalds. Why should I have to subsidize their poor choices? I knew going into college that I wouldn't make any money being a ""communications"" major so I didn't choose it. I chose something that would enable me to provide for my family. In the same vein, I was extremely aggressive during and after college securing internships and a well paying full time job. 

Now I see all of these people whining about how much doctors are being paid (no shit they are paid well, my wife gave up 12 years of her life and all of her 20's to become one), or that we need a minimum wage of $15/hr so someone can support their 2 kids on a single minimum wage income. 

I almost can't wrap my head around this idea that my wife and I should have to pay more, and/or be taxed more so people who didn't work as hard or made dumb decisions can have more cash to burn - instead of challenging themselves to improve and working to get a better job.

**TLDR:** My wife and I work hard, and don't want to pay for lazy, dumb people.

Sorry about the rant, many people in my social circle don't feel as I do, so I have few outlets to vent."

So my question to you is this, what kind of company would you recommend as a place to learn good development practices and skills, especially considering my Android focus?

My own thoughts go like this; Two options.. 1. Smaller consultancy firm that runs different projects or 2. Larger established company that has in-house Android dev. (There's also 3. Big consultancy firm but this doesn't really feel like a good place to intern).

I like the idea of being at a smaller place with different projects, but fear lack of mentorship time form senior devs and possibly not so established routines around android development. Which is why I'm leaning towards option 2.

Any input on what I should consider when deciding appreciated, thanks."

I've been on the job hunt for a little while, and it's finally coming to a close with a few internship opportunities and offers. 

Company 1 is really great, and i've been a fan of them for a very long time. I had a really great interview, and got an internship offer from them, which i quickly accepted. It's somewhere i could definitely see myself working for a long time. 

However, by the time I got the internship offered, I had already scheduled an interview with Company 2, which I perhaps like even more than Company 1. This interview is coming up this week, and if I am able to pull an offer (big IF), I would have to consider it greatly, and thus consider rescinding my acceptance with Company 1. Both are great spots, and I'm thrilled to work at either one. But is this a huge unethical move? I've never been in any position like this before.  Let me know what you all think. "
3dwaow,2,2015-07-19,Should I [M18] tell a girl [F16] how I feel about her even though I know she most likely doesn't reciprocate the same feelings back?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3dwaow/should_i_m18_tell_a_girl_f16_how_i_feel_about_her/,"DISCLAIMER: I understand some of you may have a problem with the age difference but that's NOT what this post is about. Just read it first.

I'll try to give you guys the short end of it: I met this girl who works the same internship as me and at first, I wasn't all that into her. After sometime though, I felt like we really connected, like we had a great rapport and everything. One day though, I gather the nerves to ask her out for lunch on the weekend through our *work email* because she wasn't in the same building at the time (lame that I did this, I know). Her reply wasn't a ""yes"" and wasn't a ""no"" either (She said she had to ask her parents first which I thought was BS but kinda makes sense now that I think of it) but I gathered that it was just a nice way of rejecting me. I reply back with ""It's okay if you don't want to, you won't hurt my feelings lol"" (Fucking cringe worthy, I know I know, learning process and whatnot though right?) to which she replied back with ""No one said i was trying to hurt your feelings aha. But I never go out anyways so I'll see"". I felt like a stupid nice guy that's for sure.

Next day, I wait for her response but end up having to pretty much remind her that she was still ""thinking about it"" and she pretty much came up with a fucking *list* of excuses to justify why she couldn't make it (Shopping, family plans, etc). I took that as the nail in the coffin and threw up my white flag. 

Now I'll admit, I'm still a little hung up on it when I know I shouldn't be (I'm going to college soon anyways). But I really thought this girl might have similiar feelings towards me but, either through my admittedly idiotic approach, her actual non-feelings towards me, or a mixture of both, she rejected me. Currently though, she has *definitely* been avoiding me such as not going to lunch with me during lunchbreak when she used to do so a lot and not sitting near me on the bus this one time we had a field trip. We used to email each other constantly at work but dont anymore. It really sucks because if anything, I really did like just talking to her.

And after all of *those* shenanigans, we actually had one more email conversation. I was playfully teasing her about something where she said I was ""too old to understand something"" and I said, ""yeah, I'm ""old"". I just don't understand kids these days lol"" to which she said ""Well duh, I didn't think I had to hint at it so much lol."" I though **damn, she actually got me there** and replied with ""I see how it is lol"" It was pretty fucking bad.

I *did* however, overhear her talking with a co-worker who exclaimed to her ""just talk to him!"" to which she replied, ""No he's too old"" so I admit that I have a sense of there being somewhat of a silver lining in that she *might actually like me*, it's just that I'm too old. Or maybe they were talking about someone else, IDK, my brain over analyzes stuff like this too much.

Anyways, I thought that I might try to ask her for lunch during our break and, Idk, straighten some things out like the fact that we could still just be friends??? Or that I'm kind of actually okay with her not having the same feelings towards me (Because strangely enough, I really am okay with that)? Or is this whole thing dead in the water and I should just abandon ship while I still can?

TL;DR: Felt like I had a connection with this cute girl. She didn't feel the same way. Now we can't even really be friends anymore as she avoids me. Should I just get everything off my chest and admit my feelings towards her or just abandon everything and forget about it? "

3dwo1p,1,2015-07-19,I'm really struggling right now with school and living in the United States. I wish I could get out of it =(,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3dwo1p/im_really_struggling_right_now_with_school_and/,"Ok, first I just want to make clear that Iam not one of those people who always runs to the internet to talk about their problems but I am posting here b/c I have no one I can talk to in real life that will understand me. I love my family and friends, but they are not the kind of people I can just sit down with and talk about something that is bothering me. Especially my parents are very much more like authority figures in my life.

Ok so starting Iam 18 years old and a girl from Iraq my family moved to the United States about 6 years ago. This may sound ungrateful or stupid b/c of the awful political situation in my country but I hate living here so so much. Living in the US makes me struggle with my religion a lot (Iam Muslim). There's always something that is not allowed in our religion being pushed here. Like everyone around me seems completely unrestrained and I have so much restrictions. I am happy for the restrictions I have in my life because they keep me from hurting myself, but at the same time I am wanting to do things I know are bad because I see or hear about people doing these things and enjoying them. I'm not hating against American people I understand they are from a different culture where people are not as strict and all of that, but it is hard for someone who is not allowed to do a lot of things constantly being surrounded by those things. Especially when you see people, including other Arabs, doing freely what you know you can't or shouldn't do but wish you COULD do. It makes me feel so jealous and angry, and then angry at myself for wanting something that is bad for me. Living here makes you forget that this life is not that important, which is something taught by Islam. I don't want to forget this and constantly feel bad like I do here. I wish I can go to Jordan and live with my aunt and uncle there, but I also don't want to leave my parents and family who I love and want to be with here. It's just living here constantly gives me bad thoughts and urges, and makes me feel like I'm failing at my religion because I want too much from this life and am envious of Westerners who are doing things (ex dating) that violate the rules in my religion. Living in the Islamic country I know I wouldn't feel this way b/c I never felt this way growing up. 

Part of my problem is that I am not married but I want to be. I don't want to spend too much time talking about this and I actually asked a question about this problem before. Basically my father won't let me get married until I've completed my education. I have no brothers or anything and my family struggles a lot because my parents don't have a degree or speak good English so they can't get a really good job here. So there is a lot of pressure on me to get a good job so that my family won't constantly be financially struggling. I understand that I have a duty to my parents, especially my father because he has done so so much for this family thank god. But he will not let me get married because he thinks it will distract me from my education. I have try to talk to him so much recently about saying yes to looking for someone for me to marry after I finish getting my AS degree, but he gets really mad at me and I feel bad for doing this b/c Ik he has my and my family's best interests in mind. But if I don't get married until I finish my degree, it could be over 10 years til I finally finish it + internships. I could be in my 30s and I don't want to get married and have kids this old that is a very depressing idea. And other old  Arabic people will also make fun if a girl is old and is not married, my father is basically setting me up to get laughed at. On top of that, in Islam as most people know, you are not allowed to do anything outside of marriage even date its a huge sin. I've never have a boyfriend or anything, and I feel sad and lonely in this point of my life. I cannot imagine another 10 years or something with absolutely no one, especially when I am in college and I see all of these American girls with their boyfriends enjoying being in love. It's especially bad b/c I really liked someone and never told them and now I will never see them again b/c they graduated from my school. I am sick of feeling strongly for a person only to have to disappear from my life b/c I can't talk to them. :'( 

 I am feeling so so so depressed right now I have no idea what to do. There's no talking to my father about the marriage thing, I have tried at least three times it's hopeless. I hate living in America and I wish I can live in a country where I things I cannot have are constantly thrown in my face and I have no chance of having them. Are there other Muslim people in this situation who have advice? "
3dxkp2,11,2015-07-20,What's Next?,Animus_X,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3dxkp2/whats_next/,"In the last year and a half, I've had three things to take me away from the problems of life: weed, cigarettes, and a smoking hot girlfriend.  (I've been smoking for longer, but this is sorta about her)

Two months ago, I started an internship in Cali (where I was sober, somehow). The last thing I remember her saying to me was ""I don't want to lose you,"" but after a week of interning, I'd barely heard from her. I found out that she had been smoking and drinking way more than usual, and possibly gotten sexually abused by a mutual friend (so we thought)

A week or two later, I've been binge-watching Luther and Dark Mirror and still haven't heard a whole lot from her, so the usual paranoia creeps back in... Not to mention the forced sobriety. I call her up at one point to try and help her get her shit together, to no avail.

A little over a month ago, I've managed to convince myself that she's been cheating on me with one of her friends from work. I confront her about it and everything seems fine, until I go completely nuts after work one day and get sent home to see my shrink and my girlfriend.

Still insecure, I try to ""fix my broken relationship"" which was honestly fine at the time despite both of us being in a rut, and what does she do? She actually cheats on me. After I managed to convince myself nothing was wrong, it was all in my head, etc.

It really didn't help that I started smoking again immediately after coming home.

Desperate at this point to save what's left of this relationship, believing that she's just lonely, I MISS MY FUCKING SHRINK APPOINTMENT CUZ I'M IN BED WITH HER (no sex involved)

Now it's been nearly a month since the ""incident"" and things were looking up until this guy (who she said she told to back off) shows up and whisks her away again. We mutually broke up a few days ago, but it's still killing me inside. I don't want to fall headfirst into the pit we dug for ourselves, so today I gave all my paraphenalia to a friend, knowing that weed wouldn't solve this problem. Weed turned me into the person that she couldn't be around.

Even though I was sober for a month, I don't know where to start. How do I get better?..."
3dxo9q,0,2015-07-20,A few ideas for Dirty Bomb.,stgrzzlithethird,Dirtybomb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dirtybomb/comments/3dxo9q/a_few_ideas_for_dirty_bomb/,"Hello, I would like to start by saying that I love the current state of Dirty Bomb and I look forward to see future changes in the game as it's life cycle continues. I have played for roughly 60+ hours and have the general game nailed down (Atleast I think I do)

In the current state of Dirty Bomb there are 2 main gamemodes, these being Objective and Stop-watch. 
For me personally Objective is my bread and butter of Dirty Bomb, I only really play Stop-watch for the credit missions. I believe that Objective is in a very good state aswell as it's counterpart; Stop-watch. 
I have not played enough of the prototype gamemode - Execution to warrant a decision or opinion on it as a gamemode.
I would like to pitch a few ideas for gamemodes, these primarily stem from other first person shooters and I believe will add another layer of enjoyment onto Dirty Bomb

1. Infected.
A very ironic gamemode for Dirty Bomb but nethertheless a fine addition it will be. Seeing as how focused the game is on gunplay and medium to long range combat I feel that the moments of pure fear come from the moments when you're up close and personal with a bady when all of a sudden you run out of ammo and are forced to try to bash his head in with a cricket bat. This is what an Infected gamemode will focus on.
If you don't know the gamemode it became popular in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 where a large team of survivors were pitched against one randomly chosen infected. This infected would only be able to melee the survivors but when done will infect said survivor making them an infected. This is the general idea of the gamemode, or how MW3 did it. I'm sure there will be a great Dirty Bomb twist added - possible sub objectives. 

2. Is not so much a gamemode more of a addition needed desperatly in Dirty Bomb - Aiming maps.
Despite the lackluster tutorial section showing you only the basics of two of the many mercs one area did stand out to me and that was the aiming course. A simple yet useful map that will help players improve at strafe shooting and tracking aswell as the basic headshot. 
I use the M4A1 or the weapon you use in the tutorial in pub games. And I can tell you that every now and then playing that training area does drastically help improve your aim with specific guns.
I think this will be a welcome addition to Dirty Bomb

3. Bushwacker.
If theres one thing that I dislike about Bushwacker it's how his turret is pretty lame at being a turret. 
I had the idea to make the turret repairable. But at a much slower rate then say an EV - Bushwacker would also have to stand directly behind the turret in order to repair it meaning that it's a risk/reward sort of thing. On one hand you get your turret back up and on the other you put yourself in the view of the enemies.
Another thing that will balance this out is making it repairable only to Bushwacker meaning that he's in charge of his sentry and only him. This will decrease the amount of Bushwackers doing the place and leave strat where you place a turret in a defensive position then go round running and gunning all day long. 
Aside from being an objective speacialist he will also intern become a defense speacialist. 

These are just a few of some ideas I came up with during my 60 hour playtime. I will probably make a much longer document going into detail about my ideas to merc and map changes in order to rebalance the game. 
Aswell as gadget ideas and future merc ideas.
Please note that these are my own views and ideas from my personal play time. 
I don't think that not having an Infected mode will hinder the game's longevity however I do believe it will add something else for newer players to do and reinvigoratesome love from old players.

3dxvy1,1,2015-07-20,Investing in a pre-workout - retaining energy during workouts during a cut,hellow_friends,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3dxvy1/investing_in_a_preworkout_retaining_energy_during/,"M/17/5ft8 Hi all, I'm relatively new to lifting (6 months). Currently I'm just slightly chubby for my own liking. I think losing 5 lbs would be ideal and reduce some of the annoying fat in my chest/stomach/upper arms. So I want to start a cut to do so.

Since I started lifting I haven't gone on a strict cut. I gained almost 20 lbs (mostly fat) in the first 2 months of lifting, and since then I've fluctuated around the same weight for the next 4 months. Recently I started an internship and have been eating out for lunch pretty often. As a result, I have ridiculous amounts of energy in the gym and my lifts have gone up. However I have also put on a few pounds and I look more bloated/fat. 

My main concern is losing energy during workouts. According to strengthstandards most of my lifts are slightly past intermediate. If I am cutting 5 lbs I believe I can maintain my lifts but since I'm not eating as much I assume my energy during workouts will be pretty lackluster. So I am considering a pre-workout but I have never used one. Which one should I buy? Should I go for C4 or a different brand"

Background - I am a 2015 Economics Graduate from the Manchester Metropolitan Business School (First class honours &amp; top performing student in one unit). UCAS points 260 (Maths B Economics C Biology C). Previous experience only in retail/tuition.

I want to pursue a CFA career but getting the relevant experience part, I am struggling with. The main issue here is that my UCAS points are 260 when most graduate employers are looking for 300 as a minimum (yeah I know 260 is not ideal - I was in a bad place as a teenager and really have turned my life around - if I could go back in time things would have been very different). Also my lack of previous experience in fund management.

It is for this reason that I am enquiring, the CFA qualification is a large investment. My current plan if I can't find a job is to sit my level 1 exam and conditional on passing, use that to help get a relevant job next year. OR pass all three exams and then find relevant experience. I am a very mathematical and analytical person and can easily grasp most concepts so I'm pretty confident I will pass the exams with enough effort.

So, CFA redditors, do I stand a chance or do you recommend a change in career paths?

The Institute for International Research (IIR USA) has announced dual initiatives to pave the way for more women in the U.S. to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) at top companies. 

The 2nd Annual Women in STEM (WIS) Summit will bring together women students from leading colleges pursuing STEM coursework, professionals in STEM fields and representatives from top companies looking to increase their STEM firepower for a day of networking, learning and collaboration around talent acquisition and career development for Women in STEM.

For women students attending the event from multiple colleges and universities, the WIS Summit will offer direct exposure to industry professionals and representatives from companies to learn about and potentially secure internships, mentoring and, ultimately, careers that pay as much as 33% more than those in non-STEM fields.

3dy8t2,6,2015-07-20,Me [24F] My ex [28M] broke no contact to ask for my forgiveness,forgiveandforgetthis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dy8t2/me_24f_my_ex_28m_broke_no_contact_to_ask_for_my/,"He's on reddit and I don't want him to find this, so using a throwaway. This is going to be long, perhaps I just need to vent about it and hear some opinions. The bold part at the end is the most important for right now, the rest is just to get all the facts out.

Let's call my ex [28M] Liam and the other girl [21F] Sarah. Liam and I were in an official relationship for 7 and a half months last year and have been broken up for the same amount of time.

Starting from the beginning. I met Liam when we both started an internship at the same company. We became fast friends and eventually fell in love, like I really fell for this guy, I had never felt like that in any of my previous relationships. At the time I was in a 4+ years relationship and I broke it up, it didn't have all to do with Liam, I had thought about breaking up with that ex before I even met Liam, I just felt comfortable in it and let things go for far too long. 

Before Liam and I met, and before we got together even unofficially, he had a very casual relationship with this girl, Sarah. They were good friends and would hook up when she went out with our (now) group of friends. I know they would often sext each other, but that didn't bother me because it was before we got together. I did warn him to be wary of her, because she could be in love with him and expecting more from him than just that and to try and not hurt her feelings. He ended things with her and said he was in love with me and was going to pursue a serious relationship with me (a year after that she actually confessed to me that that had broken her heart and that she was in fact in love with him and still was a year after).

Liam and I had a casual relationship for nearly two months before making it official. I had never been happier in my life, I was madly in love and he looked in love with me too. I sometimes cry just to think about it because I'm afraid of never being so in love with someone else like that again and feeling that happiness again.

In the fist 4 months everything was perfect, except the company we were interning for got into financial troubles and all the employees had to be let go (we were 5 total, it was a small company). That was a few days after we officially got together, but we were still perfect together back then and things were evolving very nicely, we were supporting each other through being unemployed again and relationship wise we were very good.

In April (2014) a few weeks after being let go was his birthday, since this all happened a year ago, he had turned 27. I don't know if it was him seeing himself a year older and again unemployed, but I do know that from that day on things started to sour. He was still very affectionate and romantic, but something was off. He was withdrawn or at least more than usual and I started to worry a bit. I noticed that his online interactions with Sarah were starting to increase. I did know they had not stopped talking, but that it was just platonic, but something told me to be guarded regarding them two.

In May I decided that maybe we should go on a road trip, just to take our minds off of our other problems and just enjoy being with each other and seeing new places. The trip was fun and we had a blast. One night, on the trip, we went out drinking and I told him once again to be wary of Sarah potentially being infatuated with him and to try to cut down on they conversations and that she actually was starting to make me very insecure. He said he was going to do that and or me not to worry about her.

A little while after we came back from the road trip he went back to being withdrawn and became very distant. We used to have sex nearly every day and most times two or three times in the same day. Now he barely initiated it and sometimes when I tried to initiate it, he would ignore me. I became very worried and insecure, I was sure something was going on. I tried to convince myself that it was just temporary and that he was probably a bit depressed.

One night, we went out with our friends like we usually did every weekend and she came as well. That night he barely acknowledged me and spent half the night talking to her instead. Whenever I tried to talk to him, or kiss him, or dance with him he would get pissy at me. Sarah got very drunk that night and made out with one of Liam's best friends and Liam just kept looking at them with this look of jealousy that made me extremely uncomfortable and I told him I wanted to go home. He got mad at me for that but eventually we went home.

With the seed of doubt firmly planted in my head I started noticing even more things. He was constantly talking to her on facebook  and I even noticed one night that he had received/sent an mms from/to her. My gut instinct was hitting hard and even thought I didn't have proof I knew there was something going on between them, so one day while we were at the beach I asked him to play a game on his phone because I was bored. He took a fairly long time to give it to me and when he did it was with the game already open and saying that he had just played some levels. I played a little in front of him but then moved places with the excuse that I needed a shade and gained some courage and went through his text messages with her. Right from the first one I read I got my doubts confirmed, he had even turned off the notifications so that I didn't accidentally see anything, so he knew what he was doing was wrong. They were sexting again I felt so lost and devastated at that moment that I even called my best friend, who was with us, by Sarah's name. I threw the phone at Liam, got my things and went home. He kept calling and texting me saying he wanted to talk and to meet him.

After taking a shower I agreed to meet him and we spent 4 hours talking about it. He said he was sorry and begged me on his knees not to break up with him, that he loved me, that she was nothing, that it was just ego boosts because he was feeling depressed. I agreed to give him another chance but that he had to cut contact with her and do anything I needed to build back the trust I had in him. I even confronted her on facebook about it, it was her brithday even, and she told me that she was sorry that things had gotten out of control and that he loved me and respected me a lot and not to break up with him. By his calculations that had gone on for two weeks and he said he wouldn't ever tell me about it because he knew it would end eventually, probably when he found a new job, and that it meant nothing. That happened in July 2014, he only found a new job in February of this year....

I couldn't stop crying for days after that, I was devastated, my self-esteem was non existent and I couldn't take what I read out of my head. He was very affectionate the first few days after that, but it quickly went back to how it was before and broke his promise almost instantly. Two weeks after all that I sent him a couple of sexy snapchats and he was responding to them when I noticed that all of a sudden Sarah was his top friend on snapchat. I got so mad that not only did he break his promise to me of cutting contact with her, he even did it using a very shady app that deletes everything. I confronted him about it and he said that she had bought a new phone and he was showing her new apps and how to use them and when I reminded him about the broken promise he told me that I couldn't realistically expect them to stop talking because they were friends and that he would still talk to her. Needless to say I was furious and even confronted her about it and she also said that she would not stop talking to Liam.

Foolishly I let the situation drag on, Liam and I were constantly fighting because I just couldn't trust him. The relationship and we became extremely  toxic to each other until I decided to break things up in November. I felt so relieved because now I had no reason to fight I had no reason to worry, but I still did of course. I still wanted to fix things and be with him, so I told him that he needed to resolve whatever was wrong with him and the things between him and Sarah and that he had to rebuild the trust. For three months a lot of times Liam still acted like he wanted to fix things, I told him to always be honest with me and asked him if he was with Sarah and he still told me there was nothing between them. On valentine's day we went together to a thing and after when we met his friends she was there and so was my ex before Liam. Sarah and my ex are friends and my ex was still very bitter or breaking up with him and getting together with Liam, so he always found ways to poison my relationship with Liam and he told me that Sarah had told him that Liam was constantly asking her to go to his house and to meet him. I asked Sarah if this was true and she broke down in tears and said that it was, that they had met several times and that they practically spent the entire month of December and the first few weeks of January together and that she was in love with him. I felt completely betrayed, because I asked him several times if there was something going on and he always told me that no and made me believe that we were going to work things out when that wasn't his intention.

That night Liam and my ex almost came to blows and one of Liam's friends had to take me home because I was so shocked by that entire thing. I was furious and I even deactivated my facebook account because I didn't want people to come ask me what had happened.

**Liam messaged me saying he didn't want to stop being my friend and that before that night he actually really wanted to fix things with me and get back together and that being with Sarah had been a way to release the sexual tension between the two of them so it wasn't an issue anymore and that they had already went back to being just platonic friends again (both swear that they never hooked up while Liam and I were still together, though). I still tried to believe him and we went on for a month trying again for some normalcy. But suddenly, one day, he just stopped talking to me, no reason, no nothing he just stopped. So I did too and 4 months went by, I got over him, fell for someone else (it didn't work out unfortunately), but I was at peace with everything that had happened and didn't plan on talking to him ever again. For me the past was buried and I was and am focused on my future and on not repeating what happened with Liam. I wasn't in love with him anymore, I didn't miss him and I was completely indifferent to him finally. Until the weekend a week ago.**

**He broke no contact to apologize for having stopped talking to me all of a sudden. That something I said pissed him off for no reason and that he didn't talk to me that day and the next and the day after and when he noticed too much time had already passed and he had lost the courage to talk to me.**

**I told him that I didn't want to be bothered by our past again and that whatever it was he had my forgiveness but that I didn't want him back into my life. e said he understood that I felt that way and I thought that was the end of it. But this saturday night he contacted me again, asking if he at least could just say hello when we saw each other at random. He asked this because that night we went to the same bar and it looked like I was avoiding even looking at him, which I confirmed. I told me once again he was sorry for everything and asked for my forgiveness and I once again told him that for whatever he felt guilty about and for whatever I thought he was at fault, I forgave him because I don't want the past to affect my future and I just want to move on and that I didn't want him back into my life. Yesterday he contacted me again and he seems desperate to tell me how sorry he is for everything and that now that some time has passed he can see what a jerk he was and that I matter too much too him and that he was too stupid to deal with it at the time. He says he still has a lot of things to tell me and it's nothing that can be said in just a few hours or even in a day, I told hi that I didn't want him to randomly contact me whenever he wanted to say something and that I didn't even want him to talk to me at all.**

**I told him to write down all the things he wants to say to me and to throw that in the wind or something, but he is begging me to let him talk to me, that he is afraid to talk to me but that he needs to and is begging me to help him.**

**I was at peace before this, I was moving on with my life and I thought he had moved on too. He doesn't have to right to come and talk to me after all this time and asking me to help him feel better and let him make me feel like shit again. I worked very hard to rebuild my self esteem after him and to learn to not let everything affect me or my future relationships. I do not want him back into my life and I feel like I'm being slightly manipulated. I don't want to sacrifice my peace of mind so he can have his, he doesn't have that right. He lost any right when he made the choice to cheat on me and to walk out of my life and I am making the choice of not letting him back in, but he is not allowing me to.**

**I do not want to block him and part of me wants him to just say what he has to say so we can put this at rest and move the fuck on like we already were, but the other part doesn't want anything to do with him and just wants to block him out completely.**
   
**tl;dr**: Had very rocky and toxic relationship with ex-bf, loved him like I've never loved before but he cheated on me, lied constantly and disrespected me and completely destroyed me during the time we were together. He was the one who stopped talking to me, but broke no contact asking for forgiveness. I feel like the time has passed for that and don't want him back into my life and didn't even want to break no contact ever. "

I am attempting to reduce the number of single points of failure we have by creating as many redundant links as possible.

Basically I'd like to have both switches (HP ProCurve 2800 series) plugged into the router (Cisco 1811), so that should either fail the network is still available. Unfortunately we do not have a second router available to use. 

I know that I can not assign the same subnet to both interfaces going to the switches, so is there some sort of failover I can implement? Or is it impossible with the equipment I have?

I have considered *ip unnumbered* but this seems to be more for serial connections.

3dyuhe,1,2015-07-20,My Story and My Journey (Warning: Very very long/detailed story),Andaho,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/3dyuhe/my_story_and_my_journey_warning_very_very/,"Okay, hey everyone. I've been meaning to write this down somewhere for a while, and many of you probably have pieced together my story and who I am as a person. Well, I've had a string of good days, followed by some very heavy days lately, and I'd like to just put it down somewhere I can remember and maybe get some comments/feedback/responses from people who understand my own position. I've been struggling with contacting her, or rather, my desire to contact her, and it's only getting worse as the summer progresses. More about that near the end of my story. 

I'd like to just talk a little aimlessly about my relationship and how it ended, because I feel as if it plays a very large part in my desire for reconciliation and my own personal growth. My name is /u/Andaho, we'll call myself A, nice to meet you all. I recently turned 20, just last week, and my ex is M, age almost 18, in a few days. We met on Tumblr, through a roleplay function, in the winter of 2012. My memory is faulty here, but to my knowledge, she was getting over a rejection from a boy (We'll go with P. This will be slightly pertinent later.) and I was trying to find myself from a similar rejection. We live on opposites sides of the US, I'm the East Coast boy, she's the West Coast girl. 

We hit it off very well, almost torrential in our infatuation and, dare I say it, mutual thirst in stroking each other's egos. Both of us saw each other for what we were doing - manipulation and flattering to make ourselves feel better - and we both admitted to previous histories of similar behaviors. However, I think we both started to see the error in that terrible way of a friendship, and we both wanted more. We shared a lot of common interests, and this was the part where we did the whole 'omg you're so perfect &lt;3' thing, as we were both still young then, I a high school senior, and she a sophomore. Now, lemme throw this in here, that I am not someone who goes around preying on younger girls, that was not my intent! Just that the age gap seemed irrelevant when it came to our mutual attraction.

It came to a head in January, when I asked her if she wanted to try being Long Distance, an actual relationship, not just flirting and ego-stroking. She agreed! And we drew some lines in the sand, things like always communicating, never lying to each other - because we had that knowledge that we were both very capable of hiding ourselves behind masks and walls and misdirection. And so we went, enjoying life, having fun, and it was a very lovely time together. Plans started being slowly formed, hoping that she would be able to come to the East Coast for university, going to conventions and movies and things. Long distance was difficult, to say the least, but we tried our best to make it work, and I think it went well for the better part of two years.

We never had any major quarrels, and our communication was fairly excellent, in my opinion. She helped me explore my emotional side, as I had been raised by a very stone-faced and (emotionally) distant set of parents, while I helped her cope with her anxiety and bipolar disorder as best I could. She struggled in her junior year, having few friends, and generally being in a very depressive state of mind - and I was always there for her when she needed me. My freshman year was almost completely (and in retrospect, unhealthily) dedicated to her well-being; I didn't know who I was prior to this relationship, so I sunk my happiness and my sense of self into the idea of us. I wasn't aware of this, at the time, I was very much blinded by love and my feeling of happiness. I loved her with all of my body and spirit, and I thought of our future a lot in this time. I was so excited, and she was too. (Also, a bit of a TMI, but our virtual sex life was okay. I don't know why I mentioned this. Maybe it is pertinent.)

I got to see her last summer. I saved up my money all year to go see her in Cali for a weekend and it was so wonderful, oh my goodness. It was everything I expected and more. Well, it was nice, but there were a few things that arose that I think may have sowed the seeds of our downfall possibly, things that hinted that it wasn't as paradisaical as I had hoped. Nevertheless, I think that time was one of the highlights of our relationship, and being able to hold her and be with her was amazing. She always craved physical intimacy, just cuddles and kisses and hugs, and not being able to give that to her was one of my biggest regrets. And I always wish that I could have given it to her more. It was a struggle, but we tried so hard to be together through that little boxy screen.

This year, I think we started to crumble just a little after our second anniversary. She had made a new circle of friends her senior year, I was very happy for her and I made some mutual friends with them, a very good group of people. One of these people was P. **storm clouds roll in.** She started going a little bit distant at this point, and as the college decision rolled in (she had been accepted to my university) she was on the fence about coming to the East Coast. Money was a problem, and it would be more expensive to go to my school out of state, rather than her UC system. I knew this, and I told her to make her college decision without me in mind. I only wanted the best for her, but I knew that if she didn't want to come to the East Coast, I would feel... disappointed? Let down? Something like that. I had hyped it up in my mind to the point that if it didn't happen, I crushed myself on that. Uhhh, my father asked me what I would do if she didn't come over, and I was confused and I tentatively said that we wouldn't work out if that happened. I regret making that logical leap, because that was the moment I started having doubts about us. And I think it showed in my thoughts and words. She started distancing herself from me, only really talking in the evenings for a short while before going to bed, and I was too busy fixating on the time she would come here, trying to block out the idea that she wouldn't be here with me in the summer. Here, in hindsight, is where I stopped caring for her, and started caring too much about the idea of us in the future. 

Here is where I have my biggest regrets and my biggest anger too - she stopped communicating with me at the same time that I started leaping far ahead of myself. M had always had a terrible fear of commitment, something that I never quite understood what it meant. This was my first big relationship, and I think I would hazard that it was hers as well, (she had dated a string of others before, and not to downplay them, but I think none were quite as serious as ours.) and I think she had that fear that we would breakup when she got here and leave her alone without friends or family, despite my promises that I would never do that to her.

May rolled in. She spent more and more time with her friends. And late April/early May, she came to the slow decision that she would be staying in California for university. I was devastated, to say the least, and I made some hasty and terrible decisions, words that I will always regret saying, in my emotional shock. I said that I couldn't do another 2/4/6/8 years of long distance, that I had already planned so much for her, that I understood her reasoning but I was still at a loss. I asked that we spend a few weeks together and then take the summer apart to see what we could do. She agreed. (I didn't know that asking for a break was akin to breaking up. I just wanted to figure out my head and figure out my heart. To find the strength to push on or not.) We spent a last few weeks together and parted amicably. I think she didn't want to hurt me and... I don't know. I can't really remember those few weeks anymore. I just wanted to take some time and see if we were okay, if we could bounce back. I didn't expect that it would spiral out of my hands so quickly...

She went to prom with P. I was okay with it when they made that plan while we were dating, because I trusted her and I knew that they were just friends. (Here's the bitterness! Hold on to your horses.) They started dating very shortly after we broke up. Like, within a week or so, I think. I'm not one to throw around mindless accusations, and I trusted that she was very physically loyal, but I cannot help but hold these thoughts of emotional cheating in my head. I would never accuse her openly of it, but it just grips my mind and throttles my happiness out - that she found another to confide in, to be with, who was able to give her the physical love that I could not, that I desperately wished I could give, so quickly after I faded from her life. I held to no contact for a few weeks, before accidentally seeing a snap from her that had them laying on top of each other at a friend's house. I was in denial til then, that they were just friends, just close friends who were just helping her through it and - I broke, ran to her, pleading and begging for answers, for something, anything that would soothe that bitter burning pain in my heart. She was very polite, very caring, trying not to hurt me I think, but I felt her pulling away with every word, every broken question. She basically told me that we broke up, and that she didn't think we would be getting back together at the end of the summer, like I had sort of planned, hoped for, whatever. I was doing okay before I found out that she was seeing someone else and it killed me. I try not to dwell on it, because that is actually one of the only things that makes me actually angry and seethe with righteous bitterness. 

So here I am. I saw pictures of them on Facebook, through a mutual friend, before I unfollowed him out of fear of it happening again. They were at a convention in California, and she was clinging to him, smiling so broadly and looking so happy. I'm torn - I really am. I want her to be happy and I want her to be successful, but I also think that she is running away from her emotions, it is something that she has done very well. I know she can be mature and handle her fears, but she has to want to do that, she has to want to change and I think she is in a spot where she wants to just enjoy that riotous brilliance that is summer life before university. But enough about her. I try to keep her out of my mind, but she flickers in every so often because I poured way too much of what I thought of myself into the relationship, and now it echoes in my mind throughout the day, bittersweet reminders of the precious thing I lost.

Let's talk about the No Contact me. I've been doing wonderfully, in terms of my own progress. I got a job, I'm doing an internship teaching English Literature, (I want to be a teacher in the future) and I finally got off my ass to get my Driver's License. I'm working out, playing games with my friends, having a good time. I'm going to a convention this weekend, doing a cosplay that I have been meaning to do for ages. I feel okay, most of the time. But it all swung south on my birthday. I had hoped that she would wish me a happy birthday - indeed, I waited all day for it and it never came. I don't know why I hoped she would send it, maybe that she just would remember me and send me a polite message - but it never came and I made myself sad for it. I know she didn't forget it, because we had fixation on dates and times because that was what kept us going on our toughest days. Her birthday is coming up this week and I am torn between wanting to keep NC and wanting to be polite and friendly. I know that it's probably a bad idea to text her or something, but we said that we'd talk on her birthday, way back when we said we'd take a break. I don't know if I am ready for it, but I also know that I really want to talk to her about how I feel now. We also said we would talk in August before school started, but I am also not sure about it. I think I will take more time, and I'd like your feedback, /r/exnocontact, because I know you all hopefully have read this brick of a novel and can give me your thoughts and help me find peace.

I have got a good headspace now. I know that I made mistakes, that I messed up some things, and I'd like to change that and make amends. I still care for her so much, I love her even though we are not together, and I want to try again. I know that people think snide comments about long distance, and I know that it would still be hard, but I know now, having tasted life outside of just being boring and slow and playing video games, that there is so much to live for, so much to fight for and try for because we only have so little time here. I want to be the best person that I can be, and I want to be happy; I want to share that with the person that gave me so much, taught me emotional depth, gave me a drive to improve, helped me find my dreams and passions again. I miss her. I think now that I have taken time to myself, I know that I can do so much better than before. But it all hinges on her now, if she wants to let me back in, despite her fears and love and disorders and everything. I know she is still so young, finding what she wants in life, her first year at college coming up, so much to live for and discover, and I want to be there for her, but I also don't want to anchor her down with my more 'mature' and developed time and path. If she doesn't want me back, I know that I'll have to go through grief again, because even now I know that I have a small seed of denial stopping my own growth, that hope beyond hope that this is just a roadblock on our wonderful path of life. I made my mistakes, and I know life doesn't often give second chances - you get one swing and that's it! - but I don't know if I'm holding on to a remnant of nothing, the past M that loved me, or if I can do it for myself and... I don't know. I need help. I've talked to my close friends, my mentor, and they all wish the best for me. Most recommend keeping NC, keeping my distance, but it gets so hard, especially late at night.

I miss her - I know people often say that loneliness stems from missing having someone, missing that feeling of being loved and wanted, and that does play a fair part in it. But I also miss her because she helped me become the person that I am today. Without her, without the breakup, I wouldn't have reached this spot of confused clarity. I know most of you will also press me to continue NC, stop hoping for reconciliation and just move on, but I feel like I really want to try again. Thank you for reading this brick of text, it has been... cathartic, in a way. If any of you have questions about me, my progress, my ex, our previous relationship, anything that you want to know, please don't hesitate to ask. I want to pour my heart out here so that both me and others can see it for what it is - and I can help myself move forward always. Do you think I should breach NC now? August? In a year? Never? What would you all do in my shoes? :("

I really love the ""MILFS"" and ""Cougars"" of the world. There is something so hot about a women older and more experienced than I am using me for my sex drive and stamina. 

Here are some ideas I have been thinking about recently
*Mother/Aunt Seducing son/nephew and having their way with him

* Friend of my parents or a friends mother can't keep their hands of me even though they know it is wrong

* Teacher offers me a better grade if I do what they ask

* Boss tells me that the only way my internship becomes a full-time job offer is if I do everything they ask, even if it is naughty

* Being invited into the bedroom by a couple to either have a threesome, or cuckhold the husband.

* Having sex with a pregnant woman

* Meeting an older woman who agrees to be my sex teacher and help me gain the experience I need to be a great lover

Limits: Scat, Blood and Gore, Hardcore violence

Kinks: pretty much anything else. Try me! worst I can say is no!

My roommate moved out, and I'm looking for another person to share my 400 sq ft studio. This place would be perfect for someone new to the area, possibly with an internship, or contract in the Bay Area. I've lived here with three people before, but it was very tight. Looking for someone to move in next week, before August. I'm going to be gone for a couple of weeks, so you'd have some time to yourself.

The studio is super close to bart, and transbay lines to the city, and is at the intersection of some nice bike infrastructure to DT Oakland, Berkeley, and Emeryville. 

I'm 23 and male. While I work in tech as an engineer, I read Model View Culture, and help coach people into careers in tech. If you're new to the area, I can help you find a more permanent place by showing you around, telling you about different neighborhoods, and setting you up with a system for finding a place.

3dzaac,17,2015-07-20,Email Transcript - Client tried to get me to do work they never paid for.,WootangWood,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3dzaac/email_transcript_client_tried_to_get_me_to_do/,"Just had an interaction with a client, where they tried to get me to do more work than was in the contract or agreed upon initially. This company has a reputation for being stingy with $$ and utilizing interns and unpaid work. 

It all started when I received a vague email between her, her accountant and I requesting my W9 stating I would do an edit. 

-------------------------------------

**me**

I see you're interested in having me do an edit on the promo video regarding [Omitted]! I'd love to chat more about this. 

To give you a ball park about how much this would cost, 

$1,500 - Edit with three rounds of review. 

$250 - Music Licensing 

$300 - Music research 

$450 - Color correcting the piece 

$1000 - Motion graphics (titles, animation) 

$200 - Audio mastering 


The only real cost that is set in stone is the $1500 edit price. Everything else is negotiable depending on what you want the end product to look and feel like.

Happy to speak further with you about this,



**Client**

""We understood that once everything was edited, you were going to put together a brief music based prom for the $600?  I hope that is still the case?  Please let us know.  We can work with Jeff [Unpaid Intern] to prep things as best as possible but we have to stay in our tiny budget.  We are applying for grants now and hope to secure funds for next year.""

**Me**

I apologize for any miscommunication, wherever it may happened. 

In no way was it ever communicated on my part that I would complete an edit for you for the price of $600.  

Attached is the invoice, you signed, that explicitly states 

*Proposed is the budget for producing and shooting  with no edit
at the [Omited] conference on may 11th and 12th.*

I understand that you have a small budget to complete this project, and I can recommend some filmmakers who are just getting started and might be more within your price range. 

If you're interested in moving forward with me, I'd love to speak further about your vision on this video and how to achieve it.""

**Client** 

I remember our talking about the $1,000 a day [My day rate] and I understood you could put together a small promo piece from our edited footage.  I’m sorry that I misunderstood.  Is that something that you would be able to do over two-three hours for the $600 we paid? [600 was for pre-production work]   Perhaps that could be putting to music what we give you?     I trust we can work this out.  Yes, let’s talk on the phone.


**me**

Once again, I apologize for any confusion. In our discussions I stated that I'd be open to handling an edit, which I still am. However I must state that the service you paid for has been completed and delivered and anything additional will be an additional cost. 

the $600 Concept development line item that you paid for was the time I spent preparing myself and the other shooters for the conference. And in no way was intended to be for an edit. As was stated in the contract that you signed, explicitly stating - No Edit. 

I would be happy to send this job along to other filmmakers who might be more within your budget. Or if you'd like me to handle this job, I can complete it at the rates listed below. 

If you'd like to discuss further, I'd be happy to join you on a phone call. 

**Client**

No worries.  I'm sorry I misunderstood. I'll work with jeff [Unpaid Intern] on it. Thanks.

----------------------------------------------

Interested to hear this communties feedback, were there things I could of done better, recommendations on how to handle this better.

I've been on the apartment hunt for weeks now and I am set on living in the Wicker Park area (Bucktown, Noble Square, Ukranian Village). It seems like I could find a better deal if I got a roommate rather than trying to find a 1 BR/Studio. Some things I would like are in unit W/D, hardwood floors, close to CTA, may be dog friendly, prefer to have my own bathroom. (I'm obsessed with exposed brick, so if by the off chance, I can find one of those with a good price that would be the dream!) I don't own a car so parking is not a concern of mine.

A little about myself: I am a recent graduate from Oklahoma and moved to Chicago for an internship. I am a creative graphic designer so ideally I would love to live with someone who shares the same creative drive. I am clean, a non-smoker, 420 friendly and occasionally likes to have a few beers/mixed drinks. I am total night owl as well. I would describe myself as an outgoing introvert. I like to go out and socialize, but I occasionally like to spend time alone to reenergize. I like to draw, animate, and learn creative programs/techniques. My interests also include Netflix binge watching, playing tennis, music, food, shopping and cooking.

I am looking for someone who is looking for the same. Must be open minded, LGBT friendly, etc. Female or Male doesn't matter to me. Prefer to be early 20's as well.

I'm looking to pay anywhere between $500-1200
Please PM me if you are interested with a summary about yourself. I would like to get something solidified ASAP. I check out craigslist constantly and have found some pretty places, but I need a roommate! "
3dzfjw,2,2015-07-20,Internship experience.,fearthenacho,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3dzfjw/internship_experience/,"Hey all,

I'm currently a rising junior majoring in accounting/finance. This summer, I've been interning at a small (20-30 employees) accounting firm that mainly deals with tax returns for small to medium sized businesses.

Most of the work I'm doing involves work with Quickbooks, where I enter checks, make deposits, make journal entries, reconcile things, etc. I've also helped my manager with a couple of his ""financial reports"" that he presents to his larger clients.

My question is, how relevant is the work I'm doing now copmared to the work being done in auditing/consulting at the larger accounting firms? Will my experience here help me at all, and does it look good on my resume when applying for internships at larger firms and eventually finding a full time job with them?

Thanks in advance for the help."
3dzg8j,17,2015-07-20,The legend of Randy,IChawt,talesfromthejob,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3dzg8j/the_legend_of_randy/," This summer I worked at the Boys and Girls Club, a job masquerading as an internship, for 6 weeks. For those of you who don't know what the Boys and Girls Club is, your property value might be too high.

 Randy is a member of this ""club,"" a 6 year old kid who took a liking to me, fuck me for trying to be empathetic because this is just the beginning of a new form of torture.

 Week 1. Randy comes to me and tells me some kids keep calling him ""Randy Cunningham,"" what am I supposed to do, being the namesake of a popular cartoon character isn't anybody's fault, I jsut politely told them to stop. They did for a little while, but when they started up again Randy started crying. I told him to go sit back on the bleachers, he sat on the floor(right next to an active game of Flag Football) and I told him he has to sit down. ""Why?"" ""Because you have to, it's the rules"" he goes and sits under the bleachers and starts crying. Everyday for the rest of the week he cries and runs to me because some kids make fun of him. One day during lunch, he asks if he can help. I say ""Go ask Ms.Cherry for some gloves"" he says ""No, can you go get the gloves, shes gonna say no."" ""Well if she sees you helping, Im going to get in trouble"" ""But your staff, the other staff let kids help them"" ""Theyre my bosses"" Randy starts crying.

 Week 2. It's reading time, we read everyday before lunch. Randy walks up to me and asks me if he can stand up, ""No, your only supposed to be up here if you're in trouble"" ""But I want to stand"" ""No"" Randy starts crying. One day the club let in kids early, I came to work, Randy is crying again. Unexplained. I ask the kid next to him what happened, he don't know nuffin'. Everyone starts calling Randy a crybaby, I asked him if he wanted to stand next to me, he doesnt say anything and stands.

Week 3. You're seeing a pattern by now, Randy cried, let's move on.

Week 4. Randy gets a new friend and a new attitude. Introducing, Kevin, he's 7, and is a bad influence. Randy starts picking on people and generally being a nuisance under the guiding hand of Kevin, everyone's complaining, Randy gets in a fight with local bad boy Brion, Brion pushes Randy and Randy does something rather predictable. A few more days of serving lunch and watching kids play sports, Randy complains about having to follow rules and cries because he can't help with lunch, the other staff members say dont baby him and one guy picks him up and takes him to the front desk.

Week 5. I didn't see Randy for like, three full days! Then, Thursday,  Randy starts cheating at Flag Football, tying his flag and what not. So we switch to Basketball, Randy cheated at that too, every time he caught the ball he dropped on the floor and started yelling ""ball,"" so I took him out of the game, surprise, he cried. The next day he did this again.

Week Final: AKA Randy works up the nerve. Randy comes up to me while I'm on bathroom duty(sit in a chair in the bathroom and tell kids not to play in there, occasionally cleaning it.) and Randy comes up to me with a bag of gummy things, fruit snacks I think, and gives them to me, Walks away. He comes back and asks me to help. ""With what"" ""I'll watch the bathroom if you fall asleep"" ""no Randy"" ""But you're staff""(meaningless title still) ""I can't let you help or else I'll get in trouble"" ""But you're staff"" ""My boss doesn't like when I let people help"" ""You have a boss?"" ""Yes, goodbye Randy."" Randy does his usual routine. ""Goodbye, Randy"" ""But if I leave I have to take the gummies back."" ""Here you go"" ""But if I take them back you'll call me mean"" ""No I wont, goodbye."" Randy falls on the floor. A few minutes later one of my coworkers comes by and asks me whats wrong, ""He wanted to help"" ""Help do what?"" ""Exactly"" so he takes Randy back to the Gym. Later, Randy is sharing out the gummies and walks up to me and asks me if I'm still mad at him, I never acted like I was mad so this question was an obvious sign of a failed guilt trip. Some sort of calamity happens and like four kids, including Randy are fighting, we break it up and they say their ""playing"" I ignore them until my final day is over, good thing I didn't tell Randy I was leaving though."

I'm new to shell scripting and am currently trying to build a web interface using ASP C# to connect to a Unix box. I am require to call a particular script which intern prompts back for a username, password and ID.

I'm using SSH.NET but I'm unable to handle this script (prompt back, etc.). I can run simple commands and capture the response using "".runcommand"" and "".Results"" but I believe I need to use Streams and Expect to handle this prompt, which I am getting trouble with. Researching has not helping me significantly.

Thanks guys.

EDIT: Adding an update, I've gotten really close to figuring it out. Using streams and most importantly, threads to delay the process. I guess this gives the box enough time to send the prompts to be read and handled properly. The final issue I'm having is the streamwriter.WriteLine() method is writing apparently two lines (one with the correct response, and the other with a blank space). This is causing me to enter a blank for the username (first prompt after calling the script) and the username for the password, etc.

Any thoughts? Will xpost to /csharp

EDIT: I got it, apparently WriteLine() or using Environment.NewLine issues \r\n which may read as 2 lines on some boxes, manually appending ""\n"" and using Write() for a command works fine. Hope this may help someone in the future. "

Have a couple questions.,Seinpheld,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/3dznke/pt_with_ckdiii_and_elevated_kpo4_also_with_copd/,"Hi! I was lucky enough to get a job right out of my internship and have been practicing for about one month (taking my exam in two weeks, yikes!) I work as a clinical dietitian, and I have a question on a patient I saw over the weekend. The family asked to see a dietitian re: diet at home. 

Her BMI is 39 and her PMH said she had a 30# weight loss this past year. She came into the hospital with extremely elevated K+ and PO4- levels, so she was placed on a renal diet. She also has COPD. During this admission it was found that she has lung cancer, and the oncologist was telling the family that she needs to be eating a lot of protein. They wanted to talk to an RD because they've always been told to restrict protein d/t her CKDIII, and they weren't sure what she could eat. They also wanted a low K+/PO4- foods list. 

I wasn't really sure what takes precedence in this case -- the cancer (and COPD -- increased nutrient needs?) or CKD. I know cancer patients typically need more protein, and she would be undergoing CT so she would be stressed. I checked her UA protein and it was negative, but I still didn't want to tell them to increase her protein significantly at home because I didn't want to put more stress on the kidneys (keep them as healthy as possible?) 

I ended up going middle of the road and doing a diet education based on 1 g PRO/kg and also providing CKD stages 1-4 diet education via the NCM. 

Was this proper education? Should I have done anything differently? Is there anything else I should have taken into account? I'll be seeing her again on Wednesday, so I can talk to the family again if there's anything I should change. I talked with one of the RDs at my hospital about it and she said it was appropriate, but I would like other opinions in case there's more for me to learn."
3dzvwp,3,2015-07-20,delaying CF,mintswan,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/3dzvwp/delaying_cf/,"I need some advice from my fellow speechies. 

I graduated with my master's in May, yay! I'm interested in working with adults in a medical setting (acute inpatient is my first choice). I have a 6 month old and would like to delay my CF until after he is a year old and done nursing (pumping during my hospital internship was a nightmare). Working part-time would be ideal, but I'm having a hard time finding part-time CFs anywhere, let alone in a hospital or in my area. I've considered moving, but I think it would be silly to uproot my family for a part-time job. Also, my state only gives 2 years to complete CF so I have to work at least 19 hours/week or it is pointless to work at all.

Questions: 

1. does it look bad to delay CF by 8 months to a year (or even longer)? Besides it looking bad, I'm worried that I'll forget everything I've learned in the last 2 years.
2. do part time CFs exist?? what about job sharing? Besides having a baby and wanting to raise him, I also have medical conditions that make me extremely miserable when working full time.  
3. If I can't find a reasonable part-time CF, should I wait until next year and just suck it up and take a school position to get the CF over with? I would rather not work in a school, but there are so many more school positions in my city. 

I've always heard that speech-language pathology was a good career for mothers, but I'm starting to see that it's only good if you become a mom after the CF (time restraints, no part time CF). I guess I'm just feeling discouraged by the whole CF thing... 

I appreciate any advice/stories/encouragement! Thanks! "
3dzz0p,107,2015-07-20,[Discussion] Getting a dog while you are in college,Kaedylee,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3dzz0p/discussion_getting_a_dog_while_you_are_in_college/,"Here at /r/dogs, we frequently see posts from college students who would like to get a dog.  Many people come here to ask questions along the lines of, ""Do you think it's a good idea for me to get a dog now, or should I wait until after I have finished school?"".  Because many college students have similar lifestyles and are in similar living situations, these threads often follow a predictable pattern, with many commenters repeating the same valid points.  The purpose of this post is to condense these points into one place and create a sort of ""master list"" of things for college students to consider before they get a dog.

In the process of creating this list, I reached out to some of /r/dogs' regular contributors, some of whom got dogs while they were in college, while others waited until they were in a stable career and living situation.  Together, we came up with a fairly comprehensive list of questions that college students should ask themselves before they decide to get a dog.

I am aware that some people feel that college students shouldn't get a dog, period.  While there are some valid concerns behind that opinion, I am not writing this post with the intention of talking *every* college student out of getting a dog.  Rather, the purpose is to help college students take an honest look at their situation and evaluate for themselves whether or not getting a dog would be right for them.

---
**Section 1: Is it a good idea to get a dog?**

* **Can you afford it?** Emphasis on ""you"".  Barring some extreme circumstances, owning a dog is not a necessity.  If you want to take on the responsibility of owning a dog, then you should not be relying on your parents to pay for your dog, regardless of if it is a one-time deal or on an ongoing basis.  Dogs are expensive, and being a responsible owner means being able to provide for your dog financially.  You will need to have enough money saved up for:

1. The cost of buying the dog from a breeder or adoption fee.  Buying from a reputable breeder will likely cost at least $1,000.  Adoption fees will vary depending on where you live and what kind of shelter/rescue you are getting the dog from.

2. Initial expenses (crate, food/water bowl, obedience classes, etc.) 

3. Ongoing expenses (food, toys, regular vet bills, etc.)

4. Potential veterinary emergencies.  It is generally recommended to have a *minimum* of $1,000 - $3,000 set aside in an emergency account.  This should be separate from any other savings or emergency funds you may have.

* **Does your apartment allow you to have a dog?** Double-check your lease and talk to your landlord before buying a dog.  Do not buy a dog with the intention of hiding it from your landlord.

* **If you have roommates, are they OK with you getting a dog?** Everyone you live with should be on on board with this idea.

* **Are you willing to place the well-being of your dog above your social life?** This means that you will likely have to miss parties, get-togethers, and weekend trips in order to make sure that your dog gets enough exercise and play time with you.  If you're taking classes during the day and going out in the evenings, your dog will likely be alone too much.

* **Will someone be home often enough to take the dog outside to do its business?** Young puppies need to be taken outside at least every 2 hours. Many adult dogs can go 8 hours or more between bathroom breaks, but it's typically best to take them out at least every 4-6 hours.

* **Will you still be able to take care of the dog during stressful times?** Your dog doesn't care if it's finals week.  He doesn't know that you have a project due tomorrow.  What he does know is that he's bored out of his mind and if you don't take him for a walk soon, he's going to play a game called ""let's redecorate the living room with chewed-up pieces of the couch"".

* **If you plan to take an internship or do study abroad, can you find somebody to take care of your dog?**  There are many reasons why you may not be able to take your dog with you on an internship assignment or while traveling internationally.  If you think you might do either one of these things, it would probably be best to hold off on getting a dog, unless you have a solid plan to provide for the dog's care while you are gone.  Sure, your roommate may say now that they would be willing to take care of your dog, but what happens if they decide they want to go to Europe over the summer?  You better have backup plans and backups to your backup plans.  And anyone who is willing to watch your dog better be capable of providing good care.

* **Will you still be able to take care of your dog after you graduate from college?** While no one can ever be sure what will happen in the future, college students tend to go through more major life changes in a shorter period of time than adults in a stable job and living situation. When you graduate from college, will you be able to get a job that will still allow you to take care of your dog, both from a time perspective as well as a financial perspective? If you have to move back in with your parents after you graduate, will they allow you to bring the dog with you?

* **In the event of an emergency, do you have a way to transport the dog to the vet?** Most forms of public transportation do not allow dogs. If you do not have a car, do you have some other way to get your dog to the vet on short notice?

---

**Section 2: So you read Section 1, and think you can meet all the criteria of responsible dog ownership. What details do you need to consider before getting a dog?**

* **Does your apartment have any size or breed restrictions?** It's usually best to call your landlord and specifically ask about this. Be aware that statements like ""Most dogs allowed"" almost always mean that there are some kind of restrictions. Also be aware that landlords usually have a lot of say over whether or not a dog meets the ""banned breed"" criteria. So if you get a dog of an unknown breed(s) that your landlord thinks looks like a pit bull, they can refuse to allow the dog if they ban pit bulls. Even if you currently live in an apartment with no size or breed restrictions, it may be a good idea to get a dog that's likely to be allowed in a lot of apartments so that it isn't too difficult to find another apartment in the future. Commonly banned breeds include Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, Dobermans, Akitas, and other breeds with a reputation for being aggressive. Some other breeds like Huskies, Malamutes, Great Danes, and Mastiffs aren't banned as often, but are still not allowed in a lot of apartments.  Note that mixes of banned breeds are usually banned as well.  For example, if you get a German Shepherd/lab mix, any apartment that bans German Shepherds is likely to ban your dog too.

* **Is it better to get an adult dog than a puppy?** Puppies require a lot of time, training, and attention. They are babies and require constant supervision and frequent bathroom breaks.  For many people, adult dogs are a better fit.

* **If you live with other people, who is going to officially own the dog?** There should be one person who officially owns the dog and is in charge of paying for everything and making final decisions regarding training and medical decisions. This is the person who will keep the dog after graduation. Group ownership situations where roommates or fraternity/sorority members jointly own the dog almost always end badly due to disagreements over training, division of costs, medical expenses, or who will keep the dog long term.

* **How will you socialize your dog with kids?**  College campuses tend to have very few children hanging around, but you will still need to make sure that your dog has frequent positive interactions with kids.  If you plan to have kids in the future, it is important that your dog does well with them.  If you aren't planning on having kids, you will likely still have friends and relatives who do have kids.  Either way, it is important to properly socialize your dog, and you will probably have to go out of your way to do so, because many college students do not interact with kids on a regular basis.

* **What breed(s) would be a good fit for you?** There are many factors that go into selecting a dog breed, from exercise to grooming needs to how much barking you can tolerate.  [This questionnaire](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/338hpq/where_is_that_checklist_of_questions_you_all_like/cqii0b1) is a good summary of what you will need to consider when choosing a breed.  If you would like, you can fill out that questionnaire and ask the /r/dogs community to give you breed recommendations based on your responses to those questions. In addition to what you want, you also have to respect the needs and opinions of any other people who live with you. Do they have allergies? Are there any breeds they are afraid of and don't want to live with?

* **What do you expect your roommates to do with respect to the dog?** Do you want their help taking the dog outside when you're not home? Are they willing to follow through with any rules or training guidelines you implement for the dog? Are they okay with this? Do they expect any kind of compensation for their help?

---

**Section 3: You really want a dog, but don't think you can responsibly take care of one right now. How do you get your puppy fix until you are in a better position to own a dog?**

* **Volunteer at a shelter.** Many places are always looking for volunteers to help walk dogs, play with them, and clean kennels.

* **Foster a dog for a rescue organization.** This won't work for everyone, but if your primary concern is the long term commitment of owning a dog, this could be a good fit.

* **Offer to walk or play with a neighbor's dog.** Some people need to have a dog walker come over in the middle of the day to let their dogs out for a little bit.  If you have a friendly relationship with your neighbors and your schedule allows it, this can be a great way to spend some time with a dog."

Not just because I have ADHD, but I'm also an atheist and I don't drink or go out like other college kids. However, I am very genuine and a pretty interesting person (if I do say so myself :P) once you get to know me and if you can relate to and/or accept the different things about me. I have 3 semesters left in college, majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently working as a software development intern. I can be kind of nerdy when it comes to computers (and I spend a fair bit of time playing a PC game), but I'm definitely not the stereotypical nerd. I'm always seeking to improve myself in regards to health, personality, how I dress/present myself, etc. and I don't fit the typical nerd mold. Anyway, I'll stop talking now. If you're interested feel free to PM me your kik username. It can be purely a platonic thing, or we can get into some dirty stuff eventually too if that's what you're looking for. Looking forward to hearing from you!"
3e09bs,10,2015-07-20,I'm suddenly feeling alone and I just want to vent,teddyit,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3e09bs/im_suddenly_feeling_alone_and_i_just_want_to_vent/,"I’ll try to keep this not-super-ridiculously-long, I just feel like talking. Most of the time I never worry about friends and relationships, but I’ve had too much time on my hands lately and nothing to do but overthink.

*******************************************************

A couple years ago I quit public school for homeschooling. I love it, I’ve learned loads, I get to do a lot of awesome, interesting things, and I’ve completely changed my ideas about life and learning. I won’t go into it much but I basically do a lot of extracurriculars, small classes, co-ops, clubs, volunteering, internships, ect. Right now I’m going into senior year, I’ve technically reached all my state’s requirements, and although I’m still studying and doing school, this year’s going to be more like a gap year.

I always felt kind of weird/like I didn’t fit in while I was in school. I had a lot of acquaintances, but only one or two friends I could really talk to. I figured, it was highschool, *everyone* feels weird and out of place. 

When I left school, I felt forgotten about. It was like I was never invited to hang out on the weekends, just because I wasn’t at school to remind everyone that I existed during the week (does that make sense?).

Anyways, it took a little bit, but I got into a sort of rhythm. I figured out what I was interested in, and I found fun ways to learn those things. I found myself spending more time alone, and more time with much older people. Once I really got into the things that I loved, I felt *complete.*

Now it’s July, all my classes ended a month ago, and all my extracurriculars have died down for the summer. I’m in between summer trips. *No problem, I’ll just hang out with some old friends from school!*

So much has changed. Mostly me. I think I was pretty weird before, but still, I had so much more in common with everyone back then. Now, all my friends and acquaintances are grown ups who make a living doing the things I’m interested in. They’re friends, but mostly they’re mentors. Basically, I’ve been caught up with myself, and other people who like the same weird things I do. And those people have introduced me to some new weird things, and I’ve just developed a lot of weird quirks and hobbies. 

My friends have changed too. They all seem to want to do nothing but hang out and get high/drunk/fucked up all the time. There’s nothing wrong with any of that, it’s just that it’s so boring that that’s what they want to do *all the time.* They’re people to hang out with, but I can’t quite say friends. We’re just in different places right now, there’s no real connection. I think I’m especially sad to see how much I’ve grown away from my childhood best friend. Growing up, we were into different things, but now we’re both *really* into our own things and not at all into each other’s things. We used to go months without hanging out, but when we finally got together again, it was like we’d never left each other. It’s not quite like that any more. I love her, but there’s not much common ground.

And god, boys. I’m 17. Never kissed a guy. Guys have liked me, I’ve liked guys, but somehow, even when there’s an overlap, there just isn’t chemistry, and for one reason or another, it doesn’t work out. No connection, just like with all my friends.

*******************************************************

For the most part, life is pretty awesome, I don’t know why I’m complaining, usually I *perfer* being alone, I’m just bummed about feeling like I have no one to really relate and talk to/growing apart from my best friend/feeling sexually &amp; romantically behind.

I suppose it all doesn’t really matter. I’ll be spending most of my time this year applying for colleges &amp; traveling. Soon I’ll get back to my “rhythm.” In a year, I’ll be going to college. There's one school I'm really, really excited about. It just seems perfect for me, academically and socially. I know I’ll meet people in college I can connect with, and until then I’ll be too busy to think much about it most of the time. Hanging out with my old friends has just brought some feelings up."
3e0fim,12,2015-07-20,Does anyone feel they have everything else *except* a relationship?,cimarafa,ForeverAloneWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/3e0fim/does_anyone_feel_they_have_everything_else_except/,"Realistically, I know I am highly lucky.  I was born to a relatively wealthy family, am going to a good college, have internships (and probably a job) lined up for me, have loving parents, and am quite healthy.  I am privileged in every way except my looks.  It makes me feel like I cant really complain, like I don't have a right to.  

But even more so, it makes me kind of angry.  Like I won the birth lottery in every way, and yet I don't even get to enjoy it.  My average looking brother is always going out to clubs, always has a pretty girlfriend who he regularly cheats on, has tonnes of friends who he goes on vacation with etc..  Even my sister who is still in high school is the popular and pretty one in her grade, which is slowly killing me inside.  

I also think I hurts my parents.  My mother comments sometimes that I haven't even had any experience yet, that I'm her 'little nun', but she doesn't understand-  she herself was very attractive, always had boyfriends etc.. until she met my dad.  Recently she told me she lost her virginity at FIFTEEN when giving 'the talk' to my sister.  Meanwhile I'm 21 and nothing's happened to me so far.

Even my Dad, who you would usually expect to be super protective of his daughter, is basically telling me to get laid.  Two weekends ago he handed me $250 in cash and told me to go out and 'socialize'. He always offers to pay for me and some friends to go on a trip to Europe or Japan if we want.  Sometimes if we're out he'll point out guys my age and ask me if he should talk to them about me, as if that would make a difference.  I think he's worried his daughter will end up a cat lady before too long, and honestly I feel so sorry for him.  It must be sad to give your child everything and still watch them fail.   I have failed him.  

I feel like I have a lot to offer.  Really, I have been very privileged in life.  But because of my ugly face I am doomed to go through my life devoid of male attention or romance at all.  I don't really think I have the right to complain, especially compared to the poor FAs on here. But I cant help but feel like a failure.   Does anyone else feel the same way? "
3e0gek,2,2015-07-20,WGU Enrollment Process,iheartcouture,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/3e0gek/wgu_enrollment_process/,"I'm interested in taking the BS-Health Informatics program at WGU. So far this experience has been frustrating to say the least. I've applied, and was put in contact with an Enrollment Counselor who quickly denied my enrollment after finding out that I live overseas on a Military base and would not have access to all 3 education centers. After a few back and forth emails, I called to speak with her (she was unavailable) but was directed to another EC who checked into the education center requirement issue and okayed it. However, they then came back and said that for this program there are 2 PPE's that are required and cannot be replaced by work experience and have to be done in the US. I have previous experience in billing/coding and plan to sit for the CCA exam in a few months. Also I am currently working in a hospital so obtaining an internship would not be an issue. 

Has anyone else faced this issue? I find that it's really strange that they are putting up all these road blocks during the enrollment process. I haven't even been formally accepted into any program. For the website to advertise they are both Military and International friendly--they sure aren't making this easy. The EC I've been speaking with said that it is specifically for this program. Any advice? "
3e0mjz,4,2015-07-20,Four days left and I still can't find an apartment,[deleted],VirginiaTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/3e0mjz/four_days_left_and_i_still_cant_find_an_apartment/,"So I'm one of the upperclassmen who's electing to live off-campus for the $2,000 credit. Unfortunately, my few friends who are living on campus don't or can't go off-campus. As a result, I've been looking for an individual lease that's less than $400, excluding utilities (hopefully &lt;$470 with utilities) as that's all that I can afford. I can pay the security deposit, but won't be able to pay for the first month's rent until about August 17th due to my internship's pay schedule. I've contacted maybe 40 owners, but only a handful have been able to offer me an individual lease and to allow me to pay rent in the middle of August. Additionally, only two of the contracts didn't fault/charge the lessee for everything. However, all of them were at least $500, I have no financial assistance and I recently found out that the most I can pay is $470 per month.

If I could get any help finding a place, I'd really appreciate it! I have until July 24th to figure this out, so time's of the essence. Thanks, Hokies, love y'all!"
3e0mst,35,2015-07-20,Best [m]an enjoys his date at beach ceremony spot a[f]ter reception,infallible_phallus,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3e0mst/best_man_enjoys_his_date_at_beach_ceremony_spot/,"A few years back my best friend was getting married and I was honored to be his best man. The wedding was on the beach and the reception, a short drive from there. After a very hot, very long, day for the wedding party, we all went back to the beach where the ceremony was and we were finally able to swim after a hot long day of formalities.

A little about me: I am a 6' tall white, brown curly haired guy with a thin athletic build. I have always been complimented on my blue, smiling eyes.

For the wedding I brought a gorgeous date, a girl I only had been with for roughly a month. At 115 pound, 5' 4"", red head, pale with little to no freckles, and perky, full C breasts. She was both a cute girl and also quite hot. We were both just 23 years old and I'd had a handful of good relationships, but this one had a sexual connection like I'd never had before or since. We felt the need to constantly please each other. Side note: we met because she was the hot intern at my office where I worked in the IT department, so fantasies certainly can come true.

After swimming with my friends, we had been at the beach for an hour when they began to leave. Soon it was just my date and I sit on the beach in a picture perfect summer night on Lake Michigan's shore. The nearly full moon bounced off the water and lit the scene just right.

I think we both understood that we were waiting for everyone to leave, so that we could enjoy each other in this picturesque moment. She wasted little time once our friends were at the top of the stairs and disappeared in to the wood line. The best thing about this girl was that, no matter what, if my tongue touched hers, she was instantly filled with lust. Tonight was no different, a 5 second kiss was followed by 15 seconds of her pulling her summer dress up, panties off, top of the dress down around her wonderful flat tummy, barely held up around her lovely hips. All I had to do was pull my swimming shorts down as I lie back as she climbs over me and her hand is reaching down and guiding my full erection in.

Up and down, she was bouncing and doing most of the work, while I aid her rythme  with subtle motion to compliment her expert moves. We took it slower than we in the past times. Previously with her, she moved more quickly and would come twice to my one, even without added stimulation. Instead we were both lavishing in the freedom of being in nature, and taking it slow. I enjoyed the scandalous feeling of having her exactly in the place where hours before our friends stood for their wedding ceremony. At this point we were making love and it was just her and I and the moon to know. 

At least that is what I thought. What I would estimate to be about 8 minutes in to our passionate session, I looked forward and just right of the beauty I was with, to see a couple walking towards us on the path from the stair landing. They were no more than 12 feet away. Her ass was facing mostly in their direction, bouncing up and down for them to see. 
I quietly exclaimed, ""Oh my god there's people!"" She got off of me and slide her dress back in place and I pulling my bottoms up from off my ankles. As quickly as we reacted though, I'll never forget the guy's gesture. He holds his hand outward to calm our shocked response, and in a matched calming tone said, ""Hey, you're cool"". It didn't work to keep us from reacting. We jumped up, grabbing what little items we had as the couple walked past.

I was clenched my towel in an elbow, her wet, sandy panties in one hand, and her hand in my other, fleeing urgently as we raced up the beach up the long wooden stairway over the beach grass, in to the dark trees, we escaped. I began to laugh, at how funny the situation was at this point. I couldn't understand why the couple was so close to us, as they for sure were more near than they needed to be to get around us on the beach. I wanted to know how long they had been able to see us for. I was laughing, but also sad that the wondrous moment had ended. We said back and forth these very things expressing our bewilderment, walking to the parking lot. Now we were getting in the car and headed back to her apartment. Thankfully the 45 minute drive was not too long to kill our desire. Although exhausted from the long day in the sun, our young sex drives always won out. After a quick shower to rinse the sand from our bodies, we had another great session on her bed before passing out naked in each others arms.

I didn't vacuum my car once that summer. I liked looking at the excessive amount of sand from the clothing and our bodies that we flung in the car that memorable night. The two month summer fling flew by too quick and we definitely weren't perfect for each other but I still reminisce about the sex. We shared an enormous amount of sexual pleasure, until sadly she ended up going back to her ex who had cheated on her before I had met her. With a husband and kid now, I wonder if she relives these memories.

Comment if you want to hear about the first time I came over to her apartment on a second date and she wouldn't take no for an answer."

3e16dy,3,2015-07-21,I [21 M] broke up with my GF [21 F] of 3 years last week. I feel so lost.,RaffBluffin,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e16dy/i_21_m_broke_up_with_my_gf_21_f_of_3_years_last/,"Hey r/relationships.

For the past 3 years, I've had the most amazing girlfriend I could ask for. She is beautiful both in and out, and very intelligent. She has been my support and encouragement in everything I do, and is into everything I'm into or is willing to try new things for my sake.

About a month ago, I started two internships (thanks to her), so 90% of my time(9 - 5, 7 - 11)has be devoted to my jobs. Because of this, we've only had a day or two of only a few hours to see each other. Around this time I started to get uncontrollable feelings of compromised youth. All of my friends and coworkers were single and enjoying their freedom. Despite the fact that most, if not all of them are unemployed and have ample free time, I still envied them slightly. People would tell me that our relationship was taken too seriously too quickly, and that made me question even more.

Eventually, I spoke to my gf about this and it obviously didn't sit well with her. I don't believe in keeping secrets from my gf, but I think speaking to her without processing these thoughts/feelings was a big mistake in my part. She naturally felt insecure about her worth in my life and with good reason. As the workload increased at my internship, I began to neglect her. What started as feverishly texting her while in my cubicle, became rare, one-word responses and the occasional emoji.

With every day that passed, I distanced myself more. She tried so hard to keep us going and I subconsciously downplayed her efforts. I was so focused on my confusion that I failed to see how hard she was trying.

We eventually took a mini break of sorts(a day), and I quickly succumbed to grief and separation anxiety. I told her I was willing to push through all those feelings with her, and we got back together as a result.

Things began to look up the next week as we hung out during my gaps and the weekend. Our last date was very relaxing and happy. At that moment her smile was all I cared about. But soon the thoughts/feelings returned. We go into an argument over something silly; an argument we'd normally joke about afterwards. Unfortunately, honest/stupid me told her that the argument reminded me of our mini-breakup. I barely meant anything by it, but she obviously felt uncomfortable with it. The conversation was dropped, and we resumed our night.

The following week was full of thought and confusion in my part. I really began to question whether a relationship was something I truly needed right now. But most importantly, I asked myself if risking her sanity and happiness was worth our relationship. I felt as if these feelings weren't temporary. The more I tried to avoid these thoughts, the louder they grew.

By the end of the week, she asked me about the whole argument thing, and that lead to use discussing our potential breakup. By this time I had convinced myself that breaking up was the right thing to do. Because of this, my answers to her questions were blunt. I didn't hesitate to break up. Even after she (hesitantly) offered a break, I refused. Upon refusing the break, she cried hysterically as she angrily yelled at me about how much she hated me and wished we'd never gone out in the first place. 

Her words killed me. I cried my heart out, barely able to breathe. She then apologized and said she didn't mean any of it. I believe her, but I also know there was some truth to it.

The crazy thing is that after that moment, we began to jokingly reminisce about our relationship; specifically about how we ended up together.

Four days have passed since that night, and I'm here writing this as my eyes are swollen from crying. I stop myself short from calling her everyday.

She's blocked me from all social media so all I have to remember her by are pictures and her bracelet that I can't get myself to remove.
I'm still so confused and don't know if that was the best choice. I got wasted last Saturday to the point of almost blacking out. I'm surprised I didn't text/call her.

I really miss her, and am worried I let go of something really good, That I let go of the best.
She was my best friend, and I broke her heart. I want to text her so bad, but don't know if it's the right thing to do. **IF** she were to take me back, let alone respond to my text, I don't know if I'd get those feelings again. If I were to, I can't do it. I'd just be hurting her even more.

I feel like a dick, shallow. I don't know what to do. I've asked my friends, but it barely helps. Some tell me I can find someone just as good or better, but that doesn't help. Others tell me I'm not fit for a relationship, or need to be able to be alone before being with someone else. We did almost everything together for the past three years, so everything reminds me of her.

Sorry for the sloppy writing or rant or whatever. I just really need your help. I've never found myself in a state of such desperation. I come to you for everyone else I've talked to is biased in some way. If anyone here has been through something similar or has experienced this second-hand, please.

**TL;DR:** I broke up a nearly perfect relationship, because of thoughts of compromised youth. I miss my SO so much but can't afford to hurt them even more if these thoughts return (again)."

I was never one to smoke weed. Up until like my Sophomore year of high school I guess you could say I was 'against' it but at the same time I've never been one to get all bent out of shape over other peoples' choices if they don't effect me. About then was when one of my closest friends started smoking and smoking regularly and long story short I changed my view from generally not associating myself with stoners to not giving a fuck but still not doing it myself. This is pretty much how i was up until maybe a year ago (my 3rd year of college) when I started getting interested in trying it myself. Then in January I had one of my friends hook me up and since then I've loved weed and smoked pretty much daily for a few months until I quit in April (so I could pass a drug test for an internship). I've been without weed since April because like I said I stopped and came home for the summer and I don't know where to get any here. This is kinda where my brother comes in.

My brother is about 5 years older than me, has been smoking since he was in high school, and I'm pretty sure he still thinks I'm anti-weed. Im very weird about talking to people about...well things in general so I don't know how to approach the conversation. It's also worth noting that I live with my parents right now but my brother does not and I don't really see him a lot.

Ive thought about trying to find an excuse to go down to his house then try bringing it up then but like I said I'm weird about things like that and him being my brother doesn't change anything about my non-confrontational and socially anxious personality.

Anybody have any suggestions?"

3e2jei,1,2015-07-21,"Three years ago, he [32M] broke up with me [30F] after a three year relationship. I am still broken now.",fat_lab_rat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e2jei/three_years_ago_he_32m_broke_up_with_me_30f_after/,"TLDR: Jeff left me three years ago after a three year relationship. Three years on, I'm still torn to pieces. Affecting all aspects of my life. I desperately want to move on but don't know how.


As the title suggests, I have not coped with my breakup well at all. It's been three years and the grief still grips me when I least expect it. It's not all the time, but every now and then I will feel stricken, sick in my stomach, chest tightening, I am so lonely, I miss him. He has moved on, there was another girl when we broke up, but we were already having problems. Since breaking up I've had a couple of dates with one guy, I ruined that by not being over the ex, I simply have no room for anyone else. I want to love again.


Backstory- we met while doing our postgrad degree. I was in a long distance relationship when I first met Jeff in our first yr of law school. I ended up breaking up with the ex ex (we were facing a 5 yr ldr, different continents) and started going out with Jeff. We sailed through our first year together. I had the better grades and I helped him with school. Everything was going well. In our second yr of school and of being together we had a silly tiff, i forgot about what. Somehow the tiff triggered something, he proposed to me and I accepted, it was sweet, we made up. He had a diamond ring ready when he proposed. I thought that meant that he was sure, it wasn't a rash decision since ring shopping takes effort.


Honestly I was just so touched that he made any effort at all for me. Our relationship was, looking back, pretty one sided. I gave and gave. And he took a lot, of my time, my effort, my affection, it got more and more skewed as time passed. I admit that he was like a man child to me, and maybe I showed it, many times, that I wasn't at all happy at his immaturity. I made biting remarks, I would criticize him for his behavior. It wasn't constructive. But I loved the hell out of this guy. He had explosive moments, but I can be very difficult and controlling and jealous at times, that makes him so angry he explodes. These were rare moments but they did happen. During our relationship, I found many texts and online msgs that suggested he was looking around. This was in our 3rd year together. I began to feel like I was the only one who wanted this relationship to work.

Anyway we broke up shortly after that. While he was emotionally searching for someone else, or maybe he was just trying to get out of this relationship that wasn't working for him (he just fell out of love with me), we still managed to spend a lovely 2 weeks together in his home country. I felt married to the guy. I did his laundry, i waited for him to come home every day from his voluntary internship (we were on break). Things seemed so blissful and stable. But he was protective of his phone, and I knew something might be up. Later on I found out he was chatting with a girl (not his current gf), but the cousin of my very good friend (I introduced Jeff to this friend and friend's family). I was extremely jealous and distraught when I found out and I confronted him about it. He denied everything. I let it pass. I didn't know what else I could do. Finally things broke apart when he met his current gf just before he graduated- I was staying back to complete an additional degree. Needless to say I was devastated.


At first I exercised a lot. Then I put a lot of effort into improving my looks with better clothes, makeup, ocps for my complexion. I know that I looked plain and even ugly when I'm next to him and people would stare. I was in so much pain. I got a dog. I love this dog and it really helped for a while. Still love this dog, don't worry.


But I find that I am unable to sleep and I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night in tears. I wake up in the middle of the night almost every day. In tears, maybe once in a few weeks. This has been going on for too long and I need my life back...

Reddit, what can I do to help myself? I have a bright future ahead in terms of my career. I've tried my best to improve myself, by being more independent, I know neediness was very unattractive to Jeff and I need for my own sake to be happy by myself. When I'm busy in the day I'm honestly fine, I joke and laugh and chat with my friends and colleagues, I seem to be doing very well to even my close friends and family. It's only when I go back to an empty apartment that I begin to despair. I am very lonely. I feel that life is meaningless without somebody to love. reddit, what should I do..

3e2jr3,6,2015-07-21,"Can't afford to move, Can't afford to stay. What do we do?",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3e2jr3/cant_afford_to_move_cant_afford_to_stay_what_do/,"So my boyfriend, our roommate, and I just got landed with a situation I was hoping you guys could help out with

We're currently living in a downtown 3BR apartment that was purchased by a new owner several months ago. Since purchasing the building we haven't heard much from the owner (i.e. not getting back to us about some broken appliances) until last night, when we received an e-mail from them with the new lease (which is supposed to be signed every august) not only will our $950 rent be going up $150 but the also want an addition $700 security deposit! Because of the short notice they said we could pay off the security deposit over time, but that paired with the new rent is way over our budget! Not to mention, the new lease says ""no pets"" and we currently have a rabbit and an aquarium of fish.

I'm currently in grad school and will be doing a full-time unpaid internship for the rest of the year, meaning i'll only be able to pull in about $100 a week from my part-time job. I'll be getting a student loan refund at the beginning of the semester which will be hopefully around $1500, but thats still a month off. My boyfriend just graduated from grad school but he's still struggling to find a real job. at the moment he's got an unpaid internship for resume purposes and he just got hired for a side project that pays $600 every two weeks, but he wont start making money on that for a couple weeks. Our roommate works full time at an advertising firm but he doesn't have a lot of savings to offer due to having to pay off some medical debts.

The idea came up last night of moving since we'll probably never see the new or old security deposits again (we have already failed the list of requirements on the new lease) but the issue is there isn't really enough cash between us to be able to get last and first months rent together for a new place. However staying in this apartment and having to pay an extra $250 a month (assuming we try the pay the security off in 7 months) is going to kill our already strapped finances.

Any ideas or suggestions?

UPDATE -- I actually just had to leave my house. The family refused to help, and my mom's aware I'm onto her, so I wasn't safe anymore.

There are so many things going on, I don't even know what's the priority anymore. And for as strong as my mindset used to be - everything you do is a choice, so do your best and keep going -, I'm not sure my best is enough anymore.

Let's start with the latest news I got, I guess. I got a call from my mom's job, apparently she's pulling crap at work again. She's 50, bipolar, and I live with her alone, therefore I'm responsible for everything she does. I'm expected by my entire family to sacrifice my life in order to take care of her 24/7, no matter how much I protest and state 'that's not how it works'. There are several issues with my mom acting up now at work, of all times - the first main one being that they've threatened to fire her over how often she's sick last month (which she doesn't care for), and the second one being that since my internship requires me to be out of my house 12 hours a day and to have an inadequate transportation pass to take her to the hospital, hospitalization by me is impossible so I have to live in danger until whenever it is the rest of my family decides to take the sticks out of their asses and do it themselves since they claim they worry so much (spoilers: they don't do anything). They will most likely demand me to skip internship time to take care of her, except if I do that I'm kicked out of my course and thus the entirety of the last year becomes useless (and this course is my only hope of getting into college, so there's no way I'm giving that up).

Given that I don't have an income to survive on my own as I'm unemployed and studying, and since I don't have access to her bank account, now I have the risk of going hungry every month, and given her status at work, the risk of becoming homeless soon. And as I was saving for a new laptop for work to be purchased next month, I now have to use that money just to survive and pay the bills while she's gone, making me even more unable of gathering my own funds.

And given her infant behavior when she's sick (even when she's not!) I now have to take care of a 5 room, 2 bathroom house all by myself despite having numerous physical issues that outright make me unable to do so. But since the rest of the family does not give a fuck, I simply have no choice.

To add to that, throughout this whole time and plight, I've been mentally abused by an ex date (20/M) who claims to 'love me so much' and that 'I deserve better'. He repeatedly feeds off my support, breaks boundaries I set for him and backstabs me almost every day since December, and acts as if it were normal. Last week, he decided to ignore my very existence as an experiment for a whooping 11 hours to see if he had self control not to cuddle me at all, and had the balls to try to sit next to me like nothing happened on the train when we left work. He also proceeds to talk to me as if we're good friends after when I told him to go fuck himself (quite literally). What the fuck? Why do I only attract the crazies?

Speaking of which, I found him an internship. I put MY OWN GRADES AND REPUTATION on the line for that. And what does he do? He plays League of Legends/goes to Facebook or 9gag all day instead of helping me complete a website project we have, with the deadline coming up this Friday. And I'm the one with the nearly fried laptop and less knowledge. How on earth will I pull this monumental job off when I don't know half the things I'm doing (which I've been learning on my own from scratch) and have 3 days to do it, with my grades depending on it? Not to mention he frequently discusses it out loud while sitting next to me with his colleague, while knowing I have ADD. So not only he doesn't do anything, but he keeps me from doing whatever because I can't focus at all, which in turn angers me. Oh yeah, I have anger management issues. He knows about both problems too, so I'd be willing to bet he does it on purpose.

And to finish myself off, after a good 7 months, during my birthday, it finally downed on me that my ex girlfriend (24), whom I still love, is (presumably) dead. For the first time in 7 months, I cried, and nowadays I feel like I have no true support, no one who will try to pick up my pieces and glue them back together, and I have to handle all of this on my own. I have no time to socialize, no time for myself, no time for grief, no time to feel, no time for nothing, and definitely no one available to help me do any of it.

I get people have gone through worse than this. I've gone through worse than this. But right now it feels like I can't breathe. Everything's falling on me at once and everyone expects me to deal with it as if it were business like usual, without complaining, sucking it up and being perfect while others repeatedly shit on my efforts. I don't know how to keep myself motivated, what to do, how to stay 'alive' in a sense. I guess my problem with this isn't the consequences that all of these personal disasters may bring, but rather my own mental survival. I need some solid advice on how to keep myself afloat.

Help...

TL;DR - Everything in my life has gone to shit in a very short amount of time, and I have no support. While I consider myself a generally mentally strong person, I feel like I can't keep myself up and fighting with everything happening at once. Help."

I'm new to shell scripting and am currently trying to build a web interface using ASP C# to connect to a Unix box. I am require to call a particular script which intern prompts back for a username, password and ID.

I'm using SSH.NET but I'm unable to handle this script (prompt back, etc.). I can run simple commands and capture the response using "".runcommand"" and "".Results"" but I believe I need to use Streams and Expect to handle this prompt, which I am getting trouble with. Researching has not helping me significantly.

Thanks guys.

EDIT: Adding an update, I've gotten really close to figuring it out. Using streams and most importantly, threads to delay the process. I guess this gives the box enough time to send the prompts to be read and handled properly. The final issue I'm having is the streamwriter.WriteLine() method is writing apparently two lines (one with the correct response, and the other with a blank space). This is causing me to enter a blank for the username (first prompt after calling the script) and the username for the password, etc.

Any thoughts? This is an xpost from /r/Powershell

EDIT: I got it, apparently WriteLine() or using Environment.NewLine issues \r\n which may read as 2 lines on some boxes, manually appending ""\n"" and using Write() for a command works fine. Hope this may help someone in the future. "

Below is all true.


You find yourself in the body of a 6""4' 250lbs. Strong male. Aged 25.  You are studying Information Systems Technology at a state college (regionally accredited). The college offers the entire B.S. of Information Systems Technology, completely online. This sounds like an advantageous method of learning so you pursue it. You maintain all A's in your classes, and your summer finals approach. Additionally, you are slated to earn your A.S. in Spring of 2016, and your B.S. in Fall of 2017.


Now you carefully plan your method of job acquisition.
1. Build your portfolio. You code in C++ **everyday**, and work on several personal projects. (Chipping away at HTML, CSS, Javascript... and the QT framework.)

2. Build experience and apply for a **paid** internship your junior year. You refuse to let another man take your labor for free. This is not entitlement, you understand that this requires you to be worth your salt. You are proud of your work, and let your hands speak for you. You have [researched](http://dor.myflorida.com/Pages/forms_index.aspx#discretionary) the [process](http://dor.myflorida.com/dor/taxes/registration.html) and [taxes](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Self-Employment-Tax-Social-Security-and-Medicare-Taxes) of [registering](http://dor.myflorida.com/dor/businesses/newbusiness_startup.html) a [sole-proprietorship](https://efile.sunbiz.org/ficregintro.html) for the state you live in, (Florida). You will be purchasing computer repair equipment (recovery media, multimeter, ESD mat, cables, loopback plugs, spare parts, diagnostic software, toolkits, a cheaply suit/tailored, and business cards/flyers) on the next round of financial aid funding, (September). You are highly motivated, and have a genuine passion for technology.  

3. Finally, you will be acquiring several industry certifications along the way (CompTIA, A+, CCNA, MSC, and MTA).


**END RESULT:** A resume that showcases your B.S. degree with competitive certifications. A strong portfolio. A website that shows your passion and ability. And an intimate experience with the practical application of what you formally learned.  You will achieve success. You believe in this. No, you **know** this.


So far so good? Of course not. Too squeaky clean, too try-hard. Our hero is not relatable, we need flaws.  So then, let's add some true faults to this non-fictional character. (Me) 

This is your third attempt at college. The first attempt was at St. Olaf University. [The tuition was staggering.](http://wp.stolaf.edu/financialaid/aid/cost-and-billing-information/) Thankfully, a hefty athletic scholarship was provided. You were a champion athlete, and Senior Captain of your Varsity team. But, you did not emerge unscathed.  The [1,537](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/St+Cloud,+FL/Northfield,+MN/@36.3590127,-87.3201059,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88dd8e1775153549:0x53642186d1e0dabf!2m2!1d-81.2811801!2d28.2489016!1m5!1m1!1s0x87f653c36e566ca1:0x7acc799d75f938af!2m2!1d-93.161604!2d44.4582983) miles from home, left you homesick. And the culture shock, made you feel isolated. One night you drank yourself to black out, alone. You incurred near fatal levels of alcohol poisoning, requiring emergency services. You insides hurt for weeks afterwards. Eventually, you quit the team, stopped going to classes, and picked up an addiction. You then quit school all together and moved back home, before the first semester ended.  Your Major: Psychology.

After serious familial upheaval (beware darkness), you found stability. Then you found employment. In that time, you worked as a telemarketer,  a construction worker, a security guard, a janitor, and finally as a smartphone salesman. You found a new passion. Technology. You found another institute of education. And you maintained exemplary marks (3.75 GPA).
Being a natural leader, you were a member of the student government, the theater group (hot women ;) ), and possessed eligibility for [Phi Theta Kappa](https://www.ptk.org/). You were gaining momentum, and had success.  Your Major: Computer Science.

Unfortunately, due to your physical size and early childhood (you were a very fat kid!), you have developed some interesting personality flaws. You are very confident, brashly so. So much, that it crosses into arrogance, and then back into confidence. This is because, you feel absolutely zero social anxiety in social situations. You are bigger and stronger than 99% of all your rivals. You have done battle with other strong men, on a painted field for the amusement of others. Men avert their eyes in respect, and crowds move when you walk. But in the shadows are insecurities from youth. So you act reckless, and bold. This of course brought you great fortune with women. But at a cost. 

&gt;You sometimes truthfully joke: ""The day I lost my virginity, was the day I fucked three hookers...My biggest regret...I didn't fuck them all, at the same time.""

Eventually, you started taking more risks. You bought a [1986 Red Chevrolet Corvette.](http://imganuncios.mitula.net/1986_chevrolet_corvette_base_bright_red_in_delray_beach_florida_7680009435014567635.jpg) 

There is no greater feeling than having a gorgeous college girl in the passenger seat of your car. While you *punish* the limits of your V8, 5.7 Liter, 330 lb-ft torque, monster of american muscle. *She wets herself*, and your car seat, knowing she follows a similar fate, back to your place. But admittedly, it grows old...

You started visiting sex dungeons to sate your sexual appetite. Because the prostitutes, college girls and bar chicks couldn't fuck your **ego**...You've had women literally beg you to fuck them. I won't go further there. But I'll tell you how it ended.

**You were falsely accused of rape.** It happened on the job. You were fired by your job, and then indefinitely suspended from your college for breaking the student code of conduct (though the incident occurred far from campus). You maintained your position, because you knew what happened. You knew the truth, and you weren't going to let others (who were never there) dictate the reality. The formal investigation conducted by three police officers, and the state detective concluded. And with the help of **video** evidence from the job, the state detective concluded the charges were unfounded. Charges were dropped, and you didn't even go to an Arraignment. But it was a Pyrrhic victory. This was a massive blow, your face was plastered on the State News for four days, and you have many online articles about you. Funny, how those sites never update with the trial results of a cleared man. (I can link the actual police report, if it interests you.)

Blah blah blah blah....


That's in the past. Your corvette long since fell into disrepair. You rode her hard and with reckless abandon. And eventually, you broke her. RIP Natasha. You loved her more than any woman.


You dream of the success you've had, but are determined to make it stable. You have paid a majority of past debts. Now, You have dragons to slay.

Enough of the expository, let's get to numbers.


**Debt**

**Credit Card** | **Charged** | **Limit**
-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
Bank Of America | 1,978 | 2,500
Barclay | 550.00 | 1,300
Capital One | 0 | 3,500
Chase Freedom | 0 | 1,300
CFE Visa | 0 | 1,000
Cap. One Power | 500 | 500
**TOTAL** | 2,528 | 10,000


&gt;Note: Interest on your Bank of America card is 0% until March 2017, and interest on your Barclays card is 0% until September 2015. Fuck credit card interest.


**Credit Card Debt: 2528**
**Stdnt Loan Debt : 6451**
**TOTAL------------: 8979**


&gt;Note: About 5000~ of your student loan comes from expensive private liberal arts university, **but**  ALL student loans are at 0% interest, because you are attending school. Fuck student loan interest.



**Monthly Expenses**

**Type | **Cost**
---------|----------|
Food | 200 |
Rent |  0*  |
C.C. | 100 |
Fun | 50 |
**Total** | 350
&gt;Note: The food category is somewhat generous, you qualify for food stamps. You also have coded a custom diet analyzer that finds the most efficient diet given four metrics (Gram weight, Calories, Protein, and Cost). You can get 200+ grams of protein and about 2400 calories for about 5 dollars a day.  You live with your father, and cousin. Your father only asks for 100 in rent a month. You always pay him 6 months in advance. (You don't owe rent until January). You help him to pay the upcoming property taxes. He is recently divorced, so you try your best to keep him happy ( do all the yard work, socialize with him, do him favors, and hug him...yeah your dad is an ex-gangster from the 80's Brooklyn,NY projects, but fuck it...he's human god damn it). Your day consists mostly of coding/studying/lifting weights/ and fucking around with your cousin. 


**Savings**

1,574



&gt;Note: you will receive about 3,925 in financial aid in September ( in 2 months), and another 3,925 in February ( in 5 months) for financial aid. This already takes into account tuition.




Ok so here is the dilemma, glad you made it this far (hope it's been a worthwhile read). Let's switch perspectives.

My brother (23) and cousin (20) are restless to move into our own place, as the three of us. Being the eldest, I have made it clear that we will not move unless we each have 3k in savings. That means we will have a joint savings of 9,000 and will be renting a 3bed/2bath house or apartment (which ever is best value), of no more than **1200** rent **hard limit**. Ideally we will be looking at the **1000** dollar range. We are going for a ZIP code near my cousin's school and my brother's work.

The issue here is that I feel a sense of obligation to my father. I deeply respect him. He is a very strong man, and it hurts me to leave him destroyed. He is on disability, his back was broken due to an ""accident"" in his gangster days. He recently fell and broke his shoulder. And his second wife of 10 years divorced him in April. He is almost 60 and is deeply depressed and lonely. Sometimes...I weep when I see my once strong father. I try to take control of things, to support him and let him rest...But he is so strong willed. He refuses me. And I have great difficulty, defying my father.

He has made it clear that he thinks I should stay to save more money. Financially it makes sense, but part of me believes he just wants the company. I have always been the loyal son, and I am conflicted. I feel it's time I leave and start my own way, and soon, my own family.

Besides that, I have my corvette covered in our back garage. Fully paid off. I am beyond sinking money in that money pit. It has 318,000 miles. And let me assure you, none of them were easy miles. I have sank my blood, tears, time and money to restoring her. But she was sucking me dry (and not in a good way :P ).  So I want to buy a working car. I was looking at an entry level car with good economy to carry me to success.  I am looking to spend no more than 10,000 , under 60,000 miles, and 2012-2014 year. [Take a look at what I am looking at.](https://www.truecar.com/used-cars-for-sale/listings/year-2012-max/location-34769/price-below-10000/?search_radius=75&amp;sort_order=PRICE_ASC&amp;used_opt=usedprice:less10&amp;tcref=tcvehicleselect&amp;page=2&amp;mileage_high=65000)

Assuming I finance 10,000 @ 6.0% for 72 moths: 

Monthly Payment = ( (Principle x Monthly Interest-rate x (1 + Monthly Interest-rate)^72)  / (1 + Monthly Interest-rate)^72 - 1

Which gives us: a monthly payment of 165.73, add insurance of 115 a month, and it comes to **280.73** a month. Spreading out my financial aid, I bring in about 990 a month. This of course is student debt. But it's interest free.



Let's imagine I move out in spring, In February I will have : 

3925(fin. aid) + 3925(fin aid) + 1574(savings) = **9424**  - 2450(monthly expenses up to Feb.) - 1500(business start-up) - 200(dad's rent)= **5,274**

My updated budget, if I split rent with my brother and cousin:


**Monthly Expenses**

**Type | **Cost**
---------|----------|
Food | 200 |
Rent |  500 |
C.C. | 100 |
Fun | 100|
**Total** | 900


&gt;Note: 1000 rent split three ways is 333, but I added 167 to cover utilities/misc expenses. I could also take off 50 dollars from my CC payment, and still meet the minimum, but I like paying them off quicker. Lastly I could cut my Fun money as well, since I'm accustomed to a different lifestyle.








**So to recap.** If I move out In February, I will incur 900 dollars in monthly expenses. I will have 5,274 in liquid savings, minus moving costs (deposit, etc). And each roommate will have at least 3,000 in liquid savings. My allowance would be 990 monthly due to financial aid. Remember this doesn't take into account the success of my sole-proprietorship, nor does it assume I have a job ( which I may certainly get). Please take into consideration I will not have to start repayment of my loans until June 2018. And since they are all grants/[subsidized](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#subsidized-vs-unsubsidized) I will pay no interest until equally later. So this is an interest-free loan to better my life and position myself towards success. The best investment I can make is in myself.


Having said all this, should I purchase a car? It would add around 280.73( car and insurance) + 50(maintenance) + 100(gas) =  430.73. I need something reliable, and I want to focus on my success. Should I move out? Should I do something else? I'm interested in what you have to say."
3e2xkx,4,2015-07-21,"Me [23F] with my BF [26M] of 3 years, long distance destroying everything.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e2xkx/me_23f_with_my_bf_26m_of_3_years_long_distance/,"So, for some back story on my boyfriend and I. We met in school. About a year into our relationship, he switched majors and started an incredibly time consuming program. This massively ate into our time together. In fact, every semester got worse and worse, but like...what could I say? Get worse grades for me? Yeah right. Except part of the problem is that every semester he promised he would have more time for me/us. So it was just a shitty perpetual cycle of getting my hopes up for our relationship to go back to normal and crushing disappointment as surprise! he's even busier than before.

So then he landed an internship. Good for him! Except it means we have to be apart for the summer. The last summer we have together because next semester I have to move away (complicated family reasons). It's a baby distance compared to what it will be next semester, like a long distance trial run. And it hasn't gone well.

First the internship was 8 weeks long. Then 10 weeks. It was going to start 2 weeks after school ended, so we'd have some time together. Actually it starts immediately after school ends so we have no time together. Oh also now it's 14 weeks. Just kidding, it's actually 15 weeks and he might have one week to spend with me at the end of it. He's doing his ""exit interview"" this week after which he will know if he's hired or not full time next year. So why work another 5 weeks after that? Oh because he ""didn't know"" he'd get an offer so soon, he ""already promised them"" he'd work the 15 weeks. Why? Because the other interns said they'd work that long and he doesn't want to look bad compared to them.

You know what else he promised? He promised me he'd come visit me. It's a 5 hour drive. He certainly has not visited. Another hope crushed. Like, I don't know, does he just say these things to placate me with no intention of following through? I have visited him twice though now. Once a surprise and once planned. He even had a 3 day weekend and it *didn't even occur* to him to visit. I mean, I guess I just assume in long distance relationships your top priority is trying to see your SO. Moving heaven and earth, blah blah blah.

So I told him how I was feeling. That I felt like I was so far from being a priority to him, that it was hard for me to keep dealing with the disappointments of him saying one thing and it just not being true. He was sympathetic I guess but had really nothing much else to say. He had nothing to offer to try to improve things.

Between that conversation about a week ago and yesterday, 2 things happened. First of all, I found out that he had actually told them he was going to work 15 weeks, unlike 14 like he had told me. This came up rather incidentally. I guess he thought he told me, but...he hadn't. Yay another disappointment. Second, he went over 2 days without contacting me. Oh, sure, he's sooooo busy...playing Dark Souls. Thanks, Steam. Like, a week after I tell you I feel like I'm not a priority to you, you can't take a little time out of your videogaming to make me feel like you care about me/are thinking about me/miss me/love me. Ugh.

So I called him up. Told him through my tears how shitty I was feeling, how this is why I feel like such a low priority, how I feel like I've been jerked around with this internship thing re: how long it's going to actually be, how I feel like he's so busy investing all his effort into his future and no effort into *our* future. 

His response? He feels like he's putting in the effort and there's nothing more he can do. I mean, this is what our relationship looks like: he calls me once a day (maybe). We occasionally text about superficial things. That's it. No visits, no spontaneous surprises, no coupley things. Nothing. I kind of feel like a chore to him. We're long distance and communication is literally all we have to keep our relationships alive, but going 2 days without so much as a text is...putting in the effort? 

I guess it's hard for me to wrap my head around this: your SO comes to you saying she's desperately unhappy and you *make no effort* to improve the situation. Why? I feel like I am drowning and asking for a lifeline and he's standing on the dock saying, ""sorry, I can't help you, learn how to swim.""

Fuck this is long. Sorry. :/
   
**tl;dr**: I feel like a shitty low priority to my boyfriend. Are my expectations just completely unrealistic? Anyone in a LDR want to weigh in here?"

**Codename:** Lord Ethereal

**HYDRA/S.H.I.E.L.D.:** HYDRA

**Major Power:** Ectokinesis: User can create, shape and manipulate extra-planar energy called ectoplasm. His abilities include: giving life and controling dead/inanimate beings; astral projection; becoming ethereal and life drainage.

**Minor Power:** Healing Factor/Immortality, fuelled by the consuming of ectoplasm.

**Weakness(es):**

* Like a vampire, needs to have a constant supply of ectoplasm to survive.

* When he has no nearby source of ectoplasm, he needs to drain from his own body.

* Is as vunerable as a normal person.

* Complete liife drainage may take a long time.

* When in ethereal form, he cannot control when he'll solidify again.

**[Appearance](http://www.eucthebug.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hannibal-Mads.jpg):**  A man of average size with a soft and hairless body; he has a plain face, beardless and ordinary, with his only noticeable feature being his eerie eyes, which are as pale and cold. His skin is pasty white, his hair dark blond and always combed sideways.

**Personality:** Aleksander is cold, patient, calculating, and capable of great cruelty, still he is a very refined gentleman. His voice is soft, he rarely raises it, forcing those who listen to do so intently. He is meticulous in appearance, speaks very precisely, has an impeccable wit, astonishing intellect, and a gourmet palate.

**Backstory:**

Aleksander Augustus I Skyggesen was born in the early middle ages, member of a wealthy aristocratic family in Northern Denmark. He had never been a good man, since young he was fond of abusing his father's serfs as a hobby. One day, he had just turned 20, a gypsie woman was caught trespassing into their lands; as usual he assembled a band a footmen and had her brought to the Dungeons, where he tortured her for countless hours. Before her last breath, though, the woman managed to mutter a curse in which she damned her torturer to live an eternity, but dead inside he'd always hunger for life. That night he felt very strange urge, he went to the pastry and raided it, but his stomach wouldn't stop aching... He needed more and more.

In the following days, the people in the Skyggesen Household started to fall ill to an unknown disease, their body slowly growing colder, their skin paler and their hair grayer, and soon they were dead; it took all of them, noble and servant, but for one, Aleksander. At first he had no control over it, he could just see the white pasty substance leaving the passerbys' bodies and flowing to him. Through the ages he learned his full potential, he learned that he not only did absorb their vital energy, but could also bend it to his will. Every now and then, Aleksander changes his name (and puts fowards several bureaucratic maneuvres) to avoid suspicion, one thing is, he's not very creative.

He was one of HYDRA's first financiers, when the Nazis came to Denmark, soon he became one of their top members and started to give lectures for the new interns in, for obvious reasons, History.

-----------------------------------------------       

*Wearing his usual fancy tweed suit and holding an old fashioned briefcase, Aleksander arrived at Headquarters on his private helicopter, an expensive black AugustaWestland AW101 VVIP. He removed his sunglasses and looked around unsmilling, his associates had taken a great effort to convince him to come out of his reclusion to teach a bunch of kids.*"
3e3hmo,45,2015-07-21,"Treating Murder-Hobo-itis, or how our party is building a bugbear army and running a brothel",spadflyer12,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3e3hmo/treating_murderhoboitis_or_how_our_party_is/,"I'm playing with a group of brand new players. The DM and I are the only two in the group who have played before and it's the DM's first time running a campaign. I am playing a CN gnome illusionist, emphasis on the Chaotic. The rest of our party is a NG Aarakocra rogue, CE Tiefling sorceress, CN Half-Drow cleric, CN Minotaur fighter, and a CN Dragonborn bard. Needless to say we suffer from a severe case of Murderhobo-itis....  Our party background is that we are all members of a really really bad mercenary company named: Murder Hobos Multinational

Most of the time the default group reaction is ""kill it and move on with the story"". We are running Princes of the Apocalypse (no spoilers here) and are still trying to gather information related to the main questline. I've been trying to steer them away from this and so far it seems to be working, and on top of it we have been rewarded, perhaps too much, by our DM.

Examples:

1. Found bandits attacking an old in, killed the bandits but couldn't save the civies. The inn was on fire, we put it out and found a kid inside. Managed to calm the kid down, learn about a wealthy uncle in Triboar, sent him there with our intern (an npc) to see if we could get a reward! We later get a letter from the intern that the uncle wants us to help the kid get the inn / brewery back up and running and sent some capitol and the kid with our intern back to the place to get it up and running. We decide that it should be a brothel, but so far haven't been able to do much with it. **TL;DR didn't kill a kid or abandon him in the woods, got a brothel out of it.**

2. We needed to take shelter from a storm, found a cave that was inhabited by a big sleeping creature. Party wanted to leave him or kill him in his sleep. No one wanted to go in first so I walked right in and woke him up. I (hoping for a giant) tried to be polite and gently woke him up. It was an Etin... Great RP dialog followed as we tried to learn why he had a bugbear tied up in the corner. We eventually discerned that he intended to eat us and a fight ensued. Our cleric was used as a club but eventually we had this guy restrained and rolling with laughter on the floor. (Earthen Hand and Hideous Laughter) This gave our fighter the chance to (critically) hit and smash the Etin's heads in. This ""talk instead of kill"" didn't work out quite so well...

3. The bugbear chained in the corner wanted out but we didn't trust him. We interrogate him and learn some stuff. We didn't hurt him, much... aside from some slightly frostbitten balls. After interrogating him most of the party wanted to just kill this blubbering clanless bugbear. So I suggested that we needed a new intern and that he could join our company! Happy to be alive and still an Etin-club virgin he joins our company. **TL;DR didn't kill a captive bugbear, now have kickass new intern to watch our shit and camp**

4. Assaulted a keep, killed everyone but some slaves and a chapel with a priest and two sleeping pirates. By the time we got to the chapel we were super weak and basically out of spell slots. I think I had 1x 1st level left. My character, having a flair for the dramatic and loving chaos, just barged in, Minor Illusion to appear to be radiating power, Prestidigitation to make the torches flair and flicker, followed by a Tiefling, Minotaur, and Dragonborn. I just start yelling ""All bow before the great and powerful FIZBURN!!!"", ""Kneel before the might of the all powerful gnome"". *rolls 19 on intimidate*, the pirates are cowering in fear, the priest is not affected. The priest responds with ""Who are you, where is BBEG!! The wrath of god XXX shall smite you for interrupting my sermon!"". I respond with ""We left nothing of your boss save for a shadow seared into the walls of this pathetic excuse for a keep! The corpses of his men litter the courtyard!"" As this dialog occurs I am confidently striding toward the priest. Upon entering melee range and this guy is still giving me lip I shout ""NEVER FUCK WITH A GNOME!!!"" and use my last 1st level spell to cast Thunderwave, sending this guy flying into the wall. I turn to the two pirates and say ""You two, our brothel is in need of bouncers, impress me with handling this priest and you might just find yourselves a good job"" The pirates hog tie the priest and tie him up next to our giant goat. **TL;DR 3' tall, 30lb gnome barges into a chapel, scares the shit out of some pirates, convinces them to apprehend their own priest. Party gains loyal pirates to sail small boat full of loot and later be bouncers for company enterprise.**

5. Also in the keep were a group of bugbears employed by the BBEG. Instead of fighting and trying to kill them we convinced them, with lots of corporate bibblebabble, promises of promotions, etc to become a part of Murder Hobos Multinational's brand new Bugbear Division! They take the offer and we reward them with a feast / use them to guard the slaves we found so no one runs off in the middle of the night.  The only problem is these guys aren't loyal and already have a chief. We want our loyal bugbear intern, Smithforge to be the clan chief. Well when we bring Smithforge in with the rest of our gear the next day a fight breaks out. I use Phantasmal Force to give Smithforge an edge. The old chief sees Simithforge make lightning quick attacks that deal extra damage. Smithforge wins, and we now have a loyal Bugbear division. Our Minotaur fighter also recants a fight he had against a giant bugbear in an arena and solidifies their loyalty.  **TL;DR Convinced mercenary bugbears to join our company, managed to gain their loyalty through some clever trickery. We now have a squad of 4 badass bugbears and equipment to outfit them.** 

Now these bugbears come in handy down the road. Our DM puts us up against a chain demon, but sort of forgot about our bugbear army. The bugbears proceed to beat the crap out of this chain demon and we sort of trivialized the whole encounter. The chain demon ended up dying after only 3 rounds.... 

So DM's, try to reward your murder hobos for not killing people by giving them followers / allowing them to do things with the people they spare. Players: don't just kill everyone, many people / creatures can be far more useful alive than dead. "
3e3i8d,19,2015-07-21,Sex on the Beach...and I Don't Mean the Drink 🍹 ;),SheGetsHerLix,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/3e3i8d/sex_on_the_beachand_i_dont_mean_the_drink/,"I was 17 when I visited California once to meet my dad in L.A. 
It was my first time being on the west coast and I was more than inexperienced when it came to traveling on my own. My dad owned a pool contracting business and since he was busy during that summer he had one of his interns keep me company. And damn, he was ***definitely*** company worth keeping. ;) 

He was soooo fucking sexy, older than me but that never stopped me before, and he was given the task to take me wherever I wanted to go in the company truck. I tried my best to be subtle whenever I seduced him; it was especially fun teasing him with my dad in the room. ;D 

One day, after all of my attempts at making him mine fell through, I decided to try and enjoy my last week there by going to the beach. It was silent the whole twenty-minute drive to Santa Monica pier and I began to feel beside myself, thinking that I was too immature for him. What happened next proved me wrong.... ;)

I'd say probably an hour before we left, the sun was going down and the pier began to light up, I walking up to him solemnly with my things, telling him I was ready to go home. We walked back to the truck and drove off, the familiar silence still there. Suddenly I realized we were going in the wrong direction and towards some of the leveled beach parking under the pier. 

I tried asking him what was going on. Silence. He told me to get out of the car. Annoyed, I reluctantly complied and when he got out and came around to my side he grabbed me and kissed me and gripped my hair, telling me how much he wanted to fuck me and how pissed he was that I was teasing him...We fucked right there.

Thanks for participating and respecting the rules! :D


So, in this weekly discussion thread I only give the main idea for a theory and it would be cool if people could eventually find actual things to ""prove"" or "" disprove"" them. As always criticism or a like about it is welcomed. 

So here now for the theories that my friend made for me and I improved them a little: 

**First theory : Homura, the eternal patient**

the first theory my friend made up is that actually Homura is dreaming all this and nothing of all the series is actually true or really happened. It was only Homura's intern struggle as patient. 

Why patient you said? 

Because it's said in the series that she has a heart condition and in the first timeline she's VERY weak at PE and other stuff and my only question is then : How did she do all that crazy stuff ( be it in the series, in rebellion or in the PSP game )? And no I do not think only because she's now a magical girl... That's because I think that Homura dreamed all that because she's in a coma.

So why dream about all that stuff ( such as witches or wraiths or even the incubator or other things)? 

I made some research about what actually when you're in coma... And often the dreams of the patient is related to things in the actual real world and is transfered in the dream as a emotion or even a person or a concept.... So maybe  when she's in a witch barrier something bad happen in the real world( eg. and operation don't work properly or her pulse are dropping... 

Other thing that I noticed is: We don't know ANYTHING about her family or relatives or even her backstory before she met Madoka...So maybe, when bad stuff happen in her ""dream"" , maybe there are a argue between her parents in the hospital....

Then why do Homura love Madoka so much in her ""dream"" if she is only a person she made up ? 

Because in a coma or even in  a normal dream, persons are often represented as mere concepts and not as actual persons, she love Madoka's concept to be and to act , because be serious please , Homura LOVES Madoka  really but they don't really know each other. Even Homura in the first timeline doesn't know much about madoka and she ,I think , at this point, likes here. As friend and as savior from her misery because Madoka only wanted to help homura out in the first timeline.   

That's  because I think that often in her ""dream"" the persons are only concepts or how she would be like treated from other persons.... As said earlier she only interpret the real world and make that in the dream world... 

Other theorycrafting: maybe madoka is only a person in class she saw and now remembers about it in the ""dream""...  

So here's a video for the guys who are interested about: [What's it like to be in a coma?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrT9XRyDDaE)

Ok. Now more things that could support this ( only little things becuase it's your job to find more things but that as little help):


* [All the chairs in the anime](http://imgur.com/a/MrdFI)  
 ( as persons that visit her in the hospital or even more logical not visit her because they're all empty) 


* [The rebellion song: Noi! The clara dolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdXTqxTWxcM)

And as I'm not only fluent in french but also in german, I could find, in my opinion, a good translation to it: 

Original lyrics:

Wo ist deine lange Nadel? 

Wo ist deine kurze Nadel? 

Auf wiedersehen, in der Schlafenszeit, ja. 

Das Fenster, genau geschlossen.

 Der Schlüssel, (ja/er)*, genau befestigt. 

Nein, zuerst einmal werd ich zwar-

 Nein, wie wertvoll sichtbar deine Tränen.

 Nein, nein, fallen

 Nein, nein, nein, springen 

Mit wen lasst uns mal entsprechen.**

 Nein, nein, fallen

 Nein, nein, nein, springen

 Nein, nein, nein, fallen

 Nein, nein, nein, springen

 Neeeiiin. 




Translation:



Where is your long needle?

 Where is your short needle?

 Goodbye, in your sleeptime, yes 

The window, tightly closed

 The key, (yes/he)*, tightly locked

 No, first of all, I'll- 

No, how preciously visible your tears are.

 No, no, falling,

 No, no, no, jumping, 

With whom let us correlate,**

 No, no, falling,

 No, no, no, jumping,

 No, no, no, falling,

 No, no, no, jumping Nooooo.



*I don't understand if they're saying ""Ja"" (Yes) or ""Er"" (He), both would make sense. 

**This line doesn't even make sense in german, but it's what I understand, so I guess translating it literally would be the best choice here. Maybe they're saying something else, but I really can't make it out.


Yes, it is from a youtube comment in this video but after listening to it like 100 times , I think that's the most accurate translation to it.

* Homura is often represented in a white dress- In rebellion at the incubator scene, opening of rebellion, throughout the original show ( especially at the end in the space hug scene). Maybe a hint that she's a patient. 

So, I think that for this theory, it should be nearly everything that i can share with you all, so if any of you have other ideas please tell me because i really like that theory.



**Theory 2: Madoka killed every magical girl!**

This theory is only a little one and it's only about one little scene in the show : It's when Madoka ""saves"" ever magical girl from despair.... But what do we REALLY see? Please watch the scene again and no sorry I can't find a youtube link to it...

So what do we really see? We only se that Madoka came, hold the soul gem and cleansed it first and then the soul gem vanished and then the body of the magical girl vanished too... 


Death bringer? Savior?  It's up to you to think about it!


So that was the two theories I wanted to share with you! Have a good day ! 

Edit : Made some adjustement  for a better view

3e3w2c,2,2015-07-21,Brain tumour,Iamafraid_,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/3e3w2c/brain_tumour/,"Dear All,

I finally got the courage to sign up for this forum. I am 24 years old and have been worrying about my health for as long as I can remember. It started off small, but most recently I have become convinced I have a brain tumour. My symptoms and worries started around 2 years ago, even though some of them I have realised date back to when I was a kid. 

Over two years ago I developed dry eyes and got prescribed drops for that. I need to note that my vision has now been checked on numerous times and pronounced perfect. However, over a year ago, floaters followed. After the floaters, I started seeing small specks of light and sometimes even a flash of light, but have many times been cleared off retinal detachment. As I was sitting in class one day and saw these little specks, I panicked and ran to check my eyes and discovered one of my pupils is bigger than the other. I didn't know how scary this is back then and later forgot about it. I have now established that my pupils are of uneven size in certain lightning conditions, but my doctors seem to think they are reactive to light, as they haven't acknowledged it as a problem, even though I point them to it. Another thing that I have noticed is that it seems that from looking at photos, one of my eyelids (on the side of the bigger pupil, right) is slightly bigger (my face is somewhat assymetrical) and on certain mornings, I have noticed I wake up with swollen eyelids, this one being even bigger than the other. Finally, even though without fully realising it, since a child I have noticed that sometimes when I walk past objects on my left or right, but mostly left, and 'half-focus' on them, they appear as if their outer boundary gets projects slightly (not pure double image), if I just continued looking straight or turn fully to focus on them, I do not notice it. I also sometimes see ghosts of images as I look away, but so far attributed this to extensive computer use. 

In addition to this, I used to get headaches after being on the computer for too long, but now they have been replaced. Around 5 months ago, as I was working at my new internship (after having moved to a new city with the bf for the first time, sounds exciting, but I felt quite stressed) when I had something that people described to me as a migraine. I got a speck of light/form that wouldn't go away, got blind spots in my vision, got very disorientated and worried, it increased to seeing spinning jaggedy forms like the blades of a fan around my vision and eventually subsided, being followed by a headache. This has not repeated identically since then. Another thing that I started noticing maybe around a year ago or slightly less would be that when I would be on the computer, I would just get a brief wave of vertigo, something like a split-second spinning feeling that goes away. This used to occur maybe once a month, but has now too changed. Around two weeks ago I was lying in bed, twisted my head and eyes and got a very bad vertigo feeling, which was not long, but strong. Throughout that night, I would get smaller ones as I move, but nothing as bad. On the morning, I still woke up with it, but during the day, it had subsided. The vertigo returned two days ago and I am still experiencing it. It happens mostly when lying down and changing position, but sometimes I feel like I can almost trigger it or forget about it by unfocusing and relaxing my eyes (trigger) or by getting occupied with something else (forget) (I am worried pretty much 24/7 to the point I am unable to do much daily activities - am jobless atm). I also get sinus-type headaches around my nose and eyes.

In terms of headaches, I experienced over a year ago a type of out-of-nowhere pain on the left side of my head, on the back, almost where the spine connects to the skill, then never experienced it until a few weeks ago when I would get them almost every day for a week or so, but they would come once during the day and quickly go away (once, I noticed that I was able to stop its onset by relaxing my neck and shoulders). 

I have sculiosis and pretty much constantly-inflamed lymph nodes on the right side of the neck which have been there since I was a kid, but started hurting and pulling on more than two years ago after I went out with wet hair in extremely windy and cold weather. Since then, they are quite uncomfortable almost all winter, but barely noticeable in the summmer. I also have like a constant bump that my doctors have felt in the right side of my neck mid-way to the shoulder which kind of just sits there and get better or worse with illnesses or cold weather. 

I am pretty sure I can throw in a few other things in there too, but realise this post is already getting ridiculous. Please, any input will be appreciated! 

Edit: In terms of balance, mine is pretty poor, motion/car/plane sickness and even wavy/swimming feeling when I would lie down for a nap after swimming in the sea as a kid. 

Furthermore, recently one of my ears sometimes feel stuffed and used to feel wet in the winter, the joint next to it also cracks sometimes/most of the time when I move it. It has happened for both ears to also ring or to experience a short stabbing pain from time to time over the past 1-2 years.

Furthermore, I have a terrible posture due to my sculiosis."
3e400x,5,2015-07-21,B.A. in 3 years now i can't find a job.,usmcbeefpatty,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3e400x/ba_in_3_years_now_i_cant_find_a_job/,"After completing my 4 years in the Marines I decided to go to college and get a B.A. degree. I wanted a good field that would be around for a long time, i choose computer science. I went full time every semester and completed my degree in 3 years. The idea was to complete college, get it out of the way, and get in the work field as soon as possible. Now I can't get a job anywhere. Everyone wants experience or someone who has been an intern at the very least. No one wants to train or take a gamble on a green college grad. I'm now applying for jobs a hundred, or more, miles away. If that fails i will just have to attempt other states in the hope someone takes a chance on me.
I'm writing this to warn anyone who has the same game plan that i had. Other degrees may not be the same and every situation is different, but my advise is to take an intern somewhere for a summer. College alone, at least in my field, is not enough."
3e42ah,0,2015-07-21,Lot of white guy worshiping in dating I see. Black man here.,[deleted],dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/3e42ah/lot_of_white_guy_worshiping_in_dating_i_see_black/,"To give you an idea of what I'm like, I live in South Texas.  Not originally from here. Lived up and down the East Coast and moved from Atlanta.

6'1'' early 30s black guy.  Athletic, professional career, weightlifter, into MMA yada yada.  I have a credit score of over 750.  Never been married, no kids.  Good catch right?!

Nah, not for many women.  It seems I get heavily written off because I'm not white.  Where I live there is a large Hispanic population, some whites, very few black women.  I have dated across the color line but I tend to be into women outside my race simply because a lot of black women remind me a lot of family.  It's not bad, but I can't date someone that I feel is like my cousin.

Anyways, time and time again I have heard female friends say ""I only date white guys"" or something and end up with one of the bummiest guys.  I have been asked by females to hook their friends up with guys, and with guess what?  White guys, as though I know a bunch of single eligible white guys because I dress preppy and I guess I have things going on for myself.

So what's wrong with me?  I'm good looking and healthy.  And please don't think I'm FA,  I have been in serious relationships, but you have to realize that it does make dating more difficult when you are nicked off for something you can't control.  I can chalk it up to the fact that many women see white men as high status and black men as lower status, even if it is at times CLEARLY not the case.  The friend of the girl that asked me to hook her up with someone works at a law firm and rebounded with a younger guy that was an intern and a pothead.  There are better options out there.

I'm just ranting because I've seen this over and over.  I've seen asian men complain about it and Indian men as well.  I am complaining now as a black man.  No I don't want to date someone that sees me as an object or a fetish, I simply want to get equal footing in dating for my merits.   Life isn't fair though."
3e44wn,2,2015-07-21,Help! Clips skipping frames in premiere.,Webbiefoot,premiere,https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/3e44wn/help_clips_skipping_frames_in_premiere/,"Hello! 

I love making videos and have always just made them for fun with family and friends. Recently I discovered that I wanted to pursue film direction as a career and landed a video production internship for the summer. The company i'm working for doesn't have any employees who have knowledge or background in film or editing so i've been figuring out everything I need answers to through youtube and google.  However, I can't find any info or answers for the current issue i'm having. Here is the break down: 

When I view the video clips in quicktime they appear just as a filmed them; no glitches, pauses or issues. But when I import them into premiere pro it's like frames are totally being dropped and when I crop the clips the preview is totally off from where I actually am cropping it. 

I filmed in these settings: 

Format: H.264, 1930 x 1080
AC3, 48000 Hz, Stereo (L, R)
FPS: 29.97
Data Rate: 24.00 Mbit/s
Current Size: 1001 x 563

I'm taking classes at my university in the fall that should hopefully make me an expert in the stuff but for now i'm lost! I tried changing the frame rate of the sequence to 29.97 but that didn't work. 

Is there a certain way I need to import these files into premiere? Any help would be very much appreciated! "
3e4dwc,1,2015-07-21,It Started In The Streets,[deleted],ZombieLit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZombieLit/comments/3e4dwc/it_started_in_the_streets/,"(Part One)
Hello everyone, before you start to read I just wanted to let you know I wrote this in less than two hours (editing took me three :/)
Hope you enjoy my first work. This is only Part One and if y'all enjoy it then I might work on a part two. Please be honest, I've got a thick skin and can deal with criticism. Thank you!

It started in the streets.

The homeless - the invisible ones. They started disappearing and dying: no one cared, really. We all thought it was a great thing that their population seemed to be diminishing. In fact, we encouraged it. We wanted the homeless off the streets; we wanted them all to be saved- helped. Little did we know what was actually happening to them and when we finally found out. It was too late for all of us.




April 23, 2018
The news reports told of a small virus that was mainly affecting those on the streets with no shelter and no means of medication. They couldn’t fight the disease without the help of antibiotics and most succumbed to it. Since those dead were practically unknown they were broadcasting pictures; mostly those with arrest records. If no one knew them they would be buried in the Assumption Cemetery, just a few miles from the main road of town. For now, they were being held in the city’s small morgue at the hospital, down the road from Anabelle Walkers’ home. Her father, their small town’s mortician was awaiting word from the coroner if the bodies would be brought to him.

Anabelle wasn’t concerned with the dead. She had helped her father when she was little. Watching him with the embalming fluids and the makeup. Make them look like they’re sleeping was what he always used to say. Before, the idea that her father touched dead people every day was disturbing to her. Now she knew Benjamin Walkers’ job was what fed and clothed her. It wasn’t something to be afraid of. Death was a normal everyday thing. She got up from the couch and put her breakfast dishes in the sink. Today was going to be a long day, her father would be working till late she was sure and she would be all alone in the house until she started her shift at the hospital. She started working there just 6 months ago and already she had moved up in the ranks of the nurses’ assistants and was on the fast track to starting her nursing degree at the local college.

Benjamin Walkers finally got the call he had been expecting around 2:30 in the afternoon. He would be receiving 12 bodies of the recently deceased homeless in two hours. The medical examiner Bob Markum was glad to get these men and women out of his refrigerators. It was too bad that so many of them went unclaimed, he thought the small tight-knit town would try a little harder to help these poor souls find their families. The only recognition was from the Wilkens’ family, and they didn’t want to pay for funeral costs anyway. Bob hoped to put an end to the questions from the police and local media by telling them all it was a virus. Sure, it was a virus. Something he had never seen before, but why start uproar when it was contained to these dirty street people?  No one else had seemed to fall ill. No one reported anything at the hospital. But those bite marks- no he wouldn’t start the media craze. He would let them go, bury whatever the truth was with them, he thought.

Ben arrived at the funeral home with an hour to spare. He needed all of his staff focused on their jobs; the task at hand was going to be rough. 12 bodies was a lot for the small staff at Assumption. Carrey Herald, Rick Topher, and Grace Freed were all sitting in the small staff room watching the TV and playing on their phones. Rick sat on the couch, taking up most of the small sitting area. He turned away from his phone; ignoring the text he just received to watch the small screen. It was another story; the news anchor was getting tired of talking about the latest craze on social media and focused again on the 18 dead homeless in the small town. Rick shook his head.
“If they’re sending them here then what else is there to discuss? Those poor bastards don’t have any family. They really need to stop.”
Carrey, the intern looked up at him from the pillow on the floor. This was her favorite spot in the room, she hated sitting next to people and no one else wanted to sit on the floor.
“They keep bringing them up because of what happened. How bad would it suck if no one claimed you after you died! Wouldn’t you want people to come remember you? Or are you so big and bad that you don’t care?” Her eyes bulging out of her head as she raised her voice. She was so upset about these poor innocent people not getting what they needed. She hated death. If she could save everyone she would. How could Rick the Brick be so insensitive? He looked over at Grace; the old woman was sitting with her knitting completely ignoring the news and the exchange between her coworkers. She had her opinions, but would never voice them even if someone asked her. She didn’t want to go along with her coworker’s drama. Kids.

The yelling match reached Ben’s ears as soon as he walked in the door. Damn, he thought, I was hoping they wouldn’t be worked up yet. He ran down the stairs and threw open the staff door.

“Alright you two, that’s enough yelling!” He exclaimed throwing the door so hard it crashed against the wall. Grace barely looked up from her work, Rick looked sheepishly down at the floor. He knew he had been loud, but was surprised that Ben could hear him so easily. Carrey was practically in tears and decided this would be a good time to excuse herself to the restroom to freshen up. She needed to be stronger if she was going to help work on so many people today. Ben went to fill his coffee cup at the counter and sat at his desk across from the small arm chair that was currently occupied by Grace. She nodded to him with a thoughtful look. He smiled back. Rick cleared his throat as to start an excuse for his yelling. Ben inhaled sharply and looked back at Rick. He would have no sympathy for bad behavior today. They had a lot of work to do.

Anabelle started her slow trek to Cicely’s house. It wasn’t too far away; she just didn’t want to pick up the girl for their shift. Cicely Truman was practically royalty in their small town. Anabelle didn’t know why she didn’t just drive herself. But for some reason Cicely had taken a liking to her, maybe it was because of their first day of work when Cicely didn’t know how to do anything and Anabelle helped her. Anabelle slowed at the stop sign and looked over at the place she really wanted to go: Devon Reynolds was sitting at the front desk of the mechanics shop. She could see him through the large window. He looked up from his computer and locked eyes with Anabelle for a second; she hurriedly looked forward and mashed the gas pedal. She couldn’t believe he had looked at her. Anabelle felt her cheeks get hot as she thought of Devon looking into her eyes. How it would feel to be held by him, to kiss him.
She still had a smile on her face when she pulled up in front of Cicely's gated home. The largest and grandest home in the town, no one else had towers or bay windows. And practically no one had two stories, let alone a third! She grabbed her old, beat up phone and sent a short “I’m here” message to Cicely. A few minutes later the gates opened and the stunning girl was running down the front steps of her home. Anabelle pulled into the circular driveway and unlocked her door. Cicely jumped in and leaned over to give the other girl a warm hug.
“You look happy today An!”  Cicely noticed the large dopey smile plastered all over her face. Anabelle blushed all over again and shook her head.
“Just happy to see you, girl.” Anabelle hated being called An, she was named after her mother and loved her name. Cicely rolled her eyes and laughed. They drove out of the gates and turned right towards the center of town.




Ben walked down the ramp to greet the driver of the refrigerated truck about to pull up to the back door of the funeral home. It was the easiest way to transport all of the bodies, even though it wasn’t conventional. He shook hands with the man and showed him where to back up to make it easiest for his crew. Rick was really the only one strong enough to unload all of them. Grace would be organizing all of the instruments needed and Carrey would get all the paperwork. It was up to Ben himself to help move the corpses down the two flights of stairs to the preparation room. It was going to be hard work. He wished that Bob had the wherewithal to send more than one person to help. Luckily, two more cars pulled up behind the large truck and four more strong men jumped out. Ben might not have to do too much moving.

When the work was all done Ben, surveying the sea of corpses surrounding him and his staff , felt a cold chill run down his back. Would they work fast enough to get them all done by tomorrow morning when the news crew would show up? He saw Carrey touch one of the young women on the gurney and worried a little about the poor girl. When you are so young and lose your parents its hard to come to terms with death. Maybe she shouldn’t be down here, he thought, maybe I should send her up to do the paperwork and talk to the diggers. She can take care of everything upstairs.

“Carrey.” He motioned for her to come over to him. “Why don’t you go up to my office and get the paperwork started and sign off on everything from the hospital? We also need to talk to the diggers, Marty and James Cyrus. If you could get a hold of them and get them down here as soon as possible that’d be great. The funeral will be tomorrow for everyone. I want to be ready. Thank you, dear.” He placed his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly way and smiled down at her. He hoped she would feel comforted; instead she was insulted that Ben would think she couldn’t handle it. She took a deep breath and smiled back at him. Then sadly opened the door and walked up the stairs.
Bob Markum greeted Anabelle and Cicely as they walked through the back door of the hospital. Bob was in his office faxing the paperwork that needed to be completed to Ben at the funeral home.
“Anabelle! How are you m’dear?” He had been here for so long he felt as though he knew everyone. Bob was the oldest person at Welloak Valley Hospital. He had seen two fires, one earthquake and about 350 dead while working. Considering he was the head pathologist in charge of the Hospital Morgue 350 wasn’t that many. 30 years of dead bodies.

Anabelle didn’t like Dr. Markum. She tolerated him, sure, but only for her father. They worked together so often that Dr. Markum was practically her uncle; at least that’s what he always called himself. She always thought he was creepy. Cicely waved in Bob’s direction then pulled Anabelle further down the hall so they wouldn’t be stopped. She looked over her shoulder at the man and smiled.
“Sorry, Dr, Markum,” Cicely shouted down the hall. “Don’t want to be late for work, ya know?”

Anabelle smiled at Cicely. She could get away with being rude to the doctor, lucky for Anabelle. They climbed the flight of stairs up to the nurse’s station on the first floor and logged on the computer to clock in for work. Anabelle covered her long dark hair with a bandana and turned to Cicely who was doing the same thing.
“Ready?” Anabelle and Cicely grabbed their cleaning supplies and filed down the hall to the first patients room.

Ben was exhausted. Seven hours of working on these corpses and they were almost done. He had sent Grace home 20 minutes ago. Not much else the embalmer could do after every body had been pumped full. Rick was sewing up the last of the strange looking wounds on the nearest body. The elderly man was obviously attacked by something. What, Ben didn’t want to try to find out. He just went about his business. If dear Dr. Markum didn’t want to talk about it, he wouldn’t make a fuss. After all Dr. Markum was the one who got him this job. Don’t ruin it. He looked to Rick with a nod and walked out the door to the stairs. They did as much as they could tonight. They’d start bright and early the next morning. Rick snipped the thread, put the needle and scissors back in his kit and turned to walk away. He caught movement in the corner of his eye. Did that corpse just move? He stopped and stared at the small hand of the young woman. Did she just twitch? Ben called from the next floor up; Rick shook his head and turned towards the door. He had obviously been working too long on these poor people. He was seeing things. He stopped to lock the door behind him and stomped up the small staircase. Ben was waiting by the front door to lock up. Rick smiled at him wearily as he walked out the door and down the steps to the dirt parking lot where his beat up Camaro sat in the closest parking space. The faded Navy sticker adorning his back window made him smile that much more. Five years ago he had been a combat medic in the war. He was born to sew up wounds. No matter how weird they looked. He unlocked his door and turned to see Ben following him towards the parking lot.
“6 AM tomorrow, friend.” Ben grimaced at Rick. He knew it was earlier than they usually had to be at work, but if they wanted to get these people looking like they didn’t die then they needed to work from sun up. Especially since that camera crew was going to be there before noon. Ben was worried what they’d try to get out of him. He nodded at Rick. He knew Rick was concerned about the wounds too. What could they do about it Ben’s look seemed to say. Rick shook his head back, got in his car and drove away. Ben started for home as well.

Anabelle was excited for the party after work. She and Cicely started to get ready even before they clocked off. Cicely decided that Anabelle should try her hair up; Cicely was going to wear her naturally curly, blonde hair up as well. They ran down the back hallway, past Dr. Markum’s empty office and out the doors to the parking garage. Everything was so dark.
“Ugh. I hate when they don’t turn the lights on in the garage!” Cicely moaned to Anabelle. She turned towards the small blonde girl and looked her over once.
“What? Are you afraid of the dark?” Anabelle smiled menacingly at Cicely. The small girl frowned and swiped at her friend. They linked arms and started walking towards the elevator to take them to the top floor where they had parked hours before. The moon was full and bright. Illuminating their way down the sidewalk, but as soon as they entered the basement-like garage they could barely see a few feet ahead of them. Cicely grabbed tighter to Anabelle. Yes, she was afraid of the dark. You never know what could be right in front of you.

They slowly made their way to the elevator, the glowing EXIT sign helping to light up their feet. 20 feet ahead of them stood a figure. Not moving, standing still. Staring. Cicely saw him first and yelped.
“Who’s there?” Anabelle called out. The man slowly made his way, limping over to the two girls. When he was finally close enough to see the girls noticed he was wearing a torn dirty shirt and shorts. No shoes. He had one gaping bite mark on his leg.

“Help.” The man said before collapsing in front of the girls. Cicely Screamed.

Ben turned his big Suburban out of the parking lot of the Assumption Funeral Home, he felt as though he and his crew had accomplished quite a bit today. He felt bad for the poor souls, not having any family to claim them. But he knew that quite a few at Assumption Church had planned a good turn out for them, even if they didn’t know any of the deceased. He thought about the bodies on their gurneys all the way home. Why did all of them have those wounds? They looked like bites. He grabbed his phone at a stoplight and sent off a short text to Bob Markum: Almost completely finished with 12. Want to ask about tests done on them. Call me when you get a chance. Almost Home. The light turned green as he pressed the send button. He drove the last few miles home and silently hoped that Bob would call him soon.

“I need help! There’s a man in the parking garage who’s badly injured!” Anabelle ran in through the hospitals emergency entrance and yelled to anyone who would listen. Two nurses noticed her and grabbed a gurney and followed her out to the garage. The Doctor who heard the call also followed behind the nurses and ran to turn the switch on near the parking garage. The place was bathed in orange light as the nurses ran in to find Cicely sitting near the hallway holding her knees, crying. The man was nowhere to be found.
“Are you trying to play a joke on us, kid!” the male nurse asked Anabelle angrily.
“He-he just got up and-” The female nurse came over to Cicely to make sure she was ok. In the hallway behind them, the light flickered slowly. Crawling towards the girl and the nurse, slowly on his almost bare stomach. He reached the small blond girl and grabbed a hold of her beautiful hair. He pulled himself up slowly about to sink his teeth into her lovely neck.

Ben finally made it home. He slowly got out of his car and walked up the long driveway towards his front door. Strange, he thought Anabelle usually got home before he did, especially on nights that he worked so late. He looked at his phone to see if she had text him about going anywhere. Nope. He unlocked the front door and walked inside. Everything was normal; he walked into the kitchen and opened the freezer door. Pizza. His phone started ringing. He ran back into the front room to grab it. Anabelle.

“DADDY!” Anabelle was crying into the phone. “Cicely got bit!” Ben didn’t understand what she was saying.
“What bit her? A Snake? Where are you two?” Ben was sure they were somewhere they shouldn’t be. Foster’s farm. I bet they’re on Foster’s farm and a horse bit her. “Shit. Tell me where you are and I’ll come get you. I’ll call Dr. Markum and he can meet us there. He’ll help.”
“NO DAD!” Anabelle never yelled at her father. “ We are at the hospital! In the parking garage. A MAN BIT CECILY.” She screamed so loudly into the phone Ben had to hold it away from his head. He cussed again and pulled it back to his ear.
“What the hell do you mean? I’m leaving now. I’ll be there in five minutes. Are you safe?” Ben started walking out the front door.
“Yes. There’s Officer Jones here. They restrained him. But the doctor is checking out Cecily. Oh it’s my fault! I should’ve found out how to turn on the lights. I should never have left her alone with him!  OH!”
Ben got into the suburban and started it. “Stay where you are. I’m coming now.” He hung up the phone quickly and pulled out of the driveway. Speeding the whole way there, he made it in less than five minutes. He quickly and illegally parked in the emergency zone. Jumped out and ran through the double doors. There sat Anabelle, tears in her eyes. She was speaking to a female office that was writing down everything Anabelle said in a white notebook. Anabelle saw her father and jumped up immediately and ran to him. The officer watched the exchange and turned to Ben.
“Hi Ben. Everything is ok. Crazy man was in the parking garage, Anabelle ran for help when she saw he was injured. When she got back with the nurses the man was gone, he crawled back over and bit Cicely. Her parents are here. Waiting for her to come out of surgery. They’re going to fix it up just fine.” She turned to Anabelle. “Don’t worry, hon. It’s not your fault.”
Ben hugged his daughter and led her back to the chair she had been sitting in. He sat her down and kissed her forehead before turning towards the two other people in the room. Mr. And Mrs. Truman.
“Dave, Cass.” Ben greeted each of them with a handshake. “Sorry to meet you under such circumstances, but lovely to see you both, none the less.” Ben always did have a way with words. Cass Truman smiled warmly at the man. She always liked him. Dave Truman pulled himself up to his full 6 feet and puffed out his chest. He knew his wife was fond of the undertaker. And he didn’t like it. He curled his lip a little and rolled his eyes at the exchange between the two.
“Yes. Your irresponsible girl left our only daughter alone with a crazy man and he bit her. Truly bad circumstance.” Dave looked up at Ben; even at his full height he wasn’t nearly as tall as the other man. Ben almost looked shocked. He turned to Anabelle to see if she had heard. She still had her hands over her face and was crying. Officer Jones had sat down next to her and was rubbing her arm.
“Anabelle was being VERY responsible by trying to get the poor man help! Did you think to ask if Cicely offered to stay with him? She was a nurses’ assistant. You’d think she would want to help the man!” He flared at Dave Truman. “They didn’t know he was a psychopath!”
Dave breathed deeply and turned away from Ben. Cass looked at Ben apologetically and went to sit with Anabelle and Officer Jones.

Officer Emmet Lowe sat with his back to the wall watching the disheveled man twitch in his medicated sleep. He wondered who this crazy was… What kind of person is so messed up that he actually bites someone, Emmet thought. The nurse taking the vitals of Crazy glanced over at him. He smiled at her and nodded at the door. Jen shook her head.
“Aren’t you supposed to be making sure he doesn’t go anywhere?” She asked her boyfriend angrily.
“Not only is he sedated, but handcuffed to the bed. Where the hell is he going?” Emmet countered. Jen considered what he had said for a moment. Then smiled and winked at her boyfriend. She left the door open as she walked out. Emmet smiled and quickly followed behind her.
Cicely was finally out of surgery. The doctor told everyone you would barely even be able to see the scar on her shoulder. They also cleaned it out and made sure there were no bacteria. The man didn’t get a good enough grip on her to bite hard enough to break the skin, thankfully. Anabelle said goodbye to her, tearfully as her father escorted her back to his SUV from her hospital bed. Neither one of the girls were going to the party tonight.

Devon Reynolds heard what happened and immediately went to the mortician’s house. He was waiting for two hours before he thought maybe Anabelle wouldn’t be leaving the hospital tonight. If anything happened to her he didn’t know what he’d do. The girl was gorgeous but he didn’t think she even knew who he was. As he was about to start his car back up and pull down the long driveway he saw headlights slowly coming towards him.

Anabelle was asleep in the passenger seat of her father’s Suburban as they bumped over the long dirt driveway she was thrown forward in her seat and woke up with a start.
“Who could that be?” Her father saw the pickup truck in his driveway. He stopped and jumped out of his car. “Stay here, Anabelle.” He walked over to the truck and tapped on the window. Devon rolled his passenger window down and waved at Ben. Anabelle recognized Devon’s truck and honked the horn at her father. He waved her over and started to walk towards the house.
“Either he comes inside or you have five minutes. Your choice.” She nodded to her father and gave Devon a tilt of the head. He nodded and unbuckled his seat belt to follow her inside the house.


April 24, 2018

Devon awoke with a start. He was on a checked couch, his face smashed against one arm. A foot pressed against his butt made him realize he wasn’t alone. Anabelle Walkers was sleeping as well.
Ben had woken up at 530 despite only getting a few hours of sleep. He needed to finish his job at the funeral home and meet Rick at the preplanned time. When he walked past the living room doorway he wasn’t surprised to see Devon was sleeping on the couch. He was surprised, however to see his daughter sleeping there with him.
He shook his head, threw a blanket over his daughter, tucked a blanket under her head and walked out the door. For the first time in a very long time he stopped to lock the front door before leaving. You never know, he thought.

Driving through the empty streets of Welloak Valley, Ben started thinking about all the events that happened the day before. At least, he thought, today wouldn’t be any weirder.

Rick Topher pulled his Camaro into the closest parking spot in front of the Assumption Funeral Home. He didn’t sleep very well last night. The mass amounts of bodies he’d worked on yesterday didn’t help his flashbacks. The war was always in his nightmares, especially when he had multiple corpses to prepare at work. His eyes caught the front door before his headlights did. Something wasn’t right. 
It was open.

3e4i2x,1,2015-07-21,How should I modify my skin cleansing routine if I wear no makeup but work 40 hours/week outside in the summer?,Turtle_Queen,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3e4i2x/how_should_i_modify_my_skin_cleansing_routine_if/,"I work as an intern at a botanic garden. It's the summer, so that means I SWEAT. For forty hours a week. I have not modified my routine much - I wash my face in the shower three times. 

The first two times I wash, I use Clean &amp; Clear foaming facial cleanser (oil free). I do this so that I can wash off the physical film of dirt and sweat off of my face. 

The third time I wash, I use Clean &amp; Clear benzoyl peroxide cream cleanser. It doesn't sud; I use it to prevent acne (and treat a few pimples, when they happen). 

Once out of the shower, I moisturize with Aveeno ""positively radiant"" daily moisturizer, SPF 15. 

But that's it; I do nothing to my face after waking up in the morning. So here are my questions:


1) Am I washing too much? Not enough? Just right?
2) If I choose to use the OCM, do I need to wash my face first to get off the grime? Or will the oil do that? And should I just use my hands? (As of right now, I only have baby oil.)
3) Is there a moisturizer (besides CeraVe in the tub) that will really help when it comes to rehydrating my skin? Thus far, my skin has only really accepted the Aveeno moisturizer, but it may not be enough for daily moisture.


I'm starting to think that I may need to introduce much more moisture into my face's life - it's not that I'm breaking out, per se, but (ironically), now that I don't have layers of creamy foundation ""protecting"" my skin, I'm pretty sure that the sun is drying out my face perhaps too much. 


Also - I have Elta MD SPF 40 that I use on my face every day; normally I reapply halfway through the day. Should I be doing it more often?

Skincare Addiction has helped me *so much* this past year - not only in terms of aesthetics (but **wow** has it helped with that) but also in terms of me learning how to love, be kind to, and be gentle with my skin, in any condition.

Thank you so much in advance! Please let me know if any of the above was not clear. "
3e4ibq,2,2015-07-21,Should I take a semester off?,lordoftheAndals,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3e4ibq/should_i_take_a_semester_off/,"Hello, I'm currently in a rut. I'm currently a sophomore-&gt;junior (technically a senior by credit) in engineering. I did awful sophomore year which brought my GPA down to a 2.8 and my parents decided that my wanton destruction of my academic career was not worth financing so they said they'd cut me off. I'm also supposed to move out coming the start of Fall semester this year.

I currently intern at a certain firm making about 3600 a month for the summer. My boss and overseers love me I guess because of the various projects I was able to complete and push into next stage and said that they'd look into getting me hired for the fall semester (they don't know my situation),
I have a couple potential plans but I'm not sure which to execute: 

a) I go back to school. It's about 10,000 a semester after scholarships and subsidized loans (my parents make too much money for me to be considered for a loan and pretty much told me to 'fuck off' when I asked them to cosign for a private loan). My parents said that they'd pay for my tuition costs based on my grades (A=100%, B=75%,C=50%) because apparently they don't expect me to ever become successful as is. That would leave about 5000 I'd pay a semester.
After tax, I'd have made about 12000 over the summer so I'd be able to pay off a year of classes before having to finance myself over next summer. (I'm still living with my parents for this summer)

b) I continue to work with 3600 a month over the next semester and take online courses that I'll get easy As in (none of my core engineering classes though). I'll end up with about 7-8 months of experience and pay.
However this will be offset by my costs of living which are about 700 an apartment, I'll need to buy a car and get insurance for it, get gas and maybe 200 a month on food. So by the end of each month I'll have stockpiled 2100 a month. This doesn't include cost of a car or insurance which I have no idea about.
This leaves me about $25,000 dollars by the beginning of the spring semester.
Whoa. Writing this post made me realize that Plan B might actually be the best option.
I'd love feedback into how my logic works or whether there are things missing or which option you guys think is better.

Thanks!"

3e4n7m,19,2015-07-21,My friend just passed away from cancer,civilthebest,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/3e4n7m/my_friend_just_passed_away_from_cancer/,"I started college at 21 so I was a bit late to the game. I didn't know what was going on, all I had was the discipline I learned from the military and the schedule I got from Registrar. My friend, David, could see that I was lost as to what i was supposed to be doing, so he helped me out. He introduced me to his circle of friends, and pretty soon I made a strong friend circle. It was thanks to him that I got on track - didn't lose any time on classes, he showed me the ropes to becoming a good engineer because experience is all that matters. He got me the internships, the contacts.

He never told me about his cancer up till recently. I spent the last week and half visiting him in the hospital- he didn't have many visitors. When I got the courage to ask him why - he said he didn't want to be a bother to anyone. He knew everyone reacted to sickness differently - some pull away, some cry - he didn't want to see any of it. It's only now that I know he didn't reach out because he was scared. He didn't know how many people in his life cared for him and he didn't want to find out.

He cried his eyes out one day about his girlfriend cheating on him a few years back. He never got over it - he just kept it in and let it eat him alive. He knew it wasn't his fault but he always assumed there was something he could have done better.

He then cried his eyes out about his 'best friend'. The one who he helped pay for her food, her rent, her plane tickets to go to Europe, her apartment deposit, her mess ups, her tickets. The 'best friend' who couldn't live without her husband and they were so in love that he just had to be there with her even though it was financially irresponsible. It was David that played the role that her husband was supposed to play - it wasn't his responsibility to take care of her. I don't know why David got involved, that was David's choice. But you don't fucking leave him alone in the dark when he falls to the darkest moment. I'm sure she was the first one David told when he got diagnosed with cancer. I never saw her name on the visitors list. And all David did was cry about angrily messaging her during one of his pain moments from chemo about ending the friendship. He was sorry he did. God knows how many other people he helped, but he never contacted anybody after that incident with his 'best friend'. I only found out because I kept on poking my nose in his business.

I'm angry that David is gone. Because today I realize how many other good people like him out there that must be dying. And I hate it when good people are treated like shit. Without loyalty there is nothing to believe in this world. Maybe I'm a biased because I'm military. 

I miss you David. Thank you for showing me the ropes. "
3e4sm8,2,2015-07-21,I [20 M] want my Ex GF [19 F] back after 7 months apart.,lovesick_man,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e4sm8/i_20_m_want_my_ex_gf_19_f_back_after_7_months/,"**Edit: I know someone is gonna say forget about her. I hear you, but I'm not looking for advice on whether I should move on or not.  I'm looking for advice on how to win her back or figure out how she really feels so I can move on.**

So we broke up about 7 months ago after dating a year and a half. The details of the break up and why it happened is pretty complicated so I'll highlight the main points. I broke it off with her because my family dislikes her (which was tearing me apart hearing both sides complain about the other), we were both immature for what we wanted (to eventually get married), and because I was going through personal issues (depression, anxiety, etc). I DID NOT break up with her because I did not love her. I am DEEPLY in love with her.

Post Breakup she ignored me and essentially was super rude to me if I even tried to talk to her, which I do deserve. So I split off from our mutual friend group and found another set of friends far away from her. We didn't really speak or see each other at all until summer rolled around at the end of May since we both have an internship at a large tech company. 

Summer just beginning, and I see her for the first time. now granted she's been hurting this whole time and is bitter towards me and I'm torn up because I still love her and have been apart from her for so long. We started talking again and then there were a couple emotional conversations over the phone about how I've been torn up and she talked about the fact she didn't want a boyfriend right now. So it hurts me to much that I stop talking to her fro a few weeks. 

Fast forward a few weeks, I decide I want to meet up with her and talk with her and really let her know I still love her. She agrees to meet to talk, but then I see her being all flirty with this guy. I text her asking if they were a thing to which she replied ""we kind of are, but I'm unsure about alot of things with him"" to which I respond ""oh okay, nvm I don't think it's a good idea to meet up anymore"" since I wanted to avoid drama. Her reply to that was ""I still want to here what you have to say"". At this point I think there is hope, so I agree. We eventually meet up and I pour my soul out to her about how much I love her and how I spent a lot of time working on myself to fix things. In the beginning of the conversation she immediately said she didn't want to get back together with me right now and I said I didn't want to just get back together I wanted to take her on dates and stuff first, and by the end of the conversation she said she was more open to the idea of it now and that after summer back at school she ""wouldn't be opposed to a date"", but that she just wants to be friends right now.

Pretty much everyone in my life when I explained the situation to them said she chose a summer fling instead of me and so she isn't even worth it. It's been really hard for me because I am very deeply in love with her, and I don't want to give up and it's just not in my heart to do so.

So I've been trying to be friends with her, but at the same time I told her I wasn't going to hide my feelings for her or motive for being her friend (to eventually get back with her). I've been trying to make an effort to talk to her or hang out with her, such as sparking conversation or I invited her to come bowling with some friends.

She says she doesn't have any romantic feelings for me anymore but I don't think that is true and she seems to be sending mixed signals for example she said ""remember that one time you ran across campus to grab my project for me because I forgot it and was freaking out"" to which I replied ""Yeah, I'd do anything for you"" and she responded ""Why are you so sweet."" or when I told her no one else will love you more than I do, she AGREES. Then at the same time she's either distant or indifferent or even ignores me sometimes. She starts the conversation sometimes and wanted to get coffee again sometime but then she never tried to setup and actual time. 

It seems to be she went from no, to maybe, to I have no romantic feelings for you, to saying she has ""mixed"" feelings for me. My gut tells me she just pushed those feelings she had for me way deep down. I also don't understand why she is with the guy when they both know it won't last for the summer. And what would the 5 week difference between now and being back at school be for her not to even want to go on a date now. 

I'm so confused to the point that it's driving me crazy. I just want her back for good and some of the things she says and does contradicts other things.
   
**tl;dr**: Essentially, I broke with my Ex but not because I didn't love her. 7 months later I try to get back with her. She doesn't even want to try going on a date until after summer is over and she's seeing another guy only for the summer. She appears to have very mixed feelings or is just stringing me along. What should I be doing to either win her back or at least figure out how she really feels?"
3e5bht,3,2015-07-21,Looking for advice about taking time off from law school,lawschooldep,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/3e5bht/looking_for_advice_about_taking_time_off_from_law/,"Hey All, 

I'm really hoping that you can help me with some advice/perspective. I just finished my first year of law school at one of (HYS) and right now I'm hating my life. 

I came into law school with a very specific career goal - I'd done a lot of research into the types of organizations that did that work and knew all about them before starting law school. I ended up getting a 1L internship at one of those organizations. Typically, these organizations take attorneys after they have a few years of law firm experience so my plan was always to go to a firm for a few years and then transfer over to this type of organization. 

The problem? I hate it. I really don't like the work that I find myself doing day-to-day and dread going in every day. In addition, I've never felt worse about myself professional. I've failed at or been rejected from everything that I've tried to do since I started law school. I did fine grade wise (I'm above median for my class) but I'm still not used to it. I've always struggled with being insecure and I feel like this year has me feeling worse about myself than I ever have before. I came to law school thinking I'd be able to compete and would be able to do a lot of different things and I'm just finding that that's not the case. I'm upset about that. But then, I'm also upset about the fact that I'm having trouble coping with being a ""mediocre"" student. I've always thought of myself as the type of person who is motivated my rejection to just try harder next time and right now I'm just feeling like there's no point. 

I know this probably sounds like a pretty pathetic problem to some of you but it feels very real to me. I've considered that I may be getting depressed and am planning on seeing someone about how I'm feeling if I don't start to see a turnaround soon. I have to drag myself out of bed in the morning, I have absolutely no energy, and I cry every single day. I just don't know what to do. 

I'm seriously regretting coming to law school and a lot of the time I find myself wishing for my old life back, before I quit my job and moved away from all of my friends for school. I feel like I was in a really good place and all I've done over the past year is put myself in a much worse place professionally. I'm at a complete loss about what to do, seeing as I don't like the type of work that I came to law school to do, and I'm scared of waking up in 10 years working a crappy legal job that I hate and finding no joy in my professional life. 

To wrap up this post, I've been thinking about taking a leave of absence for a year, finding a job, and just working for a year while I figure all of this out. I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with taking a leave of absence for these types of reasons, what they did for the year, how their law school dealt with it, and if it helped you. 

Thanks so much for your help and for reading. "
3e5p2k,1,2015-07-21,[Request] Motivate me to pursue medical school,[deleted],motivateme,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivateme/comments/3e5p2k/request_motivate_me_to_pursue_medical_school/,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible...

I was an honors student in high school. 3.8 GPA, Student Body President. Popular, and always had friends. During senior year, I didn't get into my dream school (UCLA). To make matters worse, I didn't make it into the next 8 ""dream"" schools I had. I was rejected by every single school I wanted to get into. I was absolutely heartbroken and crushed. I saw all of my friends get into their dream schools. The girl that I was dating at the time got into Stanford. She broke up with me after the summer. 

It was like my life suddenly changed 180 degrees overnight. My friends stopped including me in their hangouts. I could feel their pity...their changing thoughts about me. My family stopped bragging about me to relatives. Everyone stopped caring about what I did or what I became. I remember my dad walked into my room and said that he was disappointed in me and he didn't know what to do with me (I'm asian...if that explains things).

What the hell happened? Did I die and end up in some alternate reality? This wasn't the way things were supposed to go. I didn't work day and night for this to happen. What the fuck happened? 

I ended up attending a safety school. I didn't fit in. I became extremely lethargic and depressed. I made some friends and lost some friends. I stopped attending classes and was put on probation. 

I felt like I was walking through a dream. Some kind of a spiral...and for some reason, I didn't stop myself from doing deeper. 

I graduated a few months ago and barely scraped by with a 2.2 GPA with a liberal arts degree. I had a few internships, but nothing special. I was absolutely dead inside. 

Eventually, I experienced the freedom of a college graduate. It was more of the same. My parents didn't really talk to me. No friends called me to hang out. My brother leaves me alone (he used to look up to me), and just spends time with his buddies. I spent a lot of days just browsing youtube on the internet and taking naps throughout the day. But something changed. 

One day, I watched a video of a surgeon saving the life of one of his patients. It was a transplant operation. It was absolutely magical. The way he cut open the body, handled the organs...saved that man's life. I was awe-struck. In the past 4 years where I felt like I was drifting, suddenly, it felt like I woke up. Whatever ambition I had suddenly sprouted. I knew what I wanted to become. 

I did everything I could after that. I talked to relatives who were in the health profession. I went around the city and conducted interviews with local surgeons and physicians. I talked with my pre-med advisor and expressed my interest. For the first time in a very long time...I wanted something. I wanted something so badly. 

But of course, mistakes have a way of catching up to you. Everyone in the medical school admissions office laughed at me. One lady actually literally laughed when she saw my transcript. There was no way I was going to get in, she laughed. There is just simply no way. I was about to protest...but she gave me brochures which showed average scores and GPAs. Basically, she said, it's best you don't think about it. 

My pre-health advisor said that I should pursue perhaps a lateral profession to surgery. Maybe a clinic staffer or some kind of medical tech position. I said no. I spent the last 3 years convincing myself that I could work IT for a company. When I got the internship, I felt more dead than I did at school. To me, working alongside someone who achieved something I wanted would be exactly like the moment when my girlfriend opened her Stanford acceptance letter and I opened my rejection email. 

So this is really where I am right now. I'm a guy desperately wishing he could time travel back and fix his mistakes. I'm a guy wishing that he would've worked harder than he did in school. 

Isn't it amazing that the choices someone makes when he's 19 can affect the trajectory of his entire adult life? It's more amazing to me that you can't 'erase' your college GPA. It's just numbers and classes. I didn't kill anyone and end up in prison. How come there isn't a second chance? 

Anyways...I came here to find advice. To find someone to kick me into action...or to find someone who can say something. Anything. There is no one in my life right now who will tell me anything positive. 

To be clear...I know how ridiculous I sound. I know how absolutely fucking stupid it must sound to someone who works in the medical industry for a college idiot to even utter that he wants to enter into the upper echelons of his profession. Even I feel ridiculous sometimes. I'd laugh at myself. But every time that laugh dies off, I still feel the longing in my chest. 

Thanks,
""David""

My girlfriend is about halfway through her undergrad chemE degree at a solid program (3 semesters remaining, this is her second degree, she also has a math BS) and will be finishing up classes with around a 3.55 GPA this summer. The problem is she is an international student studying in the US on student visa....

From what she tells me, it is very difficult to secure a co-op, let alone a job after graduation. She seems to be stuck in a catch-22 where she needs real-world experience to convince a manager to hire her in spite of her alien status...but her alien status is preventing her from accumulating any co-op experience...She told me some companies straight up tell you that you don't have a shot with them, despite doing relatively well, as they do not sponsor H1B visas...All she wants is a 9-5 job, making about 60K and a 50/50 split between field work and office work...

Is there anyone here who has gone through the same sort of situation and has any tips or advice from personal experiences? My gf is working extremely hard to maintain her solid GPA and she is also doing research with a big-wig professor in order to try to get published as well. However, she still feels an immense pressure to secure an employment opportunity.

Should she join student groups/chemE groups in the fall semester? Does participating on sports teams have any appreciable impact in the job hunt? Should she focus on networking? I suggested volunteering/doing an unpaid internship type gig where she could at least sacrifice the pay in order to have a letter of recommendation/slot on her resume with work experience, but I dont know how feasible that is....I personally have no experience with engineering and the preparation that goes into landing a job is foreign to me.

I appreciate any and all help!

Best wishes."

He did really well, he was on law review and finished in the top 10% of his class. The school he went to isn't on the top 100 list of law schools but it still has a good reputation. His schools rules when he attended didn't let students intern at private practices and make the connections they would need to have a job after graduation, his internship was with the navy.

The problem is he's applied for hundreds of jobs, and he either doesn't get called back or gets super close then they find someone with more experience.  I'm starting to worry about him. He's still sweet to me and we're doing well. But he's becoming more and more dejected as time goes on and I'm starting to get worried. I don't know what to do or how to help him. He's such hard worker so I think its a major blow to his confidence to not have a job. What can I do to help him?

   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend went to law school and (doesn't like the idea of chasing ambulances) I need advice on how to help/ best support him until he can get a job and I welcome suggestions on what he should do to find one.

1. I'm away from my derby team. I skate some, but it's not nearly the same AT ALL. I'm afraid I lost some good progress. I did go to a few local team's practices, but they're on break now (and it wasn't THAT local).

2. I've been able to get myself to lift most days (though I've been skipping my ab work). I'm on a forced deload on lower body though due to hurting my hip and lower body days basically make me cry in frustration.

3. I'm not totally sure if I can run, so I haven't done any cardio at all because it just fucking bores me.

3e5x7z,2,2015-07-22,Should I quit or should I stick it out?,Blonde_Ideas,AskDad,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDad/comments/3e5x7z/should_i_quit_or_should_i_stick_it_out/,"So this may be a bit long. PREFACE: I don't have a real dad figure. Bio dad died when I was a baby. Step dad refuses to talk to me due to a long history and disagreements. Foster dad and I didn't really connect well. So here I am asking internet fathers for advice. 


This was supposed to be my career. I am 19 working as a dental assistant at a large dental company, and got this job exactly a year ago today. I thought I was so lucky to have been able to skip the college and student loans and start my career with on the job training. They were willing to pay me while they trained me, and they even had a doctor who was certified to teach full courses and get me certified in different things. I am thankful and appreciate all that they have done for me in training me and basically giving me a shot in life since I was barely making it on my own after moving out at 17. 

The problems with this company however started to show through. As I started learning more I started realizing that things I had been taught and things I had seen others doing were not exactly sterile or ethical. I found out we had been sterilizing wrong and that at least one manager knew. I also learned that I wasn't taught proper infection control. They are often grabbing out of drawers with dirty gloves, not changing barriers with each patient. I kept chalking this up to the fact that the company is primarily run and operated by Koreans who may be unaware. This company is also rather new &lt;7yrs. On top of that there is issues with being paid properly or on time. Actually having workmans comp claims paid. They keep hiring new trainees or letting interns work for us and that causes much more issues with cleanliness as no one is trained very well before shoved into the clinic. They expect everyone to learn as we go. This doesn't work so well because now everything is contaminated. 

They also have issues with Koreans &gt; everyone else. If you are Korean you will probably be manager within 6 months. If your not... They'll make a couple non-Koreans managers for appearance only. They don't actually get to do anything besides sign documents. They can't make an decisions without talking to a Korean manager first. 

Lately a lot of people have quit and have made a fuss about the things we have been doing. This has led to them trying to correct things in terms of sterilizing but it's not working very well. The interns and trainees are still not trained and keep contaminating everything. Doctors are too stuck in their ways to remember that they can't do the things they used to get away with. I'm pretty sure I'm getting underpaid but I know there is good chance of getting raises in the future so long as I bow my head and do as I'm told. 

They started to cross train me for the front desk and I really began to enjoy it. I feel like being a people person I am much better suited for front desk. However management has decided to hire and train a new girl for front desk instead of me for whatever reason. I have asked for a change of position a couple times. 

The owner of the company is very very smart but very much an asshole. Last February he took 6 of the staff all the way to Bangladesh on his dime to work for a week to run a not for profit dental clinic down there. He plans on taking another 6 again this October/November. I would love to go but I don't know if I can stick it out this long. 

I feel like I owe them for all the training and that maybe I should stick it out and help them to change and be a great company. But all the managers currently there they have dedicated their entire lives to this company working 14-16 hr days 5 days a week plus meetings and trainings on weekends. If everything works out like the owner wants it to we will go from 6 stores to over 100. This also gives me the opportunity to ""be there from the beginning"" and even a good shot at regional or district manager. But is it worth it? I spend my weeks waiting for the weekend instead of enjoying myself. 

Part of me feels like if I leave another company will have its own set of problems and issues. That there will always be parts of every job that I hate. I've discussed all these things with my managers and one even told me if I go somewhere else it'll be worse. (Maybe trying to convince me not to go or..?) I'm trying to be as unbiased as I can with this long explanation but it's not working out very well. Haha. Anyways; 

Dad what do I do? 

TLDR; company is in bad shape ethically. Trying to change. Stick it out and have a shot at becoming a regional or district manager or leave?"
3e5xqj,2,2015-07-22,[PI] Magnets? - upvotedcontest,bobbathehutt,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3e5xqj/pi_magnets_upvotedcontest/,"Within five minutes I wondered why I even bothered to show up.  Trent had been a close friend through high school and into college but our paths separated quickly in the late 1980s.  He made his first million through death, in this case his grandfather's.  The next ten came from shrewd real estate deals and his half a billion was part of the buyout by AOL.  By '95 he was closing in on a cool billion and his third wife.  Trent managed to jump on the internet near the beginning and built a company that created and sold domain names.  It seemed stupid at the time but I damn near killed myself when his name was in the paper next to nine zeroes.  I had a chance to be a part of that initial company and he promised me stock shares as partial payment.  My wife, seven months pregnant at the time, was against the investment of our money and my time.  So, I passed on a chance at millions.

As the main course arrived, we talked about old friends like Neal Burbank and Red Carr.  Trent loved gossip and he seemed to know it all.

""Neal killed himself last month.  He mishandled some major deals and the courts were on his trail.  Red landed in prison for his role and I figure he will suffer a similar fate.""  His hands tore at a lobster's red shell and he dripped butter all over the table.  He didn't flinch as he spoke of the demise of his two largest business partners.

""But, I'm not here to talk about the past Simon.  I'm here for the future.""  He snapped his fingers and a nearby assistant or intern brought over an easel with a rendering of a fridge on it.

""This here is my next big move.  I lost a lot in Neal's Ponzi scheme and Red's poor choice of real estate.  This here,"" he pointed a sloppy finger at the easel, ""is my ticket back to the top.""

""A fridge?"" I asked.  It seemed like an odd item to pin your wealth on.

""No, not the fridge.  The magnets!""  He reached over and flipped to the next page.  On it was a similar fridge to the first but it was now covered in various magnets.  Some were ads for pizza joints and others were calendars with local lawyers faces plastered in the corner.  From there Trent launched into a well prepared demonstration of just how valuable magnets were and how everyone would want these particular magnets.  His assistant brought out samples and different metallic objects for me to try them on.  They were magnets, plain and simple. 

Magnets?

""Trent, I don't understand.  These are just magnets.  What are you asking for?""

Turns out he needed money.  Not mine of course but whatever I could scrounge from the locals.  As mayor I knew everyone in Rose Brier and he figured that I could sway the wealthier residents to join in on his magnet venture.  He wanted me as his new middle man, a fall guy.  If he could add a politician to his pocketbook, especially one who was well respected like me, he could rake in millions from the high class families who had known him since he was a child.
He didn't fight me as I left, he was the type to give you one chance and then move on.  I knew better than to meet with him but curiosity got the best of me.  As I unlocked my car I looked back at his estate and wondered what was wrong with him.  

Magnets?  

My car fired up on the fourth attempt and I began the journey back to suburbia.  My heart longed for what Trent had but this was ridiculous.  Perhaps the rumors were true and he had lost everything, including his marbles.  But, in the back of my mind, I also considered the chance that I could have just drove away from the last real chance of my life.  All I knew as I pulled into my driveway was that the suicide attempt from missing this chance wouldn't end like it had in '95.

I just graduated from a good University with my masters in accounting. I worked throughout college, mostly in retail, and I also managed to get 2 internships under my belt - one in tax and one in audit.

I've been asking them to register their company (for a service) for the past few weeks, but they don't seem any closer to completing that today compared to a few weeks ago. I have to submit my preliminary application today, and I'm not even sure if my school will accept my application with missing information.

I don't understand... this company seemed so great in the beginning, but when people started to leave, maybe that should have been a red flag. But everyone is so friendly, the perks are great, and the location is super convenient. I don't even hate myself after the workday is over. I probably tried to convince myself that people left since they were at a certain part of their career progression. Even my supervisor told me that the previous interns left for better opportunities. Why did I stay? Why did I stop my job search? When I'm STILL an intern 3 months after the end date of my 6 month part-time internship was up, why didn't that ring alarms in my head?

All I can think of at this point are all the things that I would have done differently. I should have kept searching for opportunities even after I got this job. I should have known that a part time job with no overtime is really hard to live on. I shouldn't have spent my 2/5 free days a week sleeping in, and browsing reddit/youtube. I shouldn't have listened to my parents and double majored in engineering as well. Screw your traditional gender roles.

I really don't want to go back home to my home country and deal with my mom. All she does is compare me to other people and constantly find ways to put me down. All she does is get mad at me for not listening to her even though she may be wrong. I know she means well but after 4 years of independent living, suppressing my wants and feelings to satisfy my mom is going to be absolute crap.

I really don't want to go back home because that's where I had a driver sexually assault me. I didn't know better, or what the concept of sex even was, but I've been trying to avoid all contact with him. No one knows, and he probably still works for my mom. I don't think I'll ever tell anyone I know.

I really don't want to go back home because I would feel like I've failed as a person. It's depressing to see people you know succeed while you ""don't"". Why is it so hard to find a decent full time job when you don't have connections? 

I don't know what to do. I could enroll in classes to get a new student visa, but there is no way I could afford international prices. I wish one out of all the job applications I've sent out would get back to me, but even then they probably wouldn't be able to employ me in time. Or maybe, I wish my company could just skip all the bureaucracy and sign up for that service tomorrow.

I don't know. Thanks for reading.

3e6dve,28,2015-07-22,"Two months ago, I was released from the psych ward. This is how I landed myself there in the first place.",throwawayfordays22,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3e6dve/two_months_ago_i_was_released_from_the_psych_ward/,"The train was arriving in five minutes.  I stepped off the escalator and onto the platform, thirty or forty feet above the ground.  The platform had a nice view of the rush hour congestion.  I stared at the traffic for a bit.  All of those people below me had a reason to be where they were- they were all headed somewhere.  They all knew what lead them to enter their cars.  Yet, I had no idea what I was doing at all.  I had no idea why I packed my medication with me if I had no intentions of taking them.  I had no idea why I texted my boyfriend begging him for help.  I certainly had no idea why I was overlooking the highway, standing on a platform, prepared to die.

Four minutes.

I had everything going for me, or so I thought.  I had internships and a 3.5 GPA at a great university.  I had family and friends who loved me, and a new boyfriend who displayed interest in me, even though I told him I wasn’t worth it.  I was even happy.  At the very least, I thought I was happy; rather, I couldn’t think of a reason as to why I might not be.

Three minutes.

A bright lining on the platform warned commuters to beware of the gap below; the tracks lie there, and once you’re stuck down there, there’s no way back onto the platform.  I tiptoed along the voluntary barrier between the platform and the tracks.  I began to tear up and sniffle, and I heard a voice call out to me.

“Excuse me, miss.”  I looked up to find a middle-aged man in a suit and a yellow tie approaching me.  He looked as though he was returning from a day of work- many people who travel through my town are commuting to or from Manhattan.  “When is the train heading East expected to arrive?”

“Oh…it should be here in around two minutes,” I replied softly, looking up at the LED screen behind me.  I chuckled a bit.  “They display the arrival times on that screen over there.”

I bet he knew exactly what I was up to.  What tourist travels through Long Island in business attire on a Tuesday?  He cared enough to distract me, but I suppose he didn’t know how to approach the subject.  People always tend to avoid that subject- they don’t want to be involved, but they still want to find a solution.  You can’t have it both ways.  He certainly didn’t- his efforts were ineffective.

Sixty seconds.

A light approached me, getting brighter as it gets closer.  A final tear flowed down my face, and I took a deep breath, bracing myself for the blow.  Suddenly, my pocket obnoxiously began to vibrate, screeching the lyrics of my favorite My Chemical Romance chorus:

“Give me a shot to remember, and you can take all the pain away from me…”

I fumbled for my phone, completely forgetting that I had texted my boyfriend just a few minutes earlier.  Meanwhile, the light grew brighter and brighter, until it was in my face, swishing by me.  My hair blew in the wind, and I stared at the screen of my phone.  After the train conductor announced his arrival, I picked up.

“Joe, you saved my life.” 

“Where are you? You told me to meet you at the train station.”

“Yeah, I’m here. I’m on the platform.”

“Why are you up on the platform?” Silence.  “Get the fuck down from there, right now.”

I obeyed, running down the stairs and into his car, where I began to hyperventilate.  He drove off, and we tried to forget what had just happened. Two nights later, I would recall the events to my therapist.  He wouldn’t comprehend what lead me to do that- and at the time, neither would I.

3e6jzi,7,2015-07-22,[warning: pretty darn long] i've been working at my dream job for a little over a week now and i honestly couldn't be happier,hoponthe,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/3e6jzi/warning_pretty_darn_long_ive_been_working_at_my/,"my life has been a little hectic for the last year or two. between some really rocky relationships and some really shitty, depressing jobs, i had a hard time. i dealt with a lot of depression and self-hatred, and not even for particularly good money.

so about 9 months ago, i decided i'd had enough. i decided it was time to pursue my dreams. i've always wanted to be a personal trainer. my life has revolved around the gym for the better part of the last 5 years. there's nothing that i'm more passionate about in life, it's just what i've always loved. i've got aspirations to be a competitive powerlifter some day, i'm one of maybe 3 active moderators in /r/bodybuilding, and i spend many hours every day either reading or talking about lifting. it fascinates me to no end. there aren't many things that feel better to me than breaking a personal record of mine in the gym. if i could choose between adding 15 pounds to my squat or 3 hours of sex, i'd choose the squats every time. so that should give you an idea of how passionate i am about it. but when i graduated high school, my mom discouraged me. she had worked in a gym as an accountant for a few years, and the trainers didn't make very much money at that particular gym. she was convinced that i'd never make a good living being a personal trainer, and that if i wanted to be successful i needed to go to college and get a degree (you don't need a degree to be a personal trainer). at the time i didn't know better, so i went with my mom's advice and i went to college. and i fucking hated it. i was miserable, i didn't want to be there, i was majoring in something i didn't really care about, it was just horrible. after a year of that, i left and just started working instead. i worked at a grocery store for a while, and then a restaurant. neither were particularly exciting jobs, and i don't really dislike the robotic, somewhat anonymous feel to the jobs. these are people i'm likely to never see again, and my entire job is delivering a script to them to ensure that the transaction goes as desired. i was unhappy in both jobs. but my mom was still pushing me to go to college, so i did. again.

it was another miserable failure. i tried another major, and still hated it. i didn't do well, and i wasted my mom's money. soon after, i moved away to a different city a few hours away. i'd been living on my own most of this time anyway, but i thought a change of scenery would make things better. it didn't. i had transferred restaurants from one city to the other. this one was busier and the tips were worse, so not only was i more stressed at work, i was also making less money. i said ""fuck it"" and did some research and came to find that the median personal trainer's salary is 55 thousand dollars. 55 THOUSAND. my mom had me convinced i could only make 20k a year. i called her up and showed her, and she finally caved. she helped me pay for my certification because i couldn't do it on my own. a few months later i quit my job and moved back home to work on my studying and focus on getting a job in a gym.

it took me 6 months of studying and one terrifying test to get it. i still remember it clear as day- the organization that i went through to get my certification (NASM, one of the few certifications that are accepted by most gyms nationwide) went through another organization to do their testing. so, they don't have dedicated buildings for it. instead, they have different testing sites in basically every state that you can travel to to take the tests. and a lot of them are in odd locations. mine happened to be a small regional airport that was sort of laid out like a strip mall, and it was 40 minutes away from home. i went into this tiny shop that sells shirts and trinkets for pilots. there was a bumper sticker that said ""my other car is a cessna"" or something like that. i went in this back room and started on this little old computer, and took probably the hardest test of my life. i was terrified that i was going to fail, even though i knew the material pretty well. when i finished, i went out and asked the guy who proctored the test if i passed. he checked in his computer, blocking my view of it, and took a minute. i was shaking this whole time. he told me i passed, and a huge wave of relief washed over me. i quietly said thank you, took the paper that he printed out for me, and walked out the door. i sat in my car, still unsure if this was reality or a dream. it came to me when i read what the paper said. i don't remember the details of it, but is said ""/u/hoponthe, congratulations, you have **passed** the NASM CPT exam!"" or something like that, and when i read it... i just started crying. sobbing, really.

that was one of the happiest moments of my life. this was the beginning of the next step of my life. i'd watched all my friends graduate college and enter their careers, and there i was, 21 and alone, working in a shitty restaurant making shitty money while everyone else around me was happy and living great lives. i felt like everything i had done up to that point in my life was just wrong. and when i quit my job, i thought had a vague idea of what it would feel like to be at this point, but i had not a single clue. it was pure joy, with an added dash of relief and a dollop of raw excitement. i could start working in the field that i love. for the first time in years, i felt really proud of myself. and i couldn't stop crying. like, really, i couldn't. i called my mom and told her the good news, crying the whole time. and then i drove home, which as i mentioned was 40 minutes away. i didn't stop crying until i'd been home for about 15 minutes. i thought i knew before that day what tears of joy were, but boy was i wrong.

of course, being certified was no guarantee of a job. the program i went through had an internship program, so i took advantage of it and got myself an 80 hour internship at the gym i had wanted to work at, and i started about 2 weeks after getting certified. i thought it went pretty well, but after the internship, i never got a call back from them. i don't know what i did wrong, but i was pretty crushed.

i spent the next 2 months and change applying at every gym in my city, which has a population of around 50-60 thousand, so.. decent, but not big enough that there are a ton of gyms. there were maybe 3 openings in the whole city, and most of them were for front desk positions. i figured whatever, get my foot in the door. but nope, no one called. i started getting desperate and applying for jobs that weren't even related to fitness. stockroom jobs, customer service jobs, all of it. no calls. i called these places, i stopped in and introduced myself to managers, dropped off resumes, etc. etc. but no calls back.

about 4 weeks ago, i got an interview for a job at planet fitness (which, if you're into the gym culture, you know is a joke of a gym). i figured whatever if i get into the industry that at least gives me a head start. but they wanted a front desk person as well. foot in the door and all that, but i can't say i wasn't disappointed. i nailed the interview, but a week later and i hadn't heard back from them. so i chalked that one up as a loss.

one day, while i was doing yard work for my mom at home, just digging up some grass so she could put in a garden, i got a call. my phone was off to the side so i didn't get to it until a second too late, so i listened to the voicemail. it was a personal training director from an LA fitness (which, if you're into the gym culture, you know is *not* a joke of a gym), saying they had a trainer quit on them with no notice and wanted to schedule me for an interview. 

so i called him back, and he asked if i was able to come in that day. i said yeah, give me an hour and a half and i'll be there. 

so here i am. it's almost noon in july in florida. it's probably 95 degrees with a heat index of 110, and i've been digging with a shovel for 2 hours. i'm covered in dirt and sweat, and i fucking stink. i run to the bathroom, jump in the shower, clean fucking everything, and jump out. i put on some nice pants and a button-down shirt, my nice shoes, a belt, get my hair done up all fancy, and make sure my teeth are shiny, i'm groomed nicely, and that i smell good, and i leave.

the interview goes well, but i'm pretty visibly nervous. they ask me all the standard questions, and then throw in some specific to the job. like you know, how would you train an old out of shape person vs a younger athletic person, ""tell me what's wrong with this squat"" kind of stuff. i nail those questions because shit that's my job to know that stuff. they tell me they like my personality and that they'll let me know by the end of the day, and i head home.

when i get there, my mom asks how the interview went and i say it went pretty okay. she's been hounding me about jobs for the last 3 months, and rightfully so, but it really stressed me out, so i'd been hesitant up to this point to tell her anything about my job search because she'd just go off on me about it. but she's really emotionally invested in this, obviously. i told her they'd let me know by the end of the day, and i retreated to my room for some alone time. at around 7, i get the call. 

he tells me that i have the job, and to come in tomorrow at 9 so we can get the paperwork done. again, tears. i'd spent the last 3 months broke and miserable because i couldn't find a job at all, much less in the field that i wanted to work in. and in the span of 7 hours, i got a call, an interview, and then a job. but not just *a* job, ***THE*** job. the one i'd always wanted. i took a few minutes to collect myself and casually strolled into the living room. my mom, who had already asked me 5 times by now, asks me again if i had heard anything. i said ""yeah, i got a call."" and she just gave me the death stare for not just coming out with it and said ""... and?""

""i got the job.""

at this point, she screamed. loud. and ran over to hug me. she was happy, to say the least. she wouldn't stop gushing for like a half an hour. she even tweeted about it. thanks, mom.

anyway, so we get all the paperwork and stuff done the next day, and it takes a few days for everything to process, so i started working the next monday. they said that since the person i'm replacing quit with no notice, they're gonna schedule some of her clients with me to start with, and they have a sales team that handles getting new clients, so i don't have to do it on my own. the perfect situation for me, really.

it was pretty slow at first. i only had 2 or 3 clients a day, and the sessions are only 25 minutes. but it's awesome. it doesn't even feel like a job to me. i've been helping out my friends for free for years, and i've never complained about it because it's just something that i love. and now i'm getting paid for it. and one of the cool parts is that even though i'm dealing with customers, it's nothing like being a cashier or a server. you develop relationships with these people. they tell you about their lives, and you can have real honest conversations with people and get to know them. it's really nice, actually. and you get to watch them reach their goals, get stronger, lose weight, whatever. it's really inspiring.

but now it's picking up. i've been getting more clients, basically one or two new ones every day. tomorrow is my 8th day on the job, and i have 7 clients almost all in a row. all my clients so far are saying that they like me, and that my workouts are tough. i have a couple that works with me 3 times a week, and they were with the trainer that i replaced before me. i've worked with them 4 times so far, and they told me on the second workout that i've been working them harder than the other trainer ever did, and they loved it.

and one of best parts is that i'm gonna be paid pretty damn decently for it. i started at 6 bucks a session, which equates to basically 12 bucks an hour. which isn't terrible, but it's not fantastic either. but if i work 40 hours a week, it's equatable to almost 25k a year, which is fine for someone my age, and then it also increases by 25 cents per session every 90 days, capping at 7.50 a session (so, 15 bucks an hour). but the cool thing is that my manager basically brought me on board with the idea that he wanted to promote me. LA fitness has two levels of personal trainers. there's just the regular personal trainers, which is me right now, and the ""master trainers"", which are the ones who really know what they're doing and stuff. whatever i'd have been making as a regular trainer, as a master trainer i'd double it. so, in 90 days, i could be making 25 bucks an hour. 

obviously i'm not anticipating that he promotes me as soon as i'm eligible (you need to work 90 days before you can be promoted), but every day i've come in he's been giving me tips on what i can do to be prepared for it and what i can do to get there. they previously had a staff of 4 regular trainers and 1 master, and he's planning on promoting 1 of those regular trainers, but the other 3 he doesn't want to promote at all. he wants to bring in a couple more regular trainers and promote 2 or 3 more people to master trainer, so i've got a good shot. my plan is just to work hard and smart, and do whatever it takes to get there.

oh, and i also get commissions. if i get people to sign up or add more training sessions, i get paid for that. a decent amount, too. so, if i get promoted and i sell people sessions and memberships, i could be making upwards of 60-65k a year. 

and all for hanging out in the gym and helping people reach their goals. there's literally nothing more i could want out of life. it doesn't even feel like a job. it really doesn't. it's perfect, and i couldn't be happier.

sorry for making you read all this, i'm just... really really happy. "

3e6uc7,3,2015-07-22,Why BI Tools? Pros vs Cons among the various tools?,Slutastalkajohn,qlikview,https://www.reddit.com/r/qlikview/comments/3e6uc7/why_bi_tools_pros_vs_cons_among_the_various_tools/,"Hey everyone.

I'm doing an intern at a software company where they have BI section where I'm positioned right now.
My personal area is in Computer Science where I use alot of Python and R in my day to day.

I've been working on two products in QlikSense which is the main plattform they're using now.
And right now everyone is on vaccation, however I've been tasked with investigating options for them to use outside of Qlik.


I can see from his 2012 notes when they were looking at other options from QlikView he had looked at:

* LogiXML
* Jasporsoft
* Actuate
* SpagoBI
* Pentaho Enterprise

Could you suggest some software I should look into?
Maybe if it's not too much to add, pros vs cons in various plattforms you have experience from?
And perhaps explain to me why not using a webapplication built in Java/Python etc would be suffiecent in BI (The company is heavilly geared into building webapplications for the customers)?
I personally feel I can do more with the data using R &amp; Python compared to try to build things in QlikSense (Where I feel limited and bit clueless what goes on at times)

I honestly don't understand why the use of BI softwares such as Tableu, Qlik etc etc, mind helping me out?"

Right now I'm wasting my time at the New York City Dept Of Health just calling people up and its really depressing because I've been here a year now...

I'm poor, and was an high school drop out because i spent so much time at home building up my knowledge in programming. Current I'm enrolled in Bronx Community College. 3.0 GPA 2-3 more semesters until I get my associates. I'm really not that fortunate but I can't complain.

Please help me turn my life around.

3e7frp,2,2015-07-22,Every Threshold Animation Studios horror story I could find on the internet.,rayword45,Foodfight,https://www.reddit.com/r/Foodfight/comments/3e7frp/every_threshold_animation_studios_horror_story_i/,"(Preface: if you're reading this and you moderate the fuckyeahfoodfight tumblr, approve my fucking post)

One day at work I got bored and tried to find as much TAS information/stories as I could on the internet, because a movie as outstanding as Foodfight! must have had the greatest production ever. Each testimonial I could find is separated by quotation marks.

""Silver Lining Czar

I actually worked on this film.

I signed on to the gig as a favor (and out of some sense of comradeship since a bunch of other misfits I favored were signing on) and promptly got laid off 2 weeks later along with about 20 other people because ""funding fell through from Threshold"".

I believe I blamed the management (Blake Darton? or something?) at the time but then again, they were most likely just a ""Michael"" to the whole situations ""Office"" so I don't fault that guy, he was actually pretty nice. Figure he was stuck in the same boat as some of the talent there. Man, I don't member the studios name... I think the studio was known for facial animation or some shit. We did tests using their software (I think they did work on Buttons, not Digital Domain &lt;--who've worked for and has always been top notch with me...man, I can't remember the studios name... they do facial stuff for games or something...) and the only test that got approved was mine and a couple other cats using hand-keyed animation. It was messy all around from the get go I guess...

Shit talking aside here's the thing, yes, Threshold was a monster, yes, there were rumors flying about how terrible the owner guy was, like were talking fake auditions for commercials and casting couch terrible type of shit, but everyone's missing the silver lining, because this is Hollywood and as much as animators like myself might hold some regard for it as an art form, it's a business. So while some may be upset that this Threshold guy is probably going to parlay the completion (as disastrous as the end result may be) into another film project, you have to look at the upside, because if this guy can do this(!?), why not me? Why not you? Right? So stop whining, go out there and do some terrible film of your own, they'll be plenty of bloggers waiting ;)""

""Matt Sullivan

I was working at Threshold back in 2001 and they were talking about this so-called ""film"" back then. The ""creators"" went out of their way to say it was strictly a money making device, thinking food companies would jump at the chance for free advertising.

Thank goodness even big business recognized garbage when they saw it.""

""tortured artist

I was unfortunately one of the abused artists working on the film from the dungeon of a studio. There is a certain producer/director/writer/hack with no talent who was the sole reason for this movie crashing and burning. He had no concept of how to direct animation and made us re-do stuff different ways that was DONE so many times I couldn't count. There were amazing talented artists working on graphics and animation in there, and everything that looked decent and true to the brand characters, he would change until it was beyond recognition from where it started in the worst possible way. I could go on and on all day. Every day was a new disaster brought on by incompetence on the part of the director. Meetings were a disaster and directed by the musings of a madman who also made me clean up his dog's diarrhea. I was hired to do one thing that I did very well and after some time I was switched at his direction out-of-the-blue for no reason other than pure whimsy, to do something completely different that I had no knowledge of how to do and I was given no training and had to figure it out myself. then he came 2 weeks later and asked me why I was doing such a crappy job compared to the specialists who have been doing it for years as their career. When I explained to him that this wasn't what I was hired to do and I had to learn from scratch with no help, he asked me what the difference was. Being the director, he should KNOW that difference, but I think in his mind, everyone who works in animation can do everything perfectly, from modeling, to texturing, rigging, lighting and animating - so he could randomly assign anyone to any job despite job titles and specialties and they would execute it perfectly. The result is that trailer, and probably less than an hour of footage that Threshold claims is a finished movie""

""Ethel Mertz

I saw this movie at a Threshold screening back when it was completed. Think about the worst animated film you've ever seen. It's a thousand times worse than that. It was an eye-stabbing experience from beginning to end. The great talent at Threshold isn't to blame for this. The directors and managers and anyone non-creative are solely to blame. I've heard stories of the incompetence and just sheer lack of knowledge when it comes to animation at the top of that company. It's sad.""

""Guest

I did some freelance for Threshold when they were ""developing"" that movie. The consensus was that the film would ""pay for itself millions of times over"" due to the commercial tie-ins. The development art was actually quite good ( as it was done by someone with real talent ) but boy oh boy, did those designs lose about 99% of their charm on the way to CG mediocrity-ville.

Also, this gets funded and ""developed"" for 10 years and I can't get a script made? No wonder the so many artists are ditching Hollywood for YouTube. If this is the best millions of dollars can produce....""

""Wannabe

I worked for this tool a few years ago. I say tool, because to use a things real name has power. Everyone can say what they want to about his valiant efforts, but he was a tourist completely uninterested in animation and only doing it to make a quick buck and because he thought it would be easy. He was a joke. The studio was a joke and I seriously doubt that his animators and other artist got ""paid well"" at all. It is this type of of poser that makes the animation ""business"" so hard to deal with these days. There's at least one at every studio.""

""Dead Inside. Just a Little.

Awesome!!! Rant time....

So I worked on this POS movie at a real ""classy"" (yeah i understand the irony in using POS and using the term classy in quotes btw) studio in santa monica called image metrics that laid off about 16 crew members or so about 2-4 weeks into ""production"" by some dipshit named... I want to say something Barton... Anyways, at that time, around 2006 I'm guessing (I blocked the precise dates from memory), they had just barely had the first sequence in digital animatic form, and the script wasn't even locked, despite years and years of ""pre-production work"". Look, every freelance artist and their mother knows or has a friend that knows someone that's worked on this, I'm not special. What is special about this production is exactly how it emphasizes just how amazingly far you can go with a shit, insanely corporate idea and how much money and time you can waste/grab if you play your cards right and completely disregard any artistic and moral obligation to making art.

I don't hate the creator of this, as pathetic as he's been described (fake casting calls to see hot chicks for non-existent commercial/film projects... really man? really?!?!?) or the companies involved though imagemetrics did screw the hell out of the people it brought on for this, I do resent the fact that every shitty thing you've ever heard about how ""hollywood"" people are, is sadly represented by this film.

I doubt this film will ever come out btw since from the segment i saw, the sexual innuendo was almost laughable until you understood some sick fuck (owner of Threshold I believe) was sitting there coming up with these ideas knowing full well it was intended for kids, then it just became gross and creepy. I don't get it, this film, if it ever sees the light of day will be a sad, sad testament to how far talentless hacks could rise. I'd say I'm not bitter but most wouldn't believe me after reading this. I'm not, it's just that this film embodies nearly everything that is depressing about working in this industry. Thank God I've had the chance to work on fun and creatively rewarding pics since then...

Oh, btw, I believe some pop star princess is also involved... a miley cirus type girl... cant recall her name but she should be shamed with the rest of them I guess. Thank god I'm not famous (nor want to be) and can carry my shame quietly in the darkest part of my soul, lol!

I've worked with Larry Kasanoff on a film years ago and I can say with 100% certainty that he's a complete jerkoff.""

""Anonymous

I actually worked on this movie for a bit. It was one of my first jobs in the industry and let me tell you, if you think it was a train wreck viewing, you should have seen how terrible it was to work on it. The sad truth is there were plenty of talented people working there. many of those people moved on to major studios in both film, TV and games. The bottom line is the director, Larry Kasanoff is a talent-less, classless scumbag that should be banned from Hollywood until the end of time. All of the inappropriate innuendos are a direct product of his ""creative hand"". I cannot tell you how many times this moron derailed production with his brainless input. It literally has cost the studio millions of dollars. They eventually stepped in and removed him from the project. Unfortunately, that was a decade and millions of dollars late. I am so ashamed of this movie that I have completely left working there off of my resume. On behalf of the many artists that have had the dubious distinction of working on this dumpster fire, I apologize to all of humanity for our part in this.""

""Trekintosh

The most annoying thing is the demo reel that Larry Kasanoff, the owner of Threshold, used to sell himself, contained 54% work that my father directed, 44% work that his company's current manager directed, and 2% work that current Threshold staff actually could have worked on. None of it was anynthing that Kasanoff himself touched. Fucking annoying little twerp.

[next post]

It wasn't, it was a legit attempt at a movie but the director was a man who was a completely juvenile narcissistic retard who couldn't direct his way out of an open field. Larry Kasanoff is a complete moron. He kept making people redo scenes months after they were set in stone, he had ADHD something fierce and kept redirecting teams and leaving scenes half finished, he also did not understand that an ANIMATED MOVIE needed ANIMATORS and kept firing them. I've got a whole fucking flowchart showing the exact sequence that Larry ruined the movie step by step. It's such a shame because the movie idea actually held great promise, and if the movie had released on time and on budget it should have actually been quite good and done well in box office.

Source: I grew up and pretty much spent every summer day in Threshold with my dad, who worked there. I was a motion capture actor(my part was lost in the theft), and my voice was to be used for several parts (in fact, I think it actually was used in the finish product as some background chatter). My brother worked security guard at nights after the theft. Larry used to call me ""little dude"" which I thought was cool then but looking back he is a right arrogant cunt to the highest degree. He also had a retarded chocolate lab named Monkey, who was gigantic and Larry also refused to train him. I hate Larry. He ruined my father's career in movies.

[next post]

Yeah and a shit ton of that shit ton had nothing to do with Larry Kasanoff beyond him signing the yes papers. Like I said in my first post on this thread, 52% of the work he used in his demo reel was directed by my dad, 46% by his deputy manager lady, 2% by anyone else. Examples that I can name off the top of my head are Galaxy Grand Prix, that wierd firefly/bug motorcycle thing and the fat pig exercise thingie(Sorry, I didn't pay much attention to any of them besides GGP, I was like 8 at the time and flying space race cars was way cooler than fat pigs). It's basically the demo reel we use at Mammoth except worse and without all the stuff we did after Dad and Mrs Manager(not naming no names) split from TDRL and the cancerous mass of retardism that Larry Kasanoff brings to the table.

Also I never realized where 'let's blow this popsicle stand' came from. I've been using it all my life, now I finally can remember where I picked it up.""

probably not the best throwaway to use for this, but it's true. he burned down his malibu mansion using flood lights for ""motion capture research"" and made bank on the insurance payouts, and killed the project 3 times during production to get new investors. The only reason the film was released was because the bank took over Threshold Animation after they failed to meet the deadlines for the release, and sold the movie rights to a UK company.

""donjmyers

Unfortunately I used to work at Threshold Digital Entertainment for a brief period and saw how poorly the place was run. I even found large amounts of porno on their network! Apparently they sometimes work on porno between flicks!

The studio has a terrible reputation among Lightwave animators as I learned AFTER I worked there. They have been working on Food FIght for years and not a lot has happened. Although the IMDB claims the movie is ""completed"" I've never heard anything about people working on it and the number of people listed on the credits page is miniscule. Only four or five animators? They must have been very busy! They even claimed a few years ago that someone came in and stole half their computer files for foodfight and now they had to start over. How absurd! Sounds like an excuse for why nothing was happing on the flick.

Now the IMDB page reports that even though the movie is ""completed"" the release date has been pushed back to next spring. There's a vote of confidence. A brief search of the internet will turn up various movie websites mentioning Foodfight with release dates ranging from years ago to 2007. I wouldn't trust anything the company has to say. Its owner, Larry Kasanoff, has a poor track record with movies and hasn't done much in years. His claim to fame is the old Mortal Combat movie. He has a reputation for being a tremendous jerk which is why James Cameron and many other people won't work with him.

Don't wait in line for this one to come out. Food Fight is already stale!"""

A lot has happened since then, and I thought the community deserved an update.  Before I begin, I would like to thank all of those who commented and upvoted my post.  Thanks to your input it reached the front page of PF and received a great deal of visibility, and I was able to receive some great suggestions.  My family was humbled by your outpouring of support.

First, I'll address the primary issues that brought me to this subreddit seeking advice: our loss of health insurance and our pending loss of food stamps.  We understood that when my Dad's disability case was approved, he would lose his food stamp money.

1.  The relationship between the Health Care Marketplace and individual insurance companies in Alabama is strained at best, and as /u/nuovo_donna pointed out, many of our problems stem from Alabama's refusal to take the Medicare expansion plan, which I educated myself on after making this post.  Nonetheless, I participated in several three-way calls with my mother and Health Care Marketplace reps, and we were able to join a $500/month plan partially subsidized by the federal government.  It's not great, but it's better than nothing at all.

2.  Regarding the disability/food stamps debacle, I took /u/nuovo_donna 's advice once again and wrote to all Alabama state representatives, senators, and President Obama about my father's plight.  Most representatives sent me back form letters, but REPRESENTATIVE MO BROOKS (shouting out to him even though I disagree with his political views) pushed Dad's case through the system and we received our first disability payment in June.  It included back payments through October, allowing my parents to start a small emergency fund.  The food stamps office reduced our monthly amount but has not cut us off entirely.

It took several months of arguing and debate, but in June my parents also finally allowed the house to go into foreclosure and moved into a two-bedroom apartment.  I am especially pleased with this development, because it puts my parents' finances in the black for each month.  Instead of losing money monthly as they were in my previous post, they can now save a little each month toward my dad's future long term care needs.  I now have full transparency into my parents' finances, so thank you to /u/lets-go-bravos for helping me put a plan in place towards this end.

My dad is still taking Aricept (the generic version -- thanks /u/dutch_ninja ) and his doctors have also added Prozac and are experimenting with Namenda at the moment.  He has good days and bad days, but on his good days we are able to converse fluidly and enjoy our time together.

I've been very busy with all of these life changes, but I unexpectedly landed a paid internship this summer in the insurance field at a Fortune 100 company.  While insurance is not related to my field of study in college, I find it interesting, and more importantly it should allow me to support my parents as my dad develops long-term care needs.  I also began dating a wonderful young man in the spring -- he's been nothing but sympathetic to my family's plight, and he lives in the city where my internship is located.  The internship will lead to a full-time job in January if I perform well this summer.  My future is looking brighter for the first time in a very long while.

Thank you again, /r/personalfinance .

Edit:  Wow, thank you so much for the gold!  I'm honored."

I am an intern at a nature center this summer and we have some pets on site. Two of these pets are bearded dragons who we have been told need a new enclosure.

Because my friend and I are the enrichment interns we were tasked with this assignment. However.. we need some ideas.

We want to give them more places to bask as well as something to naturally trim their nails. We read that if you put a rock in the tank with them that will trim their nails naturally. By this do they mean a decoration rock or a specific type of rock?

We have a 30 gallon and 40 gallon (sorry for the edit: I was told wrong!) tank for each dragon we are working with though we are going to request bigger ones if the directors can afford it.

Thanks in advance!

(Also now I want my own dragon. Trying to make this happen!)"
3e7pi2,4,2015-07-22,Getting better than I thought possible but still socially isolated,[deleted],DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3e7pi2/getting_better_than_i_thought_possible_but_still/,"I'm a guy who just turned 30. Starting a couple years ago I decided to get my shit together. I went back to school and am just about finished with the degree I abandoned years ago. I'm on an internship that pays more than the full time jobs I had throughout my twenties and I'm expecting it to develop into a full time job. I started lifting and my body is better than I ever thought possible. I like the way I dress, I like the way I look, and the way my career is heading and I feel like I'm turning into the person I always wished I could be.

It just feels like it's all too late for any of it to matter when it comes to the things that are really important. The biggest problem is I'm realizing that I don't have connections with other people. My family feel like strangers and I don't have much contact with them. I've never had any friends and, the older I get the more I feel like I'm never going to have them. People my age seem to have formed their social groups and, for the most part, seem to have less and less interest in meeting new people as they start families and get more devoted to their careers.

I never learned how friendships worked when I was younger so by high school I was basically completely socially isolated. I never figured out how to make friends in my first attempt at college and, while I talk to people in class now and people tend to treat me like ""one of them,"" I feel like I'm a bit too old to hang out with most of them and don't really see any potential for friendships there.

I've tried dating, which seems to suck even for well-adjusted gay guys my age. I don't even really want a boyfriend right now (since I can't imagine actually having a relationship) but I don't want to end up old and alone so it feels like something I need to do. I can get laid easily if I want, especially now that I have a better body, but it's so completely unsatisfying that I don't do it very often.

It's just really hard to feel like any progress I make is worth it when at the end of the day I'm still completely isolated. I don't even really feel human or like I have any real identity. No place feels like ""home,"" there's nothing to look forward to in weekends and holidays, I have no real belief system or code to live by... everything is just working or trying to distract myself until I can be working again. I'm starting to feel really exhausted and it feels like the weight of all my wasted years is starting to wear down on me. 

Anyone have any suggestions? I've been trying to force myself to go to meetups and things like that without much success. Right now I mostly just want ways to cope with the isolation for a while since I know it might be a good while before I have any serious connections with others.

TL;DR Been getting better than I ever thought possible but it doesn't seem worth it because of social isolation

Will do anything for a good company.",[deleted],HireNJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/HireNJ/comments/3e7r5j/for_hire_graphic_designer_renaissance_man_with_a/,"Hello,

My name is Frank and I am currently working as a graphic designer at a small sign shop in Central NJ. I love the work I do, but my current job environment is not great. I feel like I'm on a sinking ship - all of my co-workers come into work on edge, grumpy and hating life. My boss comes in late and mostly just cares about what's for lunch and his own projects. He's a boss, not a leader. What's keeping me sane is that I care about my clients and work towards their happiness with their design projects. I need a change though.

**Graphic Design:** I have designed banners, business cards, posters, flyers, magnets, decals, t-shirts, vehicle graphics, logos, etc. I'm a people person with great communication skills. I love interfacing with clients, figuring out how to best suit their needs, and building relationships with them. I handle designs independently from start to finish through all rounds of revisions. I do all of my own billing, invoicing, filing, file organization, etc. I even work on production of said materials. I'm highly proficient with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I've done Flash in the past. I'm currently familiarizing myself with InDesign and CorelDraw. 

**E-Commerce/Advertising/Marketing/Merchandising/Social Media:** I have been creative director and merchandiser for an online retail company. I put thousands upon thousands of products online ranging from power tools to luxury home goods. I have excellent grammar and communication skills. I have created landing pages, banner ads, promotional images, and company blogs. I have promoted companies on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest. I have assisted with and written copy for advertising campaigns for high end home goods. 

**IT/Networking/Office:** In high school I had two years of Cisco Networking Training. I have done IT and network support for my town's entire school system. I can set up and network your office equipment and troubleshoot your PC software and hardware problems. I'm proficient with Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I like to keep office environments organized and make sure things are running efficiently. 

**Maintenance:** I was a maintenance superintendent for four years. I've done light plumbing, electrical, and carpentry. You want proof that someone can strive with a fast-paced, high-stress environment? Give them 175-500 apartments to maintain, including all emergencies and making new units ready for rental. 

**Why you should hire me:**I strive in fast-paced environments. I like to keep active and learn as much as I can. I want to be able to assist in any job function when I am employed at a place. I'm highly organized with an eye for detail. I will go into any position learning everything I can and doing anything I can to grow the business and help make sure things are running efficiently and smoothly. I'll wear as many hats as you need as long as I feel rewarded and that what I am doing matters. I want you to be able to depend on me for anything. I'm there to make your job easier and reduce your stress. I'm sane and intelligent, and pick things up quickly. 

**What I need:** I need a place where creativity and productivity is rewarded. I'm not looking for a temporary, part time, or internship position. I want full time with decent pay, health benefits and a chance to save for retirement. I want to be at a place where employee input matters and where fun and creativity are encouraged. I would highly prefer to do something creative with graphic design, art, or writing. 

If you are interested in an employee that wants to make a home for himself at your company and help it grow in any way I can, please get in touch. I provide my resume, online design portfolio, and references upon request. Thank you!

I am very grateful that I do not have any student loans, as my uncle has a college fund for me.  So I do not have to worry about that.  

I have always wanted a newer car, I've been driving a 1997 beater since I got my license, and it is approaching 180k miles.  Now as I said, I'm entering junior year, so I will be applying for quite a few internships and co-ops, and hopefully will be offered one, so I would like a more reliable car to get me to and from these places.

Between my job at school and the side jobs I just started, I'll be averaging about $1.5k a month.  I don't really spend much, if any, money at school on anything other then necessities, so I feel like I would easily be able to make payments of ~$250, am I wrong?  Also, my uncle will be paying the down payment and will be cosigning as I don't believe my credit is good enough for a lease.

I've been looking at various summer lease deals around me, and there are a couple that really interested me.  Some leases that caught my eye:

2015 Chevy Silverado $2k down $229/mo 39 months

2015 Jeep Cherokee $3k down $299/mo 24 months

2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee $3k down $239/mo 24 months

All of these have a 10,000 yearly limit, and I'm almost positive I won't go over it.

I would look at cars rather than these trucks/suvs, but I need space to transport everything too and from school, it just makes it easier on me so I won't have to drive back and forth.  Also, I would prefer something with 4x4 so I'll have no problem in the snow and can drive on the beach in the summer.

To buy these cars instead of leasing, the monthly payments would be too high for me.  I do believe I could afford them, but I would rather not take the risk in case something comes up.

I really like the 24 month leases better, as I can have fun with it for 2 years, and then when it's over, I'll be graduated and then I'll look into a new honda civic or something else great on gas.

Also, I don't know much about leasing, would it be possible to negotiate the Silverado deal to 24 months?  It's a summer special that's why I am not sure.

Basically, I want a new car, more so truck, that is a reliable vehicle and I can have fun with in the summer while I can, as I don't think I'll have that time once graduated.

I've read a couple posts in the subreddit and many people seem to recommend buying another beater in cash, which is not an option for me.  I'm not saying its wrong, I am just saying that I've been driving my 97 beater and I just want the luxury of driving a new car if I can afford it like I believe I can.

So, is leasing a bad option for me?  Thanks everyone in advance

Edit - forgot to mention I am under my father's insurance still, so I will not have to pay that either

3e811b,24,2015-07-22,Rest in Peace Professor Reg Bell,RickBrade,Kettering,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kettering/comments/3e811b/rest_in_peace_professor_reg_bell/,"*[From an email received an hour ago from the Office of the President]*

&gt; To Kettering University Alumni and Friends:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It is with great sadness and with the deepest sorrow that I must inform you that Professor Reg Bell passed away earlier this week.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It is impossible to overstate Reg's impact on Kettering University in his more than 50 years on our faculty. Throughout his remarkable career, though, there was one constant - his unwavering commitment to the success of our students.  Reg never had a student who he did not count among his favorites.  I have met hundreds of members of multi-generational Kettering families all of whom counted themselves among his favorite students, and of course, Reg remembered everything about each and every one of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the years, Reg joyfully composed thousands of letters of recommendation for current and former students. He helped students who ran into financial difficulties find scholarships to stay enrolled and finish their degrees. He was a mentor and a constant, tireless advocate for Kettering students and alumni. He provided advice and counsel that has critically shaped thousands of lives and careers. There were very few requests from students that he would decline - he even took a starring role in several student-produced dance videos in recent years that remain YouTube sensations (and bring a smile to my face) to this day.
&gt; 
&gt; Reg was instrumental in launching the Bell-Kagle Undergraduate Research Internship program, which provides intensive research co-op positions for students in Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry.  He was even famous for finding his way onto campus tours when prospective students and families were visiting Kettering and for then giving them a customized tour - and insights about the University that only Reg was capable of providing. 
&gt; 
&gt; In 2013, together we celebrated his 200th consecutive teaching term, or 50 straight years of teaching without taking a single term off. Since that time his unbroken teaching run continued up until this very term.  In an interview about reaching the 200-term milestone, Reg was typically deferential, stating that he, ""imagined how much difficulty I would have with coping with 12 weeks without classes. ... I would have missed the students so much."" He noted that, ""the students bring out the best in me."" 
&gt; 
&gt; Reg loved Kettering University for a very simple reason - he unwaveringly believed that our students and alumni are the best and most talented in the world.  For those of us who pursue teaching as a career, we do so hoping that we will have impact in some positive way on the lives and careers of our students.  Reg achieved this for thousands of students, and so much more. He made an indelible impact on their lives. He did on mine as well.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Words cannot express how much he has meant to this University and to so many in our extended community and how much he will be missed. We ask that you please keep Reg's family and the many people whose lives he touched in your thoughts and prayers. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Robert K. McMahan
&gt; Kettering University President
&gt; 
&gt; Additional Information:
&gt; 
&gt; We are currently awaiting details on future memorial services for Reg and we will continue to share updates as we receive them. The University will hold a special community Memorial Service for Reg in the near future, and more information on this will be forthcoming as well. 
&gt; 
&gt; We have deployed a web page at www.kettering.edu/RegBell on which we will share this information. On this page you will also be able to post Reg-related photos, video, etc. It will also contain a web form for you to submit your favorite Reg stories and memories. 
&gt; 
&gt; Alumni and friends wishing to contact staff at the University can call (810) 762-9927.

3e86jj,7,2015-07-22,[Editorial] Former MMA agent here. I'm not watching another UFC fight until a union is formed and recognized.,TheRealFJ,MMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/3e86jj/editorial_former_mma_agent_here_im_not_watching/,"This is it. This is the last straw. As someone with a higher than average level of insight into the finances and business of mixed martial arts, I've had enough of the UFC's totalitarian regime. 

I became an MMA fan in college around the time Chuck started losing fights. I got really into it and decided that I wanted to be an MMA agent. I applied for a job with a small firm and was hired while still in college as an upaid intern. I scheduled fights, kept medical records in order, and most importantly, solicited sponsors for fighters. (I ended up buying the company after graduation and closing it down two years later due to the finances of the industry but that's a separate, slightly related story.)

Getting the sponsors was the best part of my job. I got to talk to decision makers at successful companies and give my pitch (usually not needed). Many of these guys saw the value in sponsoring fighters at the local level and would dish out $150-$2k to appear on the gear of a pro fighter. However, the real money came if and when a figher made it to the UFC.

Here's the thing, the jump in base pay isn't really what did it. Sure, going from a $3k/$3k (show/win) payday in a local fight to a $10k/$10k in the UFC is a massive jump. However, the real money came in the fact that the gear the fighter wore to and inside the ring suddenly went from being worth $3k (MAX!) to upwards of $20k. This is because companies like American Fighter, TapouT, etc would only play the big market and could throw money at just about anyone.

----Side Story: I once had Headblade offer my fighter $5k for a spot on the shorts on the condition that my guy shave his flowing locks and fight bald (we declined).

This sport is a cash cow and the marketing opportunities for such a niche, targeted market are endless. Dana White and the Fertittas are too greedy to see that allowing fighters to earn income outside of their meager fight purses will be good for them in the long run. 

I'm really hoping this will incite talks to get a union formed and have it recognized by the UFC and sanctioning bodies. Until that day, I'm not watching any UFC products.

TL;DR I've seen the financial side of MMA and this isn't sustainable."
3e88nf,1,2015-07-22,Small Successes w/ the help of PF! [21/F],kchromeo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3e88nf/small_successes_w_the_help_of_pf_21f/,"I have been a lurker on PF for a little over two weeks. As a long time personal finance nut I thought I knew it all and was quickly proven otherwise by the PF community. In the last few weeks I have become a YNAB addict and Vanguard Investor while increasing my financial peace of mind significantly.

Background: I am a 21 year old college student who has worked full time and gotten scholarships to fund all but one semester of college. I am in an internship to hire program in my dream job at my dream company. My internship ends in about a week for the fall semester but starts again in January-May at a pay rate of $1,200/Month. I will not have any income other than outstanding scholarships, loans to family/friends, and allowance (divorce decreed). **I am trying to determine my savings goals for before I begin my internship in January.**

**Assets**:

Checking: $47

Emergency Fund: $2,500

College Rent Fund: $1,200 (Rent for Fall Semester)

Discover CashBack: $165

Vanguard: $400 (Hope to increase that to $3,000 before end of year for VASGX)

Car Value: $11,112 (KBB; Paid cash in 2012 w/ small inheritance)

A/R (Estimated Remaining 2015 Income) = ~$11,410 (Total Personal Loan Repayment, Scholarship Monies, Remaining Summer Income, &amp; Court-Mandated Allowance)


**Liabilities**:

Credit Cards: $68.05 (Pay off each month &amp; have never held a balance!)

Student Loan Interest: $347.82 ($11.35 added every month)

Student Loan Principal: $5,500 (Super lucky &amp; Parents offered to pay it)


**Current Budget**:

Rent: $400

Utilities (Internet Inclusive): $100

Groceries: $150/Month

Gas: $50

Restaurants/Entertainment: $100

TOTAL: $800/Month until end of year
5 Months x $800 = $4000
Therefore...I have roughly $8,610 ($11,410 + $1,200 - $4,000) to save/invest/ect. by the end of the year.

**EOY 2015 Goals [Current Amount]**:

Emergency Fund: $2,500 [$2,500] (Should I increase to 6 month's expenses or $4,500-$4,800? Should I put it elsewhere or leave it in savings?)

Housing Expenses Fund (Spring): $2,500 [$0] (In case the internship falls through)

Living Expense Fund (Spring): $1,500 [$0] (In case the internship falls through)

Vanguard: $3,000 [$400] (Minimum for VASGX)


**End of Year Allocation Scenarios**:

A. Total Allocated w/o internship, w/ EF increase: $8,600

Total Unallocated w/o internship, w/ EF increase: $10

B. Total Allocated w/o internship, w/o EF increase: $6,600

Total Unallocated w/o internship, w/o EF Increase: $2,010

C. Total Allocated w/ internship &amp; EF increase: $4,600

Total Unallocated w/ internship &amp; EF increase: $4,010

D. Total Allocated w/ internship &amp; w/o EF increase: $2,600

Total Unallocated w/ internship &amp; w/o EF increase: $6,010

Please let me know your recommendations on savings goals and allocations! Should I increase my emergency fund? Should I redirect my savings? In scenarios B, C, or D what should I do with my additional funds? Save for additional security, vacation, or invest in other avenues?

Thank you for all of your help, guidance, and wisdom PF! Please let me know if you require any additional information!

3e8bdl,1,2015-07-22,Fell in love with my best friend at the worst possible time..,[deleted],aww,https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/3e8bdl/fell_in_love_with_my_best_friend_at_the_worst/,"     So I've been split from my girlfriend of 6 years for a month now. Yeah, it was probably the most heart wrenching thing that has happened in my life so far.. No, I'm not entirely over it. The worst part isn't that we broke up though.. the worst part has something to do with the fact that when my best friend (also of 6 years) came to my rescue the day it happened, I felt like it was the perfect time not just to talk about my break up, but also to talk about that one time 3 years ago when I looked at her sitting on the couch crying over a stupid girly shit movie that she made me watch and thought if I could just hold her and make her feel like the girl from the Notebook even for a second that nothing else in this fucked up world would matter... 
    Yeah.. so that happened. It's not like I've dwelled on it since.. Of course there were those times when I see her and the sexual tension was so thick I couldn't think straight, but the guilt of feeling that for her when I had a long term girl friend shook me out of the funk. Obviously heres my issue.. I'm single now as is she (even though she really doesn't want to be) and I see her every single day.. why? Oh yeah, because she lives in my building two floors down. She's got her two guy roommates and I'm living in a three bedroom one of which is now empty because my roommates moved in together because they decided to be in love... fuck that right? So in order to avoid at all costs the roommates from hell I spend most of my time two floors down in apartment 210. Still I do that, even after the word vomit. She's the most comfortable person in the world to be around and I love her for that because if I had to loose two of the most important people in my life I think I'd be far worse off than I am now. 
    So the morning after this all went down I woke up on my best friends couch to my stomach screaming at me to vomit up the tostitoes and bottle of Jameson that I layed into just hours before. She was already awake typing viscously into the computer a report for her internship that she probably had planned on doing the night before except I barged into her apartment in need of serious assistance. I remember everything about the next few moments.. maybe because I was trying to make up for forgetting parts of the night before or maybe because this was the first time I was seeing her with the knowledge that she knew too much about my feelings for her.. She looked up from her laptop and with a crooked smile asked if I needed Advil. I got the medicine and sat down with a cup of coffee just staring into it while she continued to type. The clicking slowed and stop after a moment and when I looked up she was looking at me with a face that still to this day I can't place.. it was somehow between concerned, confused, and relief. Then she asked me if I wanted to talk about it. So naturally I start apologizing like an idiot saying to forget everything blah blah blah and then she said, ""I meant your breakup."" Fuck. You can imagine how ridiculous I felt then. Without hesitating I laughed it off and started telling her what I figured what the right way to vent about the end of a 6 year relationship (coherently this time). Three coffee cups in and after I'd said all I could say about the matter she softly asked, ""Did you mean any of it?"" Of course i did, I thought. How could I not. I remembered everything I said to her from admitting the exact moment that I fell to getting upset and telling her never to date either of her two tweedle dee and tweedle dum roommates. I pretty sure everything that falls in-between was said too. How'd we end it? We ended it by agreeing to never talk about it again because thats what I needed. 
    A month later (present time) she's on vacation in London visiting her family and childhood friends. And I'm here.. still going over to her apartment because even tweedle dee and tweedle dumb are better to drink with than watching my involved roommates pretend to not know I notice when they get handsy underneath the blanket while we watch tv. She gets home tomorrow and even though we're sporadically texted for the past 3 weeks I don't know how to hide my feelings from her. She knows everything about me and whether she'll say it outloud or not she's gonna know somethings up, because something is. Help..? 

TLDR: fell in love with the best friend aka the only person in my life more important to me than the the girlfriend I just broke up with after 6 years. Seriously fucked..

3e8ica,0,2015-07-22,Just put my first 2.5k into the stock market- Good time to add more?,papasquat211,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3e8ica/just_put_my_first_25k_into_the_stock_market_good/,"A little big of background- 20yo college student, studying finance at a highly competitive program. I initially started out this morning with the intention of investing into a lower-risk portfolio and letting it sit to grow. With this in mind, my portfolio now plays out like this:

5 shares each in NFLX and DIS
10 shares in AAPL--&gt; I chose this specifically because many have said that it's a good buy-in time for Apple. I don't see Apple dropping continuously, but the slump in the last couple days has bumped the price down to a comfortable pricing.
3 shares in FIT--&gt; This is where I'm getting closer to speculation. Just bought a Fitbit and love the product, definitely see it going further in the future. 

Here is my current dilemma. My parents are encouraging me to mess around with the market to try to make some (relatively) big money before school starts again (read: invest in riskier companies), at which point I will put the majority of my money into more stable companies e.g. AAPL, NFLX, what have you. 

I plan on injecting into my account a further 2-4000$ to play around with, as they have promised a level of ""insurance"" to essentially recoup my losses. 

I know that at my age it's ok to be investing in riskier firms. However, I'm curious as to where there is a limit? Is it ok for me to be about 50/50 on safe/risky positions? If so, what are some more up-and-coming stocks to look at? I frequent WSJ and work with Bloomberg pretty often due to my internship, but am simply not sure where to start looking for smaller, riskier firms to invest in."

My name is Michael and I'm a single 35 year old guy that has joint custody of twin 10 year old boys.  I am in college full time online while working as an intern for a respected IT company while working a part time evening job as well (60 hours a week just working, 85 a week with college).  

Ok, so my mother is an intelligent and loving woman who has had lung cancer going on 9 years now.  Her lung cancer is at the later stages and she doesn't want any more treatment.  She has had half her lung already cut off, went through Chemo and vows to never go through it again.  She has gone through experimental treatments and it made her miserable.  She wants to finish out her life happy, lucid, and fighting the cancer on her own terms. 

Now she is showing signs of Alzheimers and she is forgetting everything.  She still has her intelligence and is fully functional, but now she forgets everything that is short term.  She doesn't see the problem.  To make things worse her mother (my grandma) has stage 4 Alzheimers and doesn't even know how to eat anymore much less ever even say two words to anyone.  My mother doesn't want to go through this.  She explained to me once that she doesn't want to get scanned due to shes already terminal and doesn't want to know if she has Alzheimers.  

She is retired but her health insurance is going to 700 dollars in December from 300 dollars.  We can't afford any assisted care.  We got her will started along with a living will.  We have taken care of the power of attorney.  What else can I do to help her through this process?  Do I ask her to get tested?  We've taken over her finances because she hasn't paid them in two months due to forgetting.  She still currently drives, but now is starting to get lost easily.   She is 56 years old currently.  Any guidance on how I can help her?  What other important things am I forgetting?  How do I be supportive and ask  the family to be supportive at such an early stage?  Nobody is even aware she is having a problem.  Is it too soon to talk to her friends and family?  Any guidance or advice would truly be helpful!

Thanks for listening/reading!

Long distance, a lot of repressed feelings",YouJustGotProvd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e8oaq/i_19m_made_her_19f_hate_me_long_distance_a_lot_of/,"It's been 4 months since the last time we spoke, and I just don't know where to turn anymore. I keep having dreams about it where everything is solved and there's a happy ending but then I wake up and I start the day with my heart broken.

I met this girl online almost three years ago. She lived in New England, I lived in southeast Mexico. She had a boyfriend at the time, I was into someone else. We immediately clicked it off anyhow. Our connection was completely unlike anything I've ever experienced before; from the get-go, we put a lot of work into making each other laugh. And I don't mean like, long elaborate jokes, but we talked so playfully to each other that it was hard not to grin throughout the whole damned conversation. It was very special.

She was my best friend. Whenever something happened in our lives, we'd tell each other before practically anybody else. We spent a good portion of almost every day on videocalls alone with each other. Those conversations meant a lot for me. We didn't just laugh our asses off at the million stupid in-jokes we'd developed, but we also allowed each other to open up emotionally in a way at least I wasn't used to. Through her I learned to be transparent with another person. At times it felt as though we were two components to the same being. I was never afraid to tell her anything, and I liked to think she trusted me the same way.

This was all happening at around the same time as her long-term long-distance relationship was falling apart. He was her high school sweetheart, but he had stayed in PA while she moved and went to college in NE. I don't know all of the details about him, but I know how hard it was on her, as this was one of the most important relationships in her life. Both of us needed a lot of emotional support, and we relied on each other for it.

Fast forward a few months, and our relationship was considerably evolved. We're talking *all the time*. We're both in college so it's a thing where we wake up, videochat, tell each other how cute we look, go to a class, spend that whole time snapchatting or even on Skype. She loves me. I leave for five minutes and my twitter feed is full of ""I miss you""s and ""#LoveForever""s. I don't mean this in a weird unsettling kinda way, it was really sweet. Especially when she tweeted me in Spanish. And I loved her just as much as she showed me, but at the same time, it was never a serious relationship-y thing. We would joke about sex or getting married or whatever, but in a very casual way. We weren't each other's anything. In the future, it looked like we would be; she'd start telling me about the house we would live in, what we would name our children, what our jobs would be. But in present tense we were nothing.

So one day, the day before I went on my Spring Break last year, my anxiety got the best of me. I messaged her at night telling her I felt really weird, and asked if she would ever be my girlfriend. She told me how much she hoped she could be eventually, but for the time, she had promised herself she wouldn't do long-distance again and that she was sorry. It was emotional, but a productive conversation that helped us determine how important we were to each other. We wished each other good night and that was it.

That Spring Break was when our relationship really started to change. Our conversations got considerably more sexually charged, and everything about how we couldn't been together seemed to have been thrown out of the window as we got closer and closer. I started making her mixtapes around this time, and she loved them so much. I got her on video with my little brother a few times, we did dumb stuff like play clubpenguing together or pretend we were a Mexican couple to strangers online. We started actually sexting, but in the end, I would always say something silly that made us stop halfway through. It was a little frustrating, but all in good fun. She didn't send me private pics of herself in this time. Just praise mine and describe what she was doing over text. She loved teasing me like this, and I didn't mind it too much, but it was surprising we never went beyond that.

So Spring Break ends, and this is when it really starts going downhill. She's really feeling the lack of sex, so she decides to booty call some guy she hooked up with a few months ago that was a jerk to her, but I shouldn't worry because she was just using him. Well, alright. I got to campus too early and nobody's really gotten there yet, so instead of being bored all day I decide to do drugs. I drop a tab of acid and go have fun by myself.

I ended up in some Easter parade with lots of fireworks and music, fun stuff. Then I got back home. We talked for a little bit as she was getting ready for bed. The booty call had sucked, wish you were here, etc. I don't know how many of you have done acid, but that thing makes you feel feelings you didn't know you had. It was a very weird sense of anxiety that I especially wasn't used to feeling with her, because we had never really had any problems before, so I told her right then. I'm in love with you. She couldn't say it back, but instead she told me how much she liked me and how she hoped we had a future together. Then she went to bed.

I started hearing less and less from her over the next week. Every time I tried to talk to her she acted dismissive, until she gave up and just sent me ""I need space."" We had a talk eventually, and as it turned out, she was seeing somebody new.

We didn't exactly fight or anything, but there was a weird tension between us. I felt discarded. But then, every 8 to 10 days, she would be back and we would talk and it felt as if nothing had ever changed. The rest of the time just sucked.

I wanna clarify now, because it’s kinda weird and I realize I haven’t mentioned it. For some reason, we never voice-chatted. We had been in a couple group calls before maybe, but usually when we spent all day on cam together, it was just video. It’s pretty weird I guess, I just attribute it to the fact that I was really shy and sometimes self-conscious about my voice / my accent. There was a whole dimension missing in our relationship and I was too stupid to see it at the time.

It was summer now and she was starting her internship. It was still the same between us. Once every week or so we were soulmates. The rest of the time she was seeing somebody else. She started getting on the IRC where we met again, and flirted with this dude we’re gonna call… let’s say Frank. Frank was a notoriously scummy dude, the kind that dedicated most of his online time to tormenting random kids and being bigoted in every way imaginable. Frank was in the military, and had at least one conversation on IRC about how he had joined because he wanted to kill people.

Things got too confusing too fast. For the first month of her internship, it felt as though she was alternating between the three of us. Me, Frank, and the dude she was seeing. This wasn’t her as I’d always known her. This felt like a new version of her, but she still made me feel the same way. She could be so sweet when she wanted, and so cold immediately after.

One day she tells me she’s been talking to Frank and they decided they’ll meet up in a couple months, and asks if I’m okay with that. I’m hesitant, say that it’s her choice, but that I personally don’t trust him one bit. She tells me about how nice he is to her when they spend hours on the phone at night, and not to worry. She says she wants to marry me eventually, but wants to get a chance to make bad decisions. That kinda warms my heart and breaks it at the same time, but I just go with it.

Over the next month she just gets more and more distant, until it explodes and she tells me she can’t deal with me anymore. I make her feel like crap and I’m too far for it to ever work. So she leaves. From time to time she and Frank will get on IRC together, he will start harassing somebody, and while everybody else calls him out she’ll just talk about how cute he sounds on mic and be very explicit about their meet-up plans to have sex on ecstasy. It’s a very dark time.

A month passes and I notice her posting sad-nostalgic lyrics on Twitter, then followed by pictures of private jokes we had and such. I’m heart broken and I don’t want to deal with her, but at the same time I do. One of those nights she sends me an “I miss you” on Snapchat. Another of those nights she messages me to tell me about how a TripAdvisor review singled her out as a particularly helpful worker in her internship, and how I was the first person she wanted to be proud  of her. I don’t know how it happens, and it takes weeks of tiny back and forths on social media, but eventually we reconnect.

I especially remember the first time we videochatted after that hiatus. We both got drunk as hell. She told me about how she still felt the same, and how much that scared her. We both apologized for hurting each other and promised it wouldn’t happen again. That I would do my best to go on exchange to a college near her and we would work things out.

Just the next day it was the day of her meet up with Frank. They were together for a weekend, then he went back home, then she followed him home and spent another week with him. It felt very harsh for me. The first day they were together she was talking to me over snapchat the whole time, but after that I was an afterthought again. They stopped talking after he asked her to wait 3 years for him, until his service was over, and she declined. I may not like the dude but he obviously cared a lot for her too and I’m really sorry he had to have his heart broken as well.

So we have several more weeks of the yes/no/maybe thing going on. There comes a period of time where we’re wishing each other good morning and good night with I love yous every day again, but we’re usually too busy to talk throughout the day. At one point I invite her to come to Mexico to a music festival with me, and at first she agrees, telling me she would never do that for anyone else but she’ll do it for me. As the date approaches she starts flaking out and eventually just flat out tells me she doesn’t feel ready and can’t do it. It’s no big deal, but still disappointing.

Another note I want to make here. She was majoring in hospitality and tourism, and my family just so happens to have a hotel in one of the biggest tourist destinations in the world. We had discussed the idea lots of times before, but around this time, she was finally going to apply for a job here. This is a month after the festival incident, but the same thing happens again. We spend a long time talking about how she’s gonna contact my mom via email, but the days pass and whenever I try to bring it up she just ignores me or changes the topic. It’s not gonna happen.

I flipped. I told her that it sucked that she didn’t respect me enough to ever tell me when she’s gonna back out of something and just lets me get my hopes up for nothing. She tells me I’m an asshole and that it’s not realistic for her. That it feels like a dream, and dreams never come true for her. So we leave it at that and don’t talk for a couple more weeks.

She eventually comes back and tells me that she’s sorry, but she hopes we can still be friends. I’m still crazy for this girl but I say why the hell not, I don’t want you to hate me. It’s just a few days of this and she starts getting more and more forward. She can never make up her mind. She starts doing things like sending me sexy Marvin Gaye songs, answering simple questions like “where are you gonna spend Christmas?” with “on ur dick” and basically just throwing away the “just friends” stuff. We start sexting again, now fully. But it still feels hot and cold with her.

We start off the year talking a lot. Now with added voice chat. I help her study Spanish over Skype, she gets to meet some of my roommates, it’s all great. In this time she still tells me stuff like how I’m the person she has ever cared the most about in her life, on the same tier as her best friend from childhood and specifically above other dudes mentioned before in this story. Well, that makes me feel more secure in what we have, and the feeling is obviously mutual. I haven’t talked about my relationship history a lot in this post, and that’s mostly because I don’t really have one. I had a couple of crushes in high school, but nothing serious with anyone ever. To me, this whole relationship is a first, and part of me knew that I was over my head and not emotionally mature enough for long distance with someone so unstable. But I loved her.

Then one day, again seemingly out of nowhere, she drops me again. And this time I pretty much just let it happen. Eventually I find out through mutual friends that she has a boyfriend. She had mentioned the guy to me a couple of times before, mostly complaining about him, how he was just some dude he was seeing for weed and for sex. But now she’s his girlfriend. Well, okay.

Few more weeks, around the time of Valentine’s Day, and she’s sent me a couple individual songs and a mixtape she made me, with texts such as “I know you probably hate me but this song made me think of you and I wanted you to hear it”. It’s all very sweet songs about finding your home, becoming aware of what you lost, very sweet sugar-y nostalgiacore. I say thanks and I miss you. I miss you too. That’s it.

I’m a complete idiot / reckless asshole, and this is probably my biggest regret of all. I feel completely inadequate and the anxiety is driving me crazy. I have ADHD and I’m struggling a lot with school. I need an escape. So we talk, and I ask if I can go see her for my Spring Break. She agrees to it, but we still don’t really discuss it for a while. The moment she agreed and told me she could pick me up on a certain date/time I bought my tickets online. With a whole month to go.

It’s early March and she has her Spring Break, where she gets to go to Miami to work on a golf event. My family lives in Miami, and we had talked about meeting there before, so to her it’s a place with an aura of me. Throughout the trip she’s sending me snaps about how she can’t stop thinking of me or whatever. Honestly I’m very excited. She’s busy, but she’s also very sweet to me, and in a twisted way it still makes me happy that she’s thinking of me.

So she gets back from her trip and we have a talk. The talk is mostly about her relationship status. She tells me about how much she wishes she was single, how excited she is to see me, and all the fun stuff we’re gonna do. She’s playing me Marvin Gaye again, telling me I’m gonna sleep in her bed and winking at me, these signals don’t feel very mixed, but the boyfriend thing still matters. She tells me she’s sorry, but she hasn’t given anyone a real shot in some time and she’s not gonna give up on this one so soon, and I’m only gonna visit her as her friend. We still have a nice conversation and catch up, until her boyfriend gets home, she’s visibly annoyed and tells me she’s gotta go but she hopes we can talk soon.

So this is me being an asshole again. The next day it didn’t look like we’d have time to videochat, so I straight up sent her a snapchat asking to “please” break up with her boyfriend. She didn’t take to it kindly and we didn’t talk for another two weeks. 

I realize how out of place I was, but I’m not in an easy position myself and I’m *two weeks* away from going to see her. My roommate and all my friends know the exact number of days because it’s always the first thing I say when I wake up. 33, 32, 31, 30, 29. Every morning I’m counting down. I’m crazy about this trip. But after that last conversation, I just feel more inadequate than ever. I eventually ask her to forgive me and she tells me “okay” and that’s that. We don’t talk again until the night before I go there.

So from one moment to the next I’m there. I’m at the airport and my heart is beating so fast holy shit. We’re texting trying to find each other, and we can barely contain the excitement. “HOLY SHIT DEUD IM SO EXICTED IM GONNA THRO WUP” and such. It was so surreal. Finally, after more than two years, we were gonna see each other face to face.

We hugged for whole minutes before saying anything.

I get on her car, I still hardly can believe it, and one of the first things she tells me is that she broke up with her boyfriend a couple days before. Nothing to do with me as far as I can tell. He was just being a dick and she had to end it. Only in retrospect I can tell I was putting a lot of pressure on her when it really wasn’t my place to meddle.

We get to her place, I meet her brother and her other roommate. We drink a lot of wine. We smoke weed, we laugh, we cuddle. Before I got there, she made me my own bed on the floor right next to hers. At one point we’re cuddling and my heartbeat gets ridiculous, so she asks me if I’m okay. I tell her I’m just so happy to finally be there. The fact that I’m only there visiting as a friend comes up again, and I know, it’s something I’ve been vaguely aware of the whole time. But the piece of shit in me doesn’t really believe it. She falls asleep cuddling, but I’ve never been a light sleeper and I’m not sure what to do, so I just slide off into my own bed eventually and fall asleep there.

The following morning we go to another museum, to a farm shop, to a record store. We take lots of pictures together and with each other. We’re so fucking happy, or at least from my point of view. She gets the REO Speedwagon album “Lo-Fidelity”, apparently just because she liked the cover. Maybe I was supposed to take a hint from there. It’s also COLD AS BALLS. I’m from Mexico, I’m not used to this New England weather. But I love it. I’m having so much fun and I’m so happy the whole time throughout.

We get home, get super drunk on wine again, and at one point where we’re just sitting on her bed and laughing I kiss her. She draws back and reminds me I’m just there as her friend, that’s right, but it still feels like a very light mood. I tell her that was my first kiss and we laugh. Then she kisses me back and we spend a while that night just making out before eventually falling asleep cuddling. This night she tells me I can stay in her bed so I do.

She goes to work that morning and I just kinda chill at her place and take the opportunity to download music and crap I couldn’t do at college because of firewalls. I’m the kinda dude that doesn’t really mind not doing anything for a while, and well, it was nice to get some rest.

So she comes back from work and we blaze up in her car while listening to some Grateful Dead CDs she had. We try out a pipe I brought her from Mexico. We take pictures of each other, that we intend to use to remember this trip by. Great pictures (still haven’t been able to make myself delete them). We’re stoned as hell and I try to kiss her again. She tells me no, I’m sorry, but she did some thinking at work and last night was a mistake and you’re my friend. So I say, alright, I’m sorry, and we move on.

We just chill in her room for a while, playing music for each other while she does her homework. It’s dark and it’s snowing, and we decide to take a walk to the bay. The only time I had been in the snow before in my life I was 12 and I had to climb a mountain with my family for it. I had never actually been in the snowing streets. We walked, had a few snowball fights in the way. I was having such a great time.

We get back and resume the music/chilling/homework session. It’s my turn to play a song, and I go with one of my favorites, “You Got Me” by The Roots. She’s liking it maybe a bit too much. She starts kissing me and climbs on top of me. We both make a few moves to escalate the situation, but she tells me she’s only gonna blueball me as she loves to, plus she’s on her period. I don’t care, as long as we’re enjoying it. YouTube decided to play along and the AutoPlay feature decided the natural follow-up to The Roots was a sexy R&amp;B playlist.

But it doesn’t just stop at blueballing. This is my fault and I should have stopped it instead of encouraging it. I take off her shirt, lead her hand into my pants. Honestly I didn’t know if it was going there for sure. She asks me if I really want to do it. I just kinda mutter out “yeah…”. She leaves the room for a second comes back with a condom, puts it on me and we’re in action.

Honestly this whole time I guess I’m just too nervous to cum. I don’t really know how long it lasted but I know I didn’t feel close to it, and I was enjoying it more because I found it fun and intimate than because I was sexually aroused. Anyway, I mentioned earlier that she’s on her period. And so she was. At one point she starts bleeding all over me and I just kinda laugh it off and we go start the shower.

The shower gets weird. Like, it didn’t have to be. But she kept stroking me and then asking me to look up, not at her. Like she was only concerned with getting clean, not about the fact that I was there. She gets off the shower before I do, so I finish cleaning up and then go back to her room. She’s sitting on her bed and honestly looks completely torn apart. I sit next to her, ask her what’s wrong, and she tells me “I honestly think you came all the way here just for that.” I didn’t. I assure her I didn’t. I don’t know if she really believes me, but I’m just doing my best to make sure she’s comfortable the whole time after that. I ask her if I should sleep in my own bed tonight, and she nods.

We start watching a movie on Netflix while cuddled up on her bed, and she falls asleep within just a few minutes. I carefully close her computer, put it away, and go sleep in my own bed. I send her a few text messages saying stuff along the lines of “I’m not perfect, and I’m sorry if I hurt you tonight. I’ve been having a great time here, and you mean so much to me, I’m sorry if I’ve made you uncomfortable.”

I wake up the following morning and she’s rubbing my back. Everything seems fine. We set out to go buy me a sweater of her college, but the shop is closed, so we go to Brown University instead and visit the Haffenreffer. We leave a double signature at their guest book. To me, we’re having a lot of fun. She asked me if I was OK multiple times, and I started wondering if I seemed really awkward now or what was the deal. Didn’t think to seriously ask her if she was OK; if I did, it was probably in a sarcastic tone that would make her not want to answer. I don’t know if I was a dick that day, but I was very confused on how to maintain the balance between showing her that I love her but also that I was there for support. At one point while riding in her car I ask her, if she was me, how long she would stay. She tells me she would stay the whole week and she hopes I do. I wasn’t really sure what I was gonna do at that point, as I also planned to visit my family in Miami at some point, but that works as assurance. I’m glad she’s glad to have me around.

The morning goes on, we visit a couple more record stores, pipe shops, and other stuff. I tell her I’ve never had a FroYo and we go for one, but I change my mind at the last second and tell her I’m hungry for something else. She suggests a pizza place right across the street so that’s where we go.

This is where I really noticed her starting to get tense. At one point I accidentally spilled my soda, and she immediately rushed for napkins to clean it all up for me, before I even had time to react. From that moment she seemed distant. Like she didn’t understand what I was doing there. She was looking away more often than she looked at me. While on her car, the Grateful Dead CD from earlier started playing and she aggressively shut it off. I should’ve asked if she was OK.

Eventually the time came for her to go to work, so we made plans for me to hang out with her best friend for a few hours. We went to the mall, got a few gifts that I promised friends back home and also some for her. Her friend was nice and all, but it was the first time we met so I felt like there was some lingering awkwardness. I didn’t care, I thought she was cool and was glad she took some time off her day to hang out with me. During this time at the mall, she (the girl this whole story is about) texted me thanking me for being accommodating to her schedule, and I told her it was no problem and I was grateful I could even be there in the first place. That felt very reassuring. We also joked a bit about how I found a cheaper LP at the mall than I bought from the record store earlier and how at least I was helping out a small business.

We went to a bowling place, and the friend introduced me to her whole team. I don’t know if I came across as an asshole here, I mean, I was polite to them, but I spent most of my time there just catching up with my family and friends while the best friend and the team played. I also used this time to change my profile picture of Facebook, upload some stuff on Instagram, and told my mom what a great time I was having.

So eventually the best friend drops me off at my friend’s house, I just sit down and chill for a while, until her roommate knocks on the door and tells me that tonight we’re moving my bed to the living room. I’m like uh-ok, we’ll see what this is about when she gets home. Another while passes, and the roommate comes back, and he tells me I need to go. He offers to drive me to a hotel or to the airport, but I need to get out of the house right now. He’s not giving me a choice. He doesn’t know anything, just that the girl’s brother wants me out in that moment.

I pack up my things and ask him to drive me to a hotel, from where I can grab some wi-fi and try to get in touch with my friend. It’s useless, she’s not responding. My guess is she’s just at work and thinks I’m bothering her with some unimportant nonsense we can settle later. But I’m kinda desperate. I couldn’t have internet at the hotel unless I was a guest, so I asked the very kind receptionist if he could hold my stuff while I went to a Starbucks to get some signal.

The Starbucks was closed, and I had to stand outside. I was freezing my balls off, and she wasn’t responding. I got on a Skype group where I knew she was, asked if anyone could contact her for me, and received several responses along the lines of “fuck off”. That same group had always been jerks to me, so it’s not like I expected much in the first place, so I just quit the group and kept trying to call. Nothing. I try to call her on Skype and eventually it just comes up with “your call has been blocked”. I don’t understand anything.

So, defeated, I return to the hotel and get myself a room. I spend the night calling my mom and other friends for support. I’m really going crazy in there. Eventually I get a FB message from her. “I’m terrified of you.”

She tells me all about how I’m a manipulative asshole who only used her for selfish purposes, who never cared what she wanted, who was a jerk to her, who is so self-involved he can’t take a moment to think about others and about how I broke her and betrayed her at her own house. She then blocked me.

I pretty much just spent the whole night crying and talking to my friends. I got a ticket that left for Miami a few hours later so I could see my mom and my brother. I blocked her from every last thing, except Whatsapp, where I just couldn’t figure out how to. I was heart broken and confused.

She eventually contacted me on WhatsApp while I was at the airport, and reiterated what a piece of shit she thought I was. Honestly I only very vaguely remember having this conversation; I was sleep deprived and underfed. But I’ve looked at it a few times since, and I’m actually really surprised at how calm and collected I came off this time. During the Facebook one, I freaked out; I asked how she could be so cruel, I just mashed my keyboard a bunch and begged her to let me discuss things calmly. While I was on the airport, though, I just said I was really sorry she thought that way about me but that it wasn’t true. That I did care for her, and wished she could’ve brought up these issues instead of kicking me out and leaving me out in the dark like that. I assume she either blocked me or deleted the app then.

Next week it’ll have been 4 months since then, and we haven’t talked at all. I’ve gone through a lot in this time, what with dealing with ADHD, depression, and lots of other issues I can’t shake. I have a psychologist back at college, but this summer I’m on m own. I had a job at my family hotel for a month, before the pressure became too much and I had to quit. I withdrew from college temporarily last semester, basically making it as if I didn’t take that semester at all. I’m kind of a mess, and I’ve gone through every stage of grief several times over. Some days I still love her, some days it’s just a distant memory that I feel I can move on from. But I’m lonely and I feel an urge to try to explain my side of things to her. I drunk texted her a couple times last month before I deleted her number. Just dumb drunk stuff like “ur da best i miss uuu” and such. I’m pretty ridiculous.

I lost touch with 90% of the community that I met her on after that incident. I still have a few friends there, but I also know of a few others that for sure hate me. Just two days ago they found me on another IRC and harassed me, even when I didn’t fight back. I’m not the kind to start calling them names or anything, just the fact that they’re treating me like that makes me very profoundly sad. And I have no idea what she feels. I don’t know anything about her life anymore. I can’t imagine her not hating me, though, after all the things she said and the way her friends are still acting. The whole thing just… blows. I miss my best friend and I wish I hadn’t fucked it all up.

**tl;dr: i’m bojack horseman and i fuck up all the good things in my life out of fear and a need for gratification, no matter who i hurt in the process. sorry i made it so long, but it’s a lot to get out.**

I just don't know what to do. Like... everything feels wrong. I can try to block her out, or to make contact, or whatever. Then I wake up every other day disappointed that my dream that we made up isn't actually real. Or sad she doesn't want anything to do with me and I'm not a good person. I don't know how to get over someone."

Also, to contextualize, I live in Brazil, where most people live with their parents during college, as we very rarely go to universities far from our hometowns.

So, I got into college in 2009 to study Economics (both my parents are economists), but at no point was I satisfied with my decision. After much struggle, bad grades, trying to switch majors in 2010 and doing a year abroad in 2013, I completed all my courses and had to start my final project. However, I wasn't happy with graduating in Economics and had become very interested in Law (in Brazil, Law is an undergraduate program). I then decided to take some elective courses and I absolutely loved it, and decided that I wanted to become a lawyer (this all happened this year). Also, since I have already completed all my Econ courses, I decided to try to get a double degree (I have to finish all my Law courses first, and then do one final project for each major).

The problem is that, even though I'm very happy with my decision, I lied to my parents. Because I had already spent so much time in college (and will spend even more to get my double degree), I felt scared about their reaction and told them that I had started my final project. My mom eventually found out (even though I haven't told her yet about my double degree), but my dad (who lives abroad), still thinks I'm finishing it and handing it in this month. I kept lying to him about it, hoping that I would find a way out of this. I know it's very stupid, but I have some trouble facing my parents; I fear they'll be disappointed in me (this really makes me think I should see a therapist, and I'm totally up for it).

My problem is, I'm even more scared of facing them now. What makes it even worse is that they are divorced and my father lives in a different country, so that's two emotionally draining conversations I have to have. What's the best way to approach this? The only good side of all this is that I have a full scholarship and also got an internship in Law which can handle my basic costs. Oh, I should also mention that one of my biggest concerns is that I'm already 24 and will take another 2,5 years to get my degrees.

   
**tl;dr**: I lied to my parents about college and now I'm scared about approaching them"

Hello everyone, before you start to read I just wanted to let you know I wrote this in less than two hours (editing took me three :/)
Hope you enjoy my first work. This is only Part One and if y'all enjoy it then I might work on a part two. Please be honest, I've got a thick skin and can deal with criticism. Thank you!

It started in the streets.

The homeless - the invisible ones. They started disappearing and dying: no one cared, really. We all thought it was a great thing that their population seemed to be diminishing. In fact, we encouraged it. We wanted the homeless off the streets; we wanted them all to be saved- helped. Little did we know what was actually happening to them and when we finally found out. It was too late for all of us.




April 23, 2018
The news reports told of a small virus that was mainly affecting those on the streets with no shelter and no means of medication. They couldn’t fight the disease without the help of antibiotics and most succumbed to it. Since those dead were practically unknown they were broadcasting pictures; mostly those with arrest records. If no one knew them they would be buried in the Assumption Cemetery, just a few miles from the main road of town. For now, they were being held in the city’s small morgue at the hospital, down the road from Anabelle Walkers’ home. Her father, their small town’s mortician was awaiting word from the coroner if the bodies would be brought to him.

Anabelle wasn’t concerned with the dead. She had helped her father when she was little. Watching him with the embalming fluids and the makeup. Make them look like they’re sleeping was what he always used to say. Before, the idea that her father touched dead people every day was disturbing to her. Now she knew Benjamin Walkers’ job was what fed and clothed her. It wasn’t something to be afraid of. Death was a normal everyday thing. She got up from the couch and put her breakfast dishes in the sink. Today was going to be a long day, her father would be working till late she was sure and she would be all alone in the house until she started her shift at the hospital. She started working there just 6 months ago and already she had moved up in the ranks of the nurses’ assistants and was on the fast track to starting her nursing degree at the local college.

Benjamin Walkers finally got the call he had been expecting around 2:30 in the afternoon. He would be receiving 12 bodies of the recently deceased homeless in two hours. The medical examiner Bob Markum was glad to get these men and women out of his refrigerators. It was too bad that so many of them went unclaimed, he thought the small tight-knit town would try a little harder to help these poor souls find their families. The only recognition was from the Wilkens’ family, and they didn’t want to pay for funeral costs anyway. Bob hoped to put an end to the questions from the police and local media by telling them all it was a virus. Sure, it was a virus. Something he had never seen before, but why start uproar when it was contained to these dirty street people?  No one else had seemed to fall ill. No one reported anything at the hospital. But those bite marks- no he wouldn’t start the media craze. He would let them go, bury whatever the truth was with them, he thought.

Ben arrived at the funeral home with an hour to spare. He needed all of his staff focused on their jobs; the task at hand was going to be rough. 12 bodies was a lot for the small staff at Assumption. Carrey Herald, Rick Topher, and Grace Freed were all sitting in the small staff room watching the TV and playing on their phones. Rick sat on the couch, taking up most of the small sitting area. He turned away from his phone; ignoring the text he just received to watch the small screen. It was another story; the news anchor was getting tired of talking about the latest craze on social media and focused again on the 18 dead homeless in the small town. Rick shook his head.
“If they’re sending them here then what else is there to discuss? Those poor bastards don’t have any family. They really need to stop.”
Carrey, the intern looked up at him from the pillow on the floor. This was her favorite spot in the room, she hated sitting next to people and no one else wanted to sit on the floor.
“They keep bringing them up because of what happened. How bad would it suck if no one claimed you after you died! Wouldn’t you want people to come remember you? Or are you so big and bad that you don’t care?” Her eyes bulging out of her head as she raised her voice. She was so upset about these poor innocent people not getting what they needed. She hated death. If she could save everyone she would. How could Rick the Brick be so insensitive? He looked over at Grace; the old woman was sitting with her knitting completely ignoring the news and the exchange between her coworkers. She had her opinions, but would never voice them even if someone asked her. She didn’t want to go along with her coworker’s drama. Kids.

The yelling match reached Ben’s ears as soon as he walked in the door. Damn, he thought, I was hoping they wouldn’t be worked up yet. He ran down the stairs and threw open the staff door.

“Alright you two, that’s enough yelling!” He exclaimed throwing the door so hard it crashed against the wall. Grace barely looked up from her work, Rick looked sheepishly down at the floor. He knew he had been loud, but was surprised that Ben could hear him so easily. Carrey was practically in tears and decided this would be a good time to excuse herself to the restroom to freshen up. She needed to be stronger if she was going to help work on so many people today. Ben went to fill his coffee cup at the counter and sat at his desk across from the small arm chair that was currently occupied by Grace. She nodded to him with a thoughtful look. He smiled back. Rick cleared his throat as to start an excuse for his yelling. Ben inhaled sharply and looked back at Rick. He would have no sympathy for bad behavior today. They had a lot of work to do.

Anabelle started her slow trek to Cicely’s house. It wasn’t too far away; she just didn’t want to pick up the girl for their shift. Cicely Truman was practically royalty in their small town. Anabelle didn’t know why she didn’t just drive herself. But for some reason Cicely had taken a liking to her, maybe it was because of their first day of work when Cicely didn’t know how to do anything and Anabelle helped her. Anabelle slowed at the stop sign and looked over at the place she really wanted to go: Devon Reynolds was sitting at the front desk of the mechanics shop. She could see him through the large window. He looked up from his computer and locked eyes with Anabelle for a second; she hurriedly looked forward and mashed the gas pedal. She couldn’t believe he had looked at her. Anabelle felt her cheeks get hot as she thought of Devon looking into her eyes. How it would feel to be held by him, to kiss him.
She still had a smile on her face when she pulled up in front of Cicely's gated home. The largest and grandest home in the town, no one else had towers or bay windows. And practically no one had two stories, let alone a third! She grabbed her old, beat up phone and sent a short “I’m here” message to Cicely. A few minutes later the gates opened and the stunning girl was running down the front steps of her home. Anabelle pulled into the circular driveway and unlocked her door. Cicely jumped in and leaned over to give the other girl a warm hug.
“You look happy today An!”  Cicely noticed the large dopey smile plastered all over her face. Anabelle blushed all over again and shook her head.
“Just happy to see you, girl.” Anabelle hated being called An, she was named after her mother and loved her name. Cicely rolled her eyes and laughed. They drove out of the gates and turned right towards the center of town.




Ben walked down the ramp to greet the driver of the refrigerated truck about to pull up to the back door of the funeral home. It was the easiest way to transport all of the bodies, even though it wasn’t conventional. He shook hands with the man and showed him where to back up to make it easiest for his crew. Rick was really the only one strong enough to unload all of them. Grace would be organizing all of the instruments needed and Carrey would get all the paperwork. It was up to Ben himself to help move the corpses down the two flights of stairs to the preparation room. It was going to be hard work. He wished that Bob had the wherewithal to send more than one person to help. Luckily, two more cars pulled up behind the large truck and four more strong men jumped out. Ben might not have to do too much moving.

When the work was all done Ben, surveying the sea of corpses surrounding him and his staff , felt a cold chill run down his back. Would they work fast enough to get them all done by tomorrow morning when the news crew would show up? He saw Carrey touch one of the young women on the gurney and worried a little about the poor girl. When you are so young and lose your parents its hard to come to terms with death. Maybe she shouldn’t be down here, he thought, maybe I should send her up to do the paperwork and talk to the diggers. She can take care of everything upstairs.

“Carrey.” He motioned for her to come over to him. “Why don’t you go up to my office and get the paperwork started and sign off on everything from the hospital? We also need to talk to the diggers, Marty and James Cyrus. If you could get a hold of them and get them down here as soon as possible that’d be great. The funeral will be tomorrow for everyone. I want to be ready. Thank you, dear.” He placed his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly way and smiled down at her. He hoped she would feel comforted; instead she was insulted that Ben would think she couldn’t handle it. She took a deep breath and smiled back at him. Then sadly opened the door and walked up the stairs.
Bob Markum greeted Anabelle and Cicely as they walked through the back door of the hospital. Bob was in his office faxing the paperwork that needed to be completed to Ben at the funeral home.
“Anabelle! How are you m’dear?” He had been here for so long he felt as though he knew everyone. Bob was the oldest person at Welloak Valley Hospital. He had seen two fires, one earthquake and about 350 dead while working. Considering he was the head pathologist in charge of the Hospital Morgue 350 wasn’t that many. 30 years of dead bodies.

Anabelle didn’t like Dr. Markum. She tolerated him, sure, but only for her father. They worked together so often that Dr. Markum was practically her uncle; at least that’s what he always called himself. She always thought he was creepy. Cicely waved in Bob’s direction then pulled Anabelle further down the hall so they wouldn’t be stopped. She looked over her shoulder at the man and smiled.
“Sorry, Dr, Markum,” Cicely shouted down the hall. “Don’t want to be late for work, ya know?”

Anabelle smiled at Cicely. She could get away with being rude to the doctor, lucky for Anabelle. They climbed the flight of stairs up to the nurse’s station on the first floor and logged on the computer to clock in for work. Anabelle covered her long dark hair with a bandana and turned to Cicely who was doing the same thing.
“Ready?” Anabelle and Cicely grabbed their cleaning supplies and filed down the hall to the first patients room.

Ben was exhausted. Seven hours of working on these corpses and they were almost done. He had sent Grace home 20 minutes ago. Not much else the embalmer could do after every body had been pumped full. Rick was sewing up the last of the strange looking wounds on the nearest body. The elderly man was obviously attacked by something. What, Ben didn’t want to try to find out. He just went about his business. If dear Dr. Markum didn’t want to talk about it, he wouldn’t make a fuss. After all Dr. Markum was the one who got him this job. Don’t ruin it. He looked to Rick with a nod and walked out the door to the stairs. They did as much as they could tonight. They’d start bright and early the next morning. Rick snipped the thread, put the needle and scissors back in his kit and turned to walk away. He caught movement in the corner of his eye. Did that corpse just move? He stopped and stared at the small hand of the young woman. Did she just twitch? Ben called from the next floor up; Rick shook his head and turned towards the door. He had obviously been working too long on these poor people. He was seeing things. He stopped to lock the door behind him and stomped up the small staircase. Ben was waiting by the front door to lock up. Rick smiled at him wearily as he walked out the door and down the steps to the dirt parking lot where his beat up Camaro sat in the closest parking space. The faded Navy sticker adorning his back window made him smile that much more. Five years ago he had been a combat medic in the war. He was born to sew up wounds. No matter how weird they looked. He unlocked his door and turned to see Ben following him towards the parking lot.
“6 AM tomorrow, friend.” Ben grimaced at Rick. He knew it was earlier than they usually had to be at work, but if they wanted to get these people looking like they didn’t die then they needed to work from sun up. Especially since that camera crew was going to be there before noon. Ben was worried what they’d try to get out of him. He nodded at Rick. He knew Rick was concerned about the wounds too. What could they do about it Ben’s look seemed to say. Rick shook his head back, got in his car and drove away. Ben started for home as well.

Anabelle was excited for the party after work. She and Cicely started to get ready even before they clocked off. Cicely decided that Anabelle should try her hair up; Cicely was going to wear her naturally curly, blonde hair up as well. They ran down the back hallway, past Dr. Markum’s empty office and out the doors to the parking garage. Everything was so dark.
“Ugh. I hate when they don’t turn the lights on in the garage!” Cicely moaned to Anabelle. She turned towards the small blonde girl and looked her over once.
“What? Are you afraid of the dark?” Anabelle smiled menacingly at Cicely. The small girl frowned and swiped at her friend. They linked arms and started walking towards the elevator to take them to the top floor where they had parked hours before. The moon was full and bright. Illuminating their way down the sidewalk, but as soon as they entered the basement-like garage they could barely see a few feet ahead of them. Cicely grabbed tighter to Anabelle. Yes, she was afraid of the dark. You never know what could be right in front of you.

They slowly made their way to the elevator, the glowing EXIT sign helping to light up their feet. 20 feet ahead of them stood a figure. Not moving, standing still. Staring. Cicely saw him first and yelped.
“Who’s there?” Anabelle called out. The man slowly made his way, limping over to the two girls. When he was finally close enough to see the girls noticed he was wearing a torn dirty shirt and shorts. No shoes. He had one gaping bite mark on his leg.

“Help.” The man said before collapsing in front of the girls. Cicely Screamed.

Ben turned his big Suburban out of the parking lot of the Assumption Funeral Home, he felt as though he and his crew had accomplished quite a bit today. He felt bad for the poor souls, not having any family to claim them. But he knew that quite a few at Assumption Church had planned a good turn out for them, even if they didn’t know any of the deceased. He thought about the bodies on their gurneys all the way home. Why did all of them have those wounds? They looked like bites. He grabbed his phone at a stoplight and sent off a short text to Bob Markum: Almost completely finished with 12. Want to ask about tests done on them. Call me when you get a chance. Almost Home. The light turned green as he pressed the send button. He drove the last few miles home and silently hoped that Bob would call him soon.

“I need help! There’s a man in the parking garage who’s badly injured!” Anabelle ran in through the hospitals emergency entrance and yelled to anyone who would listen. Two nurses noticed her and grabbed a gurney and followed her out to the garage. The Doctor who heard the call also followed behind the nurses and ran to turn the switch on near the parking garage. The place was bathed in orange light as the nurses ran in to find Cicely sitting near the hallway holding her knees, crying. The man was nowhere to be found.
“Are you trying to play a joke on us, kid!” the male nurse asked Anabelle angrily.
“He-he just got up and-” The female nurse came over to Cicely to make sure she was ok. In the hallway behind them, the light flickered slowly. Crawling towards the girl and the nurse, slowly on his almost bare stomach. He reached the small blond girl and grabbed a hold of her beautiful hair. He pulled himself up slowly about to sink his teeth into her lovely neck.

Ben finally made it home. He slowly got out of his car and walked up the long driveway towards his front door. Strange, he thought Anabelle usually got home before he did, especially on nights that he worked so late. He looked at his phone to see if she had text him about going anywhere. Nope. He unlocked the front door and walked inside. Everything was normal; he walked into the kitchen and opened the freezer door. Pizza. His phone started ringing. He ran back into the front room to grab it. Anabelle.

“DADDY!” Anabelle was crying into the phone. “Cicely got bit!” Ben didn’t understand what she was saying.
“What bit her? A Snake? Where are you two?” Ben was sure they were somewhere they shouldn’t be. Foster’s farm. I bet they’re on Foster’s farm and a horse bit her. “Shit. Tell me where you are and I’ll come get you. I’ll call Dr. Markum and he can meet us there. He’ll help.”
“NO DAD!” Anabelle never yelled at her father. “ We are at the hospital! In the parking garage. A MAN BIT CECILY.” She screamed so loudly into the phone Ben had to hold it away from his head. He cussed again and pulled it back to his ear.
“What the hell do you mean? I’m leaving now. I’ll be there in five minutes. Are you safe?” Ben started walking out the front door.
“Yes. There’s Officer Jones here. They restrained him. But the doctor is checking out Cecily. Oh it’s my fault! I should’ve found out how to turn on the lights. I should never have left her alone with him!  OH!”
Ben got into the suburban and started it. “Stay where you are. I’m coming now.” He hung up the phone quickly and pulled out of the driveway. Speeding the whole way there, he made it in less than five minutes. He quickly and illegally parked in the emergency zone. Jumped out and ran through the double doors. There sat Anabelle, tears in her eyes. She was speaking to a female office that was writing down everything Anabelle said in a white notebook. Anabelle saw her father and jumped up immediately and ran to him. The officer watched the exchange and turned to Ben.
“Hi Ben. Everything is ok. Crazy man was in the parking garage, Anabelle ran for help when she saw he was injured. When she got back with the nurses the man was gone, he crawled back over and bit Cicely. Her parents are here. Waiting for her to come out of surgery. They’re going to fix it up just fine.” She turned to Anabelle. “Don’t worry, hon. It’s not your fault.”
Ben hugged his daughter and led her back to the chair she had been sitting in. He sat her down and kissed her forehead before turning towards the two other people in the room. Mr. And Mrs. Truman.
“Dave, Cass.” Ben greeted each of them with a handshake. “Sorry to meet you under such circumstances, but lovely to see you both, none the less.” Ben always did have a way with words. Cass Truman smiled warmly at the man. She always liked him. Dave Truman pulled himself up to his full 6 feet and puffed out his chest. He knew his wife was fond of the undertaker. And he didn’t like it. He curled his lip a little and rolled his eyes at the exchange between the two.
“Yes. Your irresponsible girl left our only daughter alone with a crazy man and he bit her. Truly bad circumstance.” Dave looked up at Ben; even at his full height he wasn’t nearly as tall as the other man. Ben almost looked shocked. He turned to Anabelle to see if she had heard. She still had her hands over her face and was crying. Officer Jones had sat down next to her and was rubbing her arm.
“Anabelle was being VERY responsible by trying to get the poor man help! Did you think to ask if Cicely offered to stay with him? She was a nurses’ assistant. You’d think she would want to help the man!” He flared at Dave Truman. “They didn’t know he was a psychopath!”
Dave breathed deeply and turned away from Ben. Cass looked at Ben apologetically and went to sit with Anabelle and Officer Jones.

Officer Emmet Lowe sat with his back to the wall watching the disheveled man twitch in his medicated sleep. He wondered who this crazy was… What kind of person is so messed up that he actually bites someone, Emmet thought. The nurse taking the vitals of Crazy glanced over at him. He smiled at her and nodded at the door. Jen shook her head.
“Aren’t you supposed to be making sure he doesn’t go anywhere?” She asked her boyfriend angrily.
“Not only is he sedated, but handcuffed to the bed. Where the hell is he going?” Emmet countered. Jen considered what he had said for a moment. Then smiled and winked at her boyfriend. She left the door open as she walked out. Emmet smiled and quickly followed behind her.
Cicely was finally out of surgery. The doctor told everyone you would barely even be able to see the scar on her shoulder. They also cleaned it out and made sure there were no bacteria. The man didn’t get a good enough grip on her to bite hard enough to break the skin, thankfully. Anabelle said goodbye to her, tearfully as her father escorted her back to his SUV from her hospital bed. Neither one of the girls were going to the party tonight.

Devon Reynolds heard what happened and immediately went to the mortician’s house. He was waiting for two hours before he thought maybe Anabelle wouldn’t be leaving the hospital tonight. If anything happened to her he didn’t know what he’d do. The girl was gorgeous but he didn’t think she even knew who he was. As he was about to start his car back up and pull down the long driveway he saw headlights slowly coming towards him.

Anabelle was asleep in the passenger seat of her father’s Suburban as they bumped over the long dirt driveway she was thrown forward in her seat and woke up with a start.
“Who could that be?” Her father saw the pickup truck in his driveway. He stopped and jumped out of his car. “Stay here, Anabelle.” He walked over to the truck and tapped on the window. Devon rolled his passenger window down and waved at Ben. Anabelle recognized Devon’s truck and honked the horn at her father. He waved her over and started to walk towards the house.
“Either he comes inside or you have five minutes. Your choice.” She nodded to her father and gave Devon a tilt of the head. He nodded and unbuckled his seat belt to follow her inside the house.


April 24, 2018

Devon awoke with a start. He was on a checked couch, his face smashed against one arm. A foot pressed against his butt made him realize he wasn’t alone. Anabelle Walkers was sleeping as well.
Ben had woken up at 530 despite only getting a few hours of sleep. He needed to finish his job at the funeral home and meet Rick at the preplanned time. When he walked past the living room doorway he wasn’t surprised to see Devon was sleeping on the couch. He was surprised, however to see his daughter sleeping there with him.
He shook his head, threw a blanket over his daughter, tucked a blanket under her head and walked out the door. For the first time in a very long time he stopped to lock the front door before leaving. You never know, he thought.

Driving through the empty streets of Welloak Valley, Ben started thinking about all the events that happened the day before. At least, he thought, today wouldn’t be any weirder.

Rick Topher pulled his Camaro into the closest parking spot in front of the Assumption Funeral Home. He didn’t sleep very well last night. The mass amounts of bodies he’d worked on yesterday didn’t help his flashbacks. The war was always in his nightmares, especially when he had multiple corpses to prepare at work. His eyes caught the front door before his headlights did. Something wasn’t right. 
It was open.

3e8z7r,1,2015-07-22,"Middle aged women calling me handsome? My age, not so much",[deleted],askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/3e8z7r/middle_aged_women_calling_me_handsome_my_age_not/,"So I was walking to church by myself this past Sunday morning and I was dressed up in business casual and as I was walking this lady, probably aged around 40-50 said ""oh my goodness, you look so handsome!""

That really made my day. I have this condition called alopecia which basically is a condition where I can't grow hair. I'm bald, have no eyebrows, or any other hair anywhere else on my body. I lost all my hair the summer after my sophomore year ended in high school. I'm 19 years old now and am about to be a junior in college.

I basically lost any confidence whatsoever when I lost all of my hair and I avoided girls pretty much until college started. I still played football in high school, but I was not feeling good about myself at the time. Now, I'm feeling a lot better about myself.

I just got an internship this summer and I'm experiencing the adult world by living on my own for three months. I keep my head up and smile at anyone I make eye contact with now. I stand up straight and keep good posture. I don't really wear hats anymore. It has gotten so much better since junior year of high school.

Sorry about all that information. But, I guess my question is why do middle aged women call me handsome, but girls my age don't really care? At least three strangers have called me handsome this summer (all middle aged women).

Sometimes I think it's because I have no hair and other times I think it's because girls my age want guys to initiate. Maybe it's because I looked really nice those days with the clothes I was wearing (but I still have to look somewhat attractive, right)?

TL;DR:Why do older women call me handsome, but girls my age could care less?

I would really appreciate any guidance on where to look for this.

To be the ideal human being. I woke up this morning and realized that I've already done it and now I have nowhere to progress.

Allow me to explain. I went to MIT and double majored in Computer Science and Theoretical Physics. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA and I went on a full ride so I didn't spend a dime on my 4 years there. I also had an internship each summer. Microsoft, Facebook and Google all begged me to work for them each summer. I graduated with 20 job offers all with $150k+ starting salaries and &gt;$100k in stocks and bonuses. I'm starting work next month at a top tech company in San Francisco. I bought a used van off Craigslist for $750 complete with a slightly used mattress and some pillows. Yes, there are a few stains on them from ungodly acts of yesteryear, but it's perfectly good! Waste not want not. I convinced my employer to funnel my earnings into an offshore account and pay me only $12k/yr so it looks like I'm homeless and in poverty. I've since applied to every government welfare program out there and lo-and-behold I was accepted into every last one. My cost of living will be $0.00, I will be paying no taxes, and in 10 years I'll be a multimillionaire. I'm literally perfect in every way! Now, if I can just figure out how to retire. This is where you guys come in. I have a 100% savings rate at ~$250k/yr. How can I ensure that I'll have enough to make it until 80? Is a 0.000004% withdrawal rate too risky?"
3e9fqw,3,2015-07-22,[advice request] I'm becoming my Nmom with my boyfriend! How do I stop?! [trigger:suicide],nboyfriend,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3e9fqw/advice_request_im_becoming_my_nmom_with_my/,"I'm coming here asking for advice as to how I can stop inadvertently treating my long-distance boyfriend of almost two years poorly. Over the last few months, he and I have gotten into many, many arguments regarding how busy he has been and how frustrated I have been that I haven't gotten to talk to him. He's across the country, working a full-time unpaid internship, he is taking classes, and he is making tons of friends who have a potential to be professional connections to him. I on the other hand, am working a part-time serving job at a restaurant, have just finished school, and am attempting to find a job relevant to the degree I have just received. I just see our fights as me asking him to make more time for me, him saying that he's going to try, and then he doesn't try and it is just more of the same. But according to him, starting a few months ago, he would tell me that when I would get upset at him, that I would sound exactly like my mother. Saying that I would yell when I didn't get my way, that I am unwilling to acknowledge that some days I won't get what I want, and that how I go about telling him what's on my mind that I do it in an accusatory way. 

Now my Nmom. She has always had a strong hold over me. She got divorced from my dad when I was very young, had full custody over me, never remarried, and focused all her energy on taking care of me. When she started working, she would leave me with my grandparents, and eventually we moved in with them, where I had basically three parents (mom, grandma, grandpa) all watching over me, while at the same time my mom and grandparents would have their parent-child spats. Over the last year and a half, my grandparents have been getting sick of my mom continuing to live there, since I have been away at school, and she can feasibly find a place of her own. My mom feels very unsupported, and has been lashing out at everyone, saying that no one loves her and that she is going to kill herself. No one is supportive of her using suicide and verbal assault, so she has more or less lost any support from anyone that she had. Being so far-removed physically from the situation, I don't know what's going on. I've talked to my grandparents, and talked to my mom, they both tell me different stories, and I tell them I don't know who to believe. My grandparents are more than understanding, they don't want to put me through this, they tell me to call them only when I am able to, and they tell me they love me no matter what. My mother, on the other hand, gets frustrated with me for calling them as opposed to calling her, gets frustrated when I tell her that I don't know who to believe, and this usually leads to not so great things. She has screamed at me, hung up on me on the phone multiple times, told me that she was going to kill herself and that it would be all my fault and that I'd have to live with that, it goes on... In short, when she doesn't get her way, she flips out, and everyone in my family has a hard time dealing with it, so no one does till it gets to a point where we have to. 

Now back to my boyfriend. We have been fighting so much, over the same things, that it is wearing both of us down very thin. He is trying to make time for me, but is having to sacrifice other things he cares about to do that. I am also having to make sacrifices to make him happy, lending him money since he is getting no income working his unpaid internship and when I can tell that he's struggling financially (even when he refuses to ask for it), sending him love letters and Starbucks gift cards and things of that nature to show him that I care. However, a few days ago, we got to a point where I told him I thought a break would be best, as we have been fighting nearly every day. Neither of us are the happiest right now, and he agreed that a break would be best. However, we're still somewhat talking, instead of trying to make each other happy we're just airing out our personal problems, which is draining.

However, in talking, I realized something. I get upset with him when I don't get to talk to him, just like my mom gets upset with me when I don't take the time to talk with her. From my perspective, it's just a sad frustration, but with him, it comes across as anger, just like my mom's frustrations come across with me. When I ask him a question on something, I'm just curious, but he sees me bringing things up in accusatory manners all the time, just like my mom brings questions up in what I see as accusatory manners with me. I used to not think it was as big of a problem, but every day, I see it more and more. It has come to the point that when I do it through a text without thinking to my boyfriend, I apologize in the next text message almost instantaneously. I have told him that I recognize that the hold my mom has over me has me in a funk, and I can see how she treats me rubbing off on me, and that I want to stop treating him like this. Because being on the receiving end of it from Nmom, it hurts like crazy, and the last thing I want to do is put him through it, too. 

So, my question for you all is how do I go about stopping these behaviors (getting excitable to the point that I appear angry and addressing issues in an accusatory manner, mainly) with someone that I care about?  Should I talk to a professional about it again (I've went to counseling for the last two years, but recently stopped)? Are there any reads that anyone recommends for getting through this? Was addressing it with him the right thing to do? And do you all have any more questions for me, as I wrote this in one sit down, so there may be things that I did not articulate on as well as I could have?

I've been sub'd to this community on my real account (throwaway for reasons) for a long time. I've used other posts for advice in terms of myself, and really appreciate the help that this community has given. I'm hoping you all will help me out here. I don't want to lose the man that I love.

3e9ww7,9,2015-07-22,Registered Dietitians and Other Career Paths,SN2SMP,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/3e9ww7/registered_dietitians_and_other_career_paths/,"Hello all, I recently completed my Dietetic Internship. It's still a bit surreal, honestly! It was fantastic and I feel I've grown so much from this past year. My internship was a coordinated MS program, so I will be staying an extra year to finish my MS in Nutrition.

I find the idea of RDs with other credentials/experiences/etc. fascinating - I've met and spoke with some unique individuals who incorporated their unique perspectives from other fields into their work as RDs - education, psychology, epidemiology, even business! What do you all think about this - do you think this is helpful in moving the field forward, possibly even necessary? I understand that a graduate degree will be required for RDs in the coming years, though I am not too keen on the specifics - notably, does it have to be a graduate degree in Nutrition, or would other graduate degrees suffice? If so, this could lead to more unique coordinated DI programs in the future, such as those offering an MS in a different field (I'm not too versed on current programs, so I'm not aware whether or not these already exist).

When I began my undergraduate studies, I initially was a typical pre-med student, mostly because I was lost and unsure of what I wanted to do (I did not realize dietetics was an option at that time). During those years, my mother had been diagnosed with cancer and eventually passed away. Witnessing the toll it had on her, especially during her last days at the hospital, was difficult and at that point, I did not think I was cut out for medicine. This was around the time I learned of the dietetics route and changed paths.

The dietetic path gave me an appreciation for the sciences and showed me that I had a knack for them. I became the biochemistry nerd, and I loved it. It helped me do well in the process of finding a DI. When I started clinicals this past year, I was concerned as to how I would react - would it be just as difficult as witnessing my own mother's ordeal? The experience ended up being life changing - in a good way. I realized my love for biochemistry really connected with everything I experienced in the hospitals, and it was great seeing the application to everything I've learned. After months of seeing and speaking with patients, I realized it did not wear me down - I suppose nothing will ever be as hard as seeing your own parent go through that kind of hardship. Of course, the empathy is still there.

While I loved everything I was doing during my clinicals, and everything my preceptors were able to do and accomplish, I realized I also wanted to take part in more hands-on work - I realized I was ready for it. I want to help treat not only the nutrition related issues, but other aspects as well. After a lot of heavy thinking (whenever I'd get a break from studying and rotations, that is...), I decided that I will apply to medical school next year. I've considered the PA and RN route, but even though my life will be so much better (a.k.a. I'd actually have a life sooner), becoming a Physician ultimately fits in line with my personal career goals. I've already finished most of my pre-requisites and will finish the rest this upcoming year, as well as the MCAT. I'm sure my clinical experience will help me, at least in part, during the application process (fingers crossed, at the very least)!

Despite my prospects to become a Physician, I want to incorporate my experiences as an RD into my future career. I will take the exam, and do plan on working as an RD prior to my acceptance into medical school. Now, I understand that these are two different careers - there is no reason to become a Physician if I'm just going to be writing diet notes, for example. But at the same time, a common concern is how little nutrition education Physicians (and most other health professions) have. I've always been interested in this and what the results of an expanded nutrition foundation would be. I suppose I'm not really posting this for any purpose, but am interested in seeing the comments I'll get. Do you think the RD/MD combo can work well together? I know it will certainly help me in my interaction with patients - Physicians often give diet advice of some sort, I'll be well versed in this aspect. But do you think the two fields can supplement each other and improve as a result? Have any of you met, or at least know of any RD/MDs (or RD/DOs)? I personally don't - I tried googling some, but only came up with one who was advertising juicing and detoxes - not really in line with my interests! I also found another who was an MD in Anesthesiology, but my interests lie more towards Oncology or GI. 

Any input would be greatly appreciated, would love to get any discussion going!"
3e9x9f,7,2015-07-22,My [28M] assistant [22f] made a move on me last week. Not sure if I should tell my wife [28F] or just ignore it.,Artisdeadpan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e9x9f/my_28m_assistant_22f_made_a_move_on_me_last_week/,"I have known Emily, my personal assistant, for a little over a year. She originally was an intern for my business last summer and did an excellent job. I never expected her to be interested in working for me full time after graduation for one reason or another, but she reached out to me in the Spring and told me she was interested in coming back to work for me. I was in a position where my company could afford to hire her, and we needed the help, so I offered her a job as my assistant/admin and she accepted. Since then, she's more than exceeded my expectations in terms of her quality of work. 

She's a good employee, and I'd love to keep employing her, but after what happened last week, I don't know if that is wise. Last Wednesday wasn't the first time that Emily has stayed late to help me with a project. In fact, it's actually the norm, but that's only because she always volunteers to stay late and help me, which I mistook as her just trying to be helpful. However, this time I specifically asked her to stay late to help me. Nothing was weird about it until she insisted on the two of us sitting down and having a proper dinner instead of picking up fast food like we normally do. I didn't think that much about it so I told her that would be fine. While she went out to grab food, I had to go to the store to pick up some supplies. When I came back she had set up places for us at a table in my office with a candle in the middle. This made me uncomfortable, but I didn't want to be so bold as to assume she was trying to make a move. We sat down to eat, which was fine, but then she started asking me a lot of personal questions. Things like how many girls I've been with, how often I have sex with my wife, does she enjoy giving me oral. 

I told Emily that this was inappropriate and disrespectful to my wife, but she told me that she was just curious and meant no harm. After the meal, she tried to hug me as an apology, but I declined. She followed me out into the waiting area and kept insisting that I give her a hug to show her I wasn't mad. When I turned around, she pushed me down on the couch in the waiting/reception area, and started to kiss me.

Part of the reason why I haven't told my wife this yet is because I didn't immediately stop her. Our kiss went on for a few second before I pushed her off me. I went home after that, but it seems like that incident only embolden Emily. She been very touchy with me lately. It's not necessarily inappropriate but I feel like she's crossing some lines. She has also brought in baked goods and other little tokens for me. I've warned her to stop these things, but she claims that she knows I want her based on the kiss, which isn't true. I love my wife, and I only want to be with her.

Part of me thinks that I shouldn't share this with my wife because it seems like a blip on the radar. I'm not going to let Emily work with me late anymore or do anything else that will encourage her. I think she'll eventually see that I'm not interested and go back to dating boys her own age. But I feel like it could also be a mistake to not tell my wife. We've always tried to avoid having secrets between us, but also I worry that if she found out she might actually think I encouraged Emily or led her on in some way. 

Like I also said, I'd like to keep her because of her quality, but I'm not sure that will be possible if my wife is aware of what happened.
  
tl;dr: My assistant tried to make a move on me at work. I'd like to continue her employment, but I doubt that would be possible if my wife knew. Also, I think that the situation will resolve itself (Emily will lose interest), so I am not sure if it's worth it to get my wife upset. "
3ea12t,2,2015-07-22,"I [20 M] don't know how to tell my parents [58 M, 55 F] that I'm very worried about their health",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ea12t/i_20_m_dont_know_how_to_tell_my_parents_58_m_55_f/,"About two years ago, my parents caught me smoking weed and almost pulled me out of college. I convinced them to let me go back with a long list of conditions, one of which was that I'd start working out. At the time, I was 6' tall and only about 150 lbs. Quite the stick. Since then, I've been working out kinda off and on, and now hover around 165-170 and am very happy with my body.

On the contrary, I am very concerned about my parents' health. While they encourage me to go to the gym, run, go on backpacking trips, go climbing, etc. they do not participate in ANY physical activity. My mom has done several diets (just smoothies, calorie counters, weight watchers...), but she always ends up gaining it back and is now the biggest I've ever seen her. I'm not sure if she's obese, but she has to be pretty close. My dad is better, he's definitely not obese, and he goes on long bike rides every few days, but he does have a belly.

I'm pretty sure my dad would be open to me talking to him about it, but my mom is beyond sensitive. One time we were at the mall and she saw herself in the mirror and said ""I'm just not as slim as I used to be"", and I responded with ""well why don't you try that smoothie diet again? You had great results with that!"" and she didn't talk to me for almost 24 hours, claiming that that was a ""cruel"" and ""hurtful"" thing to say to her. Both of her parents are/were overweight, her mother much more so.

It almost seems like she's given up lately. She made me brownies the other day (a whole plate probably 12"" x 10""), and I had maybe 2 or 3 of them. When I got back from work the next day they were all gone. Another time I found a box of wheat thins in the pantry and opened them. I had a few handfuls, then put it back probably 80% full. Gone the next day. Same thing happens with cake, chips, any kind of snack almost. She does not exercise, and often makes jokes when I'm leaving for the gym like ""gee I wish I had your motivation"", and says things like ""I should go with you some time, or I might end up like my mother!"". It's obvious she's bothered by it, but I think she's disheartened by her many failed attempts. She has often times related her eating problems to alcoholism, saying that food is her drug/addiction. While I do not have this problem at all, I understand that this is a real problem for some people, and that relating her eating habbits to my own is not a fair comparison.

I don't know what to do. I've been living at home this summer because I have an internship around here, but I'm going back to college in a week and a half. I would like to sit down with them and talk about this, but I don't know how to approach it without offending them- especially my mom. Neither of them are working right now; my dad retired a few months ago, but has another job lined up he's starting in the fall. My mom really doesn't do much all day, and I can only imagine she's just lounging around, seeing friends, shopping, and eating.


   
**tl;dr: Going back to college in a week and a half, would like to have a conversation with my parents about my concern for their health before I go back. Mother is *very* sensitive about her weight. I need advice on how to approach this conversation with them.**"
3ea48p,6,2015-07-22,Multiplayer Mod Idea,abcdefghi76543,GTA,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/3ea48p/multiplayer_mod_idea/,"I recently thought of an improved idea for a roleplay type game in multiplayer.  The mod would allow you to create a character and then choose a job/occupation for the character.  The jobs/roles would be normal civilian (fast food worker, doctor, lawyer, banker, etc.), criminal/gangster (you would join a crime syndicate), police officer, fireman, EMT, government official, and rogue/serial killer.

NORMAL CIVILIAN:

Everyone would start off as a normal civilian.  You can choose one of many jobs.  Normal civilians can only carry knives as weapons.  A civilian can murder someone, but they will be sentenced to ""jail"" which means that they will be given a fine and a demotion at work.  Normal civilians can become criminals or any other track when there is an opening.

CRIMINALS:  There is a cap on criminals.  No more than 33% of the server's population can be criminals.  As a criminal, you can join a crime syndicate and select a career path.  For example, you can be a robber, drug dealer, or hitman.  

Robber Track:

Level 1:  Mugger - $500 per day

Level 2:  Store Robber - $1,000 per day

Level 3:  Car Thief - $1,700 per day

Level 4:  Bank Robber - $3,000 per day

Level 5:  Armored Car Robber - $5,000 per day

Level 6:  Art Thief - $10,000 per day

Level 7:  Master Thief - $30,000 per day

Drug Track:

Level 1:  Dealer - $1,000

Level 2:  Supplier - $5,000

Level 3:  Soldier - $7,500

Level 4:  Tier 1 Island Boss - $13,000

Level 5:  Tier 2 Island Boss - $20,00

Level 6:  Kingpin - $30,000

Hitman Track (targets politicians and other criminals):

Level 1:  Clean Up Man - $1,000

Level 2:  Low level assassin - $5,000

Level 3:  Mid level assassin - $7,500

Level 4:  High level assassin - $15,000

Level 5:  Master assassin - $30,000

POLICE CAREER TRACK:  Has a cap.  Only 15% of server can be police.  The chief of police plays the game like an RTS, they can see where every crime is and dispatch cops to the areas of crime.

Level 1:  Cadet - $2,000

Level 2:  Beat Cop - $7,500

Level 3:  Sergeant - $14,000

Level 4:  Lieutenant - $20,000

Level 5:  Captain (controls island) - $25,000

Level 6:  Chief of Police $30,000

FIREMAN:  You put out fires.  Only 4% of the server can be firemen.

Level 1:  Cadet - $2,000

Level 2:  Normal Fireman - $7,500

Level 3:  Engineer - $13,000

Level 4:  Squad Leader - $17,000

Level 5:  Battalion Chief - $23,000

Level 6:  Fire Chief - $26,000

Level 7:  Fire Marshall - $30,000

EMT PATH:  Only 4% of the server can be EMTs.

Level 1: EMT Pay Grade 1 - $6,000

Level 2: EMT Pay Grade 2 - $12,000

Level 3: EMT Pay Grade 3 - $18,000

Level 4: EMT Pay Grade 4 - $24,000

Level 5: EMT Pay Grade 5 - $30,000

POLITICIAN:  You can make server laws and determine how normal citizens can ""behave"".  Normal citizens can vote on the laws.  The mayor and high ranking politicians are often targets of hitmen.

Level 1: Intern - $3,000

Level 2: Desk Secretary - $8,000

Level 3: Mayor Aide - $13,000

Level 4: Lawmaker - $17,000

Level 5: Comptroller - $23,000

Level 6: Mayor - $30,000

ROGUE/SERIAL KILLER:  You work alone and kill random civilians.  Your goal is to stay out of the view of Law Enforcement.  If you get caught, you must return to normal civilian status.  Normal civilians can become the rogue when the other rogue is captured by law enforcement.  The rogue gets ten free kills before he/she is detected by law enforcement.  The rogue is payed whatever he/she finds on dead bodies.  There can be only one rogue.

OTHER GAME MECHANICS:

Things like car accidents and injuries can be fixed by calling 911.  If a person gets in a car accident with a criminal, the person responsible for the wreck will be put on the crime syndicate's ""hit list"" to be dealt with by a hitman.  "
3eaflm,3,2015-07-23,"Love after N abuse [TW: Neglect, Abandonment]",bumblebee14,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3eaflm/love_after_n_abuse_tw_neglect_abandonment/,"Tomorrow will mark 4 months since I put my NC letter in the mail. I haven't had contact with any members of my FOO except for my sister since. After I went NC, I grieved pretty hard. I had a lot of anxiety from ongoing stalking by my Ndad, which led me to have pretty regular contact with the police (which is discussed in some of my past posts).

I was finally able to leave my previous residence and move half way across the country for an internship. The distance has definitely helped me heal. I will be living in a different part of town once I move back for school.

My boyfriend visited me last week, and we got to have our first sort-of vacation, which is something we've wanted but weren't able to afford. He left two days ago. I figured out that I wasn't sad because I missed him, but sad because of how much better my life is with him in it. I feel completely stunned. 

I thought about it all day at work, and basically came to the conclusion that it was like my Nparents never loved me at all. It's possible that neither of them would be capable of loving another person to begin with (even each other), but over the past few months, I've realized that they made everything in my life about them. They had me to validate their existence. Neither of them ever attempted to console me when I was sad, even to tell me that it was going to be okay. I always wanted to talk to them about the cool engineering research I do, and they just ignore me when I try to talk to them about it. 

I feel so disgusted. When I was a kid, I always assumed that I would understand the things they did that didn't make sense when I was older. I will be 23 in about a week, which makes me a few months younger than my Nmom was when my Nparents got married. When I was a kid, I legitimately thought they were just doing their best. Yeah, we were poor as fuck for a while, but that shouldn't have prevented them giving my siblings and I the love and care we deserved. My boyfriend's parents were poor when he was a kid, and he tells me about how his parents sometimes went hungry so that he could have food, and how they saved for months so that he could get the toys he wanted for Christmas. Anytime I asked for something my Nparents thought was expensive, they would just explode and talk about how ungrateful and spoiled I was.

My Ndad was a RAGING, UNCONTROLLED alcoholic when I was a kid. He was so addicted that he couldn't work. He passed out drunk at all of our birthday parties and couldn't go to all-day outings like amusement parks or zoos. What infuriates me more is that my Nmom did NOTHING to protect us. My Ndad got sober when I was almost 11, and she left us alone all the time with him. He would scream and punch holes in our walls. He drove drunk with us in the car and sometimes got lost. He would threaten to hurt us for things we didn't do--once he accused my 8 year old brother and I (age 10) of stealing his salmon skin off the hot grill. He yelled at us and made us cry and threatened to belt us, even though I am 100% positive that he just lost his shit and fed it to the dog or something. It disgusts me to know that my Nmom, who was in her 30s at the time, did NOTHING. Nothing. Even though her mom and my Ndad's parents offered to take us in. 

It didn't help that I am a high IQ/EQ person, and always felt like an adult trapped in a child's body. I wrote a journal piece a while back about being an adult in the care of 4 year olds, and thought it was a pretty good description of how my childhood felt. It also didn't help that I grew up poor as fuck in a rich area, and was pretty much ostracized by everyone at my high school. I acted out a lot once I got into college. I remember falling so hard every time a guy told me that he liked me. My Nparents had a strategy to convince me that I was so unlikeable that nobody wanted to be my friend. On those ""rank my friends"" apps for Facebook, 0 out of 15 people chose me on the ""who would you rather be handcuffed to for a day?"" prompt. I still have a hard time accepting that people want to be around me at all, even though I've been described by my supervisor as friendly and polite, and don't have problems making friends now that I'm in grad school.

I finally gave up on trying to get them to love me. I always tried to obey them and their rules, but it was never enough. Our relationship revolved around me walking on eggshells in attempts to not make them mad. The hardest blow in my NC experience was the finality; the realization that I was never going to get the parental love I deserved. I don't miss them, but that realization still makes me very sad. 

I now understand so much about why some people who are deprived of love and attention act out. It feels so different to be loved completely by another human being. To know that you have someone that wants to help you be a better person, and do little things to make you happy. I've never had a person in my life who protects me like he does.

My Nmom screamed at me over the phone in January, and he held out his hand and asked for the phone. Even though we had been dating for nearly three years at that point, he had never met my Nmother and told her to shut the fuck up. Then he hung up. I wasn't mad. I was just overwhelmed by fear. He apologized to me and told me that he just couldn't take it anymore. 

I don't have any words for how much his love has changed me, or how much better I feel now that I was able to get away. The more and more I think about it, the more I realize how screwed up my Nparents are."
3eagzr,1,2015-07-23,[NAW] Thoughts on interning at Amazon,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3eagzr/naw_thoughts_on_interning_at_amazon/,"I can’t believe I’ve allowed Amazon to drag me this low…

Over the course of my college career and certainly during this internship, I have learned that your happiness is something that you own. Amazon is very keen about the concept of ownership. Ownership is the 2nd principle out of their fourteen leadership principles and is arguably the most important outside of customer obsession within the scope of the company. These principles are ultimately what drive the company and fuel its destructive culture. 

Today, I’ve decided to own my happiness. I’m no longer allowing Amazon to influence it. Today, I have decided to prioritize my own happiness over Amazon’s bottom line. 

I clocked out at 5pm today. Unit test were failing. The pipeline is broken. And it strangely felt good. It was a liberating experience. 

From Amazon’s point of view, the overall goal of the internship is to evaluate you to see if you are fit for a full-time hire or return internship. I believe the return rate is approximately 85% (unsubstantiated claim based on a Quora post). From my perspective, the other 15% can most likely be broken down into three categories:

* Individuals who legitimately did not perform well
* Individuals who received offers from competing companies
* Individuals who did not receive enough work to be properly evaluated.

I’m in an interesting situation. The software development process demands that every line of code written is thoroughly reviewed by your peers. This idea is good in theory, but if your peers aren’t invested in your project, it becomes very difficult to force them to review your code. If there’s no incentive for them to review your code, then there really isn’t any reason to get around to it. I’m in this strange situation where I’ve been tasked with modifying a service that my manager is not even responsible for. The manager that IS responsible for this service has absolutely no incentive to see my code pushed through and deployed. The engineers who ARE responsible for maintaining this service, have no incentive to review my code. My performance is suffering because of people who don’t care about my project. I can't really blame them though. 

But I guess this is a taste of the real world.

My mentor has me convinced that it’s much worse at other companies and that I should be grateful for the opportunity. Which he's right to some degree. But still. I’m not good at playing the game.

Thankfully, this is only my first internship. I've got two additional summers before I graduate so there's still time to figure out if this is for me.

That being said...

Today is the day where I am taking ownership of my own happiness. Amazon has no obligation to keep their employees satisfied or content. I’m choosing now to acknowledge that. I was naïve to believe that any company had any stake in my own happiness. At the end of the day, it is about Amazon’s bottom line. I apologize if this is spam. This is just the perspective of a failing intern.

I wanted a return offer. But now I’m indifferent. If a company can upset me and get under my skin this much, then why would I want to come back? 

This post and Quora has made me feel so much better. http://qr.ae/RGCe80

And I guess he’s right. It’s probably me. I’m ashamed to say I let this company upset me this much. 

“If your fidelity to perfectionism is to great, you never really do anything.” This has been especially true at Amazon. But no more. Tomorrow, I will be gone at 5pm. Hopefully interns can’t be placed on a PIP. 

I feel bad for my manager. He actually cared to some degree. But somehow, he’s in the same predicament I’m in. I feel that he has some responsibility or stake in my performance. But he can’t do anything about the fact that I’m underperforming due to the dysfunctional team I’m working with. He’s a really good manager. But he’s not managing the team I have been placed on.

I should probably go to bed. I've got 1 more week. Seattle's been fun but I'm ready to go back to Chicago.

I am currently a law student, and I've been seeing someone who is in the tech industry for a few weeks now.  He's pretty much everything I want in a serious relationship:  he's cute, caring and romantic.  

However, there are a few issues that have come up.  He is very successful in his professional life.  I am not.  I worked a few years before law school in low paid administrative jobs.  During law school, 
I have struggled to get internships.  (I currently have one, but it's 
low paid and I don't know if they will make me an offer for after I graduate.)  

He really tries to sympathize with me.  Recently, he compared his stress with starting a (successful) business with the stress I go through every day.  I believe fully that starting a business was very stressful.  However, it really bothers me that he compared a few months of stress with the 6 years of pain, anguish, frustration, heartbreak that I have experienced.  It's ok that he doesn't know what I've been through, because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  However, I get irritated when he compares starting a company with an established career to fall back on to staring down a quarter million in loans with potentially no way to pay it back.  

Is the gap too wide to overcome?  "
3eaqtg,1,2015-07-23,[PI] Breaking Beautifully,[deleted],WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3eaqtg/pi_breaking_beautifully/,"The room was dark, curtains closed, a dim lamp giving just enough light to outline two figures.  One was lying on the couch, the other sitting in a chair with his head in his hands, eyes bloodshot, hair disheveled. 

“Catherine, Catherine. What am I going to do with you.” Michael said, looking down at the frail figure lying on his couch. She stirred in her sleep, and he put his hand on her slender, scar crossed arms. 

Michael and Catherine had went to high school together, but hadn’t gotten to know each other till they bumped into each other at the same house party at university. They ended up staring at the stars and talking while music blared behind them. He was studying civil planning, and wanted to go back to the town after he graduated, help develop and change things there. She was a journalism student, and she wanted to go out and change the world. He was impressed with her ambition, and she found herself drawn to his honesty. They talked and talked, well into the morning. They smiled at each other, exchanged numbers, and promised to do this again sometime. 

“If you ever need anything, I’ll be there.” They had said.

They did meet up while still in their studies,now and again, but soon Catherine accepted an internship, and Michael was hired at a firm back in town, and life took over. Meetings got less frequent, then stopped. Michael went to work as he had always dreamed, drafting and planning, changing fallow fields into parks, opening libraries and little shop lined streets. 

Then, one night Michael opened his door to find Catherine outside, gaunt, miserable, ready to collapse. He took her in, sat her down, and she began to talk. She talked of how she had tried to change things. To shine lights on the dirty places of the world, show everyone what was really going on. She hadn’t anticipated how much the shadows wanted to stay in the dark. They fought dirty, tooth and nail, and pulled her down with them. So she started drinking. Just a little bit, whenever the fight got a bit too hard. But they started hitting harder, she began to drink more, and more. She lost her job after she stumbled into work on Tuesday, thinking it was Monday, in the clothes she had worn on Friday. She lost the rest soon after. So here she was. 

Michael put a lot into that week. He talked with her every day, got her off the drink, got her back to the vibrant, ambitious Catherine that Michael had known in university. After two weeks, he sent her off. She left with a smile, a wave, and a promise.

She was back four months later. She was crying, face smudged, and as soon as Michael opened the door, he was tackled with a desperate, clenching hug. He held her close as sobbed, and closed the door softly behind her. She had tried to fight the shadows again, and again they dragged her down, kicking and screaming. They slandered her, spread rumours, started all kinds of gossip. One night, she put a razor to her arm, and swiped. Just to see the bright red, to see the life that was in her, to try to prove to herself that she could still feel, still fight, withstand the pain. It wasn’t enough. No matter how hard she fought, the shadows hit ten times as hard. So she was back. 

It had been one month since then. Catherine was a fighter, but the fight was killing her. He couldn’t talk her out of it. She still wanted to fight the shadows, to change the world. 

Michael buried his head in his hands. Everytime she tried, the world just ended up changing her. But he knew, as soon as she left, she’d go right back to it. 

One day, the world would break her, shatter her beyond anything. But that wouldn’t stop Michael from trying to put her back together. 

Michael grinned. That’s why Catherine wouldn’t quit. Even she shatters, that wouldn’t stop her from trying to put the world back together.

3eb2ow,4,2015-07-23,I broke up with my GF yesterday because our relationship inevitably was going to be a long distance one. I still have feelings for her and miss our daily contact.,vent6789,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/3eb2ow/i_broke_up_with_my_gf_yesterday_because_our/,"A message from the other side of a breakup.

Yesterday I called my GF of 6 months and told her that I didn't think a long distance relationship is good for any of us. She completely agreed, and even told me that she was thinking about doing the same thing. Now, this doesn't mean that we've lost our feelings for each other, only that we both rationally agreed that we don't have the necessary foundation on which to commit to a LDR. I remember she said our timing was really bad, and that we sadly met at the wrong time of our lives.

It took me a while to prepare for this conversation, and honestly I was a bit hurt about how cool she was with it. I know, however, that she is that type of girl that doesn't like to show ""weakness"", even though I she can get emotional. Anyway, my first thoughts were a mixture of relief and sadness. Now, on day 2, the relief part is gone, and I'm stuck with sadness. 

On a daily basis we live and work at opposite sides of the country. We met through mutual friends in our home town during fall last year. She was the first to show interest and initiate contact. I, on the other hand, was not interested at first. 

During chistmas, however, we got to hang out, party, laugh, kiss and have a good time with our mutual friends. From there we took it very slowly until this easter, when we met again and where our feelings started to get more serious. We had daily contact via texts/calls. Both she and I were eager and pleased with where this was heading, and we looked forward to spend this summer together. As a recent graduate in the oil industry, I had basically no hope in getting relevant work this summer(bad times for the oil industry in Europe), which meant I could take a temporary shit job and live with my family in my home town, where she would spend almost her entire vacation of 5 weeks. 

However, I did get a late job offer this summer as a paid summer intern. This was an offer I simply could not refuse. My ex was happy for me, but later revealed that she got a little demotivated by it, since it meant that we would spend far less time together. 

We had a great time those few times we spent together this summer. At this point we were at a point where our relationship wasn't casual enough to be just a holiday/vacation hook up-thing, and probably not serious enough to commit fully to a LDR. So as I already mentioned, we broke it off.

Now, here's the thing. Since we have mutual friends back in our home town, we are inevitably going to bump into each other during holidays and perhaps a weekend now and then. Even though I'm the one who ended this (according to her, she was thinking about doing the same thing), I really miss our daily contact and the bond we share. I haven't fallen for someone in many years until I met her, and my feelings towards her are still the same. Any advice on how I can look at her as just a friend, those times we inevitably bump into each other during holiday parties and such? Skipping them won't be an option, as that's one of the few occasions where I can catch up with my best friends."
3eb3ep,8,2015-07-23,I have had Mirena for two years and it's been great! Thought I would share.,TheIUDstoryaccount,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/3eb3ep/i_have_had_mirena_for_two_years_and_its_been/,"Hi everyone,

I just wanted to contribute my (very positive) experience with Mirena to this sub.

I got the IUD inserted a little over two years ago. Before that, I had been rather unsatisfyingly on and off the pill for three years: taking it when I was in a relationship and only using condoms when I wasn't. The main reason that got me looking for a new contraception is that I was simply unable to remember to take my pill every day, which made my contraception basically useless. However, as soon as I got off the pill and got the IUD, I realised that the pill had probably been making feel more and more like crap for a while.

I first went to the French equivalent to Planned Parenthood, which is actually quite different since it is not independent but part of the ""solidarity services"" of the regional government. There, I had a consult with a midwife before seeing the gynecologist (as is usual). The gynecologist lady prescribed me a bunch of tests and and I had to go to a laboratory do blood tests and a cervix swab to look for any possible infections or diseases. When I went back with my clear lab results, we made an appointment for the week after for the insertion of the IUD. She gave me two Cytotec pills (French name of this medication against stomach ulcers that has the side effect of opening your cervix) that I would have to take two hours before the appointment. She wrote me a prescription for ibuprofen and the Mirena IUD itself, that was only partially covered by the French public and compulsory health insurance and was not covered by my crappy complementary health insurance either at the time so it cost me something like 60€. 

Like everyone, I had heard a lot of things about the horrible pain of the insertion. It really wasn't that bad at all for me, but I also have a very high tolerance to pain I think. It was an intern that actually did the insertion, guided by the doctor. The feeling was very strange and undescribable because I had never felt anything in that particular area of my body. There were maybe 30 seconds of breath disturbing pain but it was tolerable. Also, my cervix was apparently very long and they had to stop half way up there... When it was done, the intern unclipped whatever cissor/clamp looking thing she had in there. That hurt me a lot for a split second and a let out a cry. I spent a while longer at the center, probably them just making sure I wasn't fainting or anything. I was totally fine immediately afterwards, I had exams and I was able to go straight back to the library to study. For a couple of hours, it felt like bad period pain but that was all. 

Not very romantic, but the IUD can have effects on your digestive system just like your period does: I had diarrhea immediately after the insertion and I was constipated for a couple of months after the insertion. The constipation caused an small anal crack which took a long time to heal and hurt like hell whenever I needed to go to the toilet. It was really annoying but I dealt with it by taking some paraffine laxative and eating a lot of linseed all the time, which was great for my hair as a bonus. It took a while but eventually went back to normal. I feel like if I had known about this, I would have been more proactive and probably avoided the anal crack, so be prepared!

However, probably one or two months later, at what I interpreted as my first ovulation after the IUD, I had horribly bad pain. This also coincided with my boyfriend returning from abroad and with the first sex I had since the IUD. I called the gynecologist and she told me to come immediately. She told me that my uterus and cervix were tipped sideways, which isn't a problem. She said that the IUD makes the cervix and the uterus more sensitive and that the ovulation and the sex were probably triggering painful contractions. So there was nothing bad going on but the pain was seriously terrible. I got better after a couple of days but intercourse was randomly painful for a long time (months? can't remember). Still tolerable.

The next few months were amazing. I started to feel better in many different ways. I don't know if this was due to getting off a pill that wasn't a good fit for me or if the IUD made me feel better in general. I had spent one year off the pill before but I had not seen any of the positive changes that came with the IUD. 

First, I started to lose weight. I am 1,54m tall (apparently that is 5 feet ⅝ inch in American) and I was 59kg at my heaviest (130 lbs). Over the year following the IUD, I lost 8 kg (17 lbs). I was just a lot less hungry than I used to be. It is not all down to the IUD however because starting to lose weight like that motivated me to start exercising again, which I used to do a lot but had given up completely. Living with my boyfriend made me change my eating habits to much healthier food too I think. But the IUD loss of crazy appetite was definitely the kickstarter.

My breasts deflated and were not sore and tender anymore. That was amazing because I was so used to them being that way that I didn't even think they could feel this good anymore. Now, I don't have to be aware of the presence of my boobs all the time.

My hair got softer and my skin cleared up. Definitely because of the hormonal changes of the IUD because it's been this way for two years plus, even after I stopped eating all the linseed with their Omega 3.

I didn't have bad mood swings related to my cycle anymore, which had been there consistently through pill or no pill time. It was good to not feel in mental slavery of my hormones.

I almost don't have periods anymore but this is highly irregular and it's changing again. Periods first progressively decreased consistently for a long time. I wasn't comfortable with tampons so I got a menstrual cup. Eventually I didn't need it anymore but now I do again, even if it's just spotting and not really bleeding at all. My natural cycle is long and fairly irregular (around 30 days but could vary by 5 days, I don't know why) and periods were never painful for me. Periods were still not painful at all but the ovulation was a little bit after the IUD: I could feel for two days for the first year. Now, I'm still able to tell when I'm ovulating but it doesn't hurt anymore at all.

Intercourse can still cause pain or just be uncomfortable when I'm ovulating but we just do it in a position that is less deep I guess. Boyfriend felt the threads maybe twice ever.

I don't have to worry about being pregnant anymore. I never worry about contraception and I almost never think about it at all. It's so great to be able to forget it! It really improved my quality of life.

That was quite a long story long but it's an accurate account of how the Mirena IUD has worked amazingly great for me (so far). Of course, it can't be perfect but the positive aspects far outweigh the negative here. 

I'm not saying it works for every woman: my best friend got the Mirena before me and had it removed after a year. She got acne, gained weight, felt extra moody and depressed and her libido was down. Eventually, she got quite anxious and paranoid about the IUD and thought about it all the time and what it was doing to her body. It was a very bad experience for her and everything got much better when she had it taken out (skin, mood, sex etc).

Contraception is like a journey and you shouldn't stop looking until you find what really works for you, so good luck with it! :)

3ebjpd,6,2015-07-23,Me [23 M] with my colleague [23 F] getting along pretty well until she started giving me a cold-shoulder recently,AsukaRe1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ebjpd/me_23_m_with_my_colleague_23_f_getting_along/,"I'm working as a intern copywriter(Majoring in Mass Communication) under a health supplement company for 4 months and I might be planning to extend my contract for another 2 months to wait for my convocation. She is a full time nutritionist working for over a year. 

During the 2nd month of my intern we started to get along after she invited me to a birthday celebration for a ex-colleague. We share similar interest such as enjoying watching movies, tv shows and badminton. I started to car pool with her since she stayed at her friend's house which is in the same neighborhood as me. We can get along pretty well with our conversations and we had breakfast together a couple of time before heading to work. At times we would even have short conversations through Whatsapp daily.

Since a few days ago until now she didn't respond very well to my messages by not replying to me. When we are travelling to work or after work we didn't spend much time talking to each other even though I was constantly trying to engage a conversation with her but she didn't seem to have any desire to continue with the conversation which I have to think of topics to talk about but to no avail. 

I think this is what we called giving a cold shoulder? I have experience similar situations back in my college days and it ended with cutting loose with the friendship. I can for see what our relationship will ended up with if I don't sort things right between me and her. What should I do? Shall I  talk things out with her to determine the reason why she is giving me a cold shoulder? I'm heading off to work tomorrow together with her so shall I talk to her on the road or should I try ask her out to talk about it at cafe?

Here is my approach: 
Using a genetic algorithm I can go through the search space (10^7) and find the inputs(a, b, c, d) that would fit my constraints.

Anyone know good genetic algorithms or greedy algorithms APIs where I can set my hard and soft constraints?

I've been been there for a year plus change now. 

For that year, I have been, for all intents and purposes, coasting. I work my 8 hours, I come home, do whatever chores need to be done and enjoy my free time however I want, I go to sleep and repeat five times a week. It's a job that has only a tangential at best connection to my degree, it's definitely not the start to anything resembling a ""career"", and I'm still nowhere close to knowing the answer to where that road leads or even how to find it. I'm not considering grad school anytime soon, I'm not taking classes or learning new significant skills, and I basically have no idea where I'm going to be and what I'm going to be doing beyond a year or two out (if that). 

And y'know what? I'm perfectly OK with that.

I spent most of high school and all four years of undergrad stressed out of my mind that I wasn't doing enough. If I didn't get enough good internships or network with enough professors or cram in enough extracurricular activities, I wouldn't be able to get a good job and make the considerable investment of college worth it. Nothing I did was good enough, because I always could be doing more. It was bad enough that I frankly probably missed out on a good number of opportunities because I was so paralyzed by the crushing weight of it all that I didn't do anything at all. Everything was all about the future, and how I felt in the moment didn't matter.

I graduated, and apparently all the stuff that did make it on my resume was good enough for me to only be on the job hunt for a couple months at a time. I landed at a stable if somewhat dull job with regular hours that pays me well (a lot more than many can say), I've got a few hobbies and the free time and money to actually pursue them (sort of, parents, talk to your kids about Magic: The Gathering), and I've got a great and supportive friend group who lift me up and who I wouldn't trade for anything. 

I think the real reason I feel so much better though is that I can finally worry about me, not theoretical me several years from now. I don't feel crushed under some vague impending future doom anymore. I made it, I graduated and got a job even if it's not the perfect job I wanted, and as the future doom sense fades a little bit more every day, I've come to realize how miserable it was making me and how much happier I am without it. I have time to focus on the present, on how I feel RIGHT NOW! I get actual free time to myself where I can READ BOOKS FOR PLEASURE! After the constant petty rat race of college, this is a revolutionary state.    

I'm sure a couple years or so down the line I'll get restless again and restart the cycle of questioning just what the hell I'm doing with my life, but for now, I'm going to enjoy not having a plan for a little while.

By Michael Manico  
  

I had an opportunity to talk to Wesley Walker recently.  To be honest this was NYJetsNews.com’s first “get”.  Wesley Walker, the legend himself.  Thirteen years of burning guys in the NFL.  While he may never have had the catch totals some other big name receivers had, he currently ranks 12th on the all-time average per catch list.  He was a game changer and a back breaker in his day.  Turning defensive lapses into points was his specialty.  He was the team’s spark plug, which ignited a potent Jets offense within inches of the Super Bowl in 1986.

When I caught up with Wesley online, he was very willing to talk to me.  New to Twitter, I may have been the first person to ask him for an interview via that media network.  Maybe a bit naïve to the access social media gives small websites to professional athletes of the past and present, he was nothing but friendly about my request.  Next thing you know, I had Wesley on the phone, and I was planning on arranging an interview time in the future.  Then he said something that I wasn’t prepared for, “how about now?”  I gulped hard and asked him to give me a few minutes so I could set up my voice recording software. I told Wesley I would call him back in a few moments.

This was one of those life experiences that will stay with me; I know I’ll never forget the duality of the conversation.   It was pretty amazing, spending twenty minutes on the phone with Wesley Walker, a childhood hero of mine, yet his words were too disturbingly real.  To be honest, I could have talked to him forever.  He shared a story that changed my perspective on the violence of the NFL.  I almost felt embarrassed to ask him questions about his playing days after the story he told me about his current health situation.  Hearing him bounce back and forth between pride and regret, I truly was not prepared for the discussion.

 

  
Wesley was physically disabled from his playing days.  I listened intently about all the surgeries, the rods, the screws, the numbness in his extremities, the repaired rotator cuff, and the failed ACL’s.  It was not what I expected.  It was too real.  One of my heroes sacrificed his body for the fans.  In Rome they had the Colosseum, where young men destroyed themselves for the entertainment of the masses.  In America, professional football serves the same purpose.

I heard about how lucky he was to have workers' compensation and healthcare from being a high school physical education teacher.  Not every  player had that “luxury.” The NFL only gave those who played when Wesley did a two year Cobra plan when they retired.  Those that got to get away unscathed were lucky he felt, but he didn’t sound bitter.  It was the truth.  He sounded very gracious for everything, but the pain and seclusion of a disabled and bed ridden life 24 hours a day would snap him back to reality.  He spent long hours staring at the ceiling, trying not to disturb his girlfriend while she slept, as he constantly hardly slept, requiring Ambien just to get a few hours.  Wesley was a social person, but medication and the constant pain robbed him of that for years.  He loved movies, but spending 24 hours a day watching them became unbearable.  The pain led to drinking or being on prescription pain killers to numb the pain.  He knew what was happening; he saw the worry in his children.  Wesley gave up the medications, but still thinks about how much easier it would be to let prescription narcotics take the pain away.  Being a physical education teacher, and spending the last 25 years enriching the lives of children, this was not the example Wesley wanted to set for his own kids.

When NFL commissioner Rodger Goodell’s name came up, Wesley’s tone became more serious.  It wasn’t that he didn’t understand why the NFL and the NFLPA didn’t do more to help his friends in need; the problem was that he understood exactly why.

“Money” was what Wesley told me.  What else could it be?  Maybe the deception was born from a need to protect the NFL’s reputation?  Just like Pete Rose and gambling on baseball, it’s the amount of time that has passed hiding the truth that tarnishes your image way more than telling the truth ever would.
 
No current player wanted to give up any part of their share to help those who needed it the most.  The former gridiron heroes who suffered alone, secluded, unable to live any kind of rewarding life would not get their help from the NFL.  Wesley was aware that the people around him helped him get through all of this.  Not everyone had that luxury.  Those who lost everything to play the sport now had nothing, and no one.  Goodell had to do more.  Wesley may have sensed his tone, and seemed to backpedal a bit and told me how he has always liked Rodger.  He was a former Jets intern, and someone Wesley knew in his playing days.  But Wesley felt the pain.  The pain that radiated through his body on a daily basis also made him aware he wasn’t the only one.  His brethren had sacrificed their lives and bodies for the NFL too.  Wesley just desperately wanted Goodell to help get everyone the medical care they need, and to stop lying to everyone about the risks of playing.  He thought things would change after his friend got in power for the better.  Unfortunately, it hasn’t.  The punches were avoided by the NFL with a dance that would make Muhammad Ali proud.  Tell the truth about head injuries, take care of the players, and be the hero everyone needs Rodger.  Work with the NFLPA, who is just as culpable in the hiding of the truth, and let it all out.  That is what Wesley is asking for.

I also asked Wesley if he thought teams could step up and take care of their own, and Wesley replied “You would think”.  We both knew it wasn’t happening.  There is no knight in shining armor riding in to save these men, just daily pain and depression.  For the Jets to help former players, they would be taking a stand against the NFL.  It is not a position they can take being in a league where everything is collectively bargained between the league and the players.

Through every silly question I asked, Wesley was nothing but polite.  He never seemed to get frustrated with me for a second.  After he took all that time to tell me about the suffering he is bearing in his life, I tried to plug a golf event I saw he was appearing in this upcoming October.  When he figured out what I was talking about after naming off a few charity events coming up, I asked him a stupid question, “Are you going to be playing in the event?”  He must have thought I wasn’t paying attention.  He just chuckled and dismissed me with a “Nah”.

Wesley was truly gracious throughout the entire time we talked. I had nailed it, mostly because Wesley led me through the entire interview. It wasn’t really that hard to be a good listener. I downloaded the audio to hear my interview. The recording was all static. Fail. Lucky for me I was able to get Wesley on the phone again the following week and record the interview again.

One of the most important things to take away from the second interview was that Wesley lost contact with his best friend from his playing days, Marvin Powell.  He had tried several times over the years to get in touch with him, and has had no luck.  Marvin was one of the greatest tackles to ever play for the Jets.

I took the liberty, for right or wrong, to track down Powell’s son, who also played in the NFL.  His son asked me one question when I told him who I was, “Why isn’t my dad in the ring of honor?”  It was a fair question that I didn’t have an answer for, one that might shed light on his distance from the organization.  I passed on Wesley’s contact information to Powell’s son, who is also named Marvin.  I hope it works out as Wesley truly misses his friend.  Marvin, if you’re out there, please give Wesley a phone call, will you?

The last question I had for Wesley was to ask for his opinion about a comment I saw Terry Bradshaw make years ago.  Terry said “There are a lot of wonderful people from New York, the rest of them are Jets fans.”  Wesley laughed. He struggled to remember his quote that was used when he was inducted into the Jets ring of honor. He just beamed with love for the Jets fans.

The quote that is in question?

“When I played this game, I loved the Jet Fans. I loved the fans, and that is really the most important thing for me.”

I uploaded the audio to youtube.  My phone was a failure, so I had to increase my voice volume afterwards so that's why my voice is poor quality. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tahov7Vtus

I listened intently about all the surgeries, the rods, the screws, the numbness in his extremities, the repaired rotator cuff, the failed ACL’s.  It was not what I expected.  It was too real.  One of my heroes sacrificed his body for the fans.  In Rome they had the Colosseum, where young men destroyed themselves for the entertainment of the masses.  In America, professional football serves the same purpose.

I heard about how lucky he was to have workers compensation and healthcare from being a high school physical education teacher.  Not every  player had that “luxury.” The NFL only gave those who played when Wesley did a two year Cobra plan when they retired.  Those that got to get away unscathed were lucky he felt, but he didn’t sound bitter.  It was the truth.  He sounded very gracious for everything, but the pain and seclusion that is a life disabled and bed ridden 24 hours a day would snap him back to reality.  He spent long hours staring at the ceiling, trying not to disturb his girlfriend while she slept, as he constantly hardly slept, requiring Ambien just to get a few hours.  Wesley was a social person, but medication and the constant pain robbed him of that for years.  He loved movies, but spending 24 hours a day watching them became unbearable.  The pain led to drinking or being on prescription pain killers to numb the pain.  He knew what was happening; he saw the worry in his children.  Wesley gave up the medications, but still thinks about how much easier it would be to let prescription narcotics take the pain away.  Being a physical education teacher, and spending the last 25 years enriching the lives of children, this was not the example Wesley wanted to set for his own kids.

When NFL commissioner Rodger Goodell’s name came up, Wesley’s tone became more serious.  It wasn’t that he didn’t understand why the NFL and the NFLPA didn’t do more to help his friends in need; the problem was that he understood exactly why.

“Money” was what Wesley told me.  What else could it be?  Maybe the deception was born from a need to protect the NFL’s reputation?  Just like Pete Rose and gambling on baseball, it’s the amount of time that has passed hiding the truth that tarnishes your image way more than telling the truth ever would.
 
No current player wanted to give up any part of their share to help those who needed it the most.  The former gridiron heroes who suffered alone, secluded, unable to live any kind of rewarding life would not get their help from the NFL.  Wesley was aware that the people around him helped him get through all of this.  Not everyone had that luxury.  Those who lost everything to play the sport now had nothing, and no one.  Goodell had to do more.  Wesley may have sensed his tone, and seemed to backpedal a bit and told me how he has always liked Rodger.  He was a former Jets intern, and someone Wesley knew in his playing days.  But Wesley felt the pain.  The pain that radiated through his body on a daily basis also made him aware he wasn’t the only one.  His brethren had sacrificed their lives and bodies for the NFL too.  Wesley just desperately wanted Goodell to help get everyone the medical care they need, and to stop lying to everyone about the risks of playing.  He thought things would change after his friend got in power for the better.  Unfortunately, it hasn’t.  The punches were avoided by the NFL with a dance that would make Muhammad Ali proud.  Tell the truth about head injuries, take care of the players, and be the hero everyone needs Rodger.  Work with the NFLPA, who is just as culpable in the hiding of the truth, and let it all out.  That is what Wesley is asking for.

I also asked Wesley if he thought teams could step up and take care of their own, and Wesley replied “You would think”.  We both knew it wasn’t happening.  There is no knight in shining armor riding in to save these men, just daily pain and depression.  For the Jets to help former players, they would be taking a stand against the NFL.  It is not a position they can take being in a league where everything is collectively bargained between the league and the players.

Through every silly question I asked, Wesley was nothing but polite.  He never seemed to get frustrated with me for a second.  After he took all that time to tell me about the suffering he is baring in his life, I tried to plug a golf event i saw he was appearing in this upcoming October.  When he figured out what I was talking about after naming off a few charity events coming up, I asked him a stupid question, “Are you going to be playing in the event?”  He must have thought I wasn’t paying attention.  He just chuckled and dismissed me with a “Nah”.

Wesley was truly gracious through the entire time we talked. I had nailed it, mostly because Wesley led me through the entire interview. It wasn’t really that hard to be a good listener. I downloaded the audio to hear my interview. The recording was all static. Fail. Lucky for me I was able to get Wesley on the phone again the following week and record the interview again.

One of the most important things to take away from the second interview was that Wesley lost contact with his best friend from his playing days, Marvin Powell.  He had tried several times over the years to get ahold of him, and has had no luck.  Marvin was one of the greatest tackles to ever play for the Jets.

I took the liberty, for right or wrong, to track down Powell’s son, who also played in the NFL.  His son asked me one question when I told him who I was, “Why isn’t my dad in the ring of honor?”  It was a fair question that I didn’t have an answer for, one that might shed light on his distance from the organization.  I passed on Wesley’s contact information to Powell’s son, who is also named Marvin.  I hope it works out as Wesley truly misses his friend.  Marvin, if you’re out there, please give Wesley a phone call, will you?

The last question I had for Wesley was asking for his opinion about a comment I saw Terry Bradshaw make years ago.  Terry said “There are a lot of wonderful people from New York, the rest of them are Jets fans.”  Wesley laughed. He struggled to remember his quote that was used when he was inducted into the Jets ring of honor. He just beamed with love for the Jets fans.

The quote that is in question?

“When I played this game, I loved the Jet Fans. I loved the fans, and that is really the most important thing for me.”

3ecjwi,0,2015-07-23,"I'm [20F] having a difficult time moving on from my ex [20M], but for a strange reason.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3ecjwi/im_20f_having_a_difficult_time_moving_on_from_my/,"TL;DR: I'm jealous of my ex's success, and I can't figure out why, or how to stop it and move on.

Longer/more detailed version:
My ex was super successful, driven, spent his time very economically (i.e. Every minute of his time that he spent had to be justified to himself as the most important way to spend his time). I was not used to this in a partner, or even in a person, so I spent a lot of time independently trying to understand it and better myself so that I could be the best partner to him I could be. I am aware that I spent far too much time and energy on molding myself for him, whereas I don't think he ever considered doing anything like that for me, and so I probably resented him a bit somewhere down the line.

We broke up almost a year ago and I still can't get over it, but not necessarily because I think he was a good fit for me. We were best friends, and our intellectual connection was very strong and intense, and we used to spend almost every waking minute talking, or working in the same room. That intellectual connection is what I do miss a lot, because other people I meet simply aren't as smart as him, and I miss the days where we used to explore how abstract we could go.

In the end, we broke up when it became apparent that his need to be the best at everything would become a problem for me in the future. He isn't the type of guy who is willing to let anyone get in the way of his work and success, and he doesn't particularly see the need for conversation outside of information sharing and personal growth, whereas I need emotional support and a feeling of appreciation. So that ended, and rightfully so. For the record, he hadn't had a real relationship before me, and any flings or dating partners he may have had ended once he got bored and itched to invest his free time elsewhere. We were serious enough that we had said 'I love you' and talked in length about our connection. I had also met his parents, and his mother seemed to love me. My mother loved him, too.

The break up ended nicely, and was mutual at the time. But ever since the break up, I've had a sort of strange desire to 'prove myself'. I take on a heavy workload in technical subjects because I want to work at the places he can find jobs easily at. Unlike him, I've never been a 'natural' at things of a technical nature, so I end up finding myself stressed out, with waning confidence. I'm not without talent myself -- I'm probably as strong of a writer as he is an engineer, and I understand people to a degree that he isn't able to comprehend himself, which is why he was drawn to me in the first place. But for some reason, I can't shake this feeling that I'm not perfect enough because I am not technical enough.

This worsens when I see his success. Every project he develops, every prestigious award he gets, every article written about him, every internship -- I'm not sure why, but it cuts me like a knife. I think it might be augmented by the fact that he doesn't tell me about these things; I simply find out about them through the grapevine. We went from being best friends to friends who talk very rarely. When we do talk, it's like nothing has changed -- it's clear we care about each other to a certain extent, because he seems shaky and happy to see me when we first see each other, reminiscent of our first kiss (which goes against his typical, perpetually affectless composure). I've always remained the one person of his friends (including his best friends) who he prioritizes talking to, as rarely as we talk now. If he runs into me on the way to meet a friend, he will make that friend wait until we are done talking, which is typically an hour (or more) later. He once came to visit me on no sleep from a project the night before, and he chose to pull another all-nighter with me chatting instead of getting sleep for his busy day the next day. He's always done this, which I find intriguing, given the economic way he spends his time. During these times, I enjoy his company yet don't feel any desire to be romantically involved. Yet we don't talk much anymore, and so when I find out about his accomplishments, it stings all over again.

I guess I'm wondering what to make of this, and how to convince myself that this isn't a big deal. Because it truly isn't; we weren't a good fit, and he's allowed to be accomplished, and I can be equally accomplished in areas that I'm good at if I stopped wasting my energy in areas I'm not. But what I'm wondering is why I take personal offense to his success, and why I feel motivated to 'be like him' when I'm clearly nothing like him, and even a year after the break up. Any objective insight would be great."

After graduation I had an internship with an actuarial consulting firm in Germany (I minored in German and math so it was a great fit for me). After my internship ended I came back to my hometown and have been employed as a project manager at a software firm for over a year.

Although I enjoy my current job, I would like to directly use/ advance my economics degree. After browsing job postings and chatting with econ friends from school it seems that a master’s degree would be a good path to go down (I'm interested in working in the private sector). However, I’m not 100% certain that would be the right choice (as opposed to applying directly to those jobs with only my BS) and feel overwhelmed by all the possibilities available. Also, when looking at different programs, I'm not sure if a specialized program would be better than a general one (I'm most interested in macro, environmental, and international). If I figure stuff out and feel that grad school is the right path I'd like to start contacting programs soon with an eye on starting in Fall 2016.

I know that's a lot to take in, but if anyone has any thoughts I'd really appreciate hearing them. Thanks a lot in advance!"

3eep56,3,2015-07-24,Me [22 M] with my friend [24 F]. I get with her friend once and she's angry even though she's been doing the same to me for about a year.,TheBadGuyFromTron,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3eep56/me_22_m_with_my_friend_24_f_i_get_with_her_friend/,"Sorry for a lengthy post. I would also like to throw out there that I'm incredibly thankful that this is the worst of my current relationship problems at the moment.

So I've known Karen (name altered for obvious reasons) for just about 4 years. She had transferred into my university during my freshmen year and we pretty quickly became close friends. We never ended up hooking up and as far as I know she never had any romantic feelings for me (this will be relevant later on). I briefly did for her but never brought it up with her because she was with someone at the time and my interest faded. 

We were both involved in the same extracurriculars for the most part, and we had a pretty decent overlap of friends as a result. In her head, she viewed herself almost as a big sister to me I think (she never said it and I would have discouraged it if she did because I don't enjoy when my friends put themselves in a position to patronize me), and she would do things like run her hand through my hair (almost like petting me) that sort of left my friends and I with a weird feeling when she did it (people would occasionally point it out to me). 

Getting to the heart of the matter, she ended up hooking up with one of my good friends while a bunch of them were in Chicago for a convention. This is fine in and of itself, but she would ask me how I felt about it. My buddy (we'll call him Mark) was a pretty typical college guy who enjoyed playing the field and hooking up with a variety of girls when the opportunity presented itself. He was pretty open about this and whenever a girl would ask him and he genuinely did his best not to lead anyone on. Karen on the other hand, will get attached to one guy (but she won't ever admit it). As a result, I told her that while they are both adults and can do whatever they want, I thought that it might not be a good idea for her to develop any sort of attachment to him. So of course she brushed off what I said with something along the lines of ""don't worry there's no way I'm actually going to develop feelings for him,"" and continued to hook up with him. 

None of this bothered me, but it's important to understand the situation for what comes next. Karen lived with a girl named Ellie who was kind of known for getting around. She was often in relationships but I had heard (and later confirmed) that she had issues with staying faithful. This led Karen to kind of look down on Ellie as ""a bit of a whore"" (her words, not mine). Karen and Ellie are also pretty much best friends, so it seemed kind of odd to me that Karen would say that about her, even to me. 

I ended up becoming pretty good friends with Ellie over time, and there were a few occasions when it seemed like we were going to end up going home with each other (she was single at this point, so no moral quandary for any parties involved), but we didn't. Karen would make passing comments to me that she thought I could do better, which stuck out to me, because that's a pretty shitty thing to say about your good friend.

Fast forward about another month and Ellie and I did end up hooking up. It was a one-time thing but we agreed not to tell Karen because:

a) It wasn't her business. If she felt any of us were prying about her affairs, she would say the exact same thing to us and had in the past.

b) We didn't want to create a lot of drama when we had already decided that we weren't going to hook up again.

So we all continue on with our lives and while a couple of my friends knew, they all understood that informing Karen didn't seem like the most prudent course of action. This worked just fine until about 6 months later when one of my friends forgot that we weren't supposed to tell her, and he mentioned it in passing. I was about 2000 miles away from them for the summer due to an internship, so I wasn't there, but apparently Karen got pretty pissed at Ellie. She didn't bring it up with me until she saw me in person and pretty much laid a verbal trap where I would have to tell her about the hook-up or lie to her face. She actually ended up accusing me of it before it reached that point (my plan had just been to say it happened). She then went on to lecture me about how she doesn't like it when her friends hook up (she didn't elaborate why and I didn't interrupt her).

This is a side note, but she had continued to hook up with my friend Mark on occasion, even though she would talk a fair amount of shit about how he wasn't responsible and so on. He kind of just shrugged it off because he didn't want to cause issues amongst friends, and he would usually just go over there if he happened to be drunk when she texted him (she would always say he would drunk text her or just follow her home from bars but I've seen the texts and she almost always initiated their encounters). 

So I'm confused and also kind of annoyed at how she got so angry about myself and Ellie hooking up once and causing no problems for anybody, but at the same time she would periodically hook up with Mark. From my perspective, there just seems to be a level of hypocrisy here that bothers me. And now she will occasionally bring up me and Ellie and say things along the lines of ""I can't believe you did that, you knew I hate it when my friends hook up (I didn't at the time, and neither did anyone I asked), and then you lied to me about it!"" (semi-valid; she never asked me and I never volunteered the information)  

I just feel like I'm missing something. I would like to repair our friendship if possible (she now has a job in my hometown and I have a job in a city about 3 hours away), but I'm honestly not willing to admit fault with the exception that I didn't tell her about it. I can understand why that bothers her, but she is also retroactively applying a lot of information that she hadn't communicated until after this whole fiasco.

Besides not telling her (which I'll admit wasn't the classiest move, but at the same time I don't think it was any of her business seeing as it happened once and affected her life in no way whatsoever), did I really betray her that badly?


   
**tl;dr**: Friend hooks up with my good friend and current room mate. No problems on my end, but when I hook up with one of her friends she goes off on us and says we violated her trust. Am I crazy?"
3eeu5j,300,2015-07-24,I'm 31 and I've recently realized that most of my adult life has basically been a series of self manufactured distractions that have left me ultimately aimless,gardenlevelstudio,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3eeu5j/im_31_and_ive_recently_realized_that_most_of_my/,"Most of these distractions have consisted of career ambitions, most of which were entirely unrealistic. In my mid 20s I had lofty career goals not unlike any other self absorbed millennial, and I thought college and internships had me well on my way. Six years later and the sobering reality increasingly hits home: I was wholly naive about my prospects of attaining much of my career goals, and I did little to improve myself personally or professionally, as I always thought the next flavor of the month ""opportunity"" would work out. I lived at home until I was 26, and I seemed to always think every next week, month or year would bring about some kind of change or progress, thus living in some sort of vague limbo as opposed to ""building"" anything. Other times, these distractions would manifest in the form of a hobby or sport that I would suddenly become immersed in. At other times, it might be a relationship or just a summer with friends and not thinking about the future. Recently, I even moved to an entirely new city and lifestyle with the hopes of finding some sort of meaning to my life and escaping the distractions I had back home. It always seems to end up the same: the exciting new job or internship never pans out; the thrill of the new hobby/sport fades; the relationship fails; friends move on or up in life; the distraction is gone and I'm left wondering, ""what I am doing and why am I so sad inside?"" It seems soon enough I find a new career ambition, hobby, or social situation to distract me and the cycle continues. The difference is now I am cognizant of the pattern. I've thought about going back to school and such but I can't help but wonder if that is just another, ""kick the can down the road"" tactic, and I now realize that my unhappiness is a lot deeper than just petty career goals. I find myself increasingly resentful and frustrated with the world. I've become less social and less adept at even faking it. On one hand I am glad that I at least am at least more aware than ever of my depression, but the scary part is I really have no idea how to make myself happy beyond short term distractions that never yield long term change."

3eg8x6,1,2015-07-24,[Question] Need help/advice from developers,[deleted],jailbreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3eg8x6/question_need_helpadvice_from_developers/,"This isn't going to be a ""How do I make a tweak?"" type post. I do have questions but also some basic background knowledge.  tl;dr will be at the bottom.

Background:
I have been writing code for years now, majoring in CIS/CIT and am going to be a Sophomore this coming semester.  Currently I have a full time internship with a company that I write Java code for.  I've had 3 full semesters of Java, a semester of Python, and a semester of Obj-C, plus whatever developing I've done on the side.  I don't need to learn to ""program"", I need to learn how to reverse engineer and how to transfer my skills into developing tweaks, and mastering the Obj-C syntax.

My Situation:
I've been interested in developing tweaks for over a year now. Been in the JB community since the iPhone OS 2 days.  I have theos set up, have read over many articles on the iphonedevwiki, read through open-sourced tweaks, read blogs, etc. But nothing I've found is really ""helpful.""  I need to learn how to look for what to hook, and where to start basically.  

What I want:
I'm just asking some developers for some ""heres where to start"" type tips.  Doesn't matter if it's articles, code, whatever the case. I've wrote basic iPhone apps, but still don't fully understand the syntax differences between Java and Obj-C.  If developers could just give me some pointers and where to ask for help that would be awesome.  Also some basic and easy tweaks ideas for me to practice making would also be helpful.

tl;dr Looking for resources on how to transition from app-making to tweak developing, Obj-C syntax references and some ""easy"" starter-type tweaks. 

Thanks in advance to any help and hopefully sometime in the future I can make some awesome tweaks for the community!

3eghnv,6,2015-07-24,"Me [21F] with my boyfriend [20M] of 9 months. I suspect I may be bipolar, &amp; it's putting a strain on our relationship.",ineedathrowaway627,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3eghnv/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_20m_of_9_months_i/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating (officially) since ~ last Halloween. He's a really great partner - really giving and thoughtful, loving and affectionate. He's a great person. I love him so much - and I know that he loves me, but my mental health is really beginning to make it hard for us to be together. I tend to go into deep depressions every 6 months or so, which makes me suspect that I may be bipolar.

We got into an argument last night, and he told me he feels under-appreciated and has a hard time dealing with the intensity of my emotions. We usually have a lot of fun together, but I can't seem to really enjoy anything anymore. We both still love each other, and want to work on this and fix our relationship. 

There's a lot of layers to my problems right now, but my main issue at the moment is work.

My boyfriend and I work together in the same office. He's higher ranking and has been there for longer than me - I started off last year as an intern, and continued that role through the school season. It's been really difficult for me not to be jealous of him (and I feel like an awful person for being jealous of my own boyfriend), because I feel like such a failure in my own life. I'm graduating college next year, and I still don't know what to do; I'm still temping/interning. My boyfriend already has his job lined up, post-graduation, that he'll be making a salary and getting benefits from. It just looks like more of the same for me. 

I know I should be happy for him, but I'm just so miserable about myself, I can't help but measure myself against his achievements; I feel like I haven't accomplished enough in my life to be a good measuring stick. I feel horrible about myself, and it's manifesting as jealousy. 

I also just moved to his hometown, and am finding it really hard to adjust here. The culture is a lot different than where I'm from, and I'm finding that I don't have much in common with a lot of people here. I don't really know how to go about making friends, and I often feel very isolated. It's the first time I've really lived away from home for any extended period of time. My boyfriend is really popular and good at talking to people (unlike me - I'm extremely awkward and shy), which is yet another layer to the imbalances in our relationship.

I know I should schedule an appointment with a therapist, but I'm sort of nervous. If I go on medication, what will it be like? Also, I don't know how comfortable I can be, talking to a total stranger about my issues. Does anyone have experience with being depressed/bipolar, and what I can expect? 

I know there are a lot of issues in this post, and I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for other than a little support and some personal advice. I already know I should talk to a professional. 


tl;dr: I feel like a huge fuck-up, which is making me depressed an putting a huge strain on my relationship with my awesome and loving boyfriend. I want to fix it, but I'm afraid."
3egkc5,4,2015-07-24,Confronted overbearing brother about his being overbearing.,stargrunt6,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3egkc5/confronted_overbearing_brother_about_his_being/,"I'm a medical resident who just passed his last medical licensing board exams.  A time for celebration for everyone in my immediate family.  Family consists of formerly narcissistic father (in remission via biofeedback therapy), enabling but supportive/overbearing mother and brother who is a mix of both.

Since I'm in a one-year internship program, I still need to find a residency for next year.  With this in mind, my brother sends me info regarding residencies that he's already sent me info about before. They're near where he lives, a big city in the US. One of the programs is a world-class research center.

I've already told him before that these programs already have their spots filled. My brother is not in the medical field, but computers.  He's tried to give me career advice, in spite of me telling him he doesn't know what he's talking about. He's asked me for help, which scared me because it implied he was going to talk to program directors for me (YIPES!). 

SO.  In response to his emails, I sent him a three-paragraph response with zero politeness.  I won't post what I wrote because I don't want it to be searchable. I essentially told him this:

1) I've already told you politely, now I have to be rude.
2) I'm not a kid anymore and I already have a dad.
3) You have no expertise regarding applying to medical residencies.
4) These programs don't have any openings. They are too competitive to not be able to fill their spots. Big city programs fill for the most part. 
5) Please stop trying to manage my affairs.  You resent it when others even try to give you advice, please do the same for me.
6)  The reason why I don't keep in touch a whole lot is because you do things like this when I call you.
7) Stop being bossy.
8) Sorry I have to be rude, but being polite has not worked with you.

His response? Other than unfriending me on facebook, none.  I'll admit, when I saw that he unfriended me, I felt pretty bad and was tempted to call and apologize (but I know better). 

Background:  he's been my biggest cheerleader and at the same time abuser.  He's bragged about me all through my life and included me in his.  At the same time, he's gotten extremely verbally hostile to me, especially when he's really stressed out or drunk.  A couple of years ago we had a verbal fight during Christmas when he got drunk. He gave a half-assed apology the next day (""Let's move on"").  

And when we socialize, he ALWAYS cuts me off and never lets me talk. He tries to hard to be funny and the center of attention. And when I call him, his excitement over me is too much; the word ""Dick riding"" comes to mind, it's past dignity.""

We were raised by a recovering narcissistic and bipolar dad (both in remission thanks to biofeedback) and a very bossy and enabling mom.  I'll admit, I'm very much the enabler like my mom and have been a dick to my brother at times. 

I have a saying: If someone tries to serve you soup and shit, they are serving you shit. 


**TL;DR:**  Overbearing brother constantly tries to give me unsolicited career advice in spite of not knowing what he's talking about. I put my foot down and he unfriends me on facebook.

3egrph,4,2015-07-24,"(21 Y/O Male) Been on fin since March, had some rough times. Need advice on my ""daily routine,"" am I doing something wrong?",anewprotagonist,tressless,https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/3egrph/21_yo_male_been_on_fin_since_march_had_some_rough/,"First and foremost, for those concerned or who may ask, I'll flat out say I have not had any major side effects from fin.  From time to time, I do notice an orgasm with my girlfriend not feeling ""as satisfying"" as I've experience before, however beyond that, my sexual cravings (libido) are healthy and strong as always.

Back to the topic, as the title mentions, I've been taking fin since about mid-March (2015).  I began noticing I was losing some hair in the early fall around September (2014), but really only decided to do something once I started noticing the sides on the top part of my heading thinning (late October).  I was in Scotland at the time, so it took until March to get the prescription all taken care of, unfortunately.  I blamed stress for the seemingly sudden onset.  With my parents announcing their divorce (to be official after Christmas, 2014), and my being away from sisters for any entire year (study abroad) - life got rough for a bit.  I can't provide pictures right now (currently at the office), however I either have, or had, diffuse pattern balding. 

When I first started taking fin however, I was definitely not shedding as much as I am now.  Since my returning to the U.S. in May, my hair seems to shed more.  Is this because of the change of environment, or location?  If I flip my hand through my hair throughout the day, a few hairs will fall (5-15).  While taking a shower however, as soon as I start lathering, anywhere from 20-50 will stay stuck to my hands, neck, chest etc., wherever the soap runs. 

My daily routine consists of 1 mg of fin in the morning along with my liquid Zyrtec pill, after breakfast (different from when I was in Scotland, used to take fin in the late evening 11:00 P.M.-12:00 A.M).  I try to hit the gym at least 2-3 times a week, much less than before I started this internship (don't have the time right now to go more often), and I have noticed I shed less on the days after I train.  At night, after dinner I take an assortment of vitamins: 1 biotin, 1 B-complex, 1 iron (every other day), 1 E, 1 acidophilus (probiotic), and occasionally some vitamin C.  I do not use Rogaine, but do use [RegenPure](http://www.amazon.com/RegenePure-Doctor-Reccomended-Treatment-Shampoo/dp/B0032FSDOA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437768616&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=regenepure) for my shampoo (started using only this month), along with [OGX Keratin shampoo](http://www.amazon.com/Organix-Brazilian-Keratin-Shampoo-Bonus/dp/B007ZC2ZMM/ref=pd_sim_194_5?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1EAMVSETQS7GXZ651W4B) or [OGX Biotin shampoo](http://www.amazon.com/OGX-Shampoo-Thick-Biotin-Collagen/dp/B00ADRH2OM/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437768564&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ogx+biotin+and+collagen) depending which is in stock.  (I have used Nizoral, but stopped since I started using RegenPure a few weeks ago.)  I mix some RegenePure with the OGX shampoo, then following the rinse-off I use RegenPure shampoo and OGX Coconut conditioner together.  My diet strays from anything dairy, fried, and generally anything that makes you feel like shit.  I've always been in good physical shape.

My apologies for the wall of text, but if any of you kind folks could have a look through and see if there is anything I should not being doing, or can recommend anything that I should be doing, **I would greatly appreciate the help!  Thank you for your time!**

PS - Which works better RegenPure shampoo or [Revita shampoo](http://www.amazon.com/Hair-Care-Laboratories-Stimulating-Shampoo/dp/B00D58T7US/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437768711&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=revita)?  Anyone have long term experience with either, or recommend a different brand altogether?   

EDIT: I should add, I have started putting a pea-size amount of [Moroccan oil](http://www.vidabeleza.com.br/moroccanoil-creme-pentear-argan-oil-300ml.html) in my hair before bed since mid-June "

3ehasy,2,2015-07-24,Boyfriend [20] has taken a step back in the relationship with me [F 20]. What do I do?,cherrycheh,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3ehasy/boyfriend_20_has_taken_a_step_back_in_the/,"This summer, I am living with my boyfriend at his apartment. He invited me to stay in our college town with him so I could stay for an internship opportunity and we wouldn't be 4 hours apart. I get my own new apartment in three weeks in August. We've been dating for 9 months.

About a month ago in June while he was away volunteering, he expressed his desire to move forward in the relationship and get me a promise ring. I thought he meant an engagement ring and wasn't as enthusiastic because I was afraid he was only expressing this because he missed me. (We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks.) After that he dropped it, and I began to think about it and expressed that I want that to, and that I was just worried he was missing me. But I told him I wanted the promise ring, but he dropped it.

A week ago, I saw him googling ""unhappy in relationship"" when he opened the internet on his phone. I asked him about it yesterday and he said that ""he just felt smothered"" and didn't want to go with the promise ring right now because ""forever is a long commitment right now"". He said my ambitions are so big for after graduation and he's afraid he'll hold me back, making me think that he feels held back. He assured me he didn't and that he still loves me more than the world and can only imagine a life with me.

Does he still love me? Or is he waiting for me to move out to break up with me? Will living separately strengthen our relationship? I feel like he doesn't feel independent or is missing out on stuff, even though I keep telling him he can do whatever he wants. I just want him to be happy and experience everything he wants to.

Optional Backstory:
I couldn't have sex for 6 months because of endometriosis and he stuck it through with me. He even stuck with me through my surgery. I'm on an induced menopause right now, and it's making me anxious. I can't tell what he's feeling. It really is taking more of a toll on me than he'll ever know. We lived together without sex and recently started having sex. I thought we'd be banging 24/7, but he doesn't seem as excited about it as I am. "
3ehh7k,3,2015-07-24,Can I comfortably buy a house right now? [22m],HouseSeeker92,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ehh7k/can_i_comfortably_buy_a_house_right_now_22m/,"Alright PF, this is my first time posting! I've been a lurker on here for a loooooong time and I wanted to get your opinions.  

I'm 22 and I graduated college with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering last December and started working at my dream job 3 months ago. I'm working about 20 miles away from my hometown and don't see that changing anytime soon. I'd like to purchase a home here! I know the area extremely well and houses are fairly inexpensive (even though I live on the East Coast). The cost of living in my town is extremely low compared to most places. The median house price here is 70-90k for 3 bed, 2 baths, 1800 sqft for example.  

I just finished paying off my student loans (~$9000). I had internships every summer (4) in college and did an 8 month Co-op my last year to pay for college. I commuted from home for the first 3 years so that also helped me save a bunch. (30 miles one way to school but worth it!) I have 2 credit cards but I have no balance on them. I pay them off every month. My credit score is 710. I own my car outright and she's been nothing but a champ since I got her! I plan to keep driving it for another 100k miles until it dies.  

I'm living with my parents for the moment while I figure out a permanent living situation. So I don't pay any rent. When I move out I'll be living with my best friend (we lived together my last year in college). He's still in college and will be living with me for the next 2 years regardless if I buy a house or rent. But I don't count his rent contributions at all in anything below, just in case. No debts of any kind at the moment.  

**Current Savings**  
Emergency Fund ~ $2500  
401K ~ $1800  
529 Savings Plan ~ $300 (Just started this. Even though I'm single right now, the ultimate goal is a family! So I want to slowly start saving for my future kids college since I can. I know they can always take loans... But this is something I want to do!)  

**Income**  
70k pre tax salary  
401k Contributions (16%) = $860/month  
Take Home after taxes and 401k ~ $3400/month  

**Expenses (Monthly)**  
*Stock Vesting Tax: $800/month (To pay tax on my vested company stock next May. Company is not public, I'll have 30k vest next year and 20k a year after that for a total of 5 years and 100k)  
529 Contributions: $100/month  
*Phone: $68/month  
*Car Insurance: $50/month  
*Gas: $160/month  
*Media Subscriptions: $35/month  
*Entertainment: $100/month (Rarely ever approach anywhere near this. Most of the stuff I like to do is free or is very cheap)  
*Health Insurance/Dental/Eye = Paid by my employer  
*Food = I want to say ~ $100/month? And that's really pushing it. My work provides breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Which I definitely take advantage of since I work a lot haha. I can always take food home.  

So currently my expenses total $1413/month. That leaves me with an excess of roughly $1987/month. I want to purchase a house that will most likely be around 70k + closing costs/fees. I plan to be here for a long time as my job is extremely secure and I absolutely love and am very passionate about what I do! My questions are as follows:  

What type of downpayment should I be looking at? I'd rather move out sooner rather than later to be honest. Ideally, I'd like to move out by December.  

Do you guys think it's a good idea to purchase a house right now with my finances? Renting would cost me more than a mortgage in my town (repairs, maintenance, upkeep not included).  

Is buying a home even affordable for me? I know that I'll have a ton more of expenses once I move out (Electricity, Internet, Food, Water, Home Maintenance, etc...)  

Thank you so much for your time and input! It's extremely appreciated!!"
3ehh8t,335,2015-07-24,My vegan coworker (22M) keeps commenting on my (21F) food,two_80085,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ehh8t/my_vegan_coworker_22m_keeps_commenting_on_my_21f/,"I've been having a weird problem with my coworker and I don't really know how to handle it. I've never been in this situation before.

By personal choice, I'm a vegetarian. People tend to assume I do it for religious/cultural reasons because I'm Indian, but I freaking HATE that because it's so far from the truth and a little bit racist. I just don't think it's right **for me** to ingest meat (i.e. flesh) for animal rights beliefs.  I never bring it up unless someone is preparing a meal for me or recommends eating at a restaurant with zero meat-free options and I definitely don't push it on anyone else. 

So I started an internship about two months ago and I absolutely love it. This post is referring to another intern. He's super chill and we get along for 95% of the day, but sometimes, I find myself trying super hard to not throw my food in his face. The new guy is a extreme vegan. He has used the term vegan to define himself, like when people say it's a ""lifestyle"". He's super into being environmentally friendly, health food, meditation, and all that stuff. 

Here's some of the things that have bothered me:

* I drink 1-2 Monsters everyday and he will comment that he doesn't drink any those because they're too acidic - he only drinks the natural, organic energy drinks from Whole Foods. 
* He tells me that I'm leaving out the ""only healthy part"" when I pick the vegetables out of my pad thai. 
* He says he would never eat at a restaurant I like because of how much oil they put in everything or eat the snacks I do because they're so processed. 
* On more than one occasion, he has gone into graphic detail about how animals are abused to get milk or eggs, while I'm ingesting something which clearly contains those products. 
* When we go to lunch, he will wait until **after** the meal to tell me that the beans were cooked with lard or that a soup was made with chicken broth. Same thing when he saw me pick some candy out of the candy bowl, watched me open and eat it, then told me that they use beetles for the coloring and when I ordered a Guiness, and he said they use fish bladder or something in it.

Honestly, I wouldn't beat myself up about it if I found it out myself.  It's not like I actively went searching for items which contained those things and since he clearly looked it up, if he had just told me ahead of time, I wouldn't have ordered/eaten it. But I feel like he waits until after so he can elicit a reaction from me and feel superior about it. Since it's a personal choice, I feel like I should be allowed to draw the boundary where I see fit. The way I see it, doing a little bit for a cause is better than doing nothing. Now, I feel like I constantly need to defend myself and choices.

The rest of the interns eat meat, but he only picks on me. I can't tell if it's because he relates to me and is just trying to be helpful in a weird, dick-ish way, or if he sees himself as the ""better"" non-meat-eater and feels the need to impose that on me.  Either way, it's crazy annoying. I just don't see why he cares so much about what I put in my body.

I want to just ignore it, but I feel like I'm constantly being judged. We're the only two interns who are new grads, so we're both hoping to get hired, and I don't know how much longer I can take this. How do I put my foot down without ruining our relationship and looking like a bitch?

**Tl;dr**: My new coworker is a strict vegan and is constantly commenting on my vegetarian food choices. How do I get him to stop?

*Update (7h): Wow thanks everyone for the awesome suggestions! I didn't get to reply to all of em, but I'll definitely be using some next time he does this. He better watch out for the sassy new two_80085! &gt;:) Oh also, sorry for deleting some of my comments, I think I gave away too much personal info...*"
3ehldw,2,2015-07-24,My (21F) parents (55) won't let me visit my long distance boyfriend (21M).,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ehldw/my_21f_parents_55_wont_let_me_visit_my_long/,"   Matt and I have been dating for two years now. We met at the end of our freshman year of college. We liked each other but chose not to date because I was going to be transferring to another college 3 hours alway. A few months in to our sophomore year we decided we couldn't handle not being together and decided to become official boyfriend and girlfriend. 

Our relationship is great, of course we struggle with being apart and we have our moments where it wears on us. But we love each other. 

I live at home this summer and so does Matt we happen to be 8 hours away. I've seen him a few times this summer when he visits me but every time I try and visit him my parents have a reason for me not to. Like I said I'm currently living at home for the summer. I'm pretty dependent on my parents they're helping me pay my way through college and they pay for my car (I pay for gas).  I do have a job but I'm make very little as an intern. My parents have been helicopter parents my whole life. I never even went out with friends in high school because it was just not worth getting my parents permission.

Last weekend Matt was down at his college moving in and I had not seen him in two months. I told my parents I was going to go and help him. They were reluctant at first. They told me it was too far of a drive- it's three and a half hours.  That was really their only excuse. It took me two days but they finally let in and I went.

This weekend Matt came down again to finish up some things at his house and I told my parents that I was going to go and see him again. They said no. And I figured I'd just give it a few days. So I did and they would still not let me go. They said it's too much, and I just saw him, and it's such a far drive. But it is not like I see Matt every day or even every weekend or every month. There is no reason for me not to be able to visit my boyfriend. Matt says that he understands that I tried and that he is not mad at me but I can't help but be mad at myself. He is very sweet but he deserves someone who can actually see him. I am being treated like a three year old, and three year olds cannot date.
       I left the house today texting my mom goodbye, I went to a park and waited. In a matter of minutes I got a call from my dad telling me I had better not go. But I really don't know what the repercussion of me leaving would be. I could get cut off or my car could be taken away and then I'd really never see Matt. So I need your advice how do I stick up to my parents and let them understand that I am not a child anymore and that I can make my own decisions. 



Really anytime I tell my parents that I am going to visit Matt they give me a reason why I shouldn't. They say that they like him and that he's a good guy, really Matt and I are very similar. But I can't figure it out. Months ago I was at home and Matt was about to leave for home. I told my parents I was going to visit him and they told me that would be too much. I put all my stuff in my car and started the car, my dad got in and tried to take the keys from me. I just sat there and waited. My mom was yelling at me about how she was going to cut me off. Eventually my dad got out and I left. I got a text from him later saying that everything would be alright. I just don't know if it would be the same this time. I'm really tired of fighting with them every time I want to see my boyfriend 


   
**tl;dr**: Parents wont let me visit long distance boyfriend, how do I get them to stop controlling me

3ehpuf,1,2015-07-24,It Started In The Streets,rachy00face,fiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/3ehpuf/it_started_in_the_streets/,"It started in the streets Part One

The homeless - the invisible ones. They started disappearing and dying: no one cared, really. We all thought it was a great thing that their population seemed to be diminishing. In fact, we encouraged it. We wanted the homeless off the streets; we wanted them all to be saved- helped. Little did we know what was actually happening to them and when we finally found out. It was too late for all of us.




April 23, 2018
The news reports told of a small virus that was mainly affecting those on the streets with no shelter and no means of medication. They couldn’t fight the disease without the help of antibiotics and most succumbed to it. Since those dead were practically unknown they were broadcasting pictures; mostly those with arrest records. If no one knew them they would be buried in the Assumption Cemetery, just a few miles from the main road of town. For now, they were being held in the city’s small morgue at the hospital, down the road from Anabelle Walkers’ home. Her father, their small town’s mortician was awaiting word from the coroner if the bodies would be brought to him.

Anabelle wasn’t concerned with the dead. She had helped her father when she was little. Watching him with the embalming fluids and the makeup. Make them look like they’re sleeping was what he always used to say. Before, the idea that her father touched dead people every day was disturbing to her. Now she knew Benjamin Walkers’ job was what fed and clothed her. It wasn’t something to be afraid of. Death was a normal everyday thing. She got up from the couch and put her breakfast dishes in the sink. Today was going to be a long day, her father would be working till late she was sure and she would be all alone in the house until she started her shift at the hospital. She started working there just 6 months ago and already she had moved up in the ranks of the nurses’ assistants and was on the fast track to starting her nursing degree at the local college.

Benjamin Walkers finally got the call he had been expecting around 2:30 in the afternoon. He would be receiving 12 bodies of the recently deceased homeless in two hours. The medical examiner Bob Markum was glad to get these men and women out of his refrigerators. It was too bad that so many of them went unclaimed, he thought the small tight-knit town would try a little harder to help these poor souls find their families. The only recognition was from the Wilkens’ family, and they didn’t want to pay for funeral costs anyway. Bob hoped to put an end to the questions from the police and local media by telling them all it was a virus. Sure, it was a virus. Something he had never seen before, but why start uproar when it was contained to these dirty street people?  No one else had seemed to fall ill. No one reported anything at the hospital. But those bite marks- no he wouldn’t start the media craze. He would let them go, bury whatever the truth was with them, he thought.

Ben arrived at the funeral home with an hour to spare. He needed all of his staff focused on their jobs; the task at hand was going to be rough. 12 bodies was a lot for the small staff at Assumption. Carrey Herald, Rick Topher, and Grace Freed were all sitting in the small staff room watching the TV and playing on their phones. Rick sat on the couch, taking up most of the small sitting area. He turned away from his phone; ignoring the text he just received to watch the small screen. It was another story; the news anchor was getting tired of talking about the latest craze on social media and focused again on the 18 dead homeless in the small town. Rick shook his head.
“If they’re sending them here then what else is there to discuss? Those poor bastards don’t have any family. They really need to stop.”
Carrey, the intern looked up at him from the pillow on the floor. This was her favorite spot in the room, she hated sitting next to people and no one else wanted to sit on the floor.
“They keep bringing them up because of what happened. How bad would it suck if no one claimed you after you died! Wouldn’t you want people to come remember you? Or are you so big and bad that you don’t care?” Her eyes bulging out of her head as she raised her voice. She was so upset about these poor innocent people not getting what they needed. She hated death. If she could save everyone she would. How could Rick the Brick be so insensitive? He looked over at Grace; the old woman was sitting with her knitting completely ignoring the news and the exchange between her coworkers. She had her opinions, but would never voice them even if someone asked her. She didn’t want to go along with her coworker’s drama. Kids.

The yelling match reached Ben’s ears as soon as he walked in the door. Damn, he thought, I was hoping they wouldn’t be worked up yet. He ran down the stairs and threw open the staff door.

“Alright you two, that’s enough yelling!” He exclaimed throwing the door so hard it crashed against the wall. Grace barely looked up from her work, Rick looked sheepishly down at the floor. He knew he had been loud, but was surprised that Ben could hear him so easily. Carrey was practically in tears and decided this would be a good time to excuse herself to the restroom to freshen up. She needed to be stronger if she was going to help work on so many people today. Ben went to fill his coffee cup at the counter and sat at his desk across from the small arm chair that was currently occupied by Grace. She nodded to him with a thoughtful look. He smiled back. Rick cleared his throat as to start an excuse for his yelling. Ben inhaled sharply and looked back at Rick. He would have no sympathy for bad behavior today. They had a lot of work to do.

Anabelle started her slow trek to Cicely’s house. It wasn’t too far away; she just didn’t want to pick up the girl for their shift. Cicely Truman was practically royalty in their small town. Anabelle didn’t know why she didn’t just drive herself. But for some reason Cicely had taken a liking to her, maybe it was because of their first day of work when Cicely didn’t know how to do anything and Anabelle helped her. Anabelle slowed at the stop sign and looked over at the place she really wanted to go: Devon Reynolds was sitting at the front desk of the mechanics shop. She could see him through the large window. He looked up from his computer and locked eyes with Anabelle for a second; she hurriedly looked forward and mashed the gas pedal. She couldn’t believe he had looked at her. Anabelle felt her cheeks get hot as she thought of Devon looking into her eyes. How it would feel to be held by him, to kiss him.
She still had a smile on her face when she pulled up in front of Cicely's gated home. The largest and grandest home in the town, no one else had towers or bay windows. And practically no one had two stories, let alone a third! She grabbed her old, beat up phone and sent a short “I’m here” message to Cicely. A few minutes later the gates opened and the stunning girl was running down the front steps of her home. Anabelle pulled into the circular driveway and unlocked her door. Cicely jumped in and leaned over to give the other girl a warm hug.
“You look happy today An!”  Cicely noticed the large dopey smile plastered all over her face. Anabelle blushed all over again and shook her head.
“Just happy to see you, girl.” Anabelle hated being called An, she was named after her mother and loved her name. Cicely rolled her eyes and laughed. They drove out of the gates and turned right towards the center of town.




Ben walked down the ramp to greet the driver of the refrigerated truck about to pull up to the back door of the funeral home. It was the easiest way to transport all of the bodies, even though it wasn’t conventional. He shook hands with the man and showed him where to back up to make it easiest for his crew. Rick was really the only one strong enough to unload all of them. Grace would be organizing all of the instruments needed and Carrey would get all the paperwork. It was up to Ben himself to help move the corpses down the two flights of stairs to the preparation room. It was going to be hard work. He wished that Bob had the wherewithal to send more than one person to help. Luckily, two more cars pulled up behind the large truck and four more strong men jumped out. Ben might not have to do too much moving.

When the work was all done Ben, surveying the sea of corpses surrounding him and his staff , felt a cold chill run down his back. Would they work fast enough to get them all done by tomorrow morning when the news crew would show up? He saw Carrey touch one of the young women on the gurney and worried a little about the poor girl. When you are so young and lose your parents its hard to come to terms with death. Maybe she shouldn’t be down here, he thought, maybe I should send her up to do the paperwork and talk to the diggers. She can take care of everything upstairs.

“Carrey.” He motioned for her to come over to him. “Why don’t you go up to my office and get the paperwork started and sign off on everything from the hospital? We also need to talk to the diggers, Marty and James Cyrus. If you could get a hold of them and get them down here as soon as possible that’d be great. The funeral will be tomorrow for everyone. I want to be ready. Thank you, dear.” He placed his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly way and smiled down at her. He hoped she would feel comforted; instead she was insulted that Ben would think she couldn’t handle it. She took a deep breath and smiled back at him. Then sadly opened the door and walked up the stairs.
Bob Markum greeted Anabelle and Cicely as they walked through the back door of the hospital. Bob was in his office faxing the paperwork that needed to be completed to Ben at the funeral home.
“Anabelle! How are you m’dear?” He had been here for so long he felt as though he knew everyone. Bob was the oldest person at Welloak Valley Hospital. He had seen two fires, one earthquake and about 350 dead while working. Considering he was the head pathologist in charge of the Hospital Morgue 350 wasn’t that many. 30 years of dead bodies.

Anabelle didn’t like Dr. Markum. She tolerated him, sure, but only for her father. They worked together so often that Dr. Markum was practically her uncle; at least that’s what he always called himself. She always thought he was creepy. Cicely waved in Bob’s direction then pulled Anabelle further down the hall so they wouldn’t be stopped. She looked over her shoulder at the man and smiled.
“Sorry, Dr, Markum,” Cicely shouted down the hall. “Don’t want to be late for work, ya know?”

Anabelle smiled at Cicely. She could get away with being rude to the doctor, lucky for Anabelle. They climbed the flight of stairs up to the nurse’s station on the first floor and logged on the computer to clock in for work. Anabelle covered her long dark hair with a bandana and turned to Cicely who was doing the same thing.
“Ready?” Anabelle and Cicely grabbed their cleaning supplies and filed down the hall to the first patients room.

Ben was exhausted. Seven hours of working on these corpses and they were almost done. He had sent Grace home 20 minutes ago. Not much else the embalmer could do after every body had been pumped full. Rick was sewing up the last of the strange looking wounds on the nearest body. The elderly man was obviously attacked by something. What, Ben didn’t want to try to find out. He just went about his business. If dear Dr. Markum didn’t want to talk about it, he wouldn’t make a fuss. After all Dr. Markum was the one who got him this job. Don’t ruin it. He looked to Rick with a nod and walked out the door to the stairs. They did as much as they could tonight. They’d start bright and early the next morning. Rick snipped the thread, put the needle and scissors back in his kit and turned to walk away. He caught movement in the corner of his eye. Did that corpse just move? He stopped and stared at the small hand of the young woman. Did she just twitch? Ben called from the next floor up; Rick shook his head and turned towards the door. He had obviously been working too long on these poor people. He was seeing things. He stopped to lock the door behind him and stomped up the small staircase. Ben was waiting by the front door to lock up. Rick smiled at him wearily as he walked out the door and down the steps to the dirt parking lot where his beat up Camaro sat in the closest parking space. The faded Navy sticker adorning his back window made him smile that much more. Five years ago he had been a combat medic in the war. He was born to sew up wounds. No matter how weird they looked. He unlocked his door and turned to see Ben following him towards the parking lot.
“6 AM tomorrow, friend.” Ben grimaced at Rick. He knew it was earlier than they usually had to be at work, but if they wanted to get these people looking like they didn’t die then they needed to work from sun up. Especially since that camera crew was going to be there before noon. Ben was worried what they’d try to get out of him. He nodded at Rick. He knew Rick was concerned about the wounds too. What could they do about it Ben’s look seemed to say. Rick shook his head back, got in his car and drove away. Ben started for home as well.

Anabelle was excited for the party after work. She and Cicely started to get ready even before they clocked off. Cicely decided that Anabelle should try her hair up; Cicely was going to wear her naturally curly, blonde hair up as well. They ran down the back hallway, past Dr. Markum’s empty office and out the doors to the parking garage. Everything was so dark.
“Ugh. I hate when they don’t turn the lights on in the garage!” Cicely moaned to Anabelle. She turned towards the small blonde girl and looked her over once.
“What? Are you afraid of the dark?” Anabelle smiled menacingly at Cicely. The small girl frowned and swiped at her friend. They linked arms and started walking towards the elevator to take them to the top floor where they had parked hours before. The moon was full and bright. Illuminating their way down the sidewalk, but as soon as they entered the basement-like garage they could barely see a few feet ahead of them. Cicely grabbed tighter to Anabelle. Yes, she was afraid of the dark. You never know what could be right in front of you.

They slowly made their way to the elevator, the glowing EXIT sign helping to light up their feet. 20 feet ahead of them stood a figure. Not moving, standing still. Staring. Cicely saw him first and yelped.
“Who’s there?” Anabelle called out. The man slowly made his way, limping over to the two girls. When he was finally close enough to see the girls noticed he was wearing a torn dirty shirt and shorts. No shoes. He had one gaping bite mark on his leg.

“Help.” The man said before collapsing in front of the girls. Cicely Screamed.

Ben turned his big Suburban out of the parking lot of the Assumption Funeral Home, he felt as though he and his crew had accomplished quite a bit today. He felt bad for the poor souls, not having any family to claim them. But he knew that quite a few at Assumption Church had planned a good turn out for them, even if they didn’t know any of the deceased. He thought about the bodies on their gurneys all the way home. Why did all of them have those wounds? They looked like bites. He grabbed his phone at a stoplight and sent off a short text to Bob Markum: Almost completely finished with 12. Want to ask about tests done on them. Call me when you get a chance. Almost Home. The light turned green as he pressed the send button. He drove the last few miles home and silently hoped that Bob would call him soon.

“I need help! There’s a man in the parking garage who’s badly injured!” Anabelle ran in through the hospitals emergency entrance and yelled to anyone who would listen. Two nurses noticed her and grabbed a gurney and followed her out to the garage. The Doctor who heard the call also followed behind the nurses and ran to turn the switch on near the parking garage. The place was bathed in orange light as the nurses ran in to find Cicely sitting near the hallway holding her knees, crying. The man was nowhere to be found.
“Are you trying to play a joke on us, kid!” the male nurse asked Anabelle angrily.
“He-he just got up and-” The female nurse came over to Cicely to make sure she was ok. In the hallway behind them, the light flickered slowly. Crawling towards the girl and the nurse, slowly on his almost bare stomach. He reached the small blond girl and grabbed a hold of her beautiful hair. He pulled himself up slowly about to sink his teeth into her lovely neck.

Ben finally made it home. He slowly got out of his car and walked up the long driveway towards his front door. Strange, he thought Anabelle usually got home before he did, especially on nights that he worked so late. He looked at his phone to see if she had text him about going anywhere. Nope. He unlocked the front door and walked inside. Everything was normal; he walked into the kitchen and opened the freezer door. Pizza. His phone started ringing. He ran back into the front room to grab it. Anabelle.

“DADDY!” Anabelle was crying into the phone. “Cicely got bit!” Ben didn’t understand what she was saying.
“What bit her? A Snake? Where are you two?” Ben was sure they were somewhere they shouldn’t be. Foster’s farm. I bet they’re on Foster’s farm and a horse bit her. “Shit. Tell me where you are and I’ll come get you. I’ll call Dr. Markum and he can meet us there. He’ll help.”
“NO DAD!” Anabelle never yelled at her father. “ We are at the hospital! In the parking garage. A MAN BIT CECILY.” She screamed so loudly into the phone Ben had to hold it away from his head. He cussed again and pulled it back to his ear.
“What the hell do you mean? I’m leaving now. I’ll be there in five minutes. Are you safe?” Ben started walking out the front door.
“Yes. There’s Officer Jones here. They restrained him. But the doctor is checking out Cecily. Oh it’s my fault! I should’ve found out how to turn on the lights. I should never have left her alone with him!  OH!”
Ben got into the suburban and started it. “Stay where you are. I’m coming now.” He hung up the phone quickly and pulled out of the driveway. Speeding the whole way there, he made it in less than five minutes. He quickly and illegally parked in the emergency zone. Jumped out and ran through the double doors. There sat Anabelle, tears in her eyes. She was speaking to a female office that was writing down everything Anabelle said in a white notebook. Anabelle saw her father and jumped up immediately and ran to him. The officer watched the exchange and turned to Ben.
“Hi Ben. Everything is ok. Crazy man was in the parking garage, Anabelle ran for help when she saw he was injured. When she got back with the nurses the man was gone, he crawled back over and bit Cicely. Her parents are here. Waiting for her to come out of surgery. They’re going to fix it up just fine.” She turned to Anabelle. “Don’t worry, hon. It’s not your fault.”
Ben hugged his daughter and led her back to the chair she had been sitting in. He sat her down and kissed her forehead before turning towards the two other people in the room. Mr. And Mrs. Truman.
“Dave, Cass.” Ben greeted each of them with a handshake. “Sorry to meet you under such circumstances, but lovely to see you both, none the less.” Ben always did have a way with words. Cass Truman smiled warmly at the man. She always liked him. Dave Truman pulled himself up to his full 6 feet and puffed out his chest. He knew his wife was fond of the undertaker. And he didn’t like it. He curled his lip a little and rolled his eyes at the exchange between the two.
“Yes. Your irresponsible girl left our only daughter alone with a crazy man and he bit her. Truly bad circumstance.” Dave looked up at Ben; even at his full height he wasn’t nearly as tall as the other man. Ben almost looked shocked. He turned to Anabelle to see if she had heard. She still had her hands over her face and was crying. Officer Jones had sat down next to her and was rubbing her arm.
“Anabelle was being VERY responsible by trying to get the poor man help! Did you think to ask if Cicely offered to stay with him? She was a nurses’ assistant. You’d think she would want to help the man!” He flared at Dave Truman. “They didn’t know he was a psychopath!”
Dave breathed deeply and turned away from Ben. Cass looked at Ben apologetically and went to sit with Anabelle and Officer Jones.

Officer Emmet Lowe sat with his back to the wall watching the disheveled man twitch in his medicated sleep. He wondered who this crazy was… What kind of person is so messed up that he actually bites someone, Emmet thought. The nurse taking the vitals of Crazy glanced over at him. He smiled at her and nodded at the door. Jen shook her head.
“Aren’t you supposed to be making sure he doesn’t go anywhere?” She asked her boyfriend angrily.
“Not only is he sedated, but handcuffed to the bed. Where the hell is he going?” Emmet countered. Jen considered what he had said for a moment. Then smiled and winked at her boyfriend. She left the door open as she walked out. Emmet smiled and quickly followed behind her.
Cicely was finally out of surgery. The doctor told everyone you would barely even be able to see the scar on her shoulder. They also cleaned it out and made sure there were no bacteria. The man didn’t get a good enough grip on her to bite hard enough to break the skin, thankfully. Anabelle said goodbye to her, tearfully as her father escorted her back to his SUV from her hospital bed. Neither one of the girls were going to the party tonight.

Devon Reynolds heard what happened and immediately went to the mortician’s house. He was waiting for two hours before he thought maybe Anabelle wouldn’t be leaving the hospital tonight. If anything happened to her he didn’t know what he’d do. The girl was gorgeous but he didn’t think she even knew who he was. As he was about to start his car back up and pull down the long driveway he saw headlights slowly coming towards him.

Anabelle was asleep in the passenger seat of her father’s Suburban as they bumped over the long dirt driveway she was thrown forward in her seat and woke up with a start.
“Who could that be?” Her father saw the pickup truck in his driveway. He stopped and jumped out of his car. “Stay here, Anabelle.” He walked over to the truck and tapped on the window. Devon rolled his passenger window down and waved at Ben. Anabelle recognized Devon’s truck and honked the horn at her father. He waved her over and started to walk towards the house.
“Either he comes inside or you have five minutes. Your choice.” She nodded to her father and gave Devon a tilt of the head. He nodded and unbuckled his seat belt to follow her inside the house.


April 24, 2018

Devon awoke with a start. He was on a checked couch, his face smashed against one arm. A foot pressed against his butt made him realize he wasn’t alone. Anabelle Walkers was sleeping as well.
Ben had woken up at 530 despite only getting a few hours of sleep. He needed to finish his job at the funeral home and meet Rick at the preplanned time. When he walked past the living room doorway he wasn’t surprised to see Devon was sleeping on the couch. He was surprised, however to see his daughter sleeping there with him.
He shook his head, threw a blanket over his daughter, tucked a blanket under her head and walked out the door. For the first time in a very long time he stopped to lock the front door before leaving. You never know, he thought.

Driving through the empty streets of Welloak Valley, Ben started thinking about all the events that happened the day before. At least, he thought, today wouldn’t be any weirder.

Rick Topher pulled his Camaro into the closest parking spot in front of the Assumption Funeral Home. He didn’t sleep very well last night. The mass amounts of bodies he’d worked on yesterday didn’t help his flashbacks. The war was always in his nightmares, especially when he had multiple corpses to prepare at work. His eyes caught the front door before his headlights did. Something wasn’t right. 
It was open.

3ehrt2,1,2015-07-24,What is the protocol for breaking up with my [25 M] girlfriend [23 F] who is here for the summer?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ehrt2/what_is_the_protocol_for_breaking_up_with_my_25_m/,"TL;DR: GF moved to my city to live with me for summer, want to break up with her but don't want to make her homeless. Do I suffer in silence until she moves out in a few weeks, or say something now?


**Background:**

Last summer I met a girl who was interning in the city that I live in. She was gorgeous, intelligent, fun, and our sex life was great. However, she was about to start grad school in another state and after spending ~4 months together we decided to do long distance while she went back to school. Our long distance relationship worked out pretty well and everything was going great. This summer, in order to be closer to me, she took another internship in my city with a different company. This company didn't pay, so we decided that she would move in with me, otherwise she couldn't afford to be here. 

This summer has really sucked. She was kind of cold to me when she first got here, but I attributed that to her getting used to living with me and dealing with being in a city without many connections. As the summer went on, things just got worse and I've felt more and more physically and emotionally distant from her. We have sex maybe over other week, despite multiple conversations about fixing our sex life and my unhappiness with the current situation. She kept giving me different reasons for not wanting to have sex, some of which didn't add up, until I've essentially stopped trying to initiate anything. With me not trying to initiate, I've also come to realize that she really doesn't seem to be putting any effort into most aspects of our relationship, including physical. At this point I know I'm unhappy and things aren't going to work out. I try to work late every day and find other reasons not to be around her because it is extremely painful to constantly be rejected by someone you care about. 

**Situation:**

She only has three more weeks here, but we are living together and this situation has become almost unbearable for me. If we weren't living together or if she had a steady income and could move out, I would have broken up with her already. The apartment is mine and she doesn't pay rent but I feel bad ""kicking her to the curb"" knowing that she can't find another place. I know she has some friends in the area, many of which are mine, but I don't know if she could stay with them. I, however, have friends and relatives in the area that would have no problem putting me up for a couple weeks until she moves out. I'm tempted to let her stay in my apartment while I move out for a couple weeks, though I'm slightly worried about how that would work out. 

I'm trying to decide between a few scenarios:

1.  Say nothing until she moves out in 3 weeks, suffering the entire time
2.  Break up with her and tell her to find somewhere else to stay for her remaining time (I'd give her a week to find a new place)
3. Break up with her and I move in with a friend until she leaves
4. Break up with her and see what she proposes in terms of moving/staying

3ehxbv,6,2015-07-24,Protocol for breaking up with my [28 M] gf [27 F] who is living with me for the summer?,throwaway830317,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ehxbv/protocol_for_breaking_up_with_my_28_m_gf_27_f_who/,"**TL;DR: GF moved to my city to live with me for summer, want to break up with her but don't want to make her homeless. Do I suffer in silence until she moves out in a few weeks, or say something now?**



**Background:**


Last summer I met a girl who was interning in the city that I live in. She was gorgeous, intelligent, fun, and our sex life was great. However, she was about to start grad school in another state and after spending ~4 months together we decided to do long distance while she went back to school. Our long distance relationship worked out pretty well and everything was going great. This summer, in order to be closer to me, she took another internship in my city with a different company. This company didn't pay, so we decided that she would move in with me, otherwise she couldn't afford to be here.


This summer has really sucked. She was kind of cold to me when she first got here, but I attributed that to her getting used to living with me and dealing with being in a city without many connections. As the summer went on, things just got worse and I've felt more and more physically and emotionally distant from her. We have sex maybe over other week, despite multiple conversations about fixing our sex life and my unhappiness with the current situation. She kept giving me different reasons for not wanting to have sex, some of which didn't add up, until I've essentially stopped trying to initiate anything. With me not trying to initiate, I've also come to realize that she really doesn't seem to be putting any effort into most aspects of our relationship, including physical. At this point I know I'm unhappy and things aren't going to work out. I try to work late every day and find other reasons not to be around her because it is extremely painful to constantly be rejected by someone you care about.


**Situation:**


She only has three more weeks here, but we are living together and this situation has become almost unbearable for me. If we weren't living together or if she had a steady income and could move out, I would have broken up with her already. The apartment is mine and she doesn't pay rent but I feel bad ""kicking her to the curb"" knowing that she can't find another place. I know she has some friends in the area, many of which are mine, but I don't know if she could stay with them. I, however, have friends and relatives in the area that would have no problem putting me up for a couple weeks until she moves out. I'm tempted to let her stay in my apartment while I move out for a couple weeks, though I'm slightly worried about how that would work out.


I'm trying to decide between a few scenarios:


1. Say nothing until she moves out in 3 weeks, suffering the entire time
2. Break up with her and tell her to find somewhere else to stay for her remaining time (I'd give her a week to find a new place)
3. Break up with her and I move in with a friend until she leaves
4. Break up with her and see what she proposes in terms of moving/staying

I have a month deadline - at the end of August I get to meet and greet with a few firms and get a 10 minute interview, and I hope to obtain an internship. I need an impressive portfolio. I have graphic design experience, and am confident in my ability to put together something that looks great, but substance is the most important part.

Could anyone tell me what main things potential employers will be looking for in a student portfolio?


I have so far:

CAD drawings (2D)

Sketchup Models

3D Renders of a commercial space

Moodboards (digital - should I include physical? What are good examples of mood boards? I have never been happy with mine)

As for me, I am not too interested in residential, and am more interested in Interior Architecture and Drafting, however I will take any opportunity to get my foot in the door at the moment. I think my strengths are definitely digital and CAD, my hand rendering is not great, I think I need more practice."
3eio1n,26,2015-07-24,Flashback Friday: Charles River Run 2011,ForwardBound,AdvancedRunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/3eio1n/flashback_friday_charles_river_run_2011/,"Hey guys, sorry this post is so late today. /u/BilldozerVT asked me to write about one of my races because he’s away trying to put more than one second between our half marathon times. Actually, that message was from /u/Tweeeked, but he swears that he was talking to Mr. Berlin who told him to tell me.

Anyway, as you know, I’m /u/ForwardBound [sub 5-ish miler]. Today we’re going to go way back in history, all the way back to June 6, 2011 to my first recorded run.

**Background**

I was fresh off my second year of law school and making the transition from dating a 50% Chinese girl to dating a 100% Chinese girl. Obviously both of these things were causing a lot of mental pressure. Combine that with wanting to slim down to fit more easily on Boston’s hellish public transit system, I had been cutting back on “lifting” (which in my opinion is a word it’s almost impossible to say without simultaneously crushing a beer can against your forehead) and upping the treadmill usage. My brother, who at the time worked for Ironman (the triathlon, not the superhero), had wiggled his way into the Boston Marathon that year, and when I told him how impressed I was, he said that if I could run 6 miles, I could run a marathon. I took that stupid statement at face value from someone who, 9 years older than I, used to force me to play tackle football in his bedroom while he wore an authentic Patriots helmet and I cried. 

In order to begin my training for Chicago 2011, I laced up a pair of shoes I had been using for the past 5 years, threw on my sickest black basketball shorts that covered my knees and most of my shins, and put a blue thermal on because it was 60 freedom degrees (15.5 Canadian degrees) and I didn’t want to get cold. I fired up my iPod touch workout mix, which was composed of rap for white people, indie bands that were so popular even I’d heard of them, and a lot of tunes only ‘90 kids would understand. I hit “START” on the stop watch function and I was on my way.

**The Run**

As you all know, the purpose of every single run you ever do is to sprint for as long as you can until you have to walk, then wheezejog back to your apartment. This plan worked well for me as I careened around the nerds and tourists in Harvard Square in Cambridge where I was living, making sure to pause my iPod at every stoplight or place I felt like taking a break at. Mile 1 in 7:18. By this time I was out of the square and onto the path along the Charles River, which many of you know as the water that Mark Zuckerberg drowned his would-be competitors in while he was still in school. By the time I hooked around onto the Boston side of the river, I had casually rolled up the sleeves of my sweatshirt to both maintain an air of experience but also in subtle acquiescence to the sensation of heat exhaustion that was overtaking me. Mile 2 in 7:30. I soon ripped off the thermal to expose a gray cotton shirt and acted like it was totally natural to carry a balled up sweatshirt in my left hand and an iPod in my right.

I started walking after this, which I swear I had planned from the start and it wasn’t because I didn’t know what the fuck I was doing. Mile 3 in 11:40 and mile 4 in 10:59. I couldn’t tell if what was stinging my eyes was sweat or the ton of hair gel I used to use. Miles 5 – 9 you can read about in detail [HERE]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataan_Death_March). The worst part about getting back to that apartment from a run was that I could always smell Dunkin’ Donuts right before I crossed back over the JFK bridge, but by the time I got back to my place, it was too far to walk back to. Overall I did 10.59 miles at an average running pace of 8:40, which doesn’t include the stops I may or may not have taken which you can’t prove because there’s no actual GPS data so don’t even try to Mike Rossi me, you creeps.

**Aftermath**

I felt really good about the experience, which I let my internship coworkers know all about the next day. We all sat right next to each other, which meant they’d have to leave the room and their own work to escape me, so it worked out perfectly for me. Fortunately for them I always ran so hard that I could only go out every 3 days or so, so they didn’t have to hear about running daily, like my current coworkers do.

There is a video of this, and it doubles as an eerily accurate representation of how I run when I dream about being in a race: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbYOsE7JyXs

3eioyo,8,2015-07-24,I'm miserable during my summer internship alone in a different state. I know it's temporary but idk how to get through the next few weeks.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3eioyo/im_miserable_during_my_summer_internship_alone_in/,"I've been in the DC area from another state for an internship since June. Although I did this same internship last summer, this year's is twice as long and I'm struggling to get by. 

I am staying with pretty much a random family, and they are actually really nice and let me stay for free. However, I'm not close with them and spend literally all day just sitting in this poorly air-conditioned room, laying in bed and watching tv or sitting on the computer. Everytime I interact with them, I feel like I have to seem so grateful and peppy and it's like a whole social small-talk ordeal just running into one of the family members to get water at night. I'm also not able to cook really because of this situation and I'm worried they are constantly judging me for a slightly messy room. Normally this wouldn't bother me but I feel like I've outstayed my welcome and being here gives me just horrible social anxiety. 

Furthermore, I have no friends here. I try and be active and do all these cool things anyway but going to the zoo or movies alone gets old after a while. I rock climb so I kinda have that as a social outlet, but I still don't have anybody to hang out with outside of that. 

Between those two things, a stressful commute, unwanted weight gain, missing my boyfriend and home, and constant exhaustion from a physical laborious job, I'm constantly feeling down. Back home I can do things like spend time with my boyfriend, go for bike rides, go hang out at coffee shops, etc. to pick myself up but I feel as if I've lost all of those little happy outlets. I try to go and do these things but the area I live in has no good coffee shops to hang out at, I don't have my bike, and literally every time I've tried to do something to make me happy something goes wrong. 

I constantly find myself trapped, I don't want to come back to this house and awkwardly hide away in my room while the whole family does family stuff downstairs but I also literally can't think of anything else to do. I'm painfully lonely and can't really handle wandering around alone anymore. 

I was supposed to finish up my internship August 12 but I feel like I want to end it August 8, but idk what to do until the flight on the 12th. I think about all these things like taking a train to New York or going camping, but I just don't want to be alone anymore. 

I'm losing my motivation and, though I know that this is a temporary situation and wouldn't do anything drastic, I feel like I just don't enjoy living anymore. Life is harder than it is enjoyable right now. "

I also met a couple of really strong contacts at my retail job and was even asked to come downtown to meet a manager I had met at my store for lunch. I showed up and he asked me to please email him when he can be of help to me. 

My problem is that I had a 3.3 or 3.4 gpa at the end of the spring semester before deciding to take my first summer class ever while working part time and commuting an hour each way to campus. I ended up getting a D in intermediate accounting. 

I haven't touched base with the majority of my contacts all summer and I wanted to send an email at some point to let them know that I will have to wait until the winter so I can instead apply for a winter busy season internship in 2016. This fall, I plan on retaking intermediate while cutting back on work and getting on-campus housing, so I should be able to do a lot better, especially since its going to be a full-semester class instead of 25 days. Should I tell my close/strong contacts that I did poorly in intermediate and plan to retake it in order to have the grade overridden, or should I tell them that I miscalculated how many credits I would have and as a result, I have to push my internship back until busy season?

3eiwxf,2,2015-07-24,"I'm [25F] at my wits end with my boyfriend's [24M] 'overbearing', Muslim parents, duration 5 years.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3eiwxf/im_25f_at_my_wits_end_with_my_boyfriends_24m/,"**tl;dr** My boyfriend refuses to tell his parents about our relationship but I'm almost certain they know. He lies when confronted by them, I can understand his reasoning and I have tried to be patient, but I don't know what to do anymore - HELP!


First off, I'd like to say I don't think my boyfriend's parents are actually terribly overbearing, sure they are stricter than my parents, but I understand why. It was the best word I could think of to describe how I feel in the situation. This will probably be long :/

Throwaway, but he'll know it's me if he sees it - so if you see it, hey!


I've known my boyfriend since we were 14. We went to a small school together and towards the end of high school I developed feelings for him as both a friend and eventually something more. However he was dating a classmate and I wouldn't dream of interfering, we remained nothing but friends up until the last few weeks of high school. By graduation he had broken up with his girlfriend and we were skirting around our feelings for each other. However I freaked out a little (I was very awkward romantically and didn't go on a date until I was 20) and we had little contact the first year and a half of college (we went to schools 300 miles apart).


Once we were back in contact, we began a FWB sort of relationship that lasted off and on for two years. He had been burned by his ex and wasn't ready to date, I was in love with him... Overall there were lots of hurt feelings during this period, but I never regretted it - I learned a lot about myself and what I wanted during this period. I graduated in 2012 and moved home while waiting to move abroad for work. We started seeing each other and after a year (and just before I left) we decided to officially be in a relationship. 


Overall things were fine considering the distance. It was hard but we were each able to make a visit over the course of my original 2 year commitment. At the beginning of the year I was unexpectedly given the option of returning home and I took it - I've now been home roughly 6 months and our relationship has been more difficult now than during the entire LDR portion. For the first time in years we are living in the same place as he is home for summer break from school and I am home while applying for grad school.


So my basic issue is as follows: he is Pakistani-American, I am white and his parents are literally doing their best to destroy our relationship. I have tried to be as patient and understanding as I can be, but at this point I feel my friends are frustrated with the situation, I don't want to bring it up with my family, and I really have no unbiased advice coming in.


He refuses to tell his parents we are together, and to an extent I can understand. They want him focused on school and he has one year left. He wants to be financially independent/graduated before he tells them so they will have less say in his choices. And this had always been okay with me because I understood, didn't necessarily agree, but understood. His parents were none the wiser and never interfered. 


But I am 95% sure they know he is seeing me and so this summer had been hell. An aunt and uncle are visiting and have been staying with his family for over a month and leave in a week, which I'm sure plays into this to some extent. His mom had outright asked him several times if he is seeing me and he denies it. When he does go out he tells them he is with other people. 


Yesterday he told me we should doing something tomorrow (tonight) evening. He then tells me a few hours ago he has to go to a neighboring city for dinner with his family. An hour ago he told me he will not be back by 10pm as he thought, but 12:30 or later, his mom's way of ""punishing him"" for staying out from 10pm-1am last night (we went for a run/walk and then talked for a bit. He told them he was at the gym with a guy friend and his mom texted at 12:30ish asking where he was, he said with friend at gym, she responded with ""right""). So I will not see him today. 


I can't count how many times I have been ready to go out, excited because it doesn't happen often, and it falls through and I feel so crestfallen and rejected. How many long-planned activities/trips have been cancelled last minute because he wasn't ""allowed"" to go. We live two miles from each other yet spend all of about 10 hours together a week. We have sex maybe twice a week, if that. 


I don't know how to handle this anymore. My patience is running on E. I have loved him my entire adult life and we have survived many obstacles together. I know he loves me. I don't want to give up. 


I'm looking for any advice at all. Those who are from culturally similar backgrounds, anyone who has been in an interracial relationship like this. Anyone who has 2¢ to offer.


Are my only two options to suck it up and deal or leave? Are there any ways I can better address my feelings of complete neglect? Should I put up with him not telling his parents anymore? Is that fair of him from a cultural standpoint?


A few points that I'll add just for additional background:

- We are both atheists, though his family doesn't know this
- I really like his parents and want nothing more than to build a relationship with them
- My boyfriend is quite integrated into my family
- His younger sister was able to continue living a 4+ hour drive away over the summer for an internship and seems to have more independence
- I do not think my boyfriend is in the right in this situation, lying to his parents and essentially giving them cause to become excessively 'overbearing'
- We've talked marriage (though several years out still), and he tells me his parents will ultimately support whatever makes him happy, regardless of race/religion


If there are any questions, ask, I'm sure I wrote too much on some things and skipped over important details..


Thanks for reading and again, any insight is so appreciated!"
3eixze,17,2015-07-24,"I [25 F] was pressured into getting married [27 M]: An introspective confession on mistakes, family, and frightening coincidences. **tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3eixze/i_25_f_was_pressured_into_getting_married_27_m_an/,"Several years ago, my now-husband and I met in college. Neither of us were looking for a relationship, but we were both attracted to each other's sarcastic sense of humor, and our inexperience with binge drinking led to us hooking up pretty quickly. He was never the type of guy I pictured myself with (being raised by a very sacrificial and sentimental father), but after dealing with my sister's recent suicide attempts and an emotionally unstable ex, I actually liked my now-husband's lack of concern for any serious matter.

Soon, a year had passed and we were still together. In the process, I had turned into a much more casual, relaxed individual. My previous self that used to make dark, complicated paintings and read existentialism had been replaced by a girl wearing slutty clothes watching unlimited vapid Youtube videos, but, sadly, I didn't feel unhappy. Until I realized I was pregnant. 

All of a sudden, I was brought back into my dark previous world. As a kid, my dad (who is the most selfless person I know; think of Samuel Hamilton from Steinbeck's 'East of Eden') was extremely religious and adamantly pro-life. I never considered having an abortion in the past, as I (while open minded to other people's choices) didn't feel like it was something I could be morally okay with. My now-husband initially voiced no opinions on how to deal with my pregnancy. However, a few days later, a bunch of people were in my dorm room and he pours me this mixed drink that's like 90% Everclear and tells me to drink it. I look at him and say that I don't want to, but he starts yelling at me, ""What the hell's the matter with you? Did you suddenly give up drinking?"" and everyone is looking at me and the confrontation so I swallow down enough to make him leave me alone. Repeat this a few times, plus add in some random pills that he bought online in hopes of inducing a miscarriage (which only made me black out). I was still pregnant, and now he wanted me to get an abortion. I tried to tell him I didn't think I could do it, but then he would start yelling stuff like, ""You're fucking up my life"" and it was so loud. I felt uncomfortable about everyone living around us hearing and honestly sad about hurting my husband's life plans (despite this terrible confession, I do think I used to be a good hearted person). I even started worrying that he would hurt me (although maybe this wasn't realistic since he's never laid his hands on me in anger). So I went along with it. A lot of the fault is certainly mine- I could have ran away, or gotten someone to help me if I was scared of him, but I didn't. And afterwards, while I expected to feel devastated, I felt nothing.

And we stayed together. For a while, it was like nothing had changed. But then my now-husband moved away for the summer and suddenly became quite distant. I knew he had to be cheating on me with a female friend of his, but he denied it vehemently, telling me it was all in my head and that I should see a shrink to help me deal with my insecurities without unloading them on him. However, months later, when the other woman threatened to go public with her cheating confession, he did confess, albeit not to everything at first. I called my mom crying, trying to tell her how much he hurt me and for how long (5 months) he deceived me, but then my now-husband came up by me on the phone and starting trying to talk over me. He tried to tell my mom that the reason I was so upset is because I was on birth control (which my religious parents also don't agree with), but then he started mouthing ""or because she had an abortion"". I had to quickly hang up, and I realized for the first time how trapped I was.

We broke up for a few months, at the request of my now-husband. I think he did feel bad on some level about the affair. However, it was impossible for me to move on because we were subletting rooms out of the same house and he often still came up to sleep with me at night, even if he was casually seeing some other girls on the side. I told him to stop and I locked my door, but he picked the lock and slid in beside me every night. If I tried to stop him, it turned into a heated yelling match, with him always getting so close to yelling about my previous big mistake so that all of our roommates could hear about it, too. Ultimately, the only solution was to let him live his life as he saw fit. I was terrified of my parents finding out what I had done. I wasn't so much scared that they'd be disappointed or even disown me (at this point, I'd happily accept it), but rather that what I did would hurt them so much that they'd never recover. I imagined them continually worrying that I'd burn in hell, and, compounded by the misery of watching their other daughter's horrific suicide attempts, I couldn't think of anything worse to burden my kind, selfless parents with. Their love was truly the opposite of my life.

So my and my now-husband's relationship became more solid the harder I tried to conceal what I had done. My husband lied to me that he had told his parents and they respected the decision, which made me feel like I was the only one harboring the terrible secret. Our relationship at times felt like a fortress, although I started to make more concessions to avoid making him mad and potentially having everything shatter down. When I moved to a new town, he came with me. And when he asked me to marry him (in an admittedly sweet proposal), I said ""maybe"" but he took it to mean ""yes"". 

I felt so sick inside. I couldn't tell my parents about our engagement for weeks. I couldn't bring myself to call him my fiance, instead always referring to him as my boyfriend (which seemed less final). My plan became to defer scheduling the wedding as long as possible and living in some sort of limbo. But something freaky started to happen.

I got a summer intern at my work to supervise. I didn't know anything about supervising people, as I was new myself, and we were about the same age, so it was tricky to be a hardass mentor. This guy (let's call him ""4386"" because random numbers seem equally fair as random names to me... sorry, I'm in a STEM field) was especially hard to mentor because he was really casual and spent half his time with an unusual hobby of his. But underneath this immaturity, 4386 seemed like a smart guy, and we bonded over literature, the great outdoors, and some nerdy jokes. But even with this lighthearted diversion, it finally became time to schedule the wedding, as lots of pressure from family members was weighing heavily upon me. I remember laying in the bathtub at night, wishing I could drown myself but knowing that it wouldn't atone for what I had done or protect my parents from the terrible truth. I called my dad and told him quite honestly how conflicted I was about getting married (but not about having an abortion), which was the first time I had told anyone how unhappy I was. He convinced me that, if I prayed, God would give me a clear answer. I definitely wasn't convinced, and I hadn't prayed in probably a decade, but I gave it a try. I still remember how emotional I felt begging some unknown God(s) to give me some trap door exit out of my situation.

The next morning, 4386 came in and immediately asked me if I ever was scared about getting married. He said that he feared a lot of people change as they get older and become genuinely terrible individuals that no longer hold themselves accountable for their behavior or ever feel remorse. I was shocked, as I never talked about relationships with him or anyone at work before (I'm much younger than most others in my field, so I try to act as professional as possible). A few days later, he went to his sister's wedding, who had been dating the exact length of time me and my now-husband had been. But his sister bailed the day of the wedding. I knew it could all be coincidental, but it seemed unlikely. It completely freaked me out, and when I told people about this years later (leaving out my mistakes, of course), everyone agreed that it would scare them, too. When 4386 left for the summer, I was sad to see him go, and also quite creeped out when, minutes after him giving me a hug and leaving, three of my electronic devices broke in unison. While we kept in touch afterwards (5 years) casually through e-mail, I continued to wonder what it meant. Sometimes I wondered if this were meant to protect me, or if he could be more like a devil because he seemed to encourage me to do something wrong (by bailing on the wedding and having my parents learn the terrible truth). Of course, it could mean nothing, my logical self told me. So a year later I put on a beautiful wedding dress, walked down the aisle of a church that would excommunicate me if they knew I had an abortion, and said my vows. 

And, honestly, our relationship hasn't been terrible. He never became a serial killer or wife beater, and I think he genuinely tries to be nice despite being innately a controlling individual. But I've lost so much control over my own life (where to live, how to act, even different aspects of my personality) and my guilt has been slowly growing. I've tried to be extra kind and sacrifice myself completely for others, but when I get acknowledged for this, I feel like I'm going to be sick because I know the sad truth. The world has this view that I'm a fantastic person with a loving relationship, and it is hard to live a lie forever.

So... some questions:
1. Realistically, I'm not going to get a divorce because I still care so much about my parents living in peace with the thought that they could never raise a killer. (I know it is generally good to be honest about difficult topics, but in this case I think they could never get over it). So, how can I relieve some of my guilt if possible? I've thought about secretly getting my tubes tied so I could never have children of my own, despite wanting them. But I'm not sure if this is enough.
2. Is 4386 a helpful or harmful force? If I weren't in contact with him anymore, I wouldn't care so much, but sometimes he still contacts me. Despite the fact that his e-mails are brief and silly- honestly, Sharknado is deeper than a lot of them- every time he contacts me is shortly followed (&lt;12h) by my husband doing something morally wrong to another person. I'm not superstitious, nor too religious, but this freaks me out to no end. I'm not sure if it's supposed to remind me of how bad of a life I've set up for myself (so this is my hell on Earth) or if I'm somehow contributing to more terribleness by staying in contact with him (as a casual friend; he's never know about my personal life). It doesn't help that he recommends books to me that all focus on the main character keeping a terrible secret.

I realize not everyone will agree with what I wrote, and good. I know I'm fully at fault. 

TL;DR; I've built myself a bad life (which I pass off as perfect in the lie version of my life) by my failure to stand my ground when asked to make hard choices.

If there's anything to describe this past year (let alone my life) it's loss. I don't really have a supportive family base and friends are few and far between. It's a terrible feeling. I was pretty sheltered growing up and it's a hard ""habit"" to break. Nonetheless, there's this web of animosity that my family has built (parents = divorced, extended family and parents don't communicate, etc...). It's so hard to meet and keep loyal and caring people around. I'm pretty discouraged, I suppose you could say. But I digress. In the beginning of March, my grandfather, who was like my own parent, suddenly and unexpectedly passed away. Fast forward just under three months, and at the end of May my uncle succumbed to the cancer he was fighting for over six years. (Yes, uncle and grandfather were father/son)

I have been living on my own since I was 21, I am now 26. What happened was my parents didn't want me living with them, and I eventually found myself homeless for a few months. With intervention from government and local agencies, I was able to get back on my feet for the time being.

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life (diagnosed at age 12). The kicker is I have a sleep disorder with no name to it that has left me crestfallen and frustrated. It's hard enough to function with depression and anxiety. Add in how I can't wake up in the mornings or may fall asleep in class, followed by the ""just go to bed earlier"" or ""put down the computer"" and I fear for my future. What we do know is it's something circadian rhythm related, but that's about the extent of it.

Oh, right, I did mention class. Yes, I'm a college student and I'm finally at the goal line of graduating with my bachelor's in social work this December. I've had to go part time to college due to financial obstacles. My parents have no role in my college education, and while I currently have a 3.7 GPA... it really is a sweet revenge. On the other hand, a part of me is terrified for ""life after college.""

I just finished up an internship required for my degree that was difficult, unexciting, and not the type of ""social services"" I would ever want to work in (call center, fyi). However, I had to leave some good coworkers and a great field instructor (or supervisor) behind (well, supervisor/field instructor is moving back to her native state so it's a double whammy). You know, those that were around when I lost some family members and accommodated for me.

I'm just having a hard time at the moment. I was supposed to meet with someone who works with disabilities gain employment and whatnot, and I overslept (unintentionally, obviously). The referring agency (DVR) more than likely couldn't disclose much, so when I woke up to a phone call of someone pretty angry, I tried explaining how I have a sleep disorder. While I was told I should (edit: have) called (please tell me you see the irony in that), I got torn into pretty good about how I was wasting her time and that she has to contact the referring provider should she reschedule another appointment with me. As if I didn't feel bad enough about my sleep problem(s).

So lately, I've shed more tears than I care to admit. A part of me doesn't feel I should even stay where I'm located and move cross country to ""start my life over."" (Right after I graduate) However, I know logically I don't have the finances to do so. It's an awful feeling in the pit of your stomach knowing that you feel you don't belong. (My ""family"" is such a trigger, especially as of recent, and I don't see it getting better.) I've come this far and I don't want to give up. I want to take care of my medical problems full force (as well as financials and other things) but there's only so much I can do; I'm a one man show! I don't even know where to go from here. On the other hand, it's hard not to think about giving up; a feeling I loathe just as much. I guess I'm overwhelmed, discouraged, and lost -- and it's really exacerbating my depression. I just needed to write it out and hope that someone will at least read it. Thanks for listening. "
3ejupt,10,2015-07-25,LDR. Me [30 F] with my fiancee [21 M] of 2 years both having cold feet and afraid of his ex,positivegamergirl,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ejupt/ldr_me_30_f_with_my_fiancee_21_m_of_2_years_both/,"Hi reddit, I'm not one to ask advice but lately I've been feeling really insecure.

So we've been together for 2 years and I've never found anyone whom I had so much fun and everything was so easy. We've been trough a lot already. Last year he was accused of something he didn't do and went to jail. At the time I got an Internship, as I'm from Europe and he's from USA, allowing me to be there for him. I waited, wrote letters and went to visit every time I could get ahold of a bit of money for the trip.

I know we have a big age gap although he looks older and me younger so when people sees us they never see anything wrong. He's been though a lot in life and is more mature for his age although I know he's still younger he usually doesn't act that way. His family adores me and I adore them back. I feel like I belong and when I'm there everything is perfect.

I had to come back to my country when my visa finished and he proposed to me right before. The wedding is next year. Everything was fine until one day we skyped and he told me he was unsure about marriage and all. His friends had been telling him all sort of stories and I'm sure that made him afraid, that he was too young. I told him the truth, that for me marriage was only a paper to allow us being together and that I could not be friends with him because I loved him too much and that would destroy me. But always telling him it was his decision to make even though I felt that way. He told me that he could wait until my next visit, meaning the wedding was still going on, and telling me he loved me deeply, that he didn't want to lose me and we ended having a good talk, everything going back to normal, even laughing as things are always fun and easy when we're together. But I'm afraid.

I really want to try this because I've never felt this way and would repent myself if I didn't, more when recently my grandpa passed away making me realize how short life is, but it also bugs me a lot and even though he was the one with cold feet, I am too because it really is a big decision to leave everything I know behind.

I also worry about his ex, with whom he has an old friendship. I understand that and I'm ok with it as I also have male friends, but for the things he's been telling me, it seems she still has feelings for him and even though I shouldn't, I was happy when she told him to do not contact her anymore (she is also engaged) after they went to have fun a couple of times.

I guess my insecurities always hit hard and time difference never helps. I only wish I could do something to make this feeling go away. I think he has, I surprised him by calling him and before I hang up he asked me some drawings we're preparing for the wedding to show his best friend. Still I'm having a hard time and worrying all over and I wish I knew what to do to worry less.

   
**tl;dr**: Age gap, engaged, ldr, cold feet and insecurities over ex."

The broker I chose has excellent training available and a great support staff, but I want all of the info going into things that I can get and want to be as prepared as I can be. I know not to expect to make any money right away and am prepared for that.

The main concern I have is that I am about to move to this city and do not know a single person. I am fresh out of college, but driven and willing to do whatever it takes. How do I meet people and get them to trust me? I guess my biggest thing is how do I convince someone that hiring me is a good idea when it would be my first deal? I'll be working full time as an agent and willing to do whatever it takes, but I'm just not sure how you get that first deal with no contacts in the area, especially as a super young, brand new agent.

Also, there's a team I am really interested in joining. How do you go about asking, and are teams generally open to taking on brand new realtors? I know the members only by reputation and performance in the area, and they work for my soon to be broker so I'm not sure how to approach them or if that is even appropriate.

I was hanging out with a couple of them last night and we were on our way somewhere. The other girl intern in the group was fairly drunk and I was trying to remind her of something that had happened a couple weeks ago, and mentioned it was ""the night those dudes catcalled us"" (I had gotten mad and she took it as a compliment). She then went on to say ""I'm like, an anti-feminist.""

I told her that if she were anti-feminist, she wouldn't be working. She conceded but continued to say the feminist movement was stupid, etc. I immediately kind of clammed up. The two guys in the group noticed and were like ""You're angry."" And I told them no, I was just uncomfortable. They tried to get her to drop it (and told me I needed another drink) but in her drunk state she tried to explain that she thinks men and women should be equal but the feminist movement is all wrong, etc.

I know the guys were more on her side because they were trying to also tell me that catcalling is just a compliment and why would you get mad about that. They had also just made a joke about trans people that made me uncomfortable as well. I just kind of got on my phone and tried to mentally distance myself. I just wanted to go home.

The rest of the night was OK but it was brought up again near the end and I just got the feeling that they all thought I was this crazy social justice warrior or something (funnily enough I am no longer friends with someone because she went deep, deep into the tumblr zone). 

I don't hang out with people who say these kinds of things. I grew up in a conservative, religious area where I was in the minority about every single opinion I had, and I'm just kind of done trying to bottle it up and just laugh along. I'm not really sure what to do here. We have a couple weeks left of the internship and I'm not sure if I should just like phase her out and not hang out to her anymore (like I normally would when people say stuff like that).

I like her as a person and I think she's fun, but I don't want to be put in situations like that again and put up with off-color jokes.

3ekqml,4,2015-07-25,Fear my depression has returned,Snufflebears,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3ekqml/fear_my_depression_has_returned/,"Hey reddit - I'm new, but have been lurking for several months now. I apologize if my situation sounds insignificant - I have been hesitant to post it. I don't have anyone I can confide in, as I'm sure it will be laughed away....I wrote this pretty quickly, so I apologize for any grammar/usage errors; english is unfortunately not my first language.

Little background: I'm a college student (sophomore) at an ivy league school. I'm doing very well, have lots of cool friends and am interning at a bank in NY. I've worked to be in this position for most of my life. Everything tells me that I should be happy, but I am not.

In high school I sacrificed a lot of my time to get good grades, test scores and to participate in extracurriculars. I've been funneled down this path by my parents, who I both love but can often be very intense. I had a lot of superficial friendships. I slipped into a depression my junior/senior year, when I became very stressed about getting into a good school and fell for one of the few girls I was truly close to. She had apparently had feelings for me before, but I was too busy to commit fully to a relationship (I'm not one of those types that can balance my social life and professional life. I didn't want her to know, as it was senior year and I didn't anything bad to happen between us - so I attempted to keep it a secret. However, my 'friends' told her anyway, and she then believed she couldn't trust me. I lost one of my closest friends and afterwards separated myself from those other 'friends' - what sort of 'friends' would do that? I felt empty - many days I would just return from school and sleep until late at night. I've never felt more alone - long nights studying, writing stupid college essays, running late at night through parks, and stealing/drinking my dad's beer just to take the edge off. I did get into my top school, was very happy, but had no one outside of my family to celebrate it with. Graduation was predictably terrible. 

I put that all behind me and began college. I did very well, and got back out there. I was playing sports again, going out with friends, and was able to enjoy myself with people I had just met etc. I was waking up looking forward to even gen-ed classes! Time passed and I believe I fell out of the depression - I found myself randomly smiling, instead of waking up feeling empty. 

But I am again beginning to feel at risk for falling back into depression. New York is great, but it makes me miss that girl I was once extremely close with, and the thought of possibly being with her has haunted me. I still have strong feelings for her, and feel very lonely. I feel that the persistent desire to be with her has inhibited my capability to form meaningful relationships with other girls and often even guys. I can't stop thinking about it and can't feel happy about anything. Point being: there's no point in doing well professionally, if you have nobody to share your happiness with. I haven't talked to her in two years and don't want to slip back into a state of depression. I know I am going into a high-stress profession. I know what I am getting into. I don't want my health to deteriorate - my family has a history of heart disease. I am considering seeing a therapist when I return to campus. I take NyQuil pretty much every night now just to go to sleep, as I have problems falling asleep. I take aspirin like breath mints just to get through every day as an intern. I find myself forcing smiles and ""yeah, I'm great""s  a lot now, just to keep up the illusion that everything is ok. I've been telling myself that this feeling is nothing serious, and it is utterly insignificant compared to what others are going through (I do a lot of community work), but I am lost and have nobody I can confide with. My parents wouldn't understand, my friends tell me that I should just get over her.....an endeavor I have found to be impossible. 

Thank you all in advance; any insight/advice would be highly appreciated. :)

3ekvvv,1,2015-07-25,I'll never experience a true romantic connection. (warning: long),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3ekvvv/ill_never_experience_a_true_romantic_connection/,"I really, really do not want to brag or humblebrag, but I need to offer a bit of context. To most, it seems like I have everything pretty well figured out. I'm eighteen, two years ahead in University, have a 4.0, and a summer internship at an Asian consulting firm. I hold a top position of student leadership at my college to the point of where I manage a multi-million dollar endowment and determine, as a singular example, whether/which graduate students receive large-figure research grants (with little more than my signature). 


This is why I have a hard time talking to anyone about personal issues faced; I think that life is made up of traditional success and social/personal success, and if I talk about my difficulties with the latter, it jeopardizes the former. Even if I wanted to talk to someone on a professional level (therapy), it would be on my permanent record, and I would not be able to enter the line of work I truly hope to one day. 


Being ahead came at a cost. I was educated in a non-traditional method which, when combined with being an only child, utterly demolished my social skillset. I'm only starting to learn that back now. But the damage is done to the point of where I've permanently missed out on human 'rites of passage' such as 'young love,' the type where you can get out of school at 3PM with no responsibilities and just share a genuine connection with someone you care about (or, at least, you think you do, because y'know, you're in high school). 

So, I'm a bit behind. It's fine, you can't expect to have found 'the one' at eighteen. But that's not what scares me - I truly don't think I'll ever catch up. 


I'm someone who is devastatingly bad at earning the interest of the opposite gender. I'm not a terrible looking guy - I groom myself well, average face (my features would make me a really attractive female, but the Y chromosome fucked me over), average-to-meh body, perfect skin/hair. But I'll never, ever be anyone's 'sexy' - I fit into no niche (unless semi-nerdy white guy with distinctly non-testosterone-driven features counts), and I utterly never have my (admittedly few) advances accepted. Nobody's going to eye me up as that night's hookup, and I've accepted that as just a fact of my life.  

Physically, I'm convinced that I'm really quite unattractive, and feel that even if I were to find someone on a long-term basis, I would feel bad; as if she could do way, way better. But that's thinking a few too many steps ahead.

But that's only the first half of the problem. I can't engage in conversation with people my age, which I blame my upbringing for. I come off as aloof, overly-professional, and pretentious - even in daily conversation (I've had foreigners tell me that I should drink to be less boring, and my staff mentor at University is entirely convinced I'm robotic, if that gives context). Hey, imagine that, a guy has issues talking to girls. But women who have already dated multiple men just will never find me interesting enough in comparison - my 'flirting skillset' is so insanely far behind because I've never had the chance to use it throughout my youth, it's almost a hard discouragement from trying in the first place. I feel more comfortable giving a speech to a thousand than making small talk with one, because I can guarantee how my interpersonal communication will go - poorly. 

The thing is - this is something I need. I know, barring vast circumstance, I'm going to have an upper-middle class life at least, and I will be comfortable. However, I can not go through any sort of life alone - I need someone to share it with, I need someone who actually fucking cares about me instead of just wanting to use me to their personal ends, someone to talk to at the end of a shit day.  And I am entirely convinced that I can not, and will never, find that person - the one thing that, as pathetic as this sounds, I've wanted since I was really young. I will be graduating before I am twenty, and I will be in the 'real world,' alone, when most have been developing relationships over the period of four year's time. For someone who everyone finds robotic (the amount of times my friends have half-jokingly shredded that into me is becoming painful), I really, really need people - and I would trade every single thing I've worked for over the last few years to have that sort of connection.

I don't know why - I've convinced myself that I'm entirely unlovable. I know that doesn't help, but when you see eighteen straight years of evidence in one direction, you don't find much else to go on.

Tonight, I probably would have tried to kill myself - it's something that I've thought about a bit before, but I really do think that my chances of ever being happy are permanently leaving. I can't do it overseas, because it'd complicate things too much for my family, and demolish too much of what I've worked to build for my University. 

In times like this, I might turn to my family, or to standard comforts of home. But I won't see any of that for months more, and I don't think I'll be able to survive that long in this state of mind. 

I'm not sure what I need to hear right now, but I need to hear something. I really appreciate you listening; this really is the only way I can get out how I feel."

Those capital letters mean it’s legit.  People have used the term in speaking to me, but this is the first time I’ve ever said (typed) it myself.  I was diagnosed when I was nineteen—about two and a half years ago now—after a childhood full of mysterious and confusing symptoms.  These have only gotten worse over time and, unfortunately, doctors haven’t been able to do much to help me.  I don't have a supportive “family,” so I attended these specialist visits, diagnostics, ER visits, hospitalizations…you get the idea… alone.  

I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and dysautonomia.  Collagen is the most abundant type of protein in the human body, and my collagen isn’t synthesized properly.  I have pain in my joints, which are unstable and dislocate multiple times per day.  I have fragile blood vessels, and I bruise and bleed easily.  My blood vessels seem to be unusually compliant, so blood pools in my legs whenever I’m standing upright or sitting in a chair.  To combat this, I need to wear full-length compression stockings 24/hrs a day.  Without the stockings, fluid accumulates and begins to spread to my arms, hands, torso, and face.  I can’t seem to regulate my blood pressure or body temperature, so during the summer I’ve been trapped inside.  I sleep with frozen towels and ice--but god, I sure miss blankets.  When I go out, I carry instant ice packs with me, but the relief that they offer in short lived and inadequate.  

I’m starting veterinary school in a few weeks, and I’m scared.  This past May, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with Distinction in Research.  During the commencement ceremony, I had to walk across the stadium to get ice from the EMTs because I couldn't tolerate the heat from the sun and my gown.  Not many people know about all the ways in which I am suffering, and I don't think anyone realizes how much I push myself every day.  Academically, I know that I am capable of making it through vet school.  Physically, I know that I can do it if I keep pushing...but my body hurts and my life hurts in so many ways.   There are medical assistive technologies, but I don’t have the money… especially as I’m just about to start earning a DVM degree.  

I can’t vent the heat out of my body and I can’t fix my waterlogged legs, but maybe getting some of this out of my head will make me feel a little bit better.  Here’s a story about what I want, and what I’m afraid my Illness won’t let me achieve.  

-----
When I was a child, I was given a box set of the Chronicles of Narnia by my mother’s best friend.  Although I do believe that these stories engendered in me a deep respect for non-human animals and influenced my desire to become a veterinarian, that is not what this essay is about.  Rather, it was the books themselves and the man who had given them to me that ultimately played a greater role in shaping my aspirations.  My “Uncle Joe,” as we called him, was a Jesuit priest.  He married my parents and baptized my siblings and me at the university, where both he and my mother taught.  On many Sundays, he would say mass for my family in our living room, and then stay for dinner; he was particularly fond of seafood and Vienna Sausages.  When he moved into a new residence hall for elderly priests, he was forced to give up his dog, Jackson, and she spent her last few years of life in my home.  Uncle Joe was significantly older than my mother, and before he died, he stated with a calm assurance that “Jackson would be waiting for [him] at the pearly gates.” I was only eight years old at the time, but the effects of his passing forced me to grow up quickly.

My mother lost her best friend and, with him, the ability to handle alcohol.  Over the following months, I watched in quiet helplessness as the woman who had cared for me weakened into one unable to care for herself.  The consumption of alcohol was hidden, and I did not understand what produced the nightly change in her manner.  I tried ineffectually to remedy the sadness that I observed by baking pies or cookies and bringing them to her in bed.  I had not yet been educated in school about the effects of alcohol on the body, and so did not understand why she could not eat them.  Increasingly confused, I kept her company in the queen-sized bed when my father was too angry to stay, and she would sleepily tell me how lucky I was.  

The time before Uncle Joe’s death consists of the years that I consider to be my childhood.  By the time my mother first entered rehab, she had started coming home from work drunk.  I learned to take her keys if I was concerned about her going out or, if she fought back, I would go with her.  On a few occasions, she snuck out without my awareness.  Having no knowledge of locations of stores, I went out on foot, with a goal but no direction.  My older siblings seemed less concerned about my mother’s wellbeing.  Rather, they took after her habits.  When I was sixteen, my brother began to use Klonopin, and his behavior became erratic and aggressive.  My sister, who had used drugs recreationally throughout high school, progressed to heroin addiction shortly after.  I soon discovered that the books from Uncle Joe, which had been his own copies, had been taken and sold for drugs.   

Uncle Joe was a “contented” man- that is what he would always say when asked how he was feeling, and he never asked or needed more than this.  His values became my own, but when I entered high school, I encountered starkly opposing views in my peers.  The social environment encouraged competition, perfection, and money.  I succeeded academically and maintained friendships, but was unhappy in school.  By the 10th grade, I was able to convince my parents to allow me to try homeschooling.   This later gave me the flexibility to shadow veterinarians during weekdays.

Using textbooks obtained from the school and supplementing with SAT and Regents prep books, I prepared syllabi for myself, and set goals for each week.  Without a teacher dictating the pace at which the course moved, I developed an awareness of when I had mastered the material and was comfortable moving on.  This skill became crucial in college as I prepared for exams.  Many of my friends would assume that they knew how to solve a problem, skip it, and discover only during an exam that they could not reach the solution.  I also discovered a true love of the terrifying but gratifying experience of flipping to the back of a textbook to check ones answer.  This was missing from learning by rote in public school, but the satisfaction was enough reward to motivate me to stay on task even without teachers, assignments or grades.  Today, observing this occur in another individual is my favorite aspect of tutoring in organic chemistry.  If one watches closely enough, it is truly possibly to observe a moment when something “clicks.” Knowing that I am responsible for that change, and seeing his or her excitement and relief as a previously bewildering question suddenly becomes clear, makes the initial struggle entirely worthwhile. 
 
My first true introduction to veterinary medicine my came when beagle, Holly, was diagnosed with lymphoma.  She had been named after Polly, a character in The Magician’s Nephew (one of the Chronicles).  This had been my mother’s suggestion, and undoubtedly a tribute to Uncle Joe.  Holly received treatment from Dr.R, and was in remission for nearly a year before the cancer returned.  Dr.R had once been described to me as Pollyanna-ish, but she was not excessively optimistic as the word suggests.  Rather, she served as an encouraging voice during the treatment.  She took time to explain the disease and treatment to me realistically and transparently.  Eventually, Holly began to struggle to breathe, and was euthanized at a specialty and emergency hospital owned by Dr. N.

In the months before Holly’s death, I had watched as the vets cared not only for her, but also for my family and me.  I was instilled with a sense that my actions could have a greater purpose.  I began shadowing Dr. R that winter, and observed her interactions with both animals and owners.  On one occasion, a woman came in with an underweight cat in need of thyroid medication.  She tearfully explained that her she wished to divorce her husband, but could not do so because she lacked financial independence.  The cat was her only companion at home and she was concerned about paying with the weekly allowance provided by her husband.  Dr. R calmly communicated with the owner and coordinated the treatment to minimize the charge as much as possible, while ensuring that the cat was taken care of.  Cases such as this led me to build courses in psychology, sociology, and communications into my homeschooling curriculum.  As I continued working with vets, my efforts developed a clear and directed goal.  Each day was exciting and I felt as if I were moving closer with every case or surgery I saw.  Regardless of the chaos at home, in the hospital I felt stable and secure.  I was in the background and was doing nothing concretely efficacious, but comments such as “good question” were enough to motivate me through my most challenging hours.

Interested in neurology, I began shadowing Dr. N the next year.  On the day that I observed my first neurosurgery, I was wearing a sweater that had belonged to Uncle Joe, a memento that brought comfort and confidence in myself.  Dr. N’s own confidence in me led him to ask me questions, engaging me in the same way that he did his interns and residents.  I was thus introduced to another aspect of veterinary medicine, and learned about the ways in which diagnoses are made.  I then developed my independent research project at my undergraduate university, which Dr. N continued to oversee at a distance.  After many years, this work was completed as an honors thesis.

This past summer, Dr. N asked if I would assist him in writing chapters in a well-known veterinary reference text.  I was honored to have been asked, and readily accepted, expecting not to be credited for my involvement.  I enjoyed the work immensely, and was thrilled just by the idea of writing sentences that would be printed, even if only Dr. N and I knew it.  In the final days of the work, he decided that my contribution had been so great that he contacted the editors, and I was made co-author.  He hadn't told me until he was sure, and then informed me over Skype.  He still speaks of the smile on my face when I found out, and I still smile when I think of it.

Over time, these people became my mentors, my friends and, ultimately, my family.  Their trust in my capabilities gave me strength and sense of purpose when everything else felt as if it was falling apart.  I am determined to use my power in a realm in which I am capable of effecting a positive change, and I enter now into vet school with a conviction to help animals and humans with their same compassion, diligence, and expertise.

3elzal,8,2015-07-25,Master Song List,thetvirus,weddingvideography,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingvideography/comments/3elzal/master_song_list/,"Some of us have been doing this a long time, and some are new. No matter where you are in your career, one place where I often spend more time than I would like is in choosing the music for the highlight films we produce. In the last few years we have tried to minimize the work by having interns sort through music licensing sites (mainly the  music bed) and creating a smaller list for us to sort through. However, I thought it would be great if as a community we could run through our recent licenses and list out what we have used song wise for the past few years (or however long you're willing to list). 

Hopefully this will help wedding videographers at all points in their career have a database to hop over to quickly and find some more options to sort through. A more condensed list.

So, I plan to do this sometime this week, but I think this could be quite useful to the community if others were willing to take the time to share as well.

The one rule for this is that is must be licensable. So, divide it up by licensing website and list the artist and track title!"

Customer Support refuses to do ANYTHING other than send me a new laptop, only for it to break down AGAIN!",tusing,razer,https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/3em618/razer_blade_14_broke_down_again_have_had_4_rmas_2/,"This probably has to be the most nightmarish customer support experience I have ever had. I'm genuinely afraid to use my laptop now. Defects after defects. First it was a screen flicker, then it was BSODs and the bottom pads coming off, then it was a broken fan, and then it was BSODs and a broken fan.

**Where is the Quality Control?**

I'm a college student. The laptop had to be in for repairs during my first semester midterms and second semester finals. It went in twice during my internships when I needed it. What the hell, Razer?

Then they send me a new laptop, with promises of ""it won't happen again"". They refuse refunds, because ""I've already had it a year"", while ignoring the fact that *out of the year I've had it, I've lost* ***everything*** *due to RMAs 4 times, and have not had my laptop for ~20% of the year.* 

Now I'm having GPU/PSU problems, it seems, where the laptop just immediately shuts off on any GPU-intensive game or task. I also have fan rattle. And college is about to start; customer support is still saying the same lies.

## This is truly the worst customer support experience I have ever had.

This can't be legal. Any advice? Suggestions?"

3emqcc,1,2015-07-26,[Dating] It's over after only two dates and I have no idea what I [24M] did wrong in her eyes [23F].,DyedinAsh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3emqcc/dating_its_over_after_only_two_dates_and_i_have/,"Backstory: she and I are coworkers.  I normally have a pretty strict policy against dating coworkers but she came on pretty strong with her hints, and is leaving in a few weeks time for an internship elsewhere, and so I bit the bullet and asked her to a movie that she had kept on telling me that I should see.  Any time both of us were working she would make a point of coming and making small talk.  She came on EXTREMELY strong in a few of those conversations.  I found the honesty somewhat refreshing.

Date One: Dinner and a movie was scheduled.  I showed up about twenty five minutes early since I thought it was the gentlemanly thing to do so that if she showed up early she wouldn't be waiting too long.  I picked up the tickets and sent her a text about 15 minutes before the film telling her that I had the tickets because I was starting to get anxious.  Five minutes later she showed up, which is reasonable.  I was wearing jeans a button up shirt with a jacket because it was just a movie date and I didn't want to be too formal.  I also wore my nice watch (more on that later).

As she got out of the car and spotted me inside the door I could tell that something was off.  Instead of coming to the door where I was waiting she immediately headed to the door on the other side.  I can be certain that she spotted me because when I headed to that door and opened it for her she seemed to have already noticed me.  She said something about bad traffic, and I smiled and told her not to worry about it.  I then asked if she wanted popcorn or something to drink while wondering what the problem was.  She splits off from me as we get up to the snack bar and goes to get her own thing.  No big deal, I don't mind going dutch on things, and it's not like I was trying to gain leverage on her by paying for things.  I brushed it off and we went inside and watched the film.

After the film she told me a number of things that surprised me as we were about to go to the restaurant.  She informed me that her younger sister had picked out her wardrobe and shown her some make-up tricks, and I wasn't sure how to react to that.  In my mind she was either fishing for compliments or criticizing my fashion choices.  I complimented her appearance and we went on to dinner.  Dinner got even weirder.  Our small talk wasn't any different than small talk at work, but she seemed uncomfortable.  She tried dragging our waiter into our conversation several times, to the point where he noticed the awkwardness.  I wasn't sure if it was nerves, if I had somehow verbally kicked a puppy in front of her, or what.  At the end she picked up the check, which I took as a decision to go Dutch since I had gotten the movie tickets.

She practically jumped out of my car as we got back to her car at the theater, and I've never had a girl want to get out of the car before I had even fully parked and walked her to the car.  I figured that something must have gone terribly, terribly wrong.  But I parked and walked with her to her car, where I was surprised by her saying that we should go out again sometime before going in for a hug.  I wrote it off as an awkward first date.

Interim: She stopped coming by and flirting so much.  I asked her if she wanted to go on a second date and after checking her schedule she asked if we could put it off a week.  I said sure, that it was no problem.  The next time we saw each other at work she went out of her way to explain that she was super busy and needed to rest which was why she turned me down and I told her that it was cool.

Date Two: We go to my place after work so I can make up dinner and we can watch a movie.  She follows me in her car which is entirely reasonable even it seems a bit paranoid.  For this date I'm dressed very casually in a t-shirt and jeans with a digital watch instead of my nice one because it's uncomfortable to cook while wearing.  While I'm cooking we make conversation, and that awkwardness is back in the room.  She mentions something about comparing the value of watches with someone at work and says that , and I point out that I can run comfortably while wearing my digital watch and expect to end it there.  She tells me that she can still run while wearing her watch.  I find the entire exchange super awkward but let it go.  As we're cooking she asks me the time and I ask if she has someplace to be, to which she responds that she doesn't.  I'm uncomfortable, and the awkwardness is still a presence in the room.  After a little more back and forth she tells me that it's been a long day at work and that she's out of conversation to make.  I pick up the slack and just talk for a bit while I cook, and she talks a bit too.  As I'm almost done cooking she asks if we can eat in the living room while watching the movie, and I say sure.  Clearly she doesn't want to interact.

So we sit and watch the movie.  After it's over she gets into a hurry to leave.  After collecting the DVD she asked what time it was, got a text on her phone which she explained as ""people only text me when I'm doing things"" and was in a hurry to leave.  Not even a hug goodbye when I walked her out to her car.  As she drove off I felt super awkward, as though this girl who told me ""I have nobody at all in my life except my cat"" had sized me up and spit me out without even explaining what her expectations were and how I didn't meet them.

We texted a bit after, and I brought up the awkwardness.  She proposed that maybe we rushed a bit into dating, and I agreed, so we de-escalated into being ""just friends"".  I feel that from the word go somebody who practically begged for a date had entirely unrealistic expectations for our dates and took out her frustration on me passively.  Used is a good word to describe how I feel.  Hurt is another.  I don't know what her issues were, and she never explained them to me.  She has denied me even the closure that comes with an explanation.

tl;dr: Dates went horribly, but I don't even know why.  Relationship is over before we drag ourselves on to a third date.  Why?"

We met in school at 17, sitting next to each other, and were both stellar students, decently sporty and very romantic. She was my first everything, and we rarely fought about anything, sometimes we had disagreements, like over how many sweets I ate, or my tendency to never wear shoes; but we always seemed to talk over and resolve them.

I joined the military around the time she went to the other side of the world to study, and we began our LDR. It wasn't exceptionally pleasant, but we talked often without talking too often, and whenever she came back for holidays we had the best time ever.

I was bullied in the military, and the course I was involved in was exceptionally brutal on my mind. I didn't have anyone else to turn to, and I constantly whined and raged about how everything was terrible. I understand now that negativity can destroy a relationship, and even as a student I was always fairly negative, and she supported me like a rock and helped me through the year long course even when she was far across the world.

Near the end of my military course, she came back and we celebrated so many things like our anniversary and her birthday. She told me she would love me forever, and I believed her. Like good students usually are, she was involved in all kinds of internships, and very stressed. Three days after a perfect birthday celebration, she called me out to 'discuss the things she was stressed about'. I used that time to make an encouraging card, because I wanted to be a good boyfriend. When I got there, she told me she wanted to break up. I was shocked. She said she could no longer tolerate my negativity and my self-absorption and the way I felt that everything was about myself, she had thought about it for a month and there was no changing her mind.

I was so shocked at the time, I actually responded incredibly maturely. I said I understood her perspective, I was sorry, I respected her decision and I hoped she would lead a good life. That was the model answer I had always given whenever my friends had hypothetical discussions about what to do in a breakup. It was the correct thing to do and say, but I didn't actually mean it.

One week later, I organised my thoughts and came up with an action plan on how to become more positive and less self-absorbed. I began smiling more, getting my friends to talk to me about their issues, opening up and sharing the load, and after a week I felt I had made good habits and was on a good path. I went to see her, told her everything, she laughed and smiled and I thought she was pleased, but still she said she had made up her mind. She did not respect me as a moral human being anymore, and hence she could no longer love me. The relationship was no longer special to her, and she did not want to save it.

I felt completely crushed, and though I originally thought I could put this and her down, it haunted me constantly. The thoughts and the responsibilities of the course drove me insane, and I spent most of my time brooding and overthinking. I tried not to contact her, but sometimes when I heard something that gave me hope, like when I saw a letter she had written just a few weeks back talking about forgiveness and eternal love, or when my parents mentioned that we could try a trial period, I would invariably text her. She is an incredibly intelligent woman, and I was a crushed and broken man, so she easily and pointedly deflected everything with her razor-sharp tongue; leaving me feeling pathetic on top of heartbroken.

But those were one-off incidents, on the whole I felt empowered to make real change in my life. I laughed and smiled and dealt with things in a positive manner, I became a listener and I cultivated a habit of generosity, selflessness and mercy. Everything seemed like it was getting better, and I would achieve the goals I had set for myself.

Later, we attended a formal ball. I wore a suit (the first time), bought her flowers, acted like a real gentleman throughout the whole thing. She held my hand, rested her head on my shoulders and told me she missed me. I thought it was a chance, and I opened up and told her about all the changes I had made in my life, all the bad habits I had eradicated and the new good ones I had made. She smiled, hugged me, said she was happy for me, but she had made up her mind.

In the morning, the swirl of emotions, coupled with the responsibilities of the military, the general stress and pain, combined to mess me up completely. I texted her, saying that I was working so hard to change, and I wanted her to walk down the road with me. She said she had to do the courageous thing, which was to walk away from a comfortable but unfulfilling relationship; and I said I resented her cowardice in running away from the relationship instead of fixing it and making it fulfilling. After a barbed exchange, she blocked me on Whatsapp.

I apologised to her on Facebook, saying that it was an ugly way to end things, and that I hoped she would find it within herself to understand and forgive me. She did unblock me, but she made it clear she still thought I was completely self-centered, that I did not consider her point of view, and that the whole thing was about myself. 'You really haven't changed at all.' Was the thing which hurt and stung me the most, after so much effort, so much work, so much progress, I felt like I had been dropped back down and smashed to pieces. She said she never wanted to hear from me until I could control my emotions and stop asking her to take me back.

My life is something most people would envy: I'm quite handsome, tall, going to a top university in the world, charismatic, fit and interesting. I usually have no problem motivating myself to do things other people deem insane, like learn French in 3 months. But now, after all this, I just feel stuck, reading reddits and running endlessly to try to stem the pain. The break-up broke me, and though I tried not to break down, I can feel it coming. I can't change her mind, but I can change me, but how do I motivate myself to carry on with my life? I don't want to say I feel suicidal because that might be attention seeking, but the fact is, I am beginning to feel the compulsion. And I know it's incredibly irrational, but I just can't stop myself. How do I let this girl go?

tl;dr I love her, tried to change for her, she doesn't care. How to let go?"
3enf7s,2,2015-07-26,Hagwon Help,shannondidhe,teachinginkorea,https://www.reddit.com/r/teachinginkorea/comments/3enf7s/hagwon_help/,"Hey all,
I know you're probably tired of this crap, so I apologize. I just came to Korea at the beginning of July and have been having some trouble with my hagwon. Not gonna go into details on location or anything but I'm really looking for some advice. I'll break it down:

I accepted a position at a hagwon under the old manager, who was fired before I arrived. It is my understanding that she ran the school into the ground and it's not doing well financially.

The class I was given has had problems in the past, parents had been very upset with the school several times and were not happy that the teacher I replaced left in the middle of the semester.

I have been under a lot of pressure from the administration to pull a hail mary and save the class, something I was totally incapable of doing as I had no teaching experience. I was open about my qualifications throughout the hiring process.

On Friday, I had to leave the school because I have a latex allergy and balloons were present. The administrator threatened my job, though I had told him about it before ever setting foot in the school and he said it would not be a problem.

Apparently after I left on Friday, the parents of my class demanded a teacher with better qualifications or they were going to pull their kids. I got an FB message over the weekend from my supervisor confirming this. I will post it below. (With some redaction to avoid revealing the location/identity.)

I was informed I was losing my job, as there is no longer a position for me. The school is demanding I reimburse the flight ticket and other fees and has essentially said they're not going to pay me.

I have a meeting with the owner tomorrow. He doesn't speak English but I am bringing a bilingual friend to translate. The official reason they are firing me is due to my latex allergy.

Here is the (edited) message from my supervisor:

I talked to (owner). Its going to be better for you teaching older kids like elementary school kids not kindergarten. Then you need to find other job through your recruiter. we can contact (recruiter). I am sorry for this. but I am not a mom. If moms want..then (hagwon) should do. I know how much you have rough time here. but you have to know how I have tried too with your moms.. I think the old manager who you had interview with made a big mistake not you and me. We can make a better decision. anyway have a good vacation. just forget about this for a week.

My questions are:

Is this unlawful dismissal?

Should I contact the labor board?

Any advice?

Thanks guys, sorry to bother you with this crap.

Edit:

I should also note that my contract states I'm in a 3 month internship period where I'd have to reimburse everything if I leave/am dismissed. However, it also states that I have to be given 3 warnings. I had been given teaching tips and told the school was under pressure from the parents, but was never given any warning my job was in danger.

Is this outside the bounds of my contract?"
3eo2b6,4,2015-07-26,"Long story...I really need to hear from other people about this. My long distance relationship fell apart (I'm 19/m, she's 19/f)",dpederson95,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3eo2b6/long_storyi_really_need_to_hear_from_other_people/,"Last year, my freshman year in college, I fell in love with an Indian girl. I'm 19/m, she's 19/f. 


We started as friends (Oct '14) . Neither of us wanted a relationship at the time. I knew she didn’t so I never tried to do anything like hook up with her. I just wanted to be friends. Time went on, and it turned out we really clicked, and we became best friends.


We had intimate moments before we even kissed.


Then one night, we hooked up (and by hooking up I mean sex) (Jan '15). We did that for about a month, hiding it from everybody. A few weeks in she told me she wanted to be exclusive. Then I invited her to my house for spring break. While we were there she told me to ask her to be my girlfriend (Mar '15). I did, and just like that we were official. Shortly after we got back to school, she told me she loved me. I loved her too, so I said it back. 


She was like nobody I’ve ever met before in my life. I’m a very thoughtful person. I have lots of opinions, and I’m passionate about a lot of things. But nobody in my life thinks like me. Even people that agree with me don’t share the passion that I do for certain things. But this girl does. She thinks like me. That’s such a powerful thing. For someone like me, someone who NEVER meets people that think the same as they do. I was in disbelief that I found someone like her.
And on top of that, she was absolutely beautiful, she shared my interests, she was so appreciative of everything I did (nobody in my life appreciates what I do like she does, my hobbies and interests are relatively obscure), and we vibed so well. Her roommate got a boyfriend with a single, so her roommate was gone every night basically when we started dating, so I was around her for hours a day, every single day. During spring break, we were around each other 24/7 for a week. And not once during all that time spent with her did I ever wish to be somewhere else. I loved everything about her. She was the perfect girl for me. 


So before her, I was a virgin. Before me, she has had sex with 14 different guys. That fact had always made me uncomfortable, but I always tried to just ignore it. Before the summer started, she proposed the idea of allowing me to hook up with other people, so that my sexual inexperience doesn’t become a problem later on in the relationship. I thought that made sense. I wanted to reciprocate though, and I told her that, since it wasn’t fair for me to see other people and for her not to, she didn’t have to promise me to not get with anyone else. At the time, I just wanted to make her feel better, and I told her that sex is meaningless without love, and that I’ll still love her after the summer regardless of what happens. I was just saying that, I discover later that that’s not how I really feel. Anyway, I told her to not seek it out. If she was just drunk at a party and it just happened, I would have been alright with that. I just didn’t want her to do it sober or anything, or with a guy she had been talking to for a while.


So with that, we depart for home for the summer. (May '15)


At first, we facetime every day, and I text her as much as the time zones will allow. But then I start my summer job, and she started her internship, so we just couldn’t face time as much.


She has depression.


I helped her as best as I could through it when I was at school with her. I was always there for her immediately when she needed it. I wanted to help her. Her depression only got worse when she got back home. She would facetime me and tell me about it, and I would break down into tears over the phone with her multiple times, because I cared about her so much that seeing her so sad made me sad as well. Because of this, she eventually tells me that we need to stop facetiming each other, because she’s tired of “bringing me down with her.” I was crushed. I didn’t want to, I didn’t care how sad she was making me, I just wanted to keep seeing her face and hearing her voice.
I guess you could say this was the beginning of the end.


Weeks go by, and I still text her every day at this point. One day, she was texting me about doing molly at a concert. I absolutely didn’t want her to do molly, and I told her that. It got me thinking about how people say that you should never have sex while on molly, because it would be so good that sober sex wouldn’t feel good anymore. And that really got me thinking about her having sex with other people. So I told her I wasn’t OK with it, that I changed my mind. So then she waits 3 days to respond because of the times zones and her busy schedule. She texted me while I was at work (I’m a lifeguard, so I could text on the job when I wasn’t guarding). She told me she had already slept with someone else.
As soon as I read that text, I lost it. The room started spinning. I felt like I was falling. My vision was blurry. My hands were shaking uncontrollably. It was really bad. I had to leave work right then and there, I told my boss I was feeling sick, and that is very out of character for me. I was totally crushed. 


She told me she had been texting him for 20 days before she invited him back to her place to have sex


Soon after I kept telling myself that I told her it was OK, because she had already thought that sex was meaningless, and she kept telling me that the sex she had with him was totally meaningless. But I don’t believe that. I don’t think sex is meaningless, and for her to have full on sex with another guy so soon after we had left school was heartbreaking.


(I hadn’t at that point had sex with anyone else. I hadn’t really wanted to honestly)


I decided at that point that I just needed to get over this. I told her it was OK, so she technically wasn’t breaking any promises. So a few weeks go by, and I start texting her normally like I’ve been doing. But I kept looking at her snapchat stories, and seeing her in pictures with other guys. The would be standing next to each other arm in arm, and they would be touching faces in a few of them. For the most part I was fine, I’m a happy person, I don’t get sad very easily. But seeing those pics of her with someone else took me right back to the moment I learned of her infidelity. And I told her that. Over text, I said it really hurts me seeing you in pictures with other guys like that.
3 days after I tell her that, she posts on Instagram a very intimate looking photo with another guy. She’s sitting on his lap, right on top of his crotch, with her arms around his neck, and he has his hands around her hips. At first I tried to ignore it, but one day, I saw yet another picture of her with another guy. And that set me off. One thought led to another, and before I knew it I was texting her about how rude and inconsiderate she was being to me, and how unacceptable it was considering how much I cared about her.


Of course, she was out partying, so she couldn’t respond until the next day. 


So I type out journals. As much as I’m able to, I type out what’s happening in my life at any given time. I express my deepest, rawest, most inner thoughts. They change from day to day, they in no way reflect what kind of person I am in that I could feel differently about something hours after I type it out. I save each document in google drive. I had google drive signed in on her iphone while we were still at school.


The next day, she admitted to reading my journals. In a journal that I wrote right after we started hooking up, I called her a slut. She was always very resentful of people that slut shame. I said it on impulse because I knew she had a reputation, and I was weighing the pros and cons of dating her. She read this early on in the summer, right around the time we stopped facetiming. She had sex with that guy out of spite for me.


I was extremely violated. I hold those journals very close to my heart. They are VERY personal. They are not meant to be viewed by anyone except myself. I was livid. She committed a major violation of my trust. I felt exposed.
But I hate talking about heavy shit over text. I don’t even give myself time to think about this at the time. The next day, I was texting her like normal again. I wanted to just forgive and forget. 


Then one day, she starts texting me about how she wants to “end things for the summer” to give herself peace of mind. She never explains why, she’s very vague. I think it’s because she wants to have sex. She then tells me that it’s not because of sex, and that she wouldn’t think twice about having sex with a whole bunch of guys and not telling me about it because that’s how meaningless it is for her. 


Then, she tells me that she’s not as committed to the relationship as I am, not yet.


That was it for me. I had to stop texting her then and there. Remember, she was the one that advanced the relationship to the next level every time. She wanted to be exclusive. She wanted to be my girlfriend. She said I love you first. She drew me in, made me fall in love with her, and then she slowly pushed me away, only to throw me out just like that.


I called her on facetime the next day to try and break up with her. She told me to wait until we got back to school and tell it to her face. I’ve hardly talked to her since. As soon as I called to break up with her, I wanted to call her right back and tell her I didn’t really want to. But my phone just happened to break right after that, so I had time to think. 


And in the day of the following week, she posted multiple pictures of herself with other guys. In seeing those, now I’m at the point of not even wanting to talk to her.


She knows this is all her fault. I told her straight up when I was trying to break up with her about how much she’s hurt me. I don’t blame myself for anything.


It’s been 2 weeks. I haven’t texted her once, and she hasn’t either. 


We go to a small liberal arts school. I’m going to see her around all the time on campus for the next 3 years and I’m terrified of it. Because I know that if I were to get back together with her when we got back to school, everything would be fine. She would treat me right, just like she did last year. But I can’t get back with her now.


I need some advice. How do I proceed from here? How do I get through the rest of the summer? How should I interact with her once we get back to school? Should we try to be friends? Should I reconsider breaking up with her for good? I need advice. I’m lost.


tl;dr: I fell in love with an Indian girl in college, our relationship fell apart during the summer, and we go to a small school so we will  inevitably see each other all the time for the next 3 years and I'm terrified and need help with how to proceed from here

3eoctm,8,2015-07-26,[NeedAdvice] I'm fighting a losing battle.,sonitary,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3eoctm/needadvice_im_fighting_a_losing_battle/,"It's 1:01 am. School starts in less than 7 hours. And that's not the only thing that I'll be stressing about. 

I sound like a parrot saying the same things over and over and over again. I sincerely apologize if I annoyed ~~some~~ many of you. It's just that I would like to say something very clear. It's not fun when you expect shit to come together, but eventually it doesn't. It gets worse when nobody is on your side.

I've already been told. ""Take some of these colleges out of your list. You won't make it there"" ""Are you sure you want to apply for this course. You won't survive. Heck, you won't even get into the college."" ""You don't have enough extracurricular activities. And you're curriculum doesn't look that good. Not that you had a choice, but it seems that you wasted a lot of time."" ""You have zero chance in the top colleges. If this person who took 9 SAT Subject Tests, 4 AP courses, 5 internships, and a highly rigorous curriculum couldn't get in, why should you even try?""

I've heard it all. From friends and family and admissions counselors. For some reason, the world is conspiring against me. And it comes at a time when I'm supposed to be working hard on my senior year, on my SAT's, on my final year of extracurricular activities, on my final chance to make my application seem less shit than it already will look like.

How bad do I want this? Can't people see how much I'm worrying about so many details? I don't get why people around me still ask that question when I've clearly told them that I'm having trouble making myself look ""admit-worthy"".

I've been thinking about it lately. All I need to do to end all this psychological stress is to tell people that I give up and that I'll settle with college in a local university and never get the job that I want. Anyway, I've been practically wasting so much money on a losing battle.

I need advice on how to make sense of all this mess in any way, shape, or form. I need to know how people manage to get through situations where they know they are losing, but they continue to march on. I want to learn why people have to experience watching their dreams crash and burn before their eyes and how to wrestle through the emotional breakdown it could actually cause.

My check engine light came on four days ago, however everything feels the same when driving. I took it to get the oil changed today and they said everything under the hood looks perfect. Afterwards, I took it to get the code pulled at different auto shop and it was P0455 ""EVAP Emission System Leak Detected Large Leak."" I couldn't afford the full diagnostic (living on an unpaid intern's salary =/) so I've come to reddit for help! 

Another thing that may or may not be related is when I get gas, the nozzle sometimes auto-shuts off the gas flow unless I hold it in a certain position for as long as it takes to fill the tank.

I know it's not the gas cap, the car runs exactly the same as before the light came on, and the cars been looked at by four different professional shops in the past 90 days (but only one since the light's been on) who say everything looks great. 

So I guess my questions are:
What could be the culprit?
How much should it cost to fix?
Does it need to fixed immediately?

This is my first car so I really don't know much about repairs. Also, I have to drive across the country about 2,000 miles in about a month, so I'm guessing even if it's not an urgent repair I should get it resolved before then, yes?
Thanks so much! "
3eoomb,1,2015-07-26,Thoughts on Achievement Striving and How it Worsens Anxiety (of all types).,Swayt,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3eoomb/thoughts_on_achievement_striving_and_how_it/,"Just something to notice for people who feel that their social anxiety or depressed feeling are related to constant striving and being stressed out at ""not meeting the bar"".



I was in a tech school with a highly abrasive crowd, who will openly scoff and scorn at everything that they feel that is 'too easy'.  Some examples, are:

* ""oh you thought that exam was easy? Its going to be down curve now""
* ""oh, that is just a simple &lt;some work here&gt;, it probably should only take you 10 minutes to do it. If you took longer, then I feel sorry for you.""
* ""I got 10 internship offers after 12 interviews, how many did you get?""
* ""this company offers $x and relocation, yeah! it sucks to be stuck in your home town""




When constantly berated by these lines, I unconsciously develop a sense that I was totally inferior and that I don't deserve to be happy until I achieve similar results. 

* This left me drained and lost daily, which in turn worsens my social anxiety. *It was especially bad for me near the end of my 4 years, when I literally had it drilled into my head that every coworkers must think I am stupid.
* I burned myself out to achieve the same results, and was too anxious to ask questions.




After living like this for a while, a switch suddenly flipped, and I just said **fuck it**, I don't care about achievements, don't care about money, I **stopped comparing myself to others**.  In doing so, something profound happened:

* I started doing the &lt;simple crappy&gt; projects that my classmates kept telling me are worthless. I make consistent improvements, and found motivation.
* I stopped worrying about my job progression. My manager actually handed me a major tasks out of the blue.
* I stopped being afraid of being stupid (I accept that I am, but I'll get better) and asked questions, this led to me completing all my tasks 2x faster.
* Life got better, I started learning to enjoy all the friends, family and stuff that I was too busy to see while *striving* so damn hard.



I just wanted to share this discovery in case it helps anyone else. Like with all things, it might not help you. Though take a minute, and stop *striving*, tell yourself this.

* Is this something I truly want? 
* Am I burning out?
* Is this the state of mind I want to stay in for the next 5 years?
* Is this just something I am doing to satisfy my own feelings of inferiority?
* Am I trying to use the promise of future achievement to cover up another anxiety?
* How much fun did I miss out to get meager results?




Some parting thoughts I leave with the reader:

* Maybe your anxiety is deeply rooted in how you compare yourself to others.
* Maybe you never went to find what you truly desired, and the anxiety is just the warning bell telling you that this path is not working out.
* Take a break, have some water, take a walk. Plan some leisure time. Plan some time to detach from achievements.

3eowkb,156,2015-07-26,I just stormed off [22F] on my boyfriend [30M] after discovering unsettling email. Am I doing the right thing?,czechsuspicion,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3eowkb/i_just_stormed_off_22f_on_my_boyfriend_30m_after/,"I have been with my boyfriend for over 3 years. We met in the US and went long distance for a while when I moved back to my European country. I was a student and not making much but I was saving to visit him regularly in NYC. On one of my visits I snooped in his phone and discovered he was having an affair with an engaged 35 year old woman. I then waited all day to confront him and was about to stay with a friend for the rest of the trip. But he cried, said he was sorry, said that the distance was putting him into depression and that it was to relieve the pain that he cheated. So I caved in and decided to stay with him for the last week of my trip on the condition that he cut all contact with her. But then we somehow stayed together and I feel deeper in love with him.

He ended up moving to my European country for good. I still had suspicions about him even though my trust was slowly healing. Then I made the mistake of looking into his phone and discovered he was still emailing the woman he cheated on me with. Let's call her Tina. I confronted him and he said he was talking to her because she was going through a rough patch. I told him that I really wanted her out of his life, that was the deal. Even if she was in the US and us in Europe, it seemed just unhealthy to keep tabs with her. I even asked him if it was too much to ask and he said that no, he understood.


Cut to today, we now live in Berlin, Germany, where we moved because I got an internship. I thought things were going okay for us, no big arguments, lots of laughing and he helped me cope with the stress of writing my thesis. But then I got a great job offer this week at company where I'm interning and started questioning if I really wanted to stay here long term with him. I looked into his phone again. (I know, it's bad, I have no excuse).


What I discovered grossed me out to no end. Not only was he still emailing Tina but he was telling her about masturbating thinking about her. He told her that although he loves me very much, it's not a coincidence he is still emailing her, he still has fantasies about the last time their bodies touched (so... when he was cheating on me) and he would still hope in a corner of his head to share more moments like that again.

I lost it. I started breathing heavily. My temples were beating hard and my chin was trembling. I came back to the bedroom where has taking a nap and threw the phone at him. Put some clothes on and stormed off. I left the email open in the phone, so he probably knows what's up.


It's been an hour and I haven't heard of him since. I'm in this strange city where I barely know anyone. I don't even know about that job offer anymore. Should I ask him to talk and hear his side? Did I do the right thing? There's another problem, he's basically broke (and owes me 400 euros), we were supposed to come back to my country in 4 days to renew his European visa, as a COUPLE. He needs a statement from me of its over for him here.  If I don't help him, he'll have to go back to the US but he has no money. (He actually owes a whole lot of credit card debt and never filed for taxes so I think he must owe a lot of money to IRS for the settlement money he has been living off of). Should I just forget about him and let him fend for himself? I have a lot of resentment but I don't want him to be homeless either.

Forgive the poor formating or grammar, I'm on mobile

*TL;DR: bf of 3 years still emailing suggestively the woman he cheated on me with 2 years ago. I stormed off on him. Not sure if I should try to talk, help him with his visa or forget about him*"

3epj44,17,2015-07-26,What was your journey like when you were learning PowerShell and What advice would you give to someone new just started out doing PowerShell?,THINNINGnotBald,PowerShell,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/3epj44/what_was_your_journey_like_when_you_were_learning/,"Hey /r/PowerShell !

I am currently doing a 6 month internship in a flexible role which allows me to try new things, and guess what? In the past month and a half, I have jumped into doing PowerShell!

I have completed the intro course on Lynda.com on PowerShell scripting and now going through the Scripting and Automation course on Lynda.com, and working with SCCM (read only access) and pulling lists of Servers that need to be patched, etc.

It is an exciting opportunity - however, I feel that I am far from becoming what I can become and I feel that my code is definitely not ready for production.

So I was wondering if I could ask you guys/gals about your journey learning about PowerShell and if you have any advice for inspiration to keep going when things get tough, deadlines start approaching and management gets antsy because they just want to see results???

I do prior experience working in IT as a QA tester, but that job was really repetitive doing Regression testing, so I am so happy to learn PowerShell and try to automate some manual tasks - it is such a refresher!

Thank you for reading!

Edit: These are the challenges I am struggling with in terms of PowerShell related: 

1) Error Handling, how to add ""try, catch"" to my code

2) How to make a menu which offers the choices of some names of collections in SCCM, so that the people using it can choose a certain collection name, and the code will give them a list of all servers that belong to that collection name (hence, a list of servers that are a member of a chosen collection).

3) How to query the SCCM database without having GUI access to the SCCM console. Currently I don't have GUI access to the console, which is making my tasks really difficult because I know there are commands you can run to get the information if you launch PowerShell through the SCCM console. I tried loading SCCM modules into my own machine but was not able to do so (will try again and verify this part). Right now I am using WMI to do the work based on what I am finding online.

4) How to choose a project to work on that will help the team the most? Currently another manager in the Infrastructure team is giving me really good feedback and advice on. I am currently not really liked by another manager, because when I first started, I was doing IT Tier 2 desktop support and doing it well. Then I discovered powershell and it has opened my eyes. I know this is an internship, but I also need some positive reinforcement to keep going the path that I want to go to (which is to become a developer, Android dev if I don't have any other choice, but open to becoming Infra/DevOps as well as I keep learning new things and being challenged and if I find a good boss.)"

I am currently have an internship with the Los Angeles Dodgers and my group is trying to improve the efficiency of concession lines at Dodger Stadium. As we all know, the concession lines are extremely long and at times can ruin the game experience. There have been many instances where people have missed an inning or two of the game waiting in line to buy food. Our group has an idea to fix this issue but we don't know if it would be well received by dodger fans, so who better to ask than passionate dodger fans. 

Using an app we want to allow fans to have the ability to order food and have it delivered to their seats. This would not only shorten the concession lines, but it would also improve the game experience as fans would not have to miss a moment of the game. To use this service you would need to pay a transaction fee of $2 or $3 in order to cover the expenses of the workers. Food would be delivered within 10 minutes. So what do you guys think? Do you like the idea and would you be willing to use the service? All the feedback is appreciated. Thanks in advance."

3epqs9,1,2015-07-26,"Whelp, I just ruined my whole summer and let ""the one"" get away",FlyingJae,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3epqs9/whelp_i_just_ruined_my_whole_summer_and_let_the/,"This is going to be long. Fuck it. I need to vent.

**TL;DR** Just had my summer ruined on what should have been my vactation, thanks to fapping it all away. In a really bad place right now.

A little background: I've been addicted to PMO for several years now, it all started before puberty. I was given porn by my stepfather and encouraged to use it because he thought I was gay. I'm going on 30 now. Never had a girlfriend, never kissed, never even held a girl's hand in my life. Never gotten past a second date, and haven't been on any for that matter in years (and I'm a fucking Mormon...well, aside from swearing a lot, I'm pretty observant. Oh yeah, and something something porn and shit something something.). Had plenty of crushes though, and they've all ended in the spectacular agony of being stunted with the emotional maturity of a fifteen-year-old.

Well, I just went through another one. Could have been a love story, if it weren't for the fact that PMO has turned me into a complete pussy. 

I am an American citizen, but I have spent quite a bit of time in another country, beginning almost a decade ago, just visiting for months at a time here and there. I've mastered the language and gotten pretty assimilated every time I've been here. This country also happens to have the most amazingly beautiful women I have ever seen. They've ruined me for American girls forever, true story.

Last time I was here, I ran into a wonderful girl at a party. I was actually with someone else, but things were quickly going down the tubes. Didn't matter though. I'm not typically one to move on so fast, but this new girl was amazing. A true 10 on the outside, very easy to talk to, with an interesting life and tons of mutual hobbies...I was hooked. After I got back to the states, she found me on Facebook and we started messaging each other. I truly could not get her out of my head, and started looking for excuses to come back. Well, I managed to land an internship.

I've made several half-assed attempts at NoFap in the past, sometimes with better motivation than at other times. Most of my streaks are in the ""couple of days"" range, with the occasional week and a half and one two-month-ish run a few years ago. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that when using PMO I turn into a defensive, excuse-making, closed-off, unmotivated, narcissistic shell of a man. It doesn't take a very long streak for me to realize that PMO is truly *the* thing that is holding me back. 

Anyway, I've been here all summer and, you guessed it, fapped almost every day. I completely lacked the motivation to do well in school (and this summer was a truly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to boot) and didn't get in touch with the girl of my dreams until about three weeks ago when a group of friends arranged to have me tag along for a road trip. Unbeknownst to me, this girl was the organizer of the trip. We talked a decent amount and had a blast. I was pretty sure she was into me. 

That road trip was itself a week-long streak for me. I was tempted numerous times to beat off, but I held my ground every time. I've come to realize that NoFap has the chicken-and-egg problem, at least for me, of being really doable when you are secure and loved. The trouble is, if I'm fapping regularly, I don't seek out that love or feel it from others. So it was easy for that week, and I was lucky to be separated from technology and put in close quarters with her. 

As soon as I came back, within a day, I was back at it again. I decided since I only had three weeks left, I was going to make a move anyway. I told myelf I would give myself a week of abstinence from PMO for the positive psychological effects. I did great up until Saturday, day six, but a couple of NSFW subs, some Bing searches, and a lot of videos later, I had whacked off 4 times in as many hours. When I finally ""came to,"" I decided I wasn't going to think about it. Just brush it off, minor slip, nothing happened, gotta stay focused. So I got up nice and early, took the two hour trip to her city, and showed up where I knew she would be going to church with the intention of asking her out on our first real date. She was really excited to see me and got really giddy while we sat and talked together.

I'm not actually sure what happened next, and I'm sure the next few days will be full of explanations as I start to lose certain people from my life. But I do know that I was being a total coward about the situation. Long and short of it is, a mutual ""friend"" who knew about my intentions started talking to her, I saw them whispering and looking in my direction. I was so embarrased and felt so betrayed, I left and went into the bathroom to go collect myself but just couldn't do it. I literally tried to climb through the window and just GTFO of there. No such luck. Came back out, girl is getting hit on by another dude. Yep. As I was leaving, she gave me a hug and peck on the cheek goodbye and, hand-in-hand with dudebro, told me we needed to ""talk sometime about something."" 

If I had just acted sooner. If I had just manned tf up and made the first move. If I had stuck to my goals and didn't waste my sexual energy on skinpixels. If, if, if, if, if if. Of course, there were multiple forces working against me here, but playing the victim is what got me where I am now. So I'm going to go ahead and take the blame this time and maybe learn from it.

I shivered and cried like a fucking lunatic all the way home on the bus and have now thought about suicide multiple times. Finally managed to fall asleep on the couch for a few hours just now and decided to write this, but now I'm just numb. This isn't going to go away anytime soon, and I'm really not looking forward to that conversation with her and possibly her new boytoy. After being betrayed, I feel like I have no friends or anyone I can trust anymore, so I'm ironically posting this on the internet for random strangers to see in a last-ditch attempt at calming down."
3epray,44,2015-07-26,How the show could end (if it ever does),[deleted],greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/3epray/how_the_show_could_end_if_it_ever_does/,"Meredith is sitting in the attending's lounge looking over a patients chart. She sees Maggie and Bailey there chatting away.
    
""Maggie, can you consult on my pancreatic tumor patient? He is having some chest pains.""
    
""Meredith, you don't have pancreatic tumor patient"", Bailey says instead of Maggie. ""Meredith you're not a doctor anymore.""
    
""What do you mean I'm not a doctor? Bailey whats going on?""
    
""Mom"" Maggie says calmly. ""It's me, your daughter Zola.""
    
""Maggie stop joking around. Are you available for a consult or not?"" Meredith says, upset.
    
Maggie and Bailey look at each other with disappointed looks on their faces. ""I told you it she wouldn't remember, Zo. She's too far gone."" Bailey says.
    
The scene switches from the attending's lounge to Roseridge Home for Extended Care, the home where Ellis and Adele stayed when they had stayed when they had Alzheimer's. Bailey turns into an older version of Maggie, Maggie turns into an older version of Zola. Meredith comes to the realization that she's no longer in the attending's lounge.
   
""I have it, don't I?"" Meredith asks while in tears.
    
""Yes Mom, you have Alzheimer's."" Zola says. ""I have to go to work now. It's the first day of my internship, and I don't want to look bad in front of Chief Karev.""
    
""Alex is Chief of Surgery? Wow I really have been gone for a while."" Meredith says, completely stunned.
    
""Come on Zo, I'll give you a lift to the hospital."" Maggie tells Zola, welling up.
    
The scene then cuts to Alex, who is visibly older. He has all the new interns in the OR giving the speech that Webber gave the interns on their first day in the first episode. The scene fades out on an exterior shot of Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital as the credits roll.

3epvna,84,2015-07-26,Had sex with my co-worker and made my gf cum.,fausto_silva,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3epvna/had_sex_with_my_coworker_and_made_my_gf_cum/,"It happened yesterday. I work at a big company in my country (not a English language place, so sorry about any grammar mistakes) and so we have some interns working with us. In my floor there's 4 interns, and the one that sits near me is called Lisa. Lisa is 18, has wavy long hair, has 1,50m, small breasts (A Cup?) and an incredibly Latina booty, hard and big. Every time she walks in the corridor people stare at her ass, including women and of course me - one time i even let my coffee fell on the floor. To sum up, she is incredibly hot. I usually only talked to her about work and eventually others things, but never anything sexual.

I am 22 and have a gorgeous girlfriend for 5 years and recently we started to have kind of a open relationship - we can have sex with other people if the other one is ok with it. It seems the perfect world, but until yesterday, any of us went too far with other people, maybe because we have a great sex life.

Last Sunday my gf went back to her hometown on vacation for 2 weeks. The last time we saw each other she said it would be ok if I had sex with someone during this couple of weeks and I replied saying the same - It was the first time we would be far for that long and I think it was great we made that clear.

On Thursday, after returning from lunchtime (ps: I usually lunch earlier than everybody does and she is always the last one to go eat), I noticed that Lisa was looking sad. As She was the only one in the room and I had not masturbated nor had sex since my gf went to her hometown I decided to talk to her and see where thing could go.

“Hey Lisa, how are you? You are looking so sad I thought It was another girl here”

“haha hi OP. It is nothing …. I just break up with my boyfriend. He yelled at me because I was wearing “bitchy clothes” to hang with my friends.”

“WOAH, what? Really? He know that you can dress anything you want? If what he wanted to say was that you looked TOO HOT I would be pretty happy to see you with it, if I was your boyfriend”

“So you want to see me with hot clothes huh? Haha”

I got embarrassed and quite did not answer her question and she left for lunch. The rest of the day, I realized she was staring at me from her desk and walking slower when passing by me. At first, I thought I was daydreaming but two coworkers said she was staring at me too much.

Everything was the same on Friday, until Lisa came. She was hot as fuck. She was wearing high wheels, a tight black shirt that showed her tiny but beautiful cleavage and a really tight dark blue legging that showed how big her ass is. It was so tight that it seemed that she was wearing no panties but you could see she was wearing a tiny thong that was hiding her camel toe. She walked like she was a model and the corridor was her private catwalk. Then she said “good morning guys” and gave me a fatal stare. I felt my cock harder than ever. The whole morning I tried to work but I couldn’t stop looking at her and I noticed she did know I was staring at her. She came to talk with others coworkers about 3 times, and every time I could get a look at her perfect ass, like she was just teasing me. After having lunch, I found an office empty except for her. I ignored her and went to my desk to browse some reddit when she came to my direction.

“Hey OP, how are you? So, did you like my outfit?”

“Well Lisa I’m fine and I can see you are great too, you look very pretty.”

“Thanks OP! Do you think my ass looks bad?” – and then she turned back to show her booty.

“I think it looks perfect.” – I was completely hypnotized by that fantastic piece of ass right in front of me. I still think all of this was a fucking dream or that it was a joke. After this my cock was growing and I could not possibly hide from her anymore.

“I can see. It seems you have a nice cock too” – When she said this I kinda freaked out. My cock is not as big as the cocks we see here, but it can make some magic. Anyway, she saw me froze, kneeled, unzipped my trousers and took my cock on her hand, just playing with it. “Wow it a beautiful cock!” And then she put it back and zipped my jeans.

“What was that Lisa?”

“Come on OP, I know you are always looking at my ass. I mean, everybody looks, but you look like an animal, it makes me think of that song Closer from NIN” (ps: I really liked that quote, didn’t know she knew NIN)

Then she got up and told me I was having a meeting now at the meeting room in five minutes. Holy crap. It was happening. Then I came back to me and noticed I had to talk about my girlfriend about this. I sent her a message on the facebook and waited but got no response. I decided to go to the meeting room explain Lisa the situation, but in the moment I got there she came kissing me real hard and DAMN she is a great kisser.

I held her and explained the whole situation about my gf and the open relationship stuff and Lisa said it would be better for us if I called her right now. As soon as I got my phone I received her fb response saying she was okay with it and the fact that it was probably going to happen at work made her really horny. Given the OK we were about to start fucking but she sent other messages, asking for photos of Lisa giving me head, getting pound from behind and with my cum. Just reading my gf asking for photos made me even more hornier and so did Lisa that agreed with taking the pics.

Finally “free” we resume our make out session that didn’t take so long. She kneeled, took of my jeans and put my hard cock in her mouth. Damn, it felt amazing been sucked by other mouth – I mean, my girlfriend still has the best blowjob ever, but Lisa was pretty good. She like to suck it roughly, deepthrotting it while holding my ass. I was almost forgetting but I took a photo of Lisa sucking deep and sent to my gf. Her answer was a photo of her hand going down on her pussy. Damn.

Then Lisa got up and whispered to me not to move. She took three steps behind, turned around and while scored on the table she started taking her legging slowly with one hand, never taking her eyes from me. She then revealed the best piece of ass I’ve ever seen in my life – it was perfect I cannot describe how incredible it was, it was so firm and round. I jumped to reach that ass and started licking her asshole and pussy and fingering her clit while she was shaking her booty on me. She took her shirt off and bite it to turn down her moaning. She came pretty quickly and then she pushed me to lay down on the floor and started riding me, reverse-cowgirl style. Damn, I could look her ass riding my cock forever. One thing that I loves about fucking her is that she tries to maintain visual contact all the time.

Then she said “come on we don’t have much time, fuck me from behind” while getting up and scoring on the table with her gorgeous ass up. Seeing that image I went to suck her more, but she said “OP I love you eating my pussy but I need your cock to fuck me hard”. I’m a obedient boy, so I got up and started fucking her pussy hard from behind.

Each thrust I gave she moaned louder, so i decided to put a finger in her mouth and she started sucking it and biting when I thrusted her. Then I remembered the photo and tried to find my phone that was on the floor. I stopped fucking her to get the phone and when I was resuming our from-behind session she said “well if you’re going to fuck me from behind you should do it right” and put two fingers inside her asshole.
Holy. Shit. 

I just followed her advice and put it there. It was incredibly tight and I had a hard time at the beginning but after a short time I was fucking her brains out and then took the picture to my gf. Lisa wasn’t even trying to look at me anymore, she was just focus on the anal while moaning for me to got faster.  Unfortunately I didn’t last too much and when I asked where I should cum she yelled “IN MY ASS FUCK”. I came like for 10 seconds? Didn’t know I could cum so much. Sent the photo of my cum in her asshole to my gf that said she came with the anal photo.
We quickly got dressed, and when we returned to our room a few people had returned from lunchtime – we fucked for about 30 minutes so no one have a clue about what happened.


PS: I won’t post any of the photos. Lisa’s Request.

All over town there were whisperings of a secret club of sorts formed by the girls there. Most thought they were nothing more than rumors, tales told by horny teenage boys. 

But if you knew the right people and had the right kind of money, people like you had access to this exclusive club. A club formed by slutty, moral-less, money-crazed little girls that had just discovered just how much they could sell their tight young bodies for. 

If you had the money for it - you could have them anywhere. They offered a variety of services - you could order them to your house, pretending to be a babysitter and fucking your brains out on the drive home. Maybe your wife is extra leery of your shennanigans and you have one come to your office, dressed up like a schoolgirl for a internship interview only to get pounded on your desk. Maybe you want one for yourself 24/7, and hire a little girl to be your personal breeding slut at all times. Or maybe you prefer it the simplest way - drive up behind the high school late at night where a line of girls of all ages would be lined up, say a word and point at a girl and have her in your lap within the minute.

That's pretty much the gist of it - an elite club of slutty little girls willing to do anything and everything for money. PM me getting it started - no one-liners please. Discuss ages in PMs, also like noncon and impreg. If you're opting for the last option... show me the girl you've chosen to get started, can't wait ;)"

Some venting and a request for advice.,flaccidicus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3eqyr2/me_m26_and_her_f24_ended_a_four_year_relationship/,"My now ex wife and I met when we where in a very low part of our lives. She was depressed and I had lot's of issues I tried to solve with alcohol. We where beacons to each other in a world filled of darkness. 

I saw things in her that she didn't and she saw potential in me that I was blind to. As soon as she told me she liked me I latched on like a drowning man. My affection towards her scared her at first and she tried to push me away by pointing out her flaws, I didn't see the flaws I just saw her so I stayed. I provided her with the support and unconditional love she needed to heal. And by doing that and by her loving me back I also started to heal. 

Back then she had trust issues and no sense of self worth. Now she is strong, driven and knows what mutual trust with someone feels like. I was a child in a man's body that took no responsibilities and tried to find answers in the bottle. Now I am a grown man, I know I can love and be loved unconditionally, am not afraid to tackle my problems and accept my responsibilities.

Sadly our life together has come to an end. We really needed each other back then. But we saved each other and that was our doom. We brought light into each others lives but have diverged and our lives are headed in different directions. 

She left for a two month internship abroad. Before she left I told my mother that I didn't think our relationship would handle the changes she would go through on a personal level. I partially believed that the amount of fulfillment she would get would give her the incentive to do what we I subconsciously knew had to be done but didn't have the courage to do.

We lost contact and she was becoming distant, I even posted a thread about it on reddit. The community's response was sobering I realized (rightfully) that I didn't support her enough. I dialed my communication back and let her have the space she needed. It turned out my gut feeling was right thought, we had grown distant. 

After a couple of weeks of near radio silence (our communication was sporadic texts, like the ones you would send to a close friend) I decided I wanted to talk to her and sent her a text saying that we should talk. I had my mind set on suggesting a break up, I felt that she didn't include me in her life and kept me at arms length. 

Little did I know that it was at least in part, deliberate. When we did speak (Skype video call), I said that I was in a bad mood. She asked if it was her fault, and I said it was. I then told her that I felt she didn't include me in her life, that she ignored me and that she was loosing me. I told her that I felt we didn't have a healthy relationship.

Her response was simple, ""Can we talk about this when I get back on Friday"". I said no, I see no reason to not speak about it now. I was actually a bit mad at her for not wanting to talk to me. I felt she owed me that since part of why I was upset was her not talking to me. She repeated that she wanted to talk on Friday. I insisted we speak now, and then she told me that while she was away she'd had time to think and that she believed she was no longer in love with me. 

Naturally I lost it and started crying. I asked her if there was another (I fear being cheated on greatly), and she assured there is not. She went on and told me her feelings, I could see in her eyes that this was the hardest thing she has ever done. She told me that she didn't feel our lives are on the same track any more and that she has had doubts about us for a couple of months. 

The time apart made her realize that being alone was no longer a bad thing and her love to me had faded from that of a lover to that of a best friend. She feels that she has to be alone for the next part of her life. Her career requires devotion and she needs to do this by herself, I no longer have a part to play in her life. 

I asked her if she believed we could talk this out, ride out the storm. She said she didn't think so and was quite sure about this. We spoke and cried with each other for another hour, I asked her about her feelings and how long she has felt this way. She told me that she felt bad for feeling this way but that she couldn't control it, that she was sad that she made me hurt. She told me the importance I have played in her life and that she cares about me deeply even now and that she will be ever thankful for the role I have played in her life. 

We hung up and I went to the pub because I needed to clear my head. I ordered a Guinness but after a few sips I realized there where no answers at the bottom of the glass this time (yay me!). I left my pint half full and met up with a friend, we ate ice cream and talked for a few hours. After this I called my ex again and spoke for another hour, I felt I needed to ask some more questions levelheaded.

During this hour I realized that a lot of the feelings where mutual, I have also had similar thoughts in the past. Periods in our life where I saw the gap between us, but I was not ready to face it (I'm still not ready). Instead I carried on and didn't say a thing, believing that time would fix it. I told her this and she seemed happy I shared these feelings. I want someone in my life but I realize it can't be her. I have been to afraid to let go before but now I see this has to happen.

The amount of strength required by her to come to this realization must have been phenomenal. Imagine having to distance yourself from the closest person in your life, because there is nothing left for you as a couple. She must have felt so torn and confused. I lack that strength but I thank her for summoning it, since we needed it. No one would be happy in the long run if we didn't break up. 

I write this with a lump in my throat, not because I feel cheated or mad. But because I look back at our life together fondly and realize that we have done enough for each other and there is nothing good left for us together. This chapter has ended, and like a good book it has left a void that for now is occupied by sorrow. Time will change that, I will met some one else, some one that I can love and be devout to, not by need but by choice. 

I can honestly say that the last four years have been the best in my life. I have learned so much about my self and about love. But now it is time for me to learn more about the man I have become. I am not angry with her, nor do I feel she has done something wrong. A weight has lifted from me that I did not know I carried. 

Being a practical man I already spoke to her about our home (she wants me to keep it, since she can't afford it and I can) and we have decided to met on Saturday to discuss other finances and such matters. Neither of us have any grudges and we know pretty well how our possessions are divided so this will not be difficult (always get a premarital settlement). 

The part that breaks my heart is what I will have to do with our cats. She will not be able to take them since she will move in to a small apartment and I don't think I can give them enough attention to keep them happy. So what should I do with my cats? She said she will take care of finding them a home, but how do I know it is a good home?

**TL;DR;** Had a healthy break up with my wife and I need help figuring out what to do with our cats."

Now before you think I am crazy, let me just tell you that i met a girl online and she happened to live there, in some china populated suburb in the southeast of Sydney. 
So as we fell in love I went over there and spend 6 months together whilst I had an internship.

I miss this shitty suburb, the Gloaria Jeans coffee, the train station, the amazing city itself, the weird sound pedestrian crossing make, the friends I made back then whom I haven't spoken too in 2 years... I was really happy there, I wish I could go back in time and re-experience it all. Wander the streets of that beautiful metropole and meet awesome new people whilst being in love and having someone to come home too.

Now I am on the other side of the world. alone. We broke up after a while when I got back home, there's times where I don't care anymore but lately its starting to hurt again. I don't miss her that much, a little I guess, she was nice and we were pretty good at times but it was not that good at the end. I just miss the life I had back then with friends, a girlfriend, in this wonderful city... I wanna go abck there sometime but I am scared it won't be the same if I have to take a cab from the airport this time...

Jesus this is such a bad ramble. I feel slightly better though.
Oh and kids, Ted is right. Long distance is horrible... (a slight himym joke... okthxbb)"
3er4sl,1,2015-07-27,Managing Expectations,WuMedic,AirBnB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/3er4sl/managing_expectations/,"A couple of posts on here recently got me to thinking how hosts can better manage the expectations of their guests so that both parties have a better chance at having positive experiences.

On one of my other posts, a commenter pointed out that most people on this sub are primarily hosts and the people who are guests are not frequent posters/lurkers but only come here to get advice about specific situations.  Someone else pointed out that I make a better guest than most because even thought I have some expectations that many hosts would find demanding, I read this sub's posts for a few months before making my first booking which allowed me to see the perspective of the hosts and learned how to effectively interact with them.  Obviously we can't make reading this sub mandatory for all guests before booking, but I was hoping we could start a discussion and brainstorm ideas on how to help hosts manage expectations since I see way too many good hosts on here being exasperated over what a ounce of prevention might have been able to do.

I manage expectations as a guest by being upfront about what I want.  After screening for appropriate listings, I write up a message with the first few paragraphs identical:
- Paragraph 1 - introduction to who I am, and why I want to be there. (This also includes my first expectation--I'm here for a class assignment for a one month rotation and I'm basically just using it as a place to sleep, and maybe study and eat between my shifts totaling up to 60-80 hours a week.  To me, this is a less rude way of saying ""I don't want a lot of interaction with the hosts. When I am home, I just want to be left alone to go about my own business.""
- Paragraph 2 - list of ""needs"" with explanation.  For example, ""there cannot be any indoor pets because I have allergies to many pets."" Or, ""my work requires me to take call so I must be able to come and go around the clock, including at 3AM. I will be courteous and try to wake anyone up,"" and explain that I'm on a volunteer fire department at home and have mastered the art of sneaking out of a full house (well, only to wake everyone up when I turn on the siren outside but I leave that part out! :p )
- Paragraph 3 - list of ""wants.""  I make it clear these aren't deal breakers if they aren't there.
- Paragraph 4 - this last paragraph is the only one that I change.  It states that I've read the listing and see that there's X,Y, and Z that I listed either in my needs or wants above but I just wanted to double check.  This lets the host know I'm not an idiot that doesn't read before asking questions.  I also ask for any more information that the host might think would help me now that they know me and my situation a little bit.

With that little bit of work, I've now told the host all of my expectations so they're on the same page as me.  They can consider whether they are willing to host me with those expectations or not.  After thinking about it, maybe they realize they are ok with me coming and going a few times during the night, but I can see how when one doesn't expect it, they could get annoyed with it.

So that's how I, as a guest, manage the situation.  Is there anything a host can do that's similar to this?  Some sort of partially canned response (similar to my partially canned message) to inquiries that can lay out their expectations of the guest?

And, yes, I am only a guest at the moment but have plans on buying my own place within a year.  I'm considering keeping the current lease on my apartment to airbnb out to others.  It's notoriously hard to get into because of its prime location and while rent is going up, I can see myself making some money out of it still.  Since my lease is 5 years old and airbnb was not as mainstream as it is now, my lease is one of the few at the place that does allow for subletting!  It was actually one of the original selling points of the complex that college students could sublet their place to other renters during the summer months when they might go back to their hometown but others would want a place to stay for summer internships etc."

This has worried me for a long time that it would make her want to date other people. She doesn't want to think back and regret just being with me.

We love each other to death. We don't fight. We get a long great. We work through our problems. We have fun. We enjoy each other all the time. She doesn't even want to breakup she just doesn't want to regret anything.

Shes had an internship all summer and I am going to pick her up this weekend and we plan on talking about it then. She did have a guy she has been spending a lot of time with come on to her but she told him no and I trust her when she says that.

I would feel the same way if i was in her position. I'm just not sure what to do. I don't want us to break up but I also don't want her to resent me years down the road. I don't want to wait long if we do break up and I wont be sitting there with my hands in my lap. She's my best friend. I just don't want to lose her. 

any advice would help, thank you.

Rocky? Strained? Bad?


We‘ve never had a great relationship, but this is the first time I seriously consider cutting her out of my life. I probably won‘t do that. I‘m probably just upset about the most recent blowout. I'm afraid I'm a bit scattered at the moment.



Before we get into the incident, I want to give you a bit of backstory. 
My mother... well, she became a mother too early I think. She didn‘t have a degree or a steady job and ended up divorcing my dad. Things were hard, and she didn‘t have the emotional skills to be a good parent during hard times. 


My sister. My sister always needed more assistance with school, with finances, with life. **And sometimes I felt a bit... forgotten**, I guess. I got good grades and won awards but everyone sort of just, expected that of me, so it wasn‘t anything special.



But **whenever I didn‘t do well enough, it would be a huge deal.**  This has always frustrated me to no end. I never got any assistance with any of my accomplishments. Sometimes when I was studying into the night my mother would yell at me that I had a sick obsession and should be more normal. My achievements are not celebrated all that much. But my failures become the talk of the family. All the while, my sister receives endless praise for basically not being a drug addict or a murderer.



I know I shouldn‘t care what my mother thinks. I know it‘s not productive to obsess about it, and that I shouldn´t waste my time trying to please her. And I try. I moved to a different state for school, and kept civil but minimal contact. I met my SO and we got our dogs, and things have been pretty wonderful. We recently moved back to my original state for my SO‘s work, because I can finish the rest of my studies without being present at school. 



I‘ve been seeing more of my family of course, but it‘s been more or less okay. **Now to the incident.** I was supposed to finish my study programme this summer, and I‘m still trying to do that. However, I got accepted into two prestigous summer school, that really contribute to my resume. I set out to do all those things; both summer schools back to back and work on my final project as well. The summer schools have been amazing. I finished one and started the second one now. I miss my SO and our dogs, but it‘s only 3 more weeks now. However, I‘ve been lagging behind with my final project. I wasn‘t too upset about this, as I can easily finish it next semester and graduate at christmas. I‘ve already gotten a part time internship for this fall semester during which I know I can work on it, and I‘ve got some good options for another internship in the spring term. 

Basically, I‘m doing really well. The summer schools are in a country I‘ve never been in before and it‘s been amazing to get the opportunity to travel. I‘m convinced that this is going to contribute more to my career than the exact date of when I get my degree. 
But yesterday, my mother talked to me. And my world crashed. She barely said two words about the schools and asked me how the project was going. When I said, not so good, but still hoping to finish, she lost it. I told her not to worry about me and that I knew what I was doing and that I was fine. That made it even worse. She said she was appaled by my nonchalant attitude regarding my future, and that she was really disappointed in me. Needless to say, we had a shouting match. She kept asking me to tell her what the real issue was, and asking me if I was having problems with my SO. I don‘t get it. **I‘ve never been doing as well as I am now. Ever. This is the peek so far. And yet, she‘s disappointed.** I feel like she only brings me negativity, and I don‘t want it around. She also badmouths me to the whole family. Other family members contacted me yesterday, wanting me to tell them the truth about what was wrong with me. 

I feel like I‘m caught in a storm of madness. Everyone seems to think something is wrong. And the thing is, **they would never ever say anything like this to my sister.** Never has our mother been disappointed in her. It‘s so unfair I just... can‘t really deal with it.

Can I just be rid of her? **I know she loves me. I know she‘s doing this because she‘s worried about me and she cares about my future.** But a part of me still just wants her out of my life. I don‘t want this kind of negativity at my best moments. I‘m supposed to be booming with pride and happiness now, and yet I‘m bawling my wits out. So back to the title... **Is our relationship reparable?** Is it even possible for us to be in each others lives and not cause only pain? Or should I just cut my losses and move on.


**TL;DR My mother treats me and my sister very differently. She has high expectations of me and gets angry when I don't live up to them, but is never happy about my accomplishments. I don't know if our relationship is fixable**"
3erxuz,0,2015-07-27,Should I stay or should I go?,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/3erxuz/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,"Yup it's another - what should I do about law school question - sorry guys I hate seeing them too I'm just super stuck and think I've reached the I need advice rock bottom point in life. Also apologies for throwaway too many peers/friends know my regular handle. 

The law school I currently am going to isn't a top school but it's a good school, top 40. Current 2L coming 3L this fall. I know 1 more year don't be a pussy but hear me out first. I hate contracts with a violent passion. I hate Real Property also with a violent passion. Both of these would be a big portion of the type of law I’d be going into. 

I did not get the summer internships I really wanted so ended up helping summer TA the only class I enjoyed last semester. My grades are good (3.89) so I’m good at law school which doesn’t help in making my should I stay or show I go dilemma . The reason I didn't get the internships I applied to was either a combination of reaching a bit too high, not applying to enough because of lack of interest and only wanting to do certain internships or I got them but they didn’t pay enough for me to move as far away as they were. I really just got in my own damn way. So here I am a 2L summer with no summer 2L internship. Ok,  really not good but if I start networking and doing all the campus sponsored alum/career events not entirely fatal. But I have a very low enthusiasm level to do those, I know I have to if I'm going to succeed but it's like pulling teeth without novocaine. I also fear that with my summer internships I just went through the motions and basically consciously or subconsciously sabotaged myself and that will happen again with the networking and I’ll be another year out and just as stuck if not more so. 

About 8 months ago I picked up a part-time job because one I needed money and the job I chose was in the alternative medicine field (no not marijuana industry - not that there is anything wrong with that just clarifying). Mostly to have some kind of income and for the benefits (free/at cost massages/healthcare) to balance out the stress of law school. I truly love helping people and seeing them get better, it's one reason I wanted to become a lawyer. Talking to a family member about the 'should I stay or should I go' dilemma she mentioned that she noticed how passionate I spoke about my part-time job and that I would do well in the medical field especially if I continue on with law school. She suggested if I don’t feel like killing myself daily by continuing with my final year I don't have to take the bar but do something like medical billing or something related to the medical field with a law degree background - I know unpopular opinion puffin. This got me thinking, I do enjoy my part-time medical office job. I don't want to be a doctor per se but I certainly do enjoy helping people. So I began to entertain the 'ok, say you drop out of law school what do?' question and I started to think about going back to school and getting an RN certification. 

Now let's throw a real wrench into this already messy what to do what to do situation. My partner of about 6 years recently got a starting career position out of state and not relatively close. I haven't had the 'what does this mean for us' conversation yet. But I got to thinking that my partner is really probably the main thing that keeps me plugging away at the law school grind stone just because they are supportive telling me I can do it, it’ll get better, don’t quit. Basically being my cheerleader in the evenings when I get done with my hellish muscle through it days or just being there to go out and have fun adventures with to get my mind off how much I hate law school (which are more often than the ‘I had a good day’). I have one or two close friends here where I go to school but nothing super deep mostly its a girlfriend that I like to grab coffee/dinner with occasionally to catch up and have girl time with She used to work in the same office at the alternative medicine place I do currently. There is no one I feel even remotely close to at school, if murder wasn’t a crime I probably would have killed off everyone in my study groups by now. Anyways that aside the place where my partner is moving they have a good RN program and even if I wanted to it does go all the way to MD so it's not like I'm thinking of going to one of those 'for profit get your RN/medical assistant degree is 9 month' type places. BUT I worry am I being *that person* that uproots their life to follow their partner. I at least feel confident while I may be doing that (should I ultimately decide that's what I'm doing) it's not like I met this person a year ago and am so stupidly in puppy love I'm not thinking clearly or looking at the big picture type of situation. 

The town where my partner is moving to also has a law school, not as good as the one I'm at now but not bottom of the barrel or near it. I've though I could maybe transfer there or take a leave of absence and think about what I really really want to do and then either come back to where I am in a year to finish or transfer and finish at this other place. I know people transfer in law school, but it is no way nearly as common as undergrad transfers are.  

**TL;DR** Sorry for the above wall of text but necessary for the background why I feel the way I feel and where I am right now with my life.

**Option 1** Stay in law school power through the last year and what happens with my partner happens. Where I face the potential outcome of having my JD but still not wanting to take the bar. 

**Option 2** Take a leave of absence from where I am. Take the year to either decide if I in fact want to return to law school where I am currently or use the time off to transfer and finish up at this new law school in a year from now fall semester (too late to transfer for this fall). 

**Option 3** Cut my losses with law school and pick up fresh by pursuing an RN certification at an actual school not a for profit program."
3ery7c,3,2015-07-27,My (23/f) girlfriend just broke up with me (22/m) to concentrate on medical school,throwaway171171,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3ery7c/my_23f_girlfriend_just_broke_up_with_me_22m_to/,"So starting with a little bit of background, we’ve been dating for the last 3.5 years. Most of it was semi long-distance (we lived around 2 hours away from each other), but we would see each other several days every week. We had a really serious relationship and we talked about marriage/ending up together fairly often. However, we’re also really career oriented people. Last year I chose to spend the summer in New York to pursue a really great internship opportunity and she responded by becoming emotionally distant (for the summer). This year I took a job on Wall Street and she enrolled in medical school on the west coast. When we said goodbye to each other we planned to maintain our relationship until we could get back together. However a month later (two months ago) she called me and said that she could no longer do a relationship. She said that she didn’t want a relationship to interfere with school and that to be happy she just couldn’t do it. She also mentioned that she still cares about me and that she absolutely does not want to be in a relationship with anyone at the moment. She’s always been completely honest with me so I trust her. She believes that if we’re right for each other, that we will actually end up with each other (I have a hard time believing things will just fall into place). When we’re both back home over Christmas break we made plans to discuss possibly getting back together (although she’s been clear that she doesn’t want to make any promises).

So this is where I can use the advice…I’ve been really upset the last month and my work is definitely suffering. I’ve tried to move on (like she currently is) but instead I just feel like I’m more and more in love with her. I’ve tried keeping hope for the relationship (because it’s not necessarily a permanent end) but that makes me feel terrible too. I’m seeing a psychologist but I’m actually depressed for the first time in my life. She’s been unemotional for the first time since we met. I’m actually thinking about quitting my great job (it pays 6 figures) to follow her out to the west coast at the end of the year. I just have no idea of what to do

Edit: She also told me that things might be different after the first year, when she can better understand her medical school time commitments"
3esg6i,1,2015-07-27,(Budgeting) College student would greatly appreciate budgeting help!,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3esg6i/budgeting_college_student_would_greatly/,"Hello, I've been lurking for a while and finally have the courage to ask y'all to help me figure out a game plan for the mess that is my finances right now.

I'm a 19 year old community college student living on my own, and need help figuring out budgeting before I start school again this fall, and before I transfer to a 4 year university next year.

**My finances are as follows:**

* I have about $1000 in savings, checking, and cash.
* I have about $16,500 in student loans, approx $13,000 of which were from when I went to a public university for a year before dropping out and going to a CC instead. The last $3500 I took out last year when I needed to move from my mom's house with little notice.
* I have about $400 in debt from the credit card I took out through my bank. I am definitely not living in my means with this, considering my limit is $600 and I haven't really been able to whittle down my debt on it.
* I'm embarrassed to admit this but I also have about $1000 in debt from stupid store cards that I took out last year to pay for my glasses and contacts ($500) and for things like groceries, clothes, electronics that I probably could have gone without buying ($500).

**My monthly finances are:**

* Income: approximately $1000 a month working about 30 hrs/wk at 2 jobs, plus about $100 in tips per week ($400 a month)
* Expense: $670 for rent, approximately $100 for utilities.
* Expense: $200 for food 
* Expense: $115 in credit card payments
* Expense: $70 in car insurance
* Expense: $80 in gas

I've been burning through my savings obviously, since I'm only making about $1400 a month, and spending $1235 without accounting for emergencies like car maintenance or medical emergencies.

I obviously need to work more and spend less, but am having a hard time finding a job that will work around my busy school schedule or extracurricular activities (community organizing, student senate, student activism, etc.).

 I was just admitted into a paid internship that will give me a $3000 stipend for the upcoming school year, though I need a much more lucrative job considering I will have much less time once I start school again. I am trying to get back into serving or graphic design since I was averaging about $20-40/hr doing that, but it's been hard getting called back after applying, or finding a place that is flexible with my schedule.

Any help, advice, or tough love would be appreciated. Have an amazing day!"

* I'm embarrassed to admit this but I also have about $1000 in debt from stupid store cards that I took out last year to pay for my glasses and contacts ($500) and for things like groceries, clothes, electronics that I probably could have gone without buying ($500).

**My monthly finances are:**

* Income: approximately $1000 a month working about 30 hrs/wk at 2 jobs, plus about $100 in tips per week ($400 a month)
* Expense: $670 for rent, approximately $100 for utilities.
* Expense: $200 for food 
* Expense: $115 in credit card payments
* Expense: $70 in car insurance
* Expense: $80 in gas

I've been burning through my savings obviously, since I'm only making about $1400 a month, and spending $1235 without accounting for emergencies like car maintenance or medical emergencies.

I obviously need to work more and spend less, but am having a hard time finding a job that will work around my busy school schedule or extracurricular activities (community organizing, student senate, student activism, etc.).

 I was just admitted into a paid internship that will give me a $3000 stipend for the upcoming school year, though I need a much more lucrative job considering I will have much less time once I start school again. I am trying to get back into serving or graphic design since I was averaging about $20-40/hr doing that, but it's been hard getting called back after applying, or finding a place that is flexible with my schedule.

Any help, advice, or tough love would be appreciated. Have an amazing day!"

* Assume for a second that the research is 100% correct


* Currently, tech companies make it easier for women to get positions because they want to keep a 50/50 male/female work force, despite the pool of applicants being more male than female. 

* Moreover, there are internship programs, professorships, financial incentives, laxer entry requirements for women specifically looking to enter tech.

* **If this is the case, should we stop affirmative action for women in tech?** Should we all be okay that the tech work force will only be 40:60 female male?

* ALSO: If that is the case, will you be **okay with an overall page gap** between women and men because it is explained by this difference in men and women in tech?

3estpe,1,2015-07-27,First credit card - 22 y.o. US male - New Graduate w/ high starting salary - no prior credit,gttablesaw,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3estpe/first_credit_card_22_yo_us_male_new_graduate_w/,"I am looking to get my first card and am having trouble. I graduated from university with no debt and didn't have to take out any loans. I will be starting work soon with a high starting salary of just under 6 figures and for a company that will require me to expense quite a few items; thus, a credit card is essential. I have applied to USAA Cash Rewards (I have insurance through them) and was declined because I have no credit. I also applied for AMEX SPG rewards because of the properties my company stays at; several colleagues recommended this card.
However AMEX requested a 4506 T giving them access to my tax return from last year; I haven't yet sent this and can still cancel the application without having a hard pull on my credit. I believe this is to confirm my income as I stated my salary from my job on my application; however by requesting last year's return, they will see my income from working part time as a student (approximately $10,000 from an internship and a TA job plus a signing bonus from my current job) which is obviously less than I claimed as I was not a professional at the time. Should I go ahead and withdraw this?
Any advice?"
3esttg,0,2015-07-27,"How do you switch jobs when you're ""overpaid""?",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3esttg/how_do_you_switch_jobs_when_youre_overpaid/,"I graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in creative writing last May. I had a lot of great internships and connections, so I was able to get a very well paying job as a project coordinator for an IT firm last July. 


Originally the plan was just to use this potential job to practice my interviewing skills. But then they offered me $45k to start, which was about $10k higher than I was expecting to make at my first job. I never would have taken the job if they hadn't offered me so much, and I was really hoping to get an offer from another company at the time, so I asked for $51k (not expecting to get it). They agreed and I took the job.

The people I work with are wonderful, I get to work from home one day a week, and the benefits are pretty decent. I also haven't been asked to work any overtime and I got a 6% raise for my annual review when most of the company didn't get any raise at all. 

However...the thought of working here even another year depresses the ever loving fuck out of me. I have no desire whatsoever to advance in this company, and there's really no other department I could transfer into to make it easier. I have no love for IT and have realized that management at this company would be way too stressful for me.

The problem is, I don't think I could get a job that I enjoy that also won't be a massive pay cut for me. I'm still very much in the entry level stage of my career, so pretty much any job I get will pay significantly less. How the heck do I manage this? Is it possible that some companies will match my salary regardless of my little experience? How do I negotiate salaries now?"
3esy74,3,2015-07-27,"College student, 21 years old, need help grasping financial reality.",vlw2012,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3esy74/college_student_21_years_old_need_help_grasping/,"I am a college student, 21 years old, living in the Silicon Valley. I will be graduating in May, and have a student loan debt of $12,000 that I will have to start paying back November 2016. I just quit my job in the town that I live in($12 an hour, 25 hours a week) for a job that is about an hour away. At the new job, I will be working 20-25 hours a week at $12 an hour, plus tips. I cannot work more than this because I am doing an internship through school that will pay $1300 in March, 2016.
 I currently rent a room with my boyfriend, for $400 a month(he pays $250, I pay $150), about 30 minutes away from campus.
 I have a car payment of $400 a month(including insurance), a credit card debt of $1600(used it to pay for part of my schooling), and a phone bill of $90 a month. 
He has a $360 car payment, including insurance, and pays $90 for his phone bill.

He makes about $25,000 a year before taxes, and I make about $12,000-$13,000.

I am looking for apartments and plan to move with my boyfriend, but everything is way out of our price range, so it seems. We will have to move in the next year, so I am trying to figure out the logistics of staying in the Silicon Valley.
Rent for a single bedroom apartment in my area ranges from $1600-$2300 a month, and usually doesn't include utilities.

So I have a few questions.
The amount of money I spend on gas to drive to work will probably double, but with that being said, would I be better off moving closer to my new job, or should I stay at my current housing location, for the time being?

I really don't know what else to ask, I think I just need some advice. I am starting to regret taking the new job and it has me thinking alot.

Also, I am aware that $12 hour isn't enough to make a living off of so I am hoping for a raise within the first 6 months to a year, or to pick up a second job after my internship is up. 

Please let me know if you need any clarification.

Thanks."

3eu5bk,0,2015-07-27,"I [24 M] feel unhappy with my SO [23 F] of four years, partially because of another girl but also because of her anxiety",help-what-do-I-do,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3eu5bk/i_24_m_feel_unhappy_with_my_so_23_f_of_four_years/,"Hi all,


I've been dating the same girl for almost four years now. We started dating my senior year of college, and she's amazing. I mean it, I know I'm lucky to be with her. The thing is is that I never really felt that initial ""spark"" with her; I wasn't particularly attracted physically, nor was I even that excited at the prospect of a relationship. I feel like I agreed to dates just because somebody was interested in me and not because I was super interested myself. Since then, I have grown to love her for who she is regardless, and I now find her beautiful (mentally and physically) and feel like we're ridiculously compatible. We have the same opinions on everything, like to do the same activities, are both satisfied in bed, etc. The past four years have been great, and she's definitely the best partner I've had so far in my life. I really believe that.

The problem is that she gets upset...a lot. She gets quite anxious, even over little things (I think she gets it from her mom). I can usually calm her down in these circumstances, but frankly over the course of these past four years it's really begun to grow on my nerves. I feel like we'll be at a party or out with a group of friends and that all of a sudden she's having one of her episodes and I need to drop everything and go calm her down. I realize that this sounds selfish of me, and I completely agree with you. I don't *want* to feel this way, but I do. When you want to just talk to your partner and be happy and whatnot, it's very tiring when they need to be reassured so much. I know she's not doing it for attention or anything like that, it's certainly genuine.

In addition to her frequent anxiety, my SO and I have been in a semi-long distance relationship for about two years now. We typically see each other on the weekends since we're only a couple hour's drive from each other, but it's not ideal nonetheless. However she's been applying to jobs in the area (where I go to school) and as soon as she finds one we're planning on moving in together. We've been planning on living together ever since we originally became long distance, and it's getting to be that time! However, I have some qualms, as I'll elaborate on below. Another issue that has cropped up is that, since we became long distance, I feel like my SO writes me less and less. I've repeatedly told her that I like it when she sends me cute messages or whatever (throughout the day or online, just every now and then), and she's gotten somewhat better about it. I really don't like having to ask my SO to write me and make me feel desired though, it feels disingenuous when you have to ask that of your SO. 

Yet another factor is this girl that I've known for a couple months now. She's an intern where I work, and I've been given the task of being her supervisor for the whole summer. She's 20, beautiful, super fun to be around, and I feel like she's a real catch. We started flirting a bit over the course of a couple months, and she recently told me she liked me. I responded by telling her that I was flattered, liked her back, but that I had an SO that I was dedicated to. I had previously mentioned that I had an SO, but found myself rarely bringing her up because I liked the idea of being with this other girl and didn't want to ""spoil it"" by mentioning my SO. There's yet another strike against me--I know I should feel happy to be with my wonderful SO and want to bring her up in conversation, but I don't want to ruin my chances with this other girl...I feel shitty about it, but that's the honest truth, and this is the internet. I find myself wanting this other girl, because she honestly just makes me happier than my girlfriend. I know I've known her for a shorter period of time and that I'd eventually grow sick of some of her habits as well, but that's just how it is. One issue with this girl is that she's going away for four months in a few weeks, but after that she'll be back in the area (i.e., near my school).

I don't know why I can't be happy :/ I know I have a great SO, one that many people would be (and probably are) envious of me for. However, I feel like I haven't felt as happy in this relationship...for quite a long time. When I'm with my SO it's usually pretty great...but not always. When I talk to her on the phone I find myself dissatisfied with how the conversation goes, because she usually just tells me about her day at work or what she's done that evening, and we talk less about other interesting things. I've discussed all of this with her, and while things change temporarily, it always goes back to me being bored while talking to her. We talk in the morning, sometimes after work briefly, and then before bed. I like the amount we're talking, I just don't find myself looking forward to it any more. Factor in this new, gorgeous girl that's interested in me and makes me feel much happier, and I'm finding myself very confused. I'm getting worried because my girlfriend is planning on moving in soon enough, and I don't know if I should let that happen while I'm feeling this way. I don't think that's right...but then again, it might help make me feel more connected with her? I'm not sure. I really have been trying to feel more connected with her (writing her nice messages, addressing my complaints with our conversation, going out on dates with her, etc.), but it's not working. What do I do, reddit?

TL;DR: I have a great SO of four years, but have been losing a ton of interest in the relationship for about a year now due to her anxiety and not making me feel desired. My SO is planning on moving in with me soon, as well. Another girl is interested in me, and I find myself much more excited to talk to her, but don't find her quite as compatible (although still very compatible). Don't feel happy, not sure what to do."

First time posting here but I’ll get right to it. I am in Silicon Valley for 90 days on an internship.

Is it possible for him to call in a script for me at a pharmacy here in California? Are there other options? I called one Suboxone doctor out here and they said they wouldn’t see me since I was out of state and referred me to the emergency room… I can’t imagine that would end well.

I'm currently approaching the end of my summer internship which ends at the end of August. Unfortunately I don't have a place to live since I have been unofficially subleasing from people off the UT roommate FB page.

I'm seeking to unofficially sublease a bedroom for the month of August. I'm not picky at all, I just need a bed to sleep on, and a place to shower. I'm okay with crashing in your couch as well. 

About me: 24/m, engineering student, interning at a tech company, clean, tidy, respectful, social, and friendly. I can keep to myself if you like your privacy, or I can join you in whatever you got going on (sports, games, movies, discussions, etc). I love animals so pets are not an issue. I work 8-5p and sometimes I stay late too, so I'll be gone for most of the day. I pack lightly, so I'm not carrying anything else but a briefcase with clothes. 

North side would be awesome since it's close to my job, however I'm good with any location. I can help with chores and utilities too. Last day is Aug 28th so I'll be out of your hair by then. Budget is limited, but somewhere in the $300s would be ideal. 

Thank you!"
3evkyk,2,2015-07-28,I [24/m] think my girlfriend [21/f] doesn't understand the difference between my hobbies &amp; my mental health.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3evkyk/i_24m_think_my_girlfriend_21f_doesnt_understand/,"This is going to be long. Sorry. I just... I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about all of this without risking upsetting my girlfriend. So I figured the anonymity of reddit may help a lot.

So we started dating less than a year ago. Up until this point, there have been no real issues. Despite us having some pretty challenging obstacles (difference in faith that we have lightly been talking about, etc), we have handled them with love and respect. We've talked about all sorts of things: abortion, various faiths, feminism, LGBT community, race, etc. There has been nothing we have been scared to talk about. I do my best to be open &amp; honest about everything. I try to be transparent in this relationship.

My biggest issue, personally, if that I suffer from depression. I am not medicated due to not having health care currently. I do try to work out, eat &amp; sleep the way I ought to. The end of last semester was a pretty big hit in my life. I was expected to graduate after years of overcoming my mental illness &amp; financial issues. Sadly, I had a pretty rough winter (S.A.D.) &amp; did not pass all of my classes. I was quite heart broken.

I knew I had to take those classes again this coming semester. But... having these issues &amp; feeling helpless &amp; like my professors did not care what happened because it was not documented ahead of time really took a toll on me. I passed 3/5 classes. Still. I need all 5 to graduate. I did do well in my internship. Regardless, I felt like a huge failure &amp; was depressed.

I did my best to hold on &amp; stay positive but it was just too much. I had to move far away, 24hrs driving, from the state/area I grew up in. It was to move in with my parents while I looked for a job &amp; what would come next. My hope was to have this figured out by the time the semester came around (a few weeks from now). 

Well, this summer living with my parents was not all too great. I was still too depressed &amp; defeated to feel like I could work. I was not sleeping well but was using my savings for things like presents for my girlfriend/visiting her. Luckily, she lives within an hour or two from my parent's. 

I also took some opportunities to go visit friends and volunteer doing things that are relevant to my major. Those weeks away gave me meaning. I felt like i could sleep again. I felt like I had value &amp; purpose. Now, I know I do have those things but while in episodes, I do not feel it &amp; it slowly beats me down. 

I came back, the same stuff continued to happen. I used my time applying to jobs &amp; getting ready for the semester but I never did get a local job. I do not have a car. I kept using my savings. After spending a few hours a day doing either of those things, I would resort to playing video games while talking to my friends on the computer in programs like teamspeak. Most of my closest friends game a lot &amp; one of the reasons I enjoy gaming so much is I am able to keep in touch with them through it. 

Mind you, I do not do much physical work while I am here. I feel like I have no reason to ever leave the house &amp; I feel like I may as well be talking to my friends online in stead of wandering outside alone in a climate I do not enjoy. 

Well, as things got worse, I even started masturbating again. I hadn't done that in a long time to cope with my problems. I even stopped reading my bible &amp; praying. Everything was out of wack. The only normal things were the amount of time on the computer/my hobbies &amp; my time I spent with my girlfriend. 

That's enough back story I suppose, for me. Here's where things get complicated.

A few weeks ago, we had sex. This isn't the first time but we do not have sex a lot. I have had sex many times in my life with only a handful of women &amp; I know she has been sexually active with others. But, I must have put the condom on too tightly. It broke. Neither of us noticed until after I ejaculated. We decided that Plan B was our best option. We went out and picked it up. I was somewhat forceful about me paying for it. I felt somewhat responsible and did not want her to pay for it when she pays to drive to me often &amp; I only take public transportation. 

Since that day, my girlfriend has been acting different in many ways. I know she is afraid that she is pregnant (she's going to find out when she goes to the doctor's sometime this week.). I decided a long time ago that if I was going to have sex with someone, I must be willing to provide for that woman &amp; that child. I do not make that type of covenant decision lightly.

After we talked about what she would want to do if she was pregnant, she told me she would not want to have an abortion. I support her 100% in whatever she chooses. Even if it ""ruins"" my career or whatever people say. I will support her because I love her &amp; I do not think we can make a ""wrong"" choice here. 

After this time, I noticed there was something wrong the next time I saw her. She would not tell me in person. She has had very damaging past relationships. The type of boyfriends who would sexually, physically, verbally, emotionally abuse her. I do not know to the extent of this but she has told me some &amp; it has broken my heart whenever I hear about it. Out of respect &amp; knowing she may not be able to handle the conversation, I somewhat let it go for the moment.

When I return home, later that night while we text, I ask her if something was wrong &amp; if she just did not feel safe saying it in person. She proceeds to tell me how she has noticed me changing this summer and it concerns her. She is afraid that I am being lazy &amp; not active &amp; sit in front of screens too much &amp; ""she has to bribe me to get me outside."" I am paraphrasing here so please be mindful of that. She pretty much called me lazy &amp; said I focus too much on my computer &amp; not enoguh on other things. Like getting a job or working towards getting a car or finding a way to move back near school (she will be returning there in the fall &amp; we have talked about hopes of me finding a job up there to be able to get back). 

At this moment, I break down. I'm not mad at what she's said but I know inside I have been falling apart &amp; have been horrified to admit it. Every time I have done that in the past, the girl has left me within a month. Well, I decided to be transparent. I started crying. I texted her about what has been going on. Feeling like a failure, feeling worthless, horrified of becoming like my deadbeat father if she is pregnant, her regretting me, feeling not good enough because no jobs call me back, not having a car, living with my parents, not seeing any of my friends, feeling away from God, a few other things I'd care not to directly say &amp; feeling depressed overall.

Reddit... it felt like she didn't care. I know she had to care. I think she was just more focused on her points of how I decided not to get a summer job to save money, how I ""depend"" on others for money (when I am paying 200 a month to live with my parents, I eat their left overs &amp; I do not buy anything for myself. Yes I know 200 a month is not a lot but I told my family I needed to help pay because I need to start gaining some sense of worth while being here), how I am okay with not being with her near school &amp; (my best guess is) she started thinking about long term in a more serious way aka me being ""the man of the house"" rather than being her boyfriend.

It... I don't know. I need to figure out how to explain how I feel about it to explain it better to her. But she gave me more crap today. She made comments about the same stuff. I do not know if she needed to explain herself again or if she felt the need to call me out because she is concerned with my well being. I do believe she cares about me. She has done much to prove that over this past year. 

I do not know how to put it into words. Last week when we had this talk, I started eating better, I tried to sleep more (that doesn't work as you can tell. My guess is stress), I am drinking more water, I am going outside at least once a day for ten minutes (even if I feel like a waste taking a walk for absolutely no reason), I am working out every other day for at least 30 minutes, I started praying again &amp; have opened my bible a few times. I haven't masturbated at all. I have come to the conclusion, which I gave myself in the beginning of the summer, that if I do not find a full time job in my profession that I will get a local job &amp; work my butt off while I finish my major. I have still spent a great deal of time on my computer. But all she sees is me ""changing."" 

It's like she hasn't even given me time to grow &amp; get back to where I was before. When I did have a job &amp; friends near by &amp; tons of joy in my life. 

She views my nerdy hobbies as issues for me. If I play DnD three times a week, even if it does not impact on our time together, she does not like it. I spend a lot of time prepping for games &amp; making encounters &amp; being creative because it brings me joy. I do not do it as a means to escape in an unhealthy way. It helps keep me positive during hard times. I get to express myself through those things.

If I game all day when I have a day off (which I would call most of what I do days off while I keep trying to get classes set up, waiting to hear back from professors, applying to jobs ONLY near the area I want to work at &amp; trying to be mentally healthy overall), she does not realize I do that because I get to talk to my friends the whole time. It would be like calling someone on the phone or using Skype for hours. We just happen to be playing games on Steam or w/e. 

I'm not quite sure what exactly my problem is right now. I guess I just feel like if this keeps going on, it won't be about her caring for me &amp; be more about her being selfish for what I ought to be rather than what I am.

I am so confused about where this came from. I understand that this summer has been horrible. But I love to go camping. I love going for walks. I love hanging out with my friends &amp; being active. I was super busy at college. I always did things. I was very committed to my internship &amp; made sure not to let that slack no matter how I was feeling.

Honestly, any &amp; all advice on me getting my act together, how to talk to her about how I am feeling or what I am doing wrong right now. I know in relationships it is rarely a one sided issue. I know I have a lot to take of care on my end. But how do I tell her what I need right now in a loving way? When do I bring up that if she keeps this up it will not be helpful or productive? Or am I just being too emotional right now &amp; need to deal with it while I work on things?

**tl;dr**

I have been depressed for months. My girlfriend things I'm changing. I open up. She seems more concerned about her needs than what my hobbies are &amp; my mental health."
3evqg2,8,2015-07-28,"Awful first time therapy experience, is it worth going through this mentally exhausting process again?",DiandraYEAH,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3evqg2/awful_first_time_therapy_experience_is_it_worth/,"Unfortunately, my father set up a therapist appointment for me with an intern. She was very young and it seemed like she just got out of college. I couldn't meet with any official psychiatrists or therapists because they had the max amount of patients they could take on until September. This was my first ever therapist appointment. I didn't want to do it at all. The whole week I had been dreading it. My parents and other people around me kept telling me I needed to go, and my mom had a huge panic attack thing because I've been depressed and not doing anything to get help. She didn't want to talk to me for a few weeks and generally just made me feel pretty bad about this. So I just did i mainly for everyone else.
But I gave it a shot. Maybe a small part of me wanted to try and hope that it worked. I understand not a lot gets done on the first appointment. But this was just pretty horrible. I have pretty bad depression and anxiety that just gets worse every second of every day.
First I walked into the building and it was freezing cold, I already shake in general so it made it worse. After I filled out papers that asked questions about how I feel, I was invited into the interns office. It was so small and narrow, very uncomfortable and claustrophobic. She starts out by telling me she has to video tape every session. This is TERRIBLE. I'm already unbelievably anxious and I have a camera in my face. My voice was so shaky the whole time and I almost starting crying several times because of how nervous and awkward I felt. I was under the impression I was supposed to get an evaluation to find out the type of depression I have, but that didn't happen. She just asked me a bunch of questions about how I felt, and because I have a hard time explaining myself about anything, she didn't help me out at all. If I had a long awkward silence or a hard time trying to figure out how to answer a question, I expected that she would help me out and ask more things like ""do you maybe feel like blah blah or is it like blah blah?"". And she didn't do any of that. She came off very uncaring, monotone, and didn't make me feel like I could be comfortable talking to her about anything at all, especially personal. It's not like Im used to answering questions to people about if i want to kill myself or how many times a week I have certain thoughts. And when I do open up to people I end up upsetting them, angering them, being too open to where they get freaked out. I'm very emotional and expressive when I do talk about how I feel and people think I'm yelling at them or something when I don't even say anything about them when I'm just venting. So I have no one to talk to. Anyway, she almost came off judgmental. She was just very inexperienced. I would have definitely preferred a real fucking psychiatrist and therapist, someone way older and more characteristically motherly in a way, someone who made me completely feel like I could talk to them about my worst feelings, and help me better explain them out loud.
Okay, my next option is to just go to my doctor and get prescribed antidepressants. I haven't been in favor of taking these either, but I'm just so tired of feeling this way that I just want to try and feel a little better if it works. 
The thing is, I'd be willing to do therapy if I had someone I was comfortable with. I just cannot deal with going through that process I went through over and over until I find the right person. It was so mentally exhausting and I came out having a meltdown and panic attack even though it seems like little stuff I shouldn't be upset over, tiny things overwhelm me. I don't really have anything to say to anyone anyway, or know exactly how to say it right. I just want to feel better, I don't really believe talking to someone will help me at all. Unfortunately depression isn't something you can cure as you all know.
So is it worth it to try and do therapy again? It's just so hard to get into good places with qualified people and I don't even know what I'm getting into or who it's going to be. I just feel even more discouraged now.
What do you think?
Also what are your experiences with therapy?
Has it worked or not worked for you?
Same question with antidepressants."

Nu behöver jag hjälp med det finstilta som rör ett rekryteringsföretag.
Jag har bott utomlands men flyttar nu tillbaka till sverige och då har min arbetsgivare erbjudit mig att bli en ""external business partner"" till dem.
1-2 gånger om året så har de svårt med rekryteringen och då anlitar de en ""external business partner"" men under min anställning så har jag genom intern rekrytering hjälpt dem, för en riktigt fin bonus.
Så nu hade jag ett möte med deras rekryteringsansvarig och vi diskuterade hur det här förhållandet skulle se ut.

De behöver nu att jag startar mitt eget företag och att jag är ""tax compliant"".
Jag skall starta en enskild firma men jag har redan en fast anställning som jag påbörjar när jag kommer tillbaka till Sverige.
Så ""FA"" skatt är det som gäller.


Mina frågor nu har att göra med följande:

1:
Vad är momsen jag skall lägga på fakturan, jag hittar ingenting med google.
Det är ett land i EU jag kommer fakturera från ett företag registrerat i Sverige, ""enskild näringsidkare"".

2:
De behöver att jag skriver T&amp;C, jag vet själv vad jag skall ta betalt och garantin jag erbjuder men vad jag behöver hjälp med är någon sorts mall där jag har med allt det formella som te.x garanterar att de inte kan gå runt mig och anställa de jag referrarar utan att betala mitt arvode o.s.v.

3:
När man skall registrera enskild firma så vill de att man upskattar hur mycket man kommer att tjäna, hur många kunder o.s.v. man kommer att ha, och baserat på uppgifterna man lämnar så så bedömmer skatteverket om det rör sig om en näringsverksamhet eller inte.
Hur skall jag fylla i uppgifterna för att bli godkänd och inte behöva betala 15 000+ kr i månaden i uppskattad skatt och moms?

Jag har bokat in möten med rådgivare från nyföretagarcentrum, och en revisorfirma till när jag kommer hem men jag vill ha koll på allting så snabbt som möjligt då jag inte vill gå miste om det här kontraktet.

All hjälp upskattas, Mvh"
3ew6lm,6,2015-07-28,"Me [20F] with my boyfriend [21M] of a year and a half, my father makes it very clear he doesn't like him",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ew6lm/me_20f_with_my_boyfriend_21m_of_a_year_and_a_half/,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. My boyfriend is someone I love very much, and can see myself with for a long time. We are also best friends and get comments often about us being great together. 

My parents are not his biggest fan. He's veryyy talkative, particularly when nervous (like meeting your girlfriend's parents-type situations, oddly enough), and probably comes off as a bit obnoxious. They are very much keep-to-themselves type people. I am also an only child so a lot of the time it was just the three of us growing up, particularly at holidays etc. 

Now I have someone else to spend time with (e.g. he came down to my family for a few days before christmas last year, spent christmas with my family and new year's with his family). My university is also in his town and he still lives at home, so I end up spending time with his family, who I love and it seems to be somewhat reciprocated, hopefully. One theory of mine is that this does not help things. I go see my parents every 2-3 weekends during term time but it's an eight hour round trip and I have study to do also. Plus, I do actually want to spend time with my boyfriend and friends at times. This summer boyfriend and I are also living together, working out in a country abroad. I spent last summer on a similar foreign internship. I know my parents miss me, but I hope that they understand that the little village where I am from just doesn't have anything to offer, particularly in terms of jobs and career-building, and I'd go stir-crazy there over the summer months. 

So I accept that my parents do not like my boyfriend. I have listened to their concerns, and I respectfully disagree, and they know this. I don't like it, but I can't change it. My father is harsher over it though. This brings me to my current situation. He is in my current city on a business trip for a night, and wants to take me for dinner tonight. Me, not boyfriend. When I heard he may be coming, boyfriend was planning on taking me and my father out for dinner, to make a good impression or better impression. My mother then tells me last night on the phone that my father will only do it if it's just me there, as he is coming to see me and not boyfriend.

I guess I understand wanting to see me and talk to me only. But I'd have suggested us having a drink by ourselves to catch up anyway after the dinner. Now I apparently can only see my father if he has the monopoly on me, and had to explain the situation to boyfriend. 

Boyfriend tells me he thinks it's a dick move, but that I should go see my father anyway. I should point out that my boyfriend isn't actually my father's biggest fan either, although this developed more after them meeting, so I don't think it was a factor in the original impression. An example is that my father has had a drinking problem all of my life, and there have been times when he's gone too far and, for example, called me things you shouldn't call your daughter. This is only a handful of times, but I guess it's clearly affected me on some level. Most of the time he was a good father, he just worked a lot away, so wasn't always there. Boyfriend is convinced that it's things like this that have given me a lack of confidence today. I do not know if this is true.

I basically feel stuck in the middle. My father is still largely financing my education (although obviously I am paying my own way in the summers and partially in terms from internships) and I am very grateful for that. An argument has caused him to threaten to withdraw this in the past, and that is not something I want to risk. I also don't want to have an argument that could damage the family - my mother would be stuck in the middle too then. My father has two grown-up children from a previous marriage who he has no contact with. I guess I've always been a little scared I could end up on the same route. 

I was looking forward to seeing my dad, I was always a daddy's girl when I was younger, and we've always just clicked, even if it's been more distant between us recently. But now I feel like crap. I feel terrible for having to tell my boyfriend he wasn't welcome, he's not taken it out on me but I know it's hurt him a bit. I don't want to become estranged from my father, and I don't want to waste the one night I've seen him in months on an argument, nor do I want to seem ungrateful for anything he does for me.

I don't know how to handle this situation. What do I do?

Also, this wasn't very short at all...apologies...



   
**tl;dr**: Father doesn't like boyfriend and is taking me out for dinner on the one night he's in my town on the condition boyfriend doesn't come. I feel stuck in the middle and don't know how to handle this. "
3ew6we,17,2015-07-28,I think yesterday I had a mental breakdown.,joseoneill,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ew6we/i_think_yesterday_i_had_a_mental_breakdown/,"It all started as me getting more and more depressed over this half year, I could still manage, some days worse than others, but I could manage. Just to give a little background of things, school ended in May and after it's over the studants are offered an internship for 2 months. Now before the internship it was all somewhat okay, I wasn't as happy as I was last year but it just seemed ok. Come the internship I started to realize how life really is with work, colleagues, etc... and I hate it, I hate it. And now with the internship is where I start to realize maybe I've been somewhat deppressed over the past half year, I also realized that I probably have ADHD and am now anxious with going to the internship everyday, sitting for 8 hours, doing the same work during those 8 hours. I barely talk to my friends in real life, just ocasionally send each others messages through skype. Now yesterday is when everything seemed to break in my head. I was just doing my thing, staying in the computer, watching videos, playing games, ocasionally play guitar inbetween both and I decided to go to bed and chill for a bit. This is where it all went downhill. I started overthinking but I usually do that even though I try not to, then I started crying and pulling my hair not knowing what to do. I was scared for some reason, I was afraid of getting out of my bed, I just couldn't. 40 minutes past and it's over, I finnaly get the courage to leave my bed and then 5 minutes after I start feeling the rage coming out, no idea why but I just wanted to break everything. Not much happened, started over-thinking again until I decide to sit in front of my computer. I decide to maybe play a game to maybe stop thinking so much and I started crying again. This time was a lot more sudden and short but it was worst. I started playing the game and I finnaly managed to calm myself down. Went to sleep and it was all somewhat okay. Come morning, as soon as I leave to go to the internship I start feeling like crying and throwing up, I manage to hold myself, but as soon as I get here I have to go to the bathroom to try and get a hold. I manage but I feel weird all the time. Right now I'm feeling weird and I'll see if I can leave earlier today. Good thing is the internship ends in 2 weeks, but I dont think that any of this will go away any time soon."

3ewguc,13,2015-07-28,"[SV] [Update] [Rant] Lost 35 pounds. Doctor lied, says I still need surgery!",ketokate,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3ewguc/sv_update_rant_lost_35_pounds_doctor_lied_says_i/,"I'm so upset right now, I could cry. 18 weeks ago, I was consulting with a surgeon about a total hysterectomy because of atypical adenomal hyperplasia (an enlarged endometrial lining with precancerous cells). I asked if I could take a few months before the surgery to lose about 50 pounds. He said yes, that it would make the surgery go smoother, PLUS THAT I COULD AVOID SURGERY COMPLETELY AND EVEN CORRECT THE PROBLEM BY LOSING WEIGHT.

I started back on keto that very morning. I had had success with this WOE a few years earlier - so I was pretty sure it would work. I have had exactly one cheat in 18 weeks - I went to a tastefest, but even then, I kept my carbs down to about 90g for the day. I stay between 20-25 g per day, I've lost 35 pounds, I feel fantastic, I have virtually no desire to eat carbs or return to my old ways of eating, and I plan to eat this way for life. 

So, I returned to the doctor today. He was very excited, not thrilled that I did it without going to the nutritionist he recommended, but kind of let that go and told me to keep up the good work. Then, he turned to the two interns and explained that I was taking about 6 months to lose weight before my surgery. I was stunned! I told him he said I could even avoid the surgery by weight loss. He LAUGHED and said, ""oh I never said that.""

I looked at my husband, who gave a slight shake of his head. Then I did my best not to cry and said I'd be back in 3 months. When we left the office, my husband said he wasn't sure of the words, but he knows the doctor had told me before that I could avoid the surgery completely by stopping the extra endometrial cell growth through weight loss.

So, although I'm very happy this little kick in the butt got me started on keto again, and I'm thrilled at how good I feel and the weight loss so far (and a future where I am no longer morbidly obese), I'm very disappointed with the idea of not ""curing"" this issue and still facing surgery.

My plan is to just continue - this disappointment doesn't change how lifechanging eating LCHF is - but maybe I should get a second opinion in 3 months? or just put him off another 3 months after that? I have more than 100 pounds to go and I was sooo happy that I'm finally dealing with it, but this was a crushing blow. I've seen mention of metabolic cancers and I thought this was that type of issue. Can it be cured through weight loss? Am I fooling myself? 

I left the office and had my usual 3-egg omelet with a side of bacon minus hashbrowns and toast. The waitress asked ""low carb?"" I said, yes! and I'm down 35 pounds today. (My husband is on it now, and down 30!). She congratulated us both and that was a nice reminder of how happy I should be, but I still feel the tears coming on. 

I avidly follow these keto threads, seeking tips and advice many times a day and I know you guys are really informed about these things. Any advice fellow ketoers? "

It’s more real, raw and emotional that way. Maybe someone out there will relate to this. Maybe someone out there can rest knowing they aren’t alone because someone else in the world is going through the same struggle.

My friends tell me my life should be a Lifetime movie. The problem is, my movie never ends. I swear, people that don’t know me would think I’m making this stuff up. Because what’s happened to me in my life… well, it’s not normal for someone to go through so much in such a short time.

I guess that makes me unusual. But I guess in today’s day and age, we’re taught to embrace our individuality. My experiences make me unique. And what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, right? Well if that’s true, let’s just say I should be pretty invincible at this point.

I’m 23 years old. In that time, I’ve created a successful career, moved across six states and dated a string of men with hidden mental disorders such as bipolar, schizophrenia, sociopathy, psychopathy, narcissism, multiple personality disorder, etc. I didn’t know until after our relationship went downhill, or ended completely.

My parents recently decided to divorce after 25 years of marriage, leaving me – their only child – feeling more alone and divided than I have in my entire life. My mom moved the length of a country away, from Florida to Colorado, and my dad is in Ohio working and dreaming of retirement.

My way of coping through all of this is working and staying busy. I consistently push myself, which is probably why I had four internships in college and worked two part time jobs. I was on the board of all the organizations I was part of, and I was a straight A student, all the while struggling through my first love’s trial for a violent felony.

Now it gets interesting, right? I met my first boyfriend in jr. high when I was 12. He was 14, a freshman in my mother’s English class, dating my best friend. Over a decade later and I still can’t get those eyes and that smile out of my head. His laugh will echo in my ears, making me cringe every time I see something that reminds me of him.

This was my first in a string of mentally damaged men. I swear I attract them, like lost puppies looking for a way to come home. Write about what hurts? It’s therapeutic. Or maybe it’s too much information. Whichever it is, my group therapy leader told us that it was good for us to get it out. So I’m listing out my life events in hopes that I can breathe better, clearer. I’m tired of hiding and keeping everything locked away.

I’m a child of divorced parents, struggling to define relationships.

I’m a survivor of violent crimes, committed by friends and boyfriends. Domestic violence and sexual violence mostly.

I’m a victim of pedophilia and a teacher to student “relationship.”

I had a baby once, but she was miscarried and I lost her.

I was in a wheel chair for 6 months, when my body tried to shut itself down due to my severe depression. They call it Conversion Reaction Disorder.

I have a screwed up family, who doesn’t talk about feelings and uses manipulation as a tactic to get what they want. 

I am broken. By men who have not given a damn about me, and men who thought they could but failed.

I think about killing myself every single day. Fantasize about it, really. Knowing that it wouldn’t help anything at all. Knowing I would never attempt it, but thinking about how nice it would be to just feel nothing ever again.

This world is becoming a scary place to live, and honestly. I just want a family. I just want people who love me, and I can love them back. I want to be accepted somewhere for who I am, and I want people to brush the dirt off my shoulders and hold me until everything feels okay again.

But I’m a realist, and I know that kind of thing doesn’t exist. Not for me at least. Therapeutic? I don’t know about all that. But it does feel good to say it out loud. Even if it is to random strangers who have no idea what it’s like to walk in my shoes.

I think my odds of getting into BIG 4  are pretty good, if not them then I'm fine with a national, money is money. The thing is, I'm good at this stuff on paper, I am a novice at Excel. I found an online resource and I'm going to be on it daily. How long will it be before I reach excel ""master"" level? I don't want to get into the big leagues and look like a slow leak. How long did it take you all before you felt as comfortable with excel as you do with Microsoft word?"

I don't know what to do,scarlywrong,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3ewyxb/am_i_25f_being_too_sensitive_or_is_he_25m/,"So I've been with my boyfriend for 1 and 1/2 years. We were friends but in love for a long time before we actually got together. He moved to my appartment when he came back from a 6 month internship abroad in March. Since we're officially living together, I can see that he has grown increasingly directive with me, always telling me what to do, when to do it, and blaming me for everything that goes wrong  in our apartment. 

Basically he makes passive aggressive remarks about how things are ugly, dirty, unusefull, unpractical all the time. 
If he finds somethings rotting in the fridge, he calls me over and asks me if I'm keeping this on purpose or if he can throw it away (because you know, Im such a filthy person that I might as well!).
When I don't do what he wants he gets really mad and screams at me, like if I deserved it for acting ""bad"". At these times - and it happens more often than I care to admit - he has a look in his eyes that really scares me. In general he really has anger issues.
On top of that he always makes fun of me in front of our friends, which results in me feeling one more time dumb and inadequate. Actually, Im afraid that if it keeps going, Im going to loose all sense of self worth.
When I confront him with these issues he tells me that I'm being overly sensitive, that I'm crazy or insane, that he's right and Im wrong. He can't stand me reproaching him something and gets very defensive if I do...

I'd just like to add that in spite of this behaviour he can be really sweet, like 80% of the time, and we really love each other. But this is why Im having a dilemma : aren't these problem going to only intensify if we stay together? Do you have any idea of how I could talk to him (I tried countless times) and ask him to change? 

Thanks a lot for reading, I feel better already to get this off my chest ! and sorry for the writing Im not english speaking originally..."

3ex6bl,182,2015-07-28,"Losing my accounting firm offer because of low GPA. 3 Years Later, Deloitte.",jzplayinggames,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3ex6bl/losing_my_accounting_firm_offer_because_of_low/,"Hey guys, 

I was inspired by a story on this subreddit about losing an accounting firm offer. Hopefully my story would encourage those in a similar situation not to give up. 


It was back in 2010 when I received an internship invitation. At that time, I had a GPA of 3.2, which was acceptable to get into a top 6 firm. I kinda coasted through the rest of my junior year after receiving the internship and received a few F's in my accounting classes due to not showing up and not studying. This was obviously a huge mistake on my part. Not only did my GPA tank to about 2.5, but I had lost my ability to graduate with an accounting degree because I had used up my repeat class limit, which I had used earlier in freshman year for engineering courses before I switched majors. 


I did not notify the firm of any of these things come time for my internship in the summer of 2011. I get my employment offer, then went about my senior year with mediocre grades, about 3.0 avg, not enough to pull my 2.5 above the 3.0 overall mark. I graduated with a Finance degree in 2012 and got ready for my job. 


Upon reviewing my final transcript after I graduated, the firm decided to take back their offer. It was about 2 weeks before I was set to start work. So 2 months after graduating, I was without a job. 


I was in a rut for a while after that. All of my friends got great jobs in silicon valley, investment banks, Big 4 firms, and I was stuck with a reneged offer. I was ashamed, embarrassed, and lost confidence in my ability to be a successful professional. It was reenforced over and over again as I started from the bottom, applying on craigslist for shady looking jobs that halfway resembled accounting positions. My parents were concerned, friends had wondered what became of my job, I began to be more and more antisocial. It was a bad time. 


My first job was a part time gig doing quickbooks for a paint and body shop in a crappy part of the city. The commute was awful (about 1.5 hours each way), the pay was pretty bad for the city I lived in (15 an hour), and it was still not something a 21 year old that graduated from a top 20 business school would consider a real job. 


I started working in a small non for profit as a finance assistant in addition to this body shop job about 3 months into it. This was definitely a step up, but from how far from where I fell, there was still a lot of shame involved. 


And that's something I want to emphasize in this post. My shame was keeping me back in so many ways. I had the ability to reapply to a firm, but decided not to because I thought I wasn't good enough. Sure it may have been true at the time, but it never hurts to give it a shot. Instead, I would come back home and sit on the couch and watch sitcoms. Sometimes I would fall asleep by 8pm, only to wake up at 3am just to turn on the television and wait for the sun to rise. I could've gone out to network, could've worked on my CPA, I could've admitted to my friends what had happened and asked if they had any strong leads at their jobs. Nope, I spent my time after work doing nothing. 


The tide began to change in 2014 when I left my NFP job and started federal contracting work as a sub to a small accounting firm. The work was on internal controls, and it finally resembled something that looked like actual accounting work. When the contract was up in 7 months, I had PWC and Deloitte calling my number for federal advisory. 


Now after a year at Deloitte, I am close to securing a project in NYC in Finance. I'm thinking of going into the MM IB route or in PE (if im lucky). I truly have the people around me to thank as well as the connections I've made along the way to make this lateral jump. 


To be completely honest, I feel like I could've done what I did in two years instead of three if it wasnt for my poor attitude throughout the whole process. If I could offer a few life lessons, it would be these: 


- Dont be ashamed of where you're at. Acknowledge your shortcomings and move on. The quicker you do this the better. 
- Don't compare yourself to others. Sure, I might be 2-3 years behind on my peers that I graduated with, but nothing good comes from basing your professional success on someone else's salary. Ask yourself if you love what you're doing and are you improving year by year. 
- Don't listen to people who say you have to be at a certain point to achieve a certain thing. My parents thought that I could never get into big four after what happened without my CPA. And yet I was able to do it, albeit not in something CPA heavy like audit or tax. Dont be too hard on yourself, even if you dont think you can get somewhere, it never hurts to try. 


Thanks everyone who took the time to read this long post! I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have!"
3exg68,3,2015-07-28,My (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) of almost 1.5 years got into a big fight over pillow,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3exg68/my_19f_and_my_boyfriend_21m_of_almost_15_years/,"TL;DR: My boyfriend and I got into a fight over him bringing home a smelly pillow. Basically, I feel like he's not the person I need him to be, but I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong or he is. 

Sorry in advance for the poor formatting. I'm writing this on mobile. 

For some backstory:

My boyfriend and I are both abroad for an internship and in the interest of saving money (and because we like each other) decided to live with each other for the month and a half of our internships in a small room in a shared house. I got the room ready while he was at home so I bought sheets and a single pillow for us to share on a twin bed (sad that we have to share a twin bed - but the city were in is super expensive). He's been sick lately and complained of some neck problems because his pillow isn't high enough. 

Today, while we were with a friend, I mentioned that I wanted to go to IKEA before we went home so that I could pick something up. I wanted to get another pillow because my boyfriend had said he was in so much pain and I thought it might help since he borrowed my blanket to elevate his head yesterday. He said maybe we should borrow our friend's pillow. 

The only problem is that the friend's pillow smells horrible because the city were in is super hot and he never turned the A/C on. My boyfriend and I stayed with him for two weeks before we got our own place and I stayed an extra three or so weeks. During the time my boyfriend and I stayed with the friend, we borrowed this pillow but my boyfriend sweat so much, it smelled so bad. So much so that after my boyfriend left to go home for a small vacation, the pillow left me gagging and I invested in Febreze just to mask the scent for a few hours. 

So, I said no, I really didn't want the friend's pillow since it smelled so bad and said that I would buy another pillow. My boyfriend just asked why when we could save some money. I understand saving money, I'm trying to cut corners as well - but dear GOD does this thing smell bad and I would be much happier just buying a new pillow.  

So we walk to our friend's apartment and again, he takes the pillow and asks me if we should bring it home. I said again ""No, I don't want it. It smells bad."" He asked me why I was so cranky... So I just said, fine, bring it home because I didn't want to fight. 

Outside, I told him when he asked me why I was in such a bad mood that it was because I told him multiple times I didn't want the pillow and still he insisted on bringing it back and I felt like he didn't respect my wishes or opinions. Keep in mind, during the time we've been living together, it's mostly been me folding the laundry, doing the dishes, cleaning and organizing, fixing the bed, turning off the light, boiling drinking water for him. He's been sick the past few days so I've been staying up late massaging him or scratching him when if I ask for a massage, he always gives me a half-assed 3 minute one. It bothers me because I feel like I put a lot of effort in I to caring for him and making sure he's comfortable and he doesn't extend the same courtesy for me. 

He was silent for the entire bus ride home and walked slow. He said I yelled at him when I asked him to walk faster so I could go home. I don't think I did, but I was probably sounding a little annoyed. 

Once we got home, I cried. Probably in part due to my period, but I just felt really saddened by the whole situation and feeling like he didn't take my feelings into account. Whenever I cry, I've always asked him to hold me and he never does. This was no exception. I even asked him to please hold me, but he refused. This is the biggest problem I have in the relationship - the fact that I can be upset or crying and he won't hug me even though I tell him that's what I need from him for the last 8 months. He always says he's trying,  but he never does it of his own volition and I have to beg him for half an hour to hug me while I'm crying before he does. And then this turned into a whole other fight about how he's promised to comfort me when I'm upset. 

I don't know, Reddit. Should I just give up? I feel like my boyfriend will never be the type to comfort me when I need it and that's something I really want in a partner. It's really hard when he tells me the next time I'm upset, he'll comfort me but he never does. I feel like I have so much hope in him and I'm always just let down. I guess I'm just looking for thoughts. I'm really hurt right now."
3exxcd,12,2015-07-28,[Non-Romantic] Me [31/F] with my Good Friend[24M]'s Fiancee [23F] How do We Deal with uncool Behavior?,yourhuckleberrie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3exxcd/nonromantic_me_31f_with_my_good_friend24ms/,"You guys are usually good at helping find words and perspective so I thought I'd ask for your opinion. This is Really long, and I'm feeling the Catharsis typing this out, so thanks for hanging in there -

My Husband and I (30M/31F)have a good friend (Lewis-24M) Who has recently become engaged to a girl (Mandy-23F) he met while we weren't hanging out. (We 3 were good friends in college, Didn't see each other for a year or so until Hubby and I moved to his city.) 

We are all involved in a Board gaming group that meets primarily at our house. We have a lot of fun on Friday nights, Except...This woman he is marrying apparently has no idea how to visit peoples houses, or get along in a game setting. 

Here is the latest escapade. I could definitely tell more ""Mandy stories"" but that would make this even longer.

Last Friday, I made a little dinner for the group, as I do. I've always enjoyed feeding people and am happy when something I make gets good reviews. So I made homemade chimichangas, intending for them to feed the group tonight, and then have a few left over for lunch the next day. Lewis and Mandy arrive first, and we dig in. They had brought Chips and Bean Dip, and they both said the food was good, Mandy seemed especially pleased by it, and asked for another. I stated that We weren't sure how many people were coming (Sometimes Other friend's wife comes, sometimes not etc) so to hold off on another until Everyone arrives. She looks at me like I've just slapped her, so my husband pipes up that he will split one with her, and he will eat something else for lunch the next day. I let it go.

 Mandy has had issues with our food in the past, and while I am obviously not a professional, I suspect she binge eats and doesn't notice. She once came over and ate an entire bag of chips from my cupboard that wasn't on offer. Hubby encouraged me to let it go that time, as she had been drinking. 

So the others show, (including an intern from Hubby's work who is new)and its fewer than originally expected, so I give her the green light to have more food, if she wants. She does and we sit down to play a game. The game chosen is Illuminati (For those of you not into board games, Illuminati is a Very cut throat game. Everyone playing except new intern friend is well aware of this, as we have played before) We Start to play, everyone eats, its fine. 

Then Lewis suggests to her that she attack new intern friend in the game. NIF and I are having a side convo about books, and not super paying attention. When Mandy announces her (bad) battle plan, we cut off our convo. I feel bad NIF didn't have a chance to convince Mandy not to attack her, so I throw in on her side. This makes the attack lose. Mandy stands up and goes to the bathroom. She is crying, won't let Lewis in, and stays in there 20 minutes. 

When she finally comes back, She won't answer anyone and starts to throw the game. This is, in my eyes, and the eyes of the group, Bad Gamesmenship, but We ignore it. Anyone else Sensing a Pattern here?

After the game, we're discussing what to play next, and Mandy goes into the kitchen. I hear the Microwave go, and she comes back with another chimichanga on her plate. I'm a little annoyed, but at that point I decide not to make a big thing of it. Until she decides halfway through said chimichanga that she doesn't want anymore, so she puts it in the garbage. This puts her count at 4, and the rest of us only had one. 

There is now one lonely chimichanga left on the serving dish, so I put it in a zipper bag and store it away for my lunch. We play a few hands of cards, and Mandy asks hubby if the last chimichanga is up for grabs. I am flabbergasted. She goes on to say that she wants to TAKE IT HOME FOR TOMORROW, can she have it? 

I should state that this isn't the first time this has happened when they come out to play games. In fact, I'm surprised she doesn't bring Carry out containers with her. Shes always trying to take food home when she didn't contribute to the group meal (I ended up speaking to Lewis about this after a few times, and he makes a point to bring something now)

My Husband is non-confrontational, and lets her have it, she perks up, and they all leave.
Lewis Texts me the next day that she was ""Drinking"" (yeah, OUR booze) and ""off her meds"" to excuse her behavior. I think that she needs a politeness pill, but she probably wouldn't remember to take that either.

Reddit, This is the last straw. She ate a majority of the food they brought, and we made, and made a giant scene in the middle of a game. I was so embarrassed about the last, because I could see that it made NIF uncomfortable.

 I don't want to hang out with Mandy anymore. Unfortunately, When we invite Lewis, He always says ""Mandy and I will be there"" and I don't know how to be like ""No, we just want you"" 

So my question: Do I just suck it up so we can keep being friends with Lewis? He is marrying his first serious relationship, and isn't the type to divorce, so they're a package deal. Is there a good way to make it clear we don't want her at game night anymore? Am I just being a Horrible Person about this?

**EDIT: UPDATE:**
Thanks for all the replies. I called Lewis yesterday evening for that ""come to Jesus"" chat, and he understands its a problem and decided on the following actions:

*He is working on her taking her Medication more regularly, as Anti-depressants just don't work unless you take them regularly.

*Next time she has a meltdown, they will just go. It couldn't have been comfortable for her to ""pull herself together"" in our bathroom, and it was uncomfortable for the rest of us. No comments, no judgments from the group.

*They will both be initiating a two drink limit for game nights. (solidarity)

*I am going to start serving plates, rather than everyone serving themselves when she is there and then ""closing the kitchen"". She will be bringing her own snacks if she feels hungry after that. 

*I will be vetoing more complex/cut throat games in the planning stages before anyone comes. Husband is on board with this. She doesn't always show, so this shouldn't shelve those games entirely.

* I will be more firm about food without being mean. I realize now that this whole ""taking food home"" is on me, and you were all right that I needed to either stand up about it, or let it go. Its just food, and its not as if we're starving.

Again, thank you for all the replies. If these measures don't solve the problem, I will take more drastic ones. Communication wins the day again!!! 

**tl;dr**:Friends Fiancee Eats everything in sight, throws some away, and then asks for the rest to go. She also throws a wobbler when she loses a game. How Do I tell Friend we don't wish to hang out with her anymore, or Do I just suck it up?"

So this is my first time on Reddit (and first post at the same time!) so I thought I would pop right in to the 7 Cups Of Tea subreddit and introduce myself!

My name is Phillip (@Philbear on the site) and I've been a listener for quite some time now. I don't feel as site age should govern how feel experienced you are to *listen* to others and having said that I've pretty much been listening to and offering different points of view to many in my life so far and I would love to extend that reach even further!

**Here's a quick exert from my own profile:**

&gt; Hey there! My name is Phillip, I am a 7 Cups Of Tea Intern, and starting from this very moment I wish to become your new trusted friend who has both been through, seen first hand and dealt with issues ranging from: Alcohol/Drug Abuse, Eating Disorders, Family Stress, Panic Attacks as well as Self-Harm and who feels that with his years of experience in dealing with these sensitive topics is confident that he can assist you or at least lessen the burden of your issues.

&gt; My main areas of expertise and a keen constant focus for me are: Anxiety, Breakups, Bullying, Depression and Managing Emotions.

&gt; Helping people help themselves is what drove me to not only become a trained active listener, but to also excel in all fields thereof and constantly better myself to be the best listener I can be for each and every one of the unique souls calling out for support.

I'm here today as part of my internship program to recruit new members to the site to help help themselves through active listening and perhaps even bolster our community with a new Listener or two!

What would REALLY help me out is if anyone would be as kind as to follow my [referral link](http://www.7cupsoftea.com/11634503) (http://www.7cupsoftea.com/11634503) and then [get in touch with me!](https://www.7cupsoftea.com/@Philbear).

I really hope that I can even walk away from this experience with even just 1 new member to be a part of and make a difference in their life. :)

Thanks for your time, and if you have any questions please do feel free to share them with me either on here or on the site! Thanks. &lt;3"

My name is Jon and I am currently an intern at a screen printing company based out of Columbus Ohio. I am tasked with creating over 200 original t-shirts, where we are using social media platforms to market and promote our products. Being the huge soccer fan I am, I decided make my brand line dedicated to soccer and the chants that the fans sing. I have made 5 Man City shirts based around the players/manager/chants! While I did my best to research some of the chants, I still do not know some of the inside jokes or chants that true Man City fans know! Which is where you come in! In addition to the shirts I have already made, if there are any shirts you guys would think would be popular, please by all means tell me and I can whip a shirt up based on the feedback and ideas from you guys and gals!

Just to be upfront with everyone, I do not set the price of the shirts but I do make a small commission on all shirts sold. I hope you guys like the shirts and PLEASE send any shirt ideas my way so I can try to make the best shirts I can! 

Please Don't just tell me how bad my designs are, half of the reasons I post these are to get new ideas and new shirts for the audience I am trying to reach!

    **Comments:**

Well, where do I start? If you're looking for a funny story like my other reviews, then you will be disappointed (sorry guys, I'm boring now).

I took two of these tabs around 1 PM, with a third one at around 3:30 PM. Don't know why I took the third that late, but I was just experimenting to see if I could extend visuals. I was already on the come up by 3, and decided to head to a local swimming hole with some friends. I never really went into deep nature on any psychedelic, so I was excited to go. It was beautiful. I was catching some nice contrasts off of the water, and the sun reflected off of my sunglasses to give a trippy blueish red tint to everything I looked at. I jumped in the water and it felt really weird, but swimming on LSD is a whole different experience. I quickly found myself floating down the river to the ""lazy river"", where the water isn't that high. I chilled there for about 3 hours chugging brewskis with some babes from Virginia Beach. Couldn't hold a conversation worth shit, but I enjoyed myself. I left the swimming hole with my friends about five hours later, and headed back to a friends house for a little get together. 


Usually, LSD makes me really social and want to be around everyone and talk to people. It was odd, because I just wanted to be alone. My mind was wandering, and I had a lot on it. I went out on the deck and sat down with a group of friends who were all conversing, as I quickly left reality and went on my journey. I closed my eyes and laid back as I let my mind run free. I thought about a lot. I thought about my family, friends I haven't seen in years, people who have passed, and as well as my future. I had thoughts about transferring schools, and for once, I was depressed on LSD. It was really confusing. My friends kept interrupting my trip by asking me if I was alright. I said yes, but the truth is, I really wasn't. I don't know what it was, but I just hated myself. I felt like I wasn't trying hard enough in school, or at my internship. I felt all alone. Yeah, hooking up with girls is fun, but what's the point of having sex if you aren't committed to your partner?(catholic school has caught up to me)


I thought about the pile of drugs in my room, and that made the trip even worse. What has my life come to? All I've done this summer is do drugs and work. Sometimes, I have a hard time getting up in the morning. I don't even want to hang out with my friends all the time. I felt like I had depression, but I just don't know. I'm getting old man, my life is flashing before my eyes. I'm 19, but I feel like I'm fucking 79. I thought long and hard about a conversation I had with a girl two years ago in high school, and the words she said struck a cord with me. Before I knew it, I closed my eyes, and I was back in my hometown, having a conversation with a complete stranger. ""You know, all of this? It's just temporary, right?"". I broke down crying. I don't know why, I was just really confused. I sat there and thought ""Wow, I could have done a lot more my freshman year"". You know, like maybe if I didn't join a fraternity, who I could've met, maybe I would've done better in classes, maybe I would be a lot happier. My roommate and best female friend came in to comfort me. I'm just a confused kid man. I'll admit it. I'm fucking scared. I'm fucking scared of everything about life, and this trip made me realize that I really don't have that much time left before I have to ""grow up"". My roommate grabbed my face and just said ""It's okay to not be okay. The important part is that you made it this far, dnm117. Congratulations. You made it."" I'm still trying to grasp her words, but I've been having a hard time.

I took a couple of GB hits to ease me out of the trip and into sleep. I woke up feeling dirty, and really groggy. My mind was all over the place, but it is okay now. I don't understand what happened to me. I guess I had my first ""Bad Trip"".

I gave this LSD an 8/10 on purity because it just didn't make me feel right. I enjoyed the deep thinking at times, but it was just too much for me at that moment. Maybe because it's a different formula or something? I guess we all need that sometimes, right?

**TL;DR**: Life got me fucked up.

3eyi7p,11,2015-07-28,Girls Who Code DC got a short Gear VR demo at the White House!,Vanillon,oculus,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/3eyi7p/girls_who_code_dc_got_a_short_gear_vr_demo_at_the/,"Earlier today, 3 classrooms of 20 girls each in a program called Girls Who Code (GWC) visited the White House. GWC is a program that offers an intensive 7-week summer immersion course focused on introducing rising female juniors and seniors to computer science. By this point in the course, the girls have already learned to use Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Today, the girls got to tour through the White House in the morning and talk to various women (expecially in tech) that work there, such as the CTO, Megan Smith. But during the talk, there was some cool toys and stuff passed around like littleBits, Kano (a kid computer kit that's powered by Raspberry Pi), and even an Arduino UNO board and a Galileo board.

While I was waiting for my turn with the other toys and listening to the talk, I saw it. One woman was pulling out a Gear VR! Naturally, I got excited. I guess you can say I've been a VR enthusiast since sometime freshman year, and I'm about to go into my senior year, but I've never tried modern VR. And they were about to let our group try it! I thought I'd just save myself for CV1 (my rig is ready :p), but the opportunity was closing in on me. When it got to the row in front of me, I was super ready. I could see the reactions of the people trying it. A lot of them smiled, and some just mouthed ""wow."" I thought it was so cool that everyone was getting a chance to experience VR. And then it was only two people away from my turn! But then it started to get passed backwards and I never got to try it, haha. That was a little disappointing, but if people's reactions are like this with the Gear VR, I'm really hoping I can be blown away with CV1.

Also, during the talk, I missed her name and position, but a woman (I think she might have been Asian?) spoke about Palmer Luckey. She said he interned at 18 at some university with her. Or was it under her? I don't really remember too well. I was playing with the littleBits at that time, but my ears definitely heard Palmer and intern. If anybody knows who she might have been, I would appreciate it if you told me. I asked my classmate next to me what her name was when I heard talk about Oculus, but she said she had no clue either.

But yeah, I just wrote this because I wanted to share my experience. This probably isn't very well written since I just wanted to get it out as fast as I could. I thought about posting this here earlier since I visit this subreddit usually at least once a day, and normally don't have much to contribute. But now I've had a Gear VR in my presence. I felt like I should get some sort of actual thoughts on the experience, so I asked what one of my classmates thought of the Gear VR, but I guess that was the wrong question to ask, since she didn't seem to know what I was talking about. She later brought up the ""goggles"" on her own, and said it was awesome though, and loved how it followed her head.

So TL;DR A Gear VR was passed around today during a talk at the White House. I didn't get to try it, but maybe about 30 other girls got to. From what I saw, they were pretty amazed. I'm still patiently waiting for CV1."

3ez0ub,5,2015-07-28,Me [21 M] trust issues with current SO [24 F] due to pain in the past.,Jspork,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ez0ub/me_21_m_trust_issues_with_current_so_24_f_due_to/,"Despite being young I tend to look for longer relationships then the short hookups or casual dating scene, it has never really been for me but I tried it. Last girlfriend of about two years cheated on me pretty much two weeks after going to a new university about 4 hours from where I lived. Was easy with giving trust to her, she never really made me doubt my trust in her but perhaps I was dumb and stupid. A year later I started dating my new girlfriend (call her P) 

P and I are just about to enter 6 months. I have been her first for a lot of things, I am her first real boyfriend, she was a virgin when she met me, first person she said she loved and I said it back and first person to talk about a future with. Pretty heavy stuff, but I ave always been a man of commitment. She is great to a fault it seems almost every guy she meets is attracted to her and she seems to naive to dismiss it sometimes, she always lets it be known she is in a relationship but due to her constant working to pay for grad school and my great internship opportunity she sees guys like this more often at her work. 

Before I would have blown it off but due to the cheating in the past I noticed myself way more controlling, being put in a similar situation on her end would have been infuriating for me, but I cant help but be honest with how I feel to her and I think if it continues I will be the biggest issue in the relationship. I am totally over my ex, its just the feeling of betrayal when someone has so much of you, that I worry about. 

I know this sounds petty and like I have low self esteem, which is something I should work on. I feel sometimes she rubs it in my face how much attention she gets but I also asked for honesty, which was unfortunately interpreted as openess....I am giving her the benefit of the doubt because I truly care about her and even looked into some self help material that can curb some of that jealously and trust issues.

Just wanted to ask if anyone on here has gone through a similar transition or situation and what worked for you and what didnt. Hope you evening is going well.

We'll call her Natalie.  Natalie and I started off hooking up, and I told her I wanted to be exclusive.  She told me yes, but first she had to cut off another guy she had been seeing.  I have no idea who this guy is, but she tells me when she's cut him off, and we go on dating.  Everything seems just peachy!


Fast-forward to winter break, and I get suspicious about a friend of hers, let's call him John.  John recently joined the navy, CivMar, so he gets not infrequent leave and some decent privileges.  John seems a bit close to Natalie and came out of nowhere, and they have no friends in common or anything.  So I ask Natalie about John, she says they're just friends, and ""eww.""  I'm satisfied at the time, just seemed a little odd.


So second semester rolls around, and Natalie is interviewing for internships.  In fact, a few even have her fly out!  Great!  Fast-forward to early March, and I'm helping her with some work, and she asks me to look for something in her dropbox.  I look for it, and find shirtless photos of John and photos of them kissing.  All dated from while we were exclusive, but before we were officially bf/gf.  I confront her, she breaks down, immediately says she'll cut him off, and over the next month, bends over backwards to show me she loves me.


John had stopped texting her, but out of nowhere, an old girlfriend of hers from middle school, Laura, starts texting!  I'm suspicious, but I don't do anything besides track the timing.  Then Laura stops texting, and a new girlfriend, Carmen starts!  I was very suspicious, but Natalie slipped up when she picked up the phone in front of me when Carmen called and it was a guy, not a girl like she'd said.  She breaks down, admitting it was John, and when I asked her about the interviews, she said that it was all to go see him.  I was coming up with the words to dump her, but for some reason I couldn't make myself say them.  I thought there was a chance.  Oh, how naive.


At least, not that I saw.  End of the year rolls around, I'm graduating, and the day of my graduation, she opens up a messenger app, and a text from someone I'd never heard of is at the top.  Next to it is a photo of John.  I say nothing at the time.  Two weeks later, I'm back in town visiting her, and I bring it up.  I watch as she cuts him out of her life.  We get rid of all his stuff that she had.  We try to make it work.  I thought maybe we finally had a chance.


But now I'm about 95% certain they've been in contact again.  I can't say 100%, but I determined that she has blocked me on that messenger app they use.  And she's got John and his family blocked on Facebook so John can't see the photos of me and Natalie together.  I checked the messenger app a few times, and during the times when she says she ""can't talk,"" he is always online.  He's rarely online at other times.  I haven't confronted her yet.


I'm breaking up with her when she comes to visit me in about a month, that's settled.  But John and I certainly don't deserve to be treated with such disrespect, and maybe it'll teach Natalie a lesson or two along the way.  So should I tell him?
   
**tl;dr**: Repeatedly found GF stabbing me in the back, now not letting it slide, about to break up with her.  Should I tell the other guy she's in an LDR with?"

Another thing she said was that he is ""saving"" me, didn't get an explanation for what she meant by that. 

I expected her to have a problem with our age, because she is in her late thirties and hasn't had much luck with men. But I didn't expect her to say something about me that was so personal. His mom said that she has never mentioned anything about my family and money to her before (we aren't the most wealthy, and if you look at it from a money stand point I am technically marrying into a family with more money than my own, but that has nothing to do with us getting married or our relationship). This isn't even the first time she has said something out of line to his mom. (talking crap about his dad, sending photos to his dad of her in a bikini, etc) 

After his mom told us this, i was very upset and we both decided that we don't want her there, which I think is now going to make her have even worse things to say about me and our relationship. 

Have any of you had people say things like this, what did/would you do?

**tl;dr**:My [19F] fiancés [19M] mom's friend told her that I was marrying up, that he was saving me, and that he would have to financially support me because my family isn't wealthy. "

Like, how?

The ones i work with are either 30+, or freshmen college interns. I work in IT(DevOps/Sysadmin).

I hate clubs, i hate bars(though love drinking lol), my ideal Friday night is watching historical documentaries, programming, playing video games, drinking whiskey, hacking something, eating and more drinking... in that order.

Specifically age bracket of said females is 21-28. (im 25)

Even when i go out, i never see women my age, its always wayyyy older, or wayyyy younger. And when i do see them, its in either a grocery store, or something like that, and im not gonna trying picking up women, in a grocery store(though in certain situations, i think some have hited on me, but i felt weird pursuing it or they where store employees who i couldn't tell if they where being overly nice or not).

Ive had people ask me if i wanted to be ""set up"" with some nice lady my age they know..... I never take them up on it, cause A) ive always thought that was weird, and B) im not sure if they're serious, or just being nice.

Am i gonna be single forever, Help?

3ezu83,2,2015-07-29,Need urgent help/advice for dermatologist appointment for facial skin,Spyro35,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3ezu83/need_urgent_helpadvice_for_dermatologist/,"I'll try my best to make this all as short as possible. 

I am a 22 year old male and from May 2013 to August 2014, my skin got a lot worse quickly. Pretty much solely due to a lack of sleep. This is all during my 16 month internship, the work was kind of stressful and I never kept a good sleep schedule and constantly slept max 6 hours (sometimes less) a night and used to wake up feeling terrible. I was only seeing the sun about 15 min a day but my skin got duller, darker, and rougher. I also had pretty dark eye circles and my under eye skin also seems to have thinned as my oil glands are easily noticeable and the area just looks dry with cracked skin as well. I started trying random things to try to fix the problem in August of 2014, like using lemon juice or exfoliating with baking soda or a loofah. I tried for about 2 months before I gave it up. I don't think these things made my skin worse, It may have gotten a little better but there wasn't much improvement. I'm wondering if it caused some of the cracked skin/fine lines under my eyes.

My diet the last 2 years has been horrible too with lots of sugar, I usually drink about a liter of soda a day almost. Wondering if this is also affecting me.

Right now my skin is a bit better but not close to what it used to be in April 2013. My under eye skin is particularly my biggest concern. My forehead is also still kinda rough and bumpy and my whole face is a little darker than it used to be. 

I got recommended to a dermatologist recently and went there yesterday. Had a quick consultation, he recommended a filler under my eyes (hyaluronic acid) and a blue peel for my face as well as a cream for my under eyes once the filler is done to improve the texture in that area. 

Right after my appointment though, I've been thinking a lot. I've spent the last year and a half worrying so much about my skin, it's taken over my life. I was prepared to do anything at all costs to get my skin back but now I'm extremely worried about some possible consequences of everything the dermatologist recommended. Could things become worse with the under eye filler and the blue peel? They also gave me a pre-kit that I'm to use 6 weeks prior to the blue peel. It has 4% hydroquinone, 10% glycolic acid, Retin A, and an anti-aging cream. I'm supposed to use it 7 days a week and stop 1 week prior to the peel. I'm so worried about all this stuff I'm putting on my skin and keep wondering, should I even be doing it in the first place? What if they make things worse? The blue peel could go wrong and there could be possible side effects from the under eye filler, and if it isn't done correctly, it could look horrible. I've read places online that say fillers are not good to use around the eye area. My filler appointment is next week and I'm thinking I should just cancel it and not do the blue peel either. My parents are telling me my skin looks okay and the dermatologists are just out to make money and I see where they're coming from.

Perhaps I could gradually just start to accept my skin for what it is. It is indeed getting better, although it will probably never return to normal (not my under eyes at least). I am at a total loss right now.  Is there chemical peels that don't require any prep before doing them? Or Perhaps I could also just use products at home I'm totally comfortable with such as using a 8-10% glycolic acid toner every 2nd day to just gradually improve my skin and improve my diet and drink more water. I don't know what to do with my under eye skin though.

So what do you guys think? Should I just cancel my appointments with the dermatologist? Also, it's not easy to find reviews about that office, yes there are reviews for the particular doctor and he is rated well but he lacks any sort of review on the procedures that I will be having done.

Thank you."
3f01lu,3,2015-07-29,Don't Let Your Dream Teams Be Dreams: Legacy Mode 1984-2018 (Long post),[deleted],BasketballGM,https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/3f01lu/dont_let_your_dream_teams_be_dreams_legacy_mode/,"I started this league with the 1984 roster with the primary goal of answering the question: How well would a team do if they had the two best players in the NBA at any given time? The way my league worked out had 2-3 of Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis all on the same team at various times with a mix of slightly aged Tim Hardaway, Penny Hardaway, Kevin Durant, Jabari Parker, and Dante Exum thrown in.

Worth noting here is that I didn't use God Mode at all to make this slightly more organic. [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/o5djjIf.png) How? You might ask. Well, this lofty goal was accomplished by strategic tanking for the 96, 03, and 07 draft classes to get who you would imagine. Later on, I exploited trade tendencies to snag KG and my beloved 2014ers. As time progressed, my lust for superstars only grew and I must admit I eventually got fired in 2019 for amassing a [147 million dollar payroll(http://i.imgur.com/bjeT6E5.png) during my chase for the class of 2014(shown at 127 here because LeBron retired with his 20M max contract).

Anyhow, let's begin this journey from the very beginning. I'm formatting this by narrating each era by their respective transcendent players. I also want to apologize in advance for some buggy data, due to performance issues I had to delete non-important files ever so often, which messed up some records but not enough to ruin the exercise So without further ado, I present to you: The Shia Labeouf NBA Legacy Challenge--

**PT.1 = The [MJ](http://i.imgur.com/CSUPkNL.png) and [Hakeem](http://i.imgur.com/x9nRdU0.png) Show = *6 RINGSSSSSS*:**  

In the year 1984, your boy deviantzen was hired to manage the poorly performing Chicago Bulls. Seeing the potential of the newly drafted Michael Jordan and his astounding athleticism, he began formulating a masterful plan of rebuilding the team until his alternate reality self from the future traveled back in time, killed him, and started implementing his own perverse strategies based on unfair future knowledge. I'm switching to 1st person now. Anyways, my young star Michael Jordan had a stellar rookie campaign then proceeded to lead the league in scoring his sophomore season. Knowing that he couldn't get a championship by himself, I decided to tank to land one of his future Olympic teammates David Robinson and Scottie Pippen in the 87 draft. Unfortunately, the ping pong balls didn't fall in my favor, and I was left with the 4th pick and a urge to retry this experiment while it was still early. Deciding to try my luck with my 35 million or so in cap space during free agency instead, I trusted the process and quickly picked the 65 rated Chuck Person and sprinted off to free-agent land, where a wild level 82 Hakeem the Dream Olajuwon, disheartened by the Rocket's lack of talent, awaited my maximum contract master ball. I had my stars; now it was time to see if they were enough to win a ring.

In an odd twist of fate, newly drafted Chuck Person blossomed quickly and exceeded his potential to reach a high of 77 at his peak, delivering triple doubles like prehistoric Grant Hill. The big three of MJ, Hakeem, and Person would go on to win 6 rings, until they started to decline around 94-95. All three were unceremoniously traded for assets Morey-style soon after. During this time, Jordan and Olajuwon each had 3 Finals MVPs. It's also worth noting that at this point, Olajuwon would eventually make case for being the GOAT(more on that later, hint hint: he's not) by collecting the **ROY, 16 All-NBA teams (11 first teams!), 3 FMVPs, 5 league MVPs, 10(!!) DPOYs, and 16 first team all defense, and 6 championships** during 16 years in the league. Poor Michael never stood a chance, although he did have two 70+ point games and would get a consolation prize in 2000, when he recieved another piece of jewelery playing 4th fiddle to a [ridiculous Pacers team featuring Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan, and...Raja Bell.](http://i.imgur.com/FTH9bZT.png).

**PT.2 = A Very [Kobe](http://i.imgur.com/hg2qq2O.jpg) Dynasty, featuring [Kevin Garnett](http://i.imgur.com/E6D2zfN.png) = *3 RINGSSS*:**  

With 6 championship rings in hand and a shitload of solid pieces in need of some more superstars, I tanked the 95 and 96 seasons to procure the dynamic Prep-to-pro beast duo of Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett with the 2nd and first picks of their respective drafts. Steve Nash was also there, but he was kind of underwhelming and didn't do too much outside of leading the league in assists like one season. KG was good, but not phenomenal during this stretch. Mamba began showing signs of the overtaking Hakeem as the best in history. In 1999, he put up six 50+ point games (unfortunate spoiler: he never does get 81). For his career, ""Bean"" Bryant would earn the **ROY, 5 MVPs, 6 Finals MVPs (more on that later), 15 All-nba teams (13!! 1st team), 5 2nd team all-defense en route to a jaw-dropping 12 championships.**

By 2002, Nash and KG were declining so I decided to move forwards in getting somebody in the famed 2003 class. With my eyes set on the triumvirate of LeBron, Carmelo, and Wade, I hired Byron Scott to command the great tank of the 2003 season. In a valiant effort that would make General Patton proud, the Chicago Bulls received the 1st pick in that year's draft (haha fuck you, Cleveland!) and unsurprisingly picked Darko Milicic. Haha Just kidding. Don't worry, we got LeBron. (It's worth interjecting here for comedy's sake that [Darko](http://i.imgur.com/3EX1tbO.png), while being somewhat mediocre his first few years with a potential of 62, fell into a giant vat of nuclear waste in his third season and became a 71/71, and was then bitten by radioactive spider the following year to jump to an 81/81. These comic book scenarios kept happening until he was 90/90 and *actually won a fucking championship* along with an MVP/FMVP...)

**PT.3 = [LEBRON GOATJAMES](http://i.imgur.com/Sb615J3.jpg) TIME = *12 RINGSSSSSSSSSSSS*:** 

I'm not even sure this part needs a write-up. Just..go look at his stats, I'll wait for you. 12 rings. 16 seasons. LeBron James.

At this point Kobe still had a few quite a few years left of his prime, as evidenced by his scoring output and 3 finals MVPs during the first half of the king's era. Somewhere along the line, Nash and KG got old and were traded ruthlessly for assets. I also tanked for KD to prepare for the eventual departure/oldness of Kobe, and got a few years of triple double threat Slim Reaper. I think that without Kobe's 25 shots a game, KD might have averaged more than his prime 22/8/5 stat line (which is reallllly good already), but alas he was important as the 3rd piece in a lot of the title runs. But enough about those guys.

LeBron, LeBron, LeBron. Never in my 1 year of playing basketball-gm have I gotten a player as OP as this one. Came in the league 79/97. Spent 90% of his career in the 90s and peaked at 97/100, retiring a 81/81 that many people never even get in some leagues sims. HGH is a hell of a drug /s. The greatest superstar ever--who officially validated my theory that 2 megastars in this sim (along with a reasonable team of 60s and 70s role players) is way too OP. Accomplishments include **ROY, 10 MVPs, 6FMVPs, 15 all-nba teams (14 1st-team!!!), 13 all-defensive teams (10 first-team), 3 DPOYs, and 12 rings.** Jesus.

Towards the last quarter of LBJ's career, I decided to fuck around and have a little fun and exploit the sim. I found out that piling on lots of draft picks can force trades and decent overall rated players on good contracts can be traded for newly-drafted rookies with slightly lower overall but much higher potential. I used this to nab via trade a young DeAndre Jordan who I flipped for DeMarcus Cousins eventually. The rookie exploit got me Jabari Parker and Dante Exum for chump change high 60s role players (Wesley Matthews and someone else) Got really lucky and had a Andray Blatche reach high seventies on a cheap cheap contract, who I promptly traded along with the next 3 years worth of draft picks to a rebuilding team for a young [Anthony Davis](http://i.imgur.com/eeiQWtx.png), who would become a terror and help LeBron win his last 3 rings on strength of his potentials/36. Unfortunately for me and the continuation of the Brow's story with his high 70s range pals Dante and Jabari, the owner--sick of paying 147 million a year and losing hella money--fired me.

If you've read all the way to here, I'd like to commend you for getting through this gigantic monstrosity of text and also thank you for taking the time to read my work. I really like basketball, thoroughly enjoy playing this sim at my internship (shoutout to the ""commissioner"" /u/dumbmatter You da real MVP), and also secretly like writing, so this was a real joy for me to do. Have a lovely day, y'all.

The end.

3f0ead,1,2015-07-29,A question about a on set internship at 17,Fun_Time_Shorts,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3f0ead/a_question_about_a_on_set_internship_at_17/,"I am thinking about trying to apply for a plausible internship on set for a small original series that would be shooting some time near the beginning of next summer in California. This specific internship is something that I feel would be valuable to me in the case that I actually got it. I do lots of projects on my own but because I'm not planing on going to film school, on set experience seems to be a must. I've currently never interned on a project before and I know that my current age might be an issue, so was hoping some of you guys might have some advice.

I currently am going into my senior year of high school in Oregon and will only be 18 later in the summer after graduation (most likely post internship). I'm planing on graduating a trimester early so school would for sure be out during the timeframe of the internship. What sorts of things would need to be done to get a work permit? Would I even need one? Would I need one from Oregon  or California? How would my age affect my chances of getting the internship?

 If I got the internship, I would fly down to California and stay there for a few weeks. Do internships like this typically provide any accommodation? I know some of the creative team including the director would be temporarily staying in California as well. This whole thing seems like there would be a lot of hidden obstacles I'm not thinking of, so I'm just wondering, in the case that they would want me as an intern, how possible would it be to actually have it work out?"

I've always pursued Engineering, I was successful enough to get onto a good Engineering course and have currently scored a first in my first year. I don't want to be an engineer, but I really enjoy studying it.

I've always had an interest in Law, and my mum has worked in the field her whole life so I've grown up around it. 

I wanted to get an engineering internship this summer, but the pay was too low and I don't come from a wealthy enough background to be able to earn very little money and rely on my parents to support me. I got a job in a London law firm this summer because the pay was great.

I've been able to speak to lawyers and I've fallen in love with being one. I think I've finally found what I want to do. However ideally I want to live in America as soon as I finish my degree and I know that's not an easy thing to do.

The American culture in law is fascinating to me, and is definitely something I could do. The long hours, hard work, and stress I am all aware of. 

My question is, how do I go from being a first year engineering student in the UK, to a lawyer in the US?

I have a plan, but I need advice/criticism/alternatives:

In two years time I'll finish my bachelor's in Engineering ideally with a first

Transfer to a different university nearby (I can meet entry requirements) (top 100 law school), to study for a Juris Doctor.

After Juris Doctor (3 years) try to secure a work visa/sponsor in the US.

Take California bar exam.

And finally cry about student debt.


Honestly any thoughts/advice would be much appreciated!"

About me: I'm 26M, single since my first/only/last relationship of like 5 years, 2 years ago. Since then I have tried to met some girls but for me meeting/talking to new people (male or female) is very difficult for me. 

This start like one month ago when I went to a shop to to have some work done, I had never previously enter that shop because they do a very specific kind of job and I din't need it and really I don't have any more excuses to go inside. Also this shop is really small its only her and her boss. I went 3 or 4 times because of the work I needed, once she was alone, other they were both and other the boss was alone.

There I met this girl that is doing an internship and I really kinda like her (also i don't event know her name), it's like I have a crush on her and I have been thinking on her for this month. I don't want to go inside and be like: Hi sorry to come to your work place and can I have your number to maybe go drink something. there also the possibility that if I go inside I'll met her boss an be like: Hi, ho shes not here. and ask her boss about her name and maybe her phone number?

I know this shop is going to close soon, like before next week maybe, and more likely she will end her internship at this date. I have been trying to met her casually on the street but it seems that I have never been in the good place at the good moment. Monday I saw her went Went inside a store near her work place. I was waiting in the cashier line ans comes, ask the person before me and grab something from the shelf. , she was leaving and I froze. I saw her fade away. Later I was like: you moron, you should have said something.  I think this week might be my last chance. I'm thinking on going today after my work to wait for her but if I do, I might froze again and I don't want to look like a stalker.

How should I proceed?

thanks
   
**tl;dr**: I want to meet this girl, I don't know how and I don't have much time before her internship ends I will mostly lose trace of her."
3f145j,0,2015-07-29,Bank holiday weekend and an unwanted visiter,knitting_angel,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/3f145j/bank_holiday_weekend_and_an_unwanted_visiter/,"There is a bank holiday weekend coming up. Me and my brother both live at home with my mother. I have some family abroad and a sister living and doing an internship in a different county. I wrote about her a few times here. She's a wagon. I had to report her a few weeks ago to the Gardai for abuse and harassment. 

Around two weeks ago I cracked up a joke to my brother at home. Joke was about my sister. He went into a rant about her and I swear to god, the stuff he said, I never laughed so much. He hates her. The falling out between me and her, that didn't influence him at all. He knows we don't get and he doesn't give a rats ass as to why but he knows it's her being an absolute b1tch. My brother and sister had their own falling out a few years ago where she turned around and didn't speak to him for years for punishment or something. They only just about speak now. He limits all contact with her. 

Anyways there is a long weekend coming up. Me and my mom reckon that my sister will be home at the weekend to visit. It would make sense for her. She wouldn't have to buy food, milk, bread, toilet paper, etc for her flat and come home and bum of us to spare money. Last time she was home was about 4 weeks ago. She didn't even phone my mam at all to ask could she come home or was it OK to come home. She just landed back home and started knocking on the door. Bummed of us all weekend, taking food from the fridge that wasn't hers. Was too lazy to make her bed and took over the sitting room sleeping on the couch. 

Anyways, me, my mam and my brother we are dreading the weekend. In case she's back. None of us want her there at all. We are trying to clean up the house at home too and the long weekend should be great to get a loaf of work down on the house but that one around throwing her weight around we probably won't be able to do much. Already as it is, me and my mam have a plan in place if she does come home, we're going to turn on our heels and just go from the house. To the pub or where ever. 

Any way we can stop her from coming back to the house?"

Also, on my CV I haven't put the grade I got for my degree (it was a 2.2 (not sure if it's the same grading in America)) - will people assume I did really badly, and thus not interview me?


Thanks, here is the covering letter:

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is ---------- and I am a recent graduate from the University of --------, having studied biochemistry. I found your job application for the ------------------ position via -----------. My attached CV states an East Sussex residence, however, I am relocating to Edinburgh in the next few weeks.

Prior to university, I worked as a lifeguard in a leisure centre for two years which included advising prospective and current members on membership plans, such as tiered price plans and what they could expect for their money. This provided excellent opportunity to communicate with people at all levels, and instigated a passion for sales. 

As mentioned, I have a degree in biochemistry which involved quickly understanding complex biological, numerical, and logical problems and finding a solution. I will utilise these approaches to provide expert market knowledge to my clients. I understand to be a successful ------------------ requires a solid comprehension of both the provided service and prospective business. To not know about your clientele in detail during the age of information is simply lazy and bad practice. 

During my time at university I undertook two eight week internships, demonstrating initiative and a desire for personal progression. Furthermore, being in unfamiliar territory is not a problem, and will push me to perform to the best of my ability. Additionally, I was part of my university’s tennis team. Here I organised social events for the club throughout the year which was really fun and fulfilling.

I am motivated by career progression, competition and high earning potential. I am attracted to the IT industry because it is a rapidly evolving industry which will keep me intellectually stimulated. Every business relies on IT services and thus sales are providing a necessary solution for their business, no two sales process will be the same and this excites me. It is important for me to work in an industry and for a product that I believe in.  Your advert also states you provide bespoke training which is extremely appealing. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and any additional information can be provided if requested. I hope to hear from you soon.

3f169k,4,2015-07-29,Lively Discussion to help entertain us until Friday: What do you honestly think of the lineup?,westernorange21,Lollapalooza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lollapalooza/comments/3f169k/lively_discussion_to_help_entertain_us_until/,"A redditors comment in another thread on this sub got me thinking...people are usually pretty critical of music festival lineups and I see written all over the Internet ""Oh the Lolla lineup sucks this year""...obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion but Lollapalooza is a festival that in recent years has catered to ALL music lovers from EDM enthusiasts to Indie Rockers, to Hip Hop Heads, and Folky Fanatics! Sure it started out as a mostly indie rock/ punk rock fest but I'm curious as to what you guys honestly think of the lineup?! Where do you think the festival  potentially went wrong this year? Where do you wish there was someone/something different in the lineup? What specifically could C3 have done better with the artists? What would you like to see improved in the future? 

Personally I love the lineup, one of the best set ups I've seen at the fest. I've only missed 1 year of the past 5 when I was out of town for an internship. For me it caters to all of my musical tastes, I really enjoy a diverse range of music, I don't really care for EDM and Country, no hate for anyone who enjoys those genres, just not my cup of tea. But the fest features a couple of my favorite rappers in G Eazy, Logic, Kid Cudi, Tyler ( I know, insert white guy rap joke here...) and a huge range of Indie rock and Folk acts that I am excited about such as Catfish and the Bottlemen, Django Django, the Wombats, MS MR, Misterwives, George Ezra, Givers, Walk the Moon, Glass Animals, and Night Terrors of 1927 to name a handful. 

In my other comment I discussed the topic of the headliners. Obviously Sir Paul is the biggest name on the bill by a landslide, and Lollapalooza always has a couple older ""legends""- if you will, on the lineup. Metallica is obviously the other oldie for this year, though apparently they are now making new music. From Outkast last year to Soundgarden and the RHCP a few years ago, Lolla always brings in some stars from a generation or two ago. Note I'm not saying any of these acts are not relevant in music anymore, but their influence and popularity peaked sometime in the past. 

Another point I thought about was Florence for example, I think she makes great music and I will be at her set but is she headliner material? I'm not totally convinced of that fact, it might be that Paul took up a big chunk of the budget, but she was a sub headliner a couple years ago and I'm not totally sure she has boomed in popularity since. This is mostly anecdotal since I don't follow the music industry feverishly, but just my opinion on what I've observed. A band that made the similar jump is the Arctic Monkeys, and I'm biased because they are my favorite band of all time...but with the release of AM they went on a touring rampage and exploded in popularity for over a year and sold out stadiums around the world and headlined a slew of festivals from Summer 2013 until Fall 2014. I also LOVE Of Monsters and Men but with only two albums under their belt are they worthy of the coveted sub headliner spot? That might be up for debate.

Now maybe having pop stars like Sam Smith and the Weeknd on the lineup is causing some uproar amongst the vocal hipster/indie crowd, and I can't say I will be attending either set, as I'll opt for G Eazy and Paul instead. But Sam and the Weeknd are huge stars right now and a lot of people will enjoy their music this weekend. 

Finally a point I made in my other post is that I discovered so many amazing artists that I never would have listened to before if not for Lolla, and thats the awesome thing about Lollapalooza...you know you'll get to discover some great new music and enjoy some acts you're already familiar with. 

Anyway hope you guys enjoyed reading...please discuss the questions I raised below! See you all on Friday!"
3f16c9,1,2015-07-29,Time and computers,Geminii27,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/3f16c9/time_and_computers/,"Just wondering - as small business owners, who often have to wear all the hats at once, is time the most valuable resource?

I've noticed in a lot of small and medium businesses that there's a lot of time wasted on using computers in very inefficient ways, partially because small businesses can't often afford their own on-staff technician or even to have their local IT shop come around and spend a day or three assessing and training, but also because the focus of SMEs tends to be sales, customer service, and getting the product through the pipeline, instead of on processes, workflows, and efficiencies. Those things sound like stuff you'd hire a consultant for. A bigger company might have a custom software package designed for them to automate some of their business.

So what if you could have custom software created specifically to automate your business, for far less than the giant ERP packages? Just little things that turn an hour of work into ninety seconds, or which automatically steps through an annoying fifteen-minute process for you while you're doing something more useful?

The thing is - creating automation software which does these little but often-repeated tasks for a business isn't anywhere near as difficult and time-consuming as creating giant programmatic edifices which cost six figures and need five consultants and an intern to keep running. Something simple, that just lets you click a button and goes off and does that one thing you always find yourself doing, shouldn't be anywhere near as expensive.

So what's that one sequence of things you're always doing over and over on the computer, and how much time would it save you if your computer just *did* it for you automatically?"
3f18gj,8,2015-07-29,SSH Honeypot implementation for an organisation,jacmor01,netsecstudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/3f18gj/ssh_honeypot_implementation_for_an_organisation/,"Hi everyone, 

I'm just finishing my internship  I'm getting ready to write my dissertation for when I return back to university. 
The topic I've chosen is going to be related to an organisation's implementation of a honeypot as a method of improving network security and research. 
First of all, I came across an issue of what I was going to do about hosting the honeypot (I want to use a ESXI server with a few honeypot nodes) and realised both my university and university accommodation would probably object to me putting a honeypot on their production network. So I asked my dad whether I could host one at his house and my idea now is to set up a VPN connection to his router using a Raspberry pi through direct ethernet connection and to also have the ESXI honeypot server connected directly to the router. This way I will be able to use vsphere remotely to install the honeypot distros etc. 
Has anyone got any advice as to what I should do in terms of security of his network and locking the honeypot down? 
I want to avoid worst case scenarios if possible if a hacker does compromise the system. 
If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. 

Thanks! 
Jack"

3f27vh,2,2015-07-29,[F4M] The Intern,intheofficefun,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3f27vh/f4m_the_intern/,"I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom). 

There will be a fair amount of build-up here, lots of flirting and what not, but make sure your character doesn't come off too strong. I expect a lot of detail, and I will tell you if you do not provide enough. I would like consistency with that detail as well.

I am a uni student currently doing an internship in a very male-dominated industry. The guys I work with are all really nice, and they have been super to welcoming me as a new member of their team. There's just one thing I've had a little trouble with: Quite often they will ask me about girls or comment to me on the few girls that make it through our office, I understand that talking about girls is a common ground that all straight guys have in common, and its a way for them to connect even if they are different ages/from different backgrounds. The problem is that I am, on first glance pretty ""straight-acting"" (I hate that term) and I feel like they are just trying to reach out to me and bond with me by talking about the opposite sex, but I am completely clueless and to be honest quite uncomfortable talking about women in that objectified manner.

Have any of you experience anything like this? It has been easy to avoid conversations like this for me thus far in my life as I've had a lot more in common with guys at university and school. Should I just go with it? I don't think its particularly relevant in my professional life to come out to these guys, kind of feeling a little bit weird about the whole situation. 

Sorry for the rant! 

tl;dr: Male-dominated workplace with older, less relatable men where only common small talk is women, having a hard time relating or to these well-meaning coworkers. "

We got to see each other a few times since she's been gone and she is due back to our hometown in 3 weeks. I know she had thoughts of breaking up with me before because her roommate told me and said she loves me but doesn't know if she's just staying with me because she's afraid to be alone. When I visit with her everything is great but lately i dot know if I want to be with her anymore. Often times I feel like I have to be very careful with what I say around her. She's not very expressive in her lovey dovey emotions and she's very type A and I often feel worried if I don't make enough money she will eventually leave me. She says she loves me but I always have to call her and wen we talk on te phone there's just awkward silence and skype is even more awkward. She  rarely talks about the future but has joked weirdly about getting married. 
I don't know if it's the distance getting to me and if I should tough out the next few weeks and see if things turn around when she gets home or end it and enjoy the rest of my summer. "

I'm a finance/ accounting student set to graduate this december and I'm currently applying to, and in communication with, a few proprietary trading firms in Chicago. The first step in the application process for one prop trading firm/ market maker is to take a math test. The recruiter told me that if I pass the test I will make it to the next step of interviews. What kind of questions can I expect to see? Is there a specific way to prepare myself for this test? I'm assuming since the firm is dealing with derivatives there could be a significant amount of calculus on the test. I did fine in calculus but I was originally an engineering major and did all the math through the school of engineering. Most option pricing that I have been exposed to was done by using a calculator or excel file. 

Second, I read in their job descriptions that knowledge of Python is a huge plus.  During my summer internship in commercial banking I learned some basic Python to integrate excel spreadsheets with a few databases.  How much more should I learn before going into an interview and telling them I have exposure to python?

I appreciate the input anyone has and even advice not directly related to these two points!"

3f3i4k,2,2015-07-29,"I'm [22/M] attracted to an already-taken friend [21/M], though it seems mutual.",3d7899c,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3f3i4k/im_22m_attracted_to_an_alreadytaken_friend_21m/,"**Background:** I've gradually become increasingly attracted to one of my male friends – I’ll call him ‘B’ for the sake of brevity – who is currently in a relationship with another guy – we’ll go with ‘C’ for him. I don’t really know C except for tangentially through B. I originally ""met"" B on a dating app last August; he messaged me and we had one nice (albeit brief) conversation and neither of us messaged the other again. In October, he added me on Facebook (despite not knowing my name from the previous interaction); neither of us said anything to the other, however. In April-ish, he started dating C (~21/M) who attends a school about an hour away from where we both live. Said boyfriend has been away for a summer internship since May and isn't returning until late August. I didn’t actually meet B until a dinner party with a mutual friend of ours. We both seemed to enjoy each other’s company and it’s somehow spiraled to the point that we consistently see each other 4-5 times/week – and it’s almost exclusively stuff that would considered dates in other contexts (going to the movies, me cooking dinner and having him over, taking daytrips, etc… – all with just the two of us).

B’s relationship with C is, from everything I can see, instable. They weren’t formally together for a significant period before this long-distance situation arose. At one point, C broke up with B but wanted him back the next day; B specifically said that he feels less invested in the relationship as a result of that stunt. Further, B is already skeptical of the future with respect to C, as C is graduating within a year and will almost undoubtedly be moving out-of-state for post-grad.

I’ve been out-of-town for the past several weeks on business (returning mid-August, though). We message each other throughout the day – literally over 5,200 messages in the six-ish weeks since the dinner party. Since I’ve been gone, he’s started saying things like “I miss you so much […] I'm glad that you're in my life” and has escalated to “This break we've had is killing me.” He sends obviously suggestive emoji on a regular basis. He’s suggested vacationing together – once a beach trip, another time cruise. He has – without any sort of provocation – explicitly suggested living together on two separate occasions. He, on one occasion, sent me a risqué photo with enough partial nudity that most would consider over-the-line for someone in a committed relationship.

At the same time, whenever C comes up in conversation, B always refers to their relationship in a context that doesn’t imply an imminent end. For example, when he said, “I wish I lived with you,” and I responded, “C would probs kill me!” his response was, “Nah, he wouldn’t.” More recently when I asked, “How’s everything with you and C?,” all he said was, “We are good.”

I can objectively say that it seems as if he’s more emotionally attached to me than he is his boyfriend. I do genuinely appreciate the platonic value of our friendship and don’t want to lose that, but don’t see the current situation as one that’s realistically sustainable. I feel like we should either be dating each other, or he should be doing most of the activities we’re partaking in with his boyfriend instead.

At this point, I have no reason to expect the situation to change unless I actively do something to cause it – I can’t talk to him less without it seeming like I’m ignoring him and I can’t see him at a lesser frequency without it coming off as avoiding him. While I definitely don’t want to lose him as a friend, I also have no desire to be his BFF while I’m attracted to him and he’s dating someone else. One of my confidants familiar with the situation suggested giving him an ultimatum, which I honestly think is douchey, disrespectful, and more likely to preclude maintaining the friendship. The only real solution I can think of is telling him that I’m attracted to him, feel uncomfortable with our current level of involvement, and that needs to focus his efforts on his relationship if he wants it to work (under the premise that if he doesn’t, he won’t, and if he does, then he should be happier with it in the long-term).

Is there a better approach? Am I misinterpreting his interest?

**tl;dr:** Not sure if an already-in-a-relationship friend is into me or ultra friend-zoning me and am considering acquaintance-zoning him to avoid the entire situation becoming even more uncomfortably involved."
3f3kon,2,2015-07-29,He (26m) seems into me but won't ask me (22f). Yet if I pull back he seems upset. What to do...,dogdoggod,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3f3kon/he_26m_seems_into_me_but_wont_ask_me_22f_yet_if_i/,"We are both coworkers and work closely together. One weekend I asked him if he wanted to get a drink, and he said ""don't hate me. I'm busy this weekend so I won't be able to this weekend"". He said he would get a drink with me, but it has been weeks since I have heard from him. He also played along when I told him a coworker said he saw us ""holding hands and kissing"" (we didn't. Our coworker was just messing around cuz we got lunch together).

He teases me a lot. He remembers weird things about me. He is always smiling at me. I got asked on a date and he had a billion questions about the guy. He just generally seems interested; especially since coworkers say he is ""mr.shy"", but he doesn't seem shy around me.

I told him via text he was sweet and cute and he said ""easy, intern"". Cuz I started out as intern at this company...  I apologized and he said ""it's ok. How is your night?""


Anyways, I kind of pulled back today. He kept asking me why I was so cranky / if I was upset, so obviously he was a bit upset I wasn't giving the amount of attention I usually give him.

He was getting a drink with a coworker this weekend, and I teased him (we having a teasing relationship) about how he never got a drink with me/ when he was planning on paying me attention (again we have this friendly relationship, so it's not too far fetch of a thing to say) he said ""that is the age old question; when will I ask you to hang out"". 

That just got me really frustrated. He can show me attention, get upset when I don't reciprocate, but he won't ask me for a drink ?? I'm not sure what to do. I'm sick of playing the games and want to walk away, but I still have feelings...

Tl;dr coworker flirts a lot and gets mad if I ignore him, but he won't ask me out for a drink even though I asked him out weeks ago."
3f3krs,32,2015-07-29,I finally understand what unwanted attention is like... It sucks.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3f3krs/i_finally_understand_what_unwanted_attention_is/,"I've always struggled with the idea that you (women) wouldn't want to get hit on or be showered with attention and compliments.  The other day it finally clicked on why it would be unwanted and how much it does suck.

I have a pretty awesome job.  I enjoy what I do and I enjoy the people/team I work with and I get paid well for my age and this job will look good on my resume so I really don't want to leave.  However at work there is a gay guy who I started out being friends with and it's gotten really uncomfortable for me to the point that I dread going into work some times because it's so awkward and uncomfortable for me.  He works in another department and we have no work related reason to interact. 

  At first Derek (the gay guy in question) and I would just chat and were friends, but as we got to know each other he started saying things like ""what were you doing last night or who were you doing last night?"".   I took this originally as a playful way of asking what I was up to over the weekend.  However as time went on he'd press for more information about my sex life and what I was spending my weekends doing.  At times he'd ask me what positions my girlfriend and I liked or other questions that aren't appropriate for most friends to ask, much less work friends.  

  Eventually started trying to invite himself over to my house and saying we should hang out and go bar hopping or just get drunk on wine and chat at my house with just the two of us.  I did my best to change the subject or avoid the question but he would continue to push the topic.

  At times he would walk into my cube and I'll not notice him because I'm working and have my headphone in.  Instead of knocking or trying some other way to get my attention he would rub my back or massage my shoulders.  This made me really uncomfortable and I don't enjoy it at all.  Sometimes he would wink and hint at us having some good alone time, maybe swim or go for a drive together. 

  After this occurring and slowly escalating for a year I mentioned it to my girlfriend how it really bothers me and makes me feel uncomfortable and generally dislike what is an amazing job.   She thought for a moment, looked at me, and said that's what it's like for a lot of women who receive that attention.  You don't want to have people hinting at hanging out and making sexual comments.  You don't want to have someone touching you and rubbing your shoulders.  You don't want to have to hate work.

  She said that I should tell HR at work but I really don't want to cause an issue and hurt anyone career/lose what is an amazing job.  I'm an intern and Derek has been working here for roughly a decade so he has plenty of seniority and friends in the office.

  This whole situation has opened my eyes on how much this must suck for a lot of women to be uncomfortable at their place of work or walking down the street and constantly have this completely unwanted attention and pressure on them.  Seriously, just leave me the fuck alone to work/shop/walk.  I also realize it isn't as easy as it sounds to mention it to HR/management.  You don't want to mess someone's career or life up and you don't want to damage your own career.  In my case Derek is a pretty nice guy but has a pretty obvious ulterior motive that bleeds through into all interactions.

So while this may not be all of society waking up and understanding how uncomfortable it can be, at least one more person understands.

And for the record it's not that I dislike him for being gay or even hitting on me.  I have several gay friends and enjoy going to some of the gay clubs in town to get drunk on vodka-crans and dance my heart out.  At a gay club it's more than appropriate to expect to get hit on (apparently I'm quite the sexy bear) It's the constant and persistent sexual advances that I dislike in a environment that should have no sexual interactions at all."
3f3tuv,1,2015-07-29,PF Perspective on Job Move - Better Opportunities for Less Money,careeradviceme,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3f3tuv/pf_perspective_on_job_move_better_opportunities/,"Hi PF!

I have been offered a job which opens up more opportunities for career advancement but which is for less money than I make now and I wanted PF's perspective on it. 

The details:
I am in my mid-20s with an advanced degree and about 200k in student loan debt. I qualify for student loan forgiveness in 9 years as well as a (small) pension when I turn 65 if I stay within my government's job circuit. Given that debt load, I want to stay in my government's job circuit for the next 9 years as the average interest on my loans is ~7%. So here's where my question comes in - 

My government job circuit consists, basically, of three levels - 
#1 - What I do now. Pay ranges from 55k - 75k. I have a year experience at this level.
#2 - A greater range of transferable skills. Pay ranges from 45k - 55k
#3 - The best job in my circuit. Pay ranges from 60k - 90k. I did a fairly significant internship at this level.

My career goal is to make it to #3 within 9 years then jump to a federal job (where the pay can be more than double).

I currently make 57k and am on track for making ~$62k next year this time in my #1 job slot. That increase will be graduated over the course of the year. 

I have just been offered a job for 53k at the #2 job slot. That job also comes with some added expenses - travel time will increase significantly (gas per work week estimated at 30 - 35 gallons instead of 10) + I will have to get a second car for my wife. That job will also give me about half the amount of leave time as my current position. However, that job will open up the job market significantly, making me much more marketable for a #3 job slot (or a federal job slot). Quite honestly, the extra skills in the #2 job slot are the only skills missing from my resume for the #3 job slot. That said, the #3 job slot only comes up once, maybe twice, per year and there is a fair bit of competition. I do know, however, that if I take the #2 job, I can expect to be a very strong competitor for the #3 slot in about 2 years and will probably get it within 5.

Based upon the pay scales, I can expect to earn/keep ~100k more over the next 5 years than if I move to the #2 slot. After that, however, there is a good chance that I will move to the #3 slot and be on par. After 9 years, I would have a much, much better shot at a federal job in the #3 slot than the #1 slot, and there I could potentially make quite a few hundred thousand more than if I get stuck in the state system.

My question is, should I take the #2 job even though I'm looking at a significant and immediate loss of income?"

1) How is the program as a whole? Is there a lot of respect for the CS program? 

2) How are the job/internship prospects? Can students get jobs and internships with Google/Microsoft/big tech startups vs the competition from MIT or Harvard or is it very difficult? Are there career fairs?

3) What clubs could I get involved in?

4) How is the software engineering track specifically?

5) What is the best and worst thing about UMass? Does it still have a reputation as a party school or has it gotten better? I'm just worried that employers may look over me because of a party-school reputation, if it even exists."

How to break it to company no.1,hushgod,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/3f42yz/got_a_coop_offer_but_am_waiting_on_another_offer/,"I am interning with company no.1 right now. Due to some financial aid issues on my part, I am looking to take a semester off, and I want to keep my semester co-op options open.

I talked with the company I am interning with and told HR that I wanted a position. After several weeks, the HR rep finally got me one and got me in contact with my potential manager-to-be. They want a response by this Friday.

What I haven't mentioned [to anyone in company no.1] is that I had also been applying to other companies, and I had actually interviewed with another company (no.2) last week. I talked with the interviewer, and the earliest time he can let me know is by the following Monday.

I want to keep both options open, but I feel bad as I didn't tell the HR rep or my potential manager-to-be that I was looking at other positions, and I think that they think I'm definitely taking the position.

(If I get an offer from company no.2, I will be taking that one)

How can I go about to minimize the potential damage from this? I don't want to burn any bridges, especially as I would like to keep company no.1 as an option for a summer internship next year.

Thanks in advance for all your help!"
3f467n,1,2015-07-29,Should I give up on my online class?,[deleted],makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/3f467n/should_i_give_up_on_my_online_class/,"Hello,  
It's a machine learning class, I'm a computer science undergrad. It's not that I'm having a hard time in the class, and I am learning things, but I just think that my time investment to ""things learned"" ratio is too small. I bought a few books about data analysis/machine learning that I haven't even opened yet, and next week I won't have internet for half the week, and the other half I'll be home on vacation, so it'll be a time crunch to get the ""work"" done which so far is pretty much just watching videos. I figure if I relax about the class deadlines and my grade, I'll just read next week and take a break from the class.  

I fear that the class material is really out of date, but at the same time I don't know if I can work with more up-to-date things without learning the basics, or if I already know enough, or if I can learn things along the way.  

I also don't know if a good grade in this class would help me with machine learning internships, or if they don't care about online classes."
3f49jk,2,2015-07-29,"Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 2.5 years, my parents want me to break up with her for the sake of my grades",reps5jesus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3f49jk/me_21_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of_25_years_my/,"My girlfriend and I met in my first year of college, her second year.  We go to a state school and she is from that state.  I am from a state about five hours away.  She is a business major and I am a mechanical engineering/comp sci double major.  We started out just hooking up but we developed much stronger feelings for each other and started dating in February of 2014.  We have a really strong relationship, we're very compatible sexually and have great communication, and we have seriously been talking about a future together after graduation.

The problem is with my parents.  I am South Asian and she is a mix of Asian and white.  They do not think I am ready for a girlfriend.  They think that I've fallen head over heels for the first girl that I've seen and are always trying to lecture me about how women at my age are very cunning, only using me to get ahead, are only a distraction to me and how now is not the time to build relationships with girls.  This is all coming from my mom.  My dad says that they are sending me to school to get an education, and not to get a girlfriend.  He says I don't need friends or girlfriends and just to focus solely on academics.  My parents are also very conservative and unreasonable, the type to stick to their opinion no matter the evidence to the contrary.

So during the school year, my girlfriend and I can spend as much time together as we want and I downplay my relationship with her to my parents.  The problem is during the summer.  Last summer, I proved all their talk wrong as I made the dean's list.  However, they still kept guidelines with her.  I could only talk to her once a day and that I couldn't be texting her all the time.  I thought this was BS so I skirted them all the time.  I was working during the summer and she was taking a class so we only had a couple weeks where we would both be free.  Both our parents were against us living together before marriage but we thought that it would be reasonable for me to visit her and stay in her guest bedroom for a night.  But my parents absolutely refused to do that so my girlfriend took a 5 hour bus ride twice so that she could visit me and hang out with me for another 6 hours before she had to go back again.  Doing that sucks for the both of us and we hate it.  The second time, I came home and got into a huge shouting match with my father where he tried to talk to me about girls while being piss drunk.

So this past school year, we're still together and stronger than ever.  She is living in an apartment off campus where she has her own room and I'm still in the dorms with a roommate.  So I spent a lot of time at her place.  Admittedly, a little too much.  Whereas before, we were down the hall from each other, we are now 25 minutes apart.  I went over to her place almost every night.  Her coursework is easier and so she studies less whereas I study for an hour or so every night, often more.  So I missed out on a lot of studying by going over to her place.  This showed in my grades.  I got a C in 2 classes and my GPA dropped.  My parents blames this entirely on my girlfriend and told me to basically keep my relationship with her to a bare minimum.  

My girlfriend and I identified me coming over as a problem for the next semester so we compromised and she came over a lot more and helped me study a lot.  However, I overloaded on credits and took many hard classes at the same time and got Ds in two of them.  My parents again blame her and have given me numerous talking tos about her, about how she is taking up too much of my time, how I'm only focussed on her, how she's making my grades suffer, etc.

We both landed good internships in our home states so we haven't seen each other in 2 months and we were planning to this week.  I still think that the most logical thing would be for me to visit her and stay a night but my parents are still absolutely against it.  So even though it sucks she was planning on visiting me via bus.

Now today, I had to go cancel my local gym membership but I completely forgot but it's not really a big deal because I have another week to do so without penalty.  But when my mom came home, she started giving me the same talk with emphasis on how I'm only focussed on her and how she is a different race that doesn;t understand our customs and then she banned her from visiting and basically told me to break it off with her and that if she truly is the one, then my girlfriend would be fine with waiting.  

So here's my view on this.  My parents definitely have a point about my grades and I know I have to get my shit in order.  The semester I was on the dean's list, my girlfriend and I lived down the hall from each other and this upcoming year, we'll be a 2 minute walk away in the same apartment complex so I feel like this will help a lot with wasted time.  However, I don't think I can cut off my girlfriend like that.  These past 2.5 years have easily been the best of my life and we both see a future with each other.  She makes me a better person and has always been willing to comply with my parents odd demands but I don't know if I can break up with her for my parent's.  She's recently said that she's tired of being in a secret, high school relationship since our connection is much more than that, and honestly, so am I.

So reddit, what do I do?  Is there a common ground solution, or do I basically disobey my parents and get my grades fixed and prove them wrong?


   
TL;DR:  College girlfriend of 2.5 years.  My grades have recently suffered for a variety of reasons.  Parents want me to break up with her.

EDIT: Also what do I do about trying to see her before the summer ends?  I'm going out of the country for 3 weeks and I haven't seen her in two months and would like to before I leave."

I really want to get a auditing or advisory job at either the big 4 or a regional firm with the hopes of being able to partake in other service lines provided. I didn't get an internship with any of them this senior year or junior year. Though I did get a internship with the government. I am scared that I won't be able to get any job at all. 

One major factor I'm fully aware of that prevents me from getting any recognition is my GPA. Right now I stand at the between a 2.9 and a 3.0. I believe that the low GPA comes from from the one D I have and I am retaking the class to get rid of it. Hopefully, that will be enough to push me over to the favorable side of firms.

I also curious how much will I be affected by not pursuing a master's in accounting? Financially, I can't afford it. Doing a 5th year is already pushing it for my family and I even with financial aid. I've opted to take specific courses to get my 150 hours.

Now that I've described my background, I was wondering how I would go about getting to my career goal. It always seemed impossible to get an internship but is my GPA really the only big factor that prevents me from getting noticed? I want to go to the fall career fair where all the firms I want to work for will be but I wouldn't have completed the class I need to fix yet. 
Finally, I've been to this career fair every year to get to put myself out there, network, etc and I feel like I've been genuinely interested and energetic talking to them. I know that personality is also something firms are looking for. Am I doing something wrong with that? Any advice on how to behave?

**So to summarize the questions:**

*Is my 2.9 GPA truly the major deal breaker?

*Will my chances be affected by not pursuing a master's in accounting?

*How should I act when talking with recruiters?

Thanks for taking the time and answering my questions! I really appreciate any of the advice you guys can give me!

I was attracted to this subreddit because my behavior therapist directed me to a Youtube video which mentioned this subreddit.

I am a college student who doesn't want to fail at life and relationships.

Yeah, a behavior therapist, so about that. I've found that over time- especially lately- I've been slipping into depression mainly based in anxiety, worry, and lack of focus. I've PMOed on average daily for quite some time and it seems to have taken its toll. I felt devastated after watching the Youtube video and looking through YourBrainOnPorn.com as I saw that the symptoms mentioned there were verbatim what I was dealing with.

I feel like my life is heavily disrupted by this depression especially over summer break as I ""attempted"" to looked for internships before school starts again, and learning that PMO is very likely behind it, I want to stop it entirely- especially if I'm seriously considering prescription drugs to treat depression that could be stopped just by not chronically fapping. I also feel like I use PMO to suppress my emotions like when I'm stressed or upset about something/someone. I would like to learn how to properly process my emotions, so halting PMO is of dire interest to me.

I hope this place will be helpful to me, and maybe eventually, I could be helpful in return. Thanks."

One weekend I asked him if he wanted to get a drink, and he said ""don't hate me. I'm busy this weekend so I won't be able to this weekend"". He said he would get a drink with me, but it has been weeks since I have heard from him. He also played along when I told him a coworker said he saw us ""holding hands and kissing"" (we didn't. Our coworker was just messing around cuz we got lunch together).


He teases me a lot. He remembers weird things about me. He is always smiling at me. I got asked on a date and he had a billion questions about the guy. He just generally seems interested; especially since coworkers say he is ""mr.shy"", but he doesn't seem shy around me.


I told him via text he was sweet and cute and he said ""easy, intern"". Cuz I started out as intern at this company... I apologized and he said ""it's ok. How is your night?""


Anyways, I kind of pulled back today. He kept asking me why I was so cranky / if I was upset, so obviously he was a bit upset I wasn't giving the amount of attention I usually give him.
He was getting a drink with a coworker this weekend, and I teased him (we having a teasing relationship) about how he never got a drink with me/ when he was planning on paying me attention (again we have this friendly relationship, so it's not too far fetch of a thing to say) he said ""that is the age old question; when will I ask you to hang out"".


That just got me really frustrated. He can show me attention, get upset when I don't reciprocate, but he won't ask me for a drink ?? I'm not sure what to do. I'm sick of playing the games and want to walk away, but I still have feelings...

3f5wq9,1,2015-07-30,What Am I Worth to You?,[deleted],Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/3f5wq9/what_am_i_worth_to_you/,"I’ve been unemployed for several months now. This situation I’m in has nothing to do with me being lazy, nor does it mean I haven’t been looking for a job – I’m actively looking for jobs, on a daily basis. These last 3 months I have registered with several recruiters, and applied to countless jobs – I probably have 5 altered resumes on my laptop right now, some extensive and others I’ve had to dumb-down.

Let me give you a short introduction about myself.

I’m 27 years young – a business entrepreneurial enthusiast, fashion connoisseur, and, based off what my friends tell me, a universal advisor. Ask anyone who knows me, I’m very ambitious – reach for the stars kind of attitude, and once I set my mind to something I go with it all the way. 

Since I was a pre-teen, fashion has been a part of me. It all began when I was 13 years old watching Fashion Television for the first time and experiencing the splendor of a runway show. A few minutes into the show I was entranced, it was as if a seed flew off the runway, out of the television, and into my brain where it immediately took root in me. Ever since then everything I’ve done throughout the years has revolved around fashion. 

I’ve worked in fashion retail, completed co-op placements with local designers, obtained an Advanced Diploma in Fabrics and a Certificate in Women’s Fashion Illustration, moved to the Middle East for 8 months to assist with a fashion start-up, and interned at a fashion start-up e-commerce company in Toronto. This is just a short list of my experience, just to give you an idea of my incessant dedication to this inexorable industry.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had a few hits with my resume and have been contacted for interviews. But based off the meetings I’ve had, it seems that businesses these days just want to “stripend” you for all your skills and experience. 

When I initially took this internship position earlier in the year, I was under the impression that this was a rapidly growing company and that my chances of being hired at the end of my internship was pretty high. In the beginning, I agreed to their terms of working 2-3 days a week and that the cost of my transportation would be covered by them, all the while I would gain valuable experience during my time there. To give you an idea of some of the duties I had – I designed graphic t-shirts on Adobe Illustrator, custom hand illustrations, sourced fabric swatches, and picked up samples. This all seemed exciting in the beginning and I anticipated my role becoming more challenging down the road, unfortunately it took an opposite direction. I’m very observant, and even though I may be quiet and sometimes in the zone when I work, I’m always aware of my surroundings, and as weeks passed I started to get the impression that my hopes for being there permanently would only remain as a hope and nothing more. My hunch was correct; this became clear to me when I overheard indirect news of another intern that would be taking my place after my internship was complete, which then followed with a few employees being laid off. As you can imagine this didn’t sit well with me, and I chose to end my internship a few weeks early. If you came to me today and asked what my take is on internships, based off my experience, I would tell you that I’m opposed to it and would convince you to take another road towards your desired career path. Personally, I think any job that demands your best skills, time, and dedication should compensate you - either by contract, hourly, or salary.

These days I find myself confused, posing the question: What exactly are companies looking for in an employee?

If an employer was to look at my resume right now they would see that the longest job I’ve held was 2 ½ years, after that I attended college for three years and chose to remain unemployed during that period. Ever since 2013, I have gone through 3 jobs, and not because I chose to leave them, but all due to unfortunate circumstances that was out of my control. One thing I will mention is that I don’t regret having held any of these last three positions because I was able to expand my knowledge and gain experience in all areas of business, management, marketing, e-commerce, and design. My learning hasn’t ended there though; with all this spare time I’ve made a daily effort to research and study trends, businesses, and today’s ongoing demand for swift online and mobile-friendly services.

Ideally, I would like to be apart of a company pertaining to my expertise, where I can apply my mountain of skills and knowledge that would potentially help with the growth and profit of the business. Sometimes I wonder though, will I ever find an employer who see’s my worth and would take a chance with me?

I’ll just have to keep searching to find out."

3f6208,2,2015-07-30,25 [M4F] Prototype,rootshock,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3f6208/25_m4f_prototype/,"It began, as these things usually do, rather unremarkably.  On a quiet street of a quiet suburb next to a bland-looking office building.  Quitting time comes early here; the executives and even the rank-and-file dribbling onto the adjacent freeway one after another.  But for the intern looking to swim upstream, the quiet night is an opportunity.  A time for focus, a time to pull ahead, a time to oneself.

The night is an opportunity for other things, too.  And so it was that a black sedan quietly rolled along the empty street.  The glossy reflections from its polished finish were barely visible in the moonlit haze.  From its undercarriage came the soft mechanical whine of an electric motor.  A motor that seemed to glide along for a short distance and then smoothly stop.  And again.  Almost as if it were pacing, the measured steps an expression of some pensive, inward thought.

One would be wise to inquire about the driver, but darkness is a confidential friend.  A dark silouette is hidden in the driver's seat, but no movement would betray its attitude.

The pause is longer this time.  The wait is rich, and progresses in stages.  First, awareness.  Deliberation.  And then decision.  The sedan's lull beneath the third-story window becomes a stand.

With the gentle hiss of a hydraulic pump, the sedan's hood swings open.  But no engine is concealed.  Instead, a segmented appendage waves at the night air, unseating itself from its premolded bed.  A second soon joins it, grasping and clawing at the darkness, as if to pull itself out by the night sky.

Instead, it finds the front bumper.  Like a human climbing out of a swimming pool, the two arms push back against the black metal, propelling the creature into the open air.  It lands with precision, leaving behind the molted shell that encased it during its safe passage here.  Its legs--for it seems clear now there are too many to be characterized in any other way--taste the tiny raindrops on the road beneath it.  A quiet chorus of hydraulic whines announce its calibration.  It raises its central body to its full height, a full 5 feet of clearance, before shirinking itself back against the ground.  It scuttles, the rubber-coated limbs pattering the ground with dull thuds as it turns its single red eye toward the office building.  Its body tilts, as if thinking.

The beauty of machines is not in their cold strength or their cunning ingenuity.  While they certainly possess both, they are by no means unique in that regard.  Rather, their true graces are quiet endurance.  The all-encompassing deity of the defined Objective, and the blind pursuit of her, forsaking all others.  They track the Objective without the primitive handicaps of fear or the sensation of pain.  They are never afflicted with petty anger, or dreams of revenge.  Man did not become the apex predator through brute strength, but by chasing the antelope until it tired.  The Machine does not love you, but neither does it hate you.  You are merely a resource that it can use for something else.

The round, black central body rights itself, completing its study of the office window.  This surface is nonporous.  With a ripple of pleasant pops, white plastic bursts forth, speckling the ends of its slender libs, as they raise in small greeting.  The front legs reach upwards, pressing against the glass window, the suction cups attaching themselves with the grace of a stiff-legged octopus.  The rear legs curl up into the body, one by one, testing the strength of the grip.  The experiment is satisfactory.

A tiny gasp can be heard as the pressure of the cups is released, reluctantly unsealing themselves from their tight embrace, before reattaching higher up the wall.  Our automaton applies itself with the precision of a trained catburglar, keeping its large eye focused ahead of it, peering steadfast into the darkness.

For the first time, a sound that might be intentional.  It begins as a gentle whisper, but grows to something more audible.  Not that anyone would hear it on an empty street.  It is... music, of a sort.  The notes hang on the cold air.  But one would have expected better from a marvel so carefully crafted.  It suggests a music box that is slightly off-pitch, or an icecream truck that hasn't sold a lick of custard in twenty years.

3f6243,11,2015-07-30,Looking for Advice - My Help Desk role evolved into IT Manger,it_throwaway001,ITManagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/3f6243/looking_for_advice_my_help_desk_role_evolved_into/,"Hello /r/itmanagers,
 
I love the subreddit, and have found some of the links from top all-time to have a lot of really helpful content and advice (especially [these]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/xh06q/i_just_became_it_manager_so_now_what/) [two]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/32kq0t/promoted_from_sysadmin_to_technology_director/) posts).  I’ve quickly transitioned into the IT field, and then into the role of a manager.  I’m looking for advice about how to talk to my CEO/owner, compensation, and any general tips. 
 
My background: I studied physics and math in college, and realized too late that I wanted to go into IT, and that I didn’t much like physics.  No formal background in IT/CS besides an intro to programming class senior year of college.  I have always played with computers: built a NAS for my family in middle school, installed Linux on my original Xbox, created a couple of Arduino projects, built a RaspPi media center, created some very useful Tasker profiles, etc.  But definitely nothing formal that I feel qualifies me for IT.  I’m 25, unmarried, no children, and willing to work hard &amp; long hours while I’m young. 
 
My situation: My company’s headquarters has about 75 employees, and five branch offices with another 30 or so total employees—all IT support and services are out of HQ.  I’ve worked in operations at my current company for the last two years, and back about 4 months ago our Help Desk person left.  They interviewed outside people, but ended up asking me if I wanted to do it because they thought I’d be a good fit (I had spent a bit of time in the IT room, talking to the developers &amp; CIO and had even passed some of their coding brain teasers they use for hiring interns, and probably most importantly—because I am very familiar with the in-house application and have provided detailed bug reports and feature requests for the past two years).  I’ve taken that role, but it has evolved into a management role. 
 
At the time, the department was 4 developers, 1 help desk, and the CIO.  The CIO started the IT department when the company was &lt;10 employees, and has managed everything since then...acting as the senior developer, SysAdmin, DBA, Network Engineer, 3rd Tier Support, some sales roles, CIO, etc.  This was acceptable when the company was smaller, but now that we’ve added 50 employees in the last 2 years to put us over 120 total it is not a good practice.  About a week into my training, our CIO put in his two week notice to pursue his own project (time sensitive, it had been in the back of his mind, but a law changed making his idea feasible and he wanted to be first to market…otherwise he would have had a longer transition).  My training was then a split between desktop support, project management, and a few other responsibilities our CIO gave me.  In addition to me taking several of the CIO’s roles, before he left we hired a SysAdmin and a DBA to take those hats from him.     
 
Over the last four months, my role has very much drifted towards IT Manager.  I go to the weekly managers meetings and report on IT’s projects and issues.  I was flown out to a branch office to setup their internet connection, MPLS, and VoIP phones.  I lead the department’s SCRUM meetings.  I sometimes work 60-70 hour weeks to get everything done that is needed.  I work with the managers to understand what features they want added to our in-house application, and then prioritize and build task lists with my developers.  When a branch manager or department mangager has an issue after hours—they call me on my cell.  I work with my DBA &amp; SysAdmin in prioritizing their tasks and keeping them accountable.  I do all of the IT purchasing, and plan all department events.  I speak directly with external customers to figure out their needs and then work with my appropriate team to fulfill their needs.  I manage our physical building’s security system with RFID badges &amp; alarm codes on our security server.  I’ve been working with my SysAdmin to move our servers to a colo facility.  I’m rewriting our DR plan.  I’m coordinating the installation of Ethernet &amp; internet into our new training office.  I lead the technology &amp; in-house software training for our new hires.  This is all in addition to being the primary support desk person—mostly setting up &amp; closing accounts, and then approximately 10 help tickets daily (the department is already planning on getting a new support desk person after this summer).  For this work, I was recognized as company employee of the month in July. 
 
My loose plan had been to work on my CompTIA A+ certification and get 6 months of experience and see how things are looking before I talked to my CEO about an official promotion to an IT manager and a raise in salary.  However, this has been expedited because my team is now treating me as a manager—they are sending me emails or texts when they have an issue (child sick, running late, want 3 hours off on Thursday b/c they’re working 3 hours on Saturday on the database).  It is really unclear to me what my role is because my official job offer was “IT Help Desk” and lists zero people reporting to me.  Also, HR is redoing titles &amp; job descriptions company wide, and just sent me my “IT Help Desk” roles &amp; responsibilities and asked me to bold the most important functions and let them know what skill requirements best describe the position.
 
Does anybody have any advice on what I should do?  I think that I should approach my CEO and tell him that I think my role has transitioned into a management role and I should be compensated and recognized as such.  Does anybody agree or disagree?  Any tips on how to have the conversation?

3f66ti,3,2015-07-30,"Responses to 'I Stand With Planned Parenthood', or why internet activism contacting government feels useless.",nuutz,aclu,https://www.reddit.com/r/aclu/comments/3f66ti/responses_to_i_stand_with_planned_parenthood_or/,"I used the ACLU site to submit comments to my Senators supporting Planned Parenthood and dismissing the recent videos regarding fetal tissue specimens used for scientific research.  I replaced the form email with my own personal history with PP:

&gt;Instead of a form response, here is my personal history with the PP in [removed] - not as a female, but a male. PP isn't just about female reproductive rights, PP provided services to me as a teenager for STD testing and free/discounted condoms. It was a place I would stop by on the way home from High School with my girlfriend, who now 20 years later is my wife with 2 beautiful children of our own. I was always comfortable walking into their office, discussing sex with their personnel, and want to preserve that same welcoming &amp; non-judgmental atmosphere for my own kids when they become sexually active. 

&gt;I am very strongly pro-Choice, and have no problems with the contents of these recent videos. As a Biology major, who was Pre-Med, I understand the importance of fetal tissue research. I have friends who work in abortion clinics, and they do a lot of good for a lot of people. I even support late-term abortions in cases of medical necessity, incest or rape. A persons body and what they do or put into it, is not the domain of government.

&gt;Planned Parenthood is not the problem. Do you want to know what IS harmful to a sexually active &amp; inquisitive youth? Religious dogma and faith-based groups disguising themselves as ""family planning"". Maybe, instead of de-funding Planned Parenthood, Congress can work on eliminating public taxpayer support of religious institutions pretending to work for the benefit of their communities. In other words, preserve the separation of church &amp; state, instead of acquiescing to the moral religious right.


Within 24 hours, I received the following response from one Senator:

&gt;Thank you for taking the time to contact my office about the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Like you, I believe that all innocent human life is sacred and value your opinion on this important matter.
&gt;The recently-released videos appearing to show senior Planned Parenthood officials casually negotiating the sale of aborted fetal tissue are both appalling and deeply troubling. As a result, I have signed onto letters circulated by Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) asking that Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, in conjunction with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, to launch investigations into whether federal laws prohibiting partial-birth abortions and the sale of fetal tissue have been violated.

&gt;During my tenure in the Senate and the House of Representatives (1999-2005), I have had a solid pro-life record that has earned the support of the largest and most well respected pro-life organization in the country. I am a co-sponsor of S. 582, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act introduced by Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), which would prevent federal tax dollars from going to Planned Parenthood, as well as S. 1553, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act introduced by Senator Lindsay Graham (R-SC), which would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. 

&gt;Please be assured that I remain dedicated to protecting the sanctity of human life and will keep your comments on this important issue in mind. Thank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.
&gt;Sincerely,
  
&gt;Signature
&gt;Pat Toomey
&gt;U.S. Senator, Pennsylvania

It is pretty clear from this response, that whichever intern opened my email didn't even bother to read it.  I think my letter stated my position, and should not lead to such confusion. It is pretty clear to me, that this Senator has already decided their position on this issue, and no amount of feedback from his constituency is going to shift that opinion.  I'm not even sure if my response is going to get properly flagged in their system opposing the Senators position.  

So I come here to express my frustration with the current representative system in America, and also my concerns with the current trend of online activism.  How effective are our efforts, really truly, when I take the time to write a message that obviously doesn't even get read?    

I applaud the ACLU, in setting up these systems for us citizens to easily contact the right people at the right time.  However  I am worried the flood of emails is simply getting lost in the mix.  I feel I have had the best success in conveying my support/opposition to legislation is via a phone call and directly speaking to an assistant.  I would ask that the ACLU always make a point to include the phone contact information along with the option to email in these campaigns.  Yes, an email is a traceable communication with proof of receipt, versus a phone call which can be easily dismissed.  But the email response above indicates my message was never truly received in any case.

I have an intern who has never worked on the commandline before, and I need him to run some scripts for me on a Linux server. I know it's going to be a tough one, but is there a website where he can get a quick crash-course on basic navigation, program execution, etc. on the commandline? I'll be doing most of the script modification, etc. and I just need him to be able to check if some files have been written, copy them between folders, read what's in them, etc.

So more generally, is anyone aware of good websites that offer the essential basics of the commandline?

Thanks!"

3f6ubo,14,2015-07-30,I [20m] found out my girlfriend [22] of 7 years has been going out with a man [30m]. My girlfriend and I recently lost a baby I need Help,nameless23,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3f6ubo/i_20m_found_out_my_girlfriend_22_of_7_years_has/,"Some background information. My girlfriend let's call her Jessica and I have been together for 7 years this coming December. we were high school sweet hearts and my parents loved her ever since we started dating, as for her parents they hated me for taking her virginity away during highschool. But eventually grew to love me after being there for her daughter when we lost our son that I will mention later on. So here it goes I'll keep it as short as possible since I'm using my phone. 

Our high school relationship was really good until I became a senior in 2012 and she had already graduated at attended college in 2011. We attended a high school where we took college courses and high school courses at the same time.  We would constantly argue and we both decided to take a break and during this break I was talking to other girls sure i kissed them but that was as far as anything went. Jessica has been to this day the only woman I have done everything besides kissed with. And of course she found out and did the same and i have no idea what she did but she said only kissing aswell. After I graduated I told myself enough was enough I was committed to Jessica because I really love her. 

We ended up moving together to a different college in 2012 2 months after i graduated and lived off campus together with a best friend in had in high school whose name isn't important. we would argue about the past and slowly we argued less and less but our relationship was still good we laughed, had great sex almost once every week which was ok since during high school it was like 5 times a week. 

After a year of college there now it's 2013 and my parents had moved up to another city about 4 hours away and they had a college she's been wanting to go to so I asked my parents if we can move in so she can go to college and they said yes so we moved in with my parents. And our relationship was great. Now fast forward to 2014.

On new years eve in 2014 we found out she was pregnant and  we told both of our families. My family wanted to support us but my sister we can call her Maria was not having it she wanted both of us out of my parents house and she wanted my girlfriend to abort the baby but I wasn't having that shit and said I am having this baby and that's that. So ultimately we needed to get our own apartment which we did because my girlfriend didn't want to be around my sister. I went to every appointment with her when she was pregnant kept her well fed and was just excited to be a father scared but excited. 

On March 7 2015 she had a still birth inside of our apartment and basically her and I had to deliver the baby ourself when he was only 3 months old and give him mouth to mouth to try and no get his little lungs working but didn't work. I was there for her through it all whatever she needed I was there taking care of her during these time and of course before. Our families were both devastated 

For the most part we coped okay with the situation being as young as we are. And our relationship was strong we went to memorial for families in the same situation as us. Did activities in remembrance of him and we're just trying to do things that could help us cope. 

Around this time she has almost completed her bachelor's degree and just needs to do her internship and of course her second jobs because we were both pretty broke. 

And this is where it happens so I am a manager at a cell phone store as of now and she has her internship that she started in June and her second job as a lead teacher for a day care that works with her hours. She goes In around 7 to the internship leaves at 2 30ish and then goes to her other job and gets out at 6 30isb. And i go in at 9 mainly because I rather just go to work early than be home alone and come home around 8 maybe earlier. So of course we don't really have time to see each other because she works Monday through Friday and we with me it varies I might be off one weekday and sunday so Sunday Is really the only day for us. I can honestly say I haven't been giving her the attention I needed to mainly because I can't really be there to give it to her because of our schedules but in Sundays you better believe we spend time together and whenever I get off work we always eat together. She says when I look at her she feels no connection anymore and that she thinks I don't have feelings for her but the thing is i just can't show them for one reason or another but that's honestly the only thing I can say I've done wrong is just not give her the attention she needs. So I started to out whatever effort I could to try and be with her but she was always on her phone texting away and never thought anything of it but my heart told me something is up so I questioned her on it when one day I caught her deleting messages from the corner of my eye because for as long as I've known her she never deletes texts 

I asked her if she has anything to tell me and lies and says no so I asked her again making her swear (swearing with us is a huge deal for some reason)  and thats where it all happens. This man is a [30m] will name him bitch well he has a child special needs and he is a married man for that matter and it was always her to say she hated home wreckers and cheaters. 

[EDITED]  DURING THIS TIME HER PARENTS HAD VISITED US AND STAYED WITH US FOR A GOOD 4 DAYS AND WE WERE HAVING A GOOD TIME AND I ASKED HER NIECE THAT WAS VISITING IS ASWELL THAT IF SHE WOULD LIKE FOR ME TO BE A UNCLE AND I WAS PLANNING ON PROPOSING TO HIS AUNT. I HADNT FOUND OUT SHE WAS CHEATING OFFICALLLY UNTIL LAST NIGHT. HER PARENTS LEFT YESTERDAY MORNING AND THIS HAPPENS YESTERDAY NIGHT WHEN I CONFRONTED HER.

Here are some questions I asked.


How long have you been going behind my back? 3 weeks

What have you done with him? Kissed him 

You kissed him or he kissed you? He kissed me and I kissed him back for a bit

Why did you do this to me? Because he was there when I wanted someone to talk too and you weren't giving me that. 

You do know I work to support you right? ( I may our apartment all by myself which a man should do anyways) she says yes but still you weren't there

Have you guys been on a date? Yes he took me to go shooting 

When did you find time to do this? Whenever you worked on the weekend I went out ( as far as I know it's just been one date but she says they have lunch together at their internship)

How serious was it? Not that serious it was just a little crush since he was there for me and you weren't

Is there anything else you need to tell me you guys have done together? Nope

(Me bluffing) I'm getting a copy of the text messages so is there anything else you need to tell me? Her eyes get big and says well your not going to like things that were said at all and starts getting mad saying why would I get copies of her texts that's low of me and I tell her that I was bluffing and I was seeing if she would lie to me again

What kind of texts wouldn't I like? I don't know I can't remember she says 

Anything sexual? She kinda smirks or giggles or a mixture of both as says I can't remember but I do remember him saying that they would mess around saying they would get a hotel together and they would be together if I and the bitchs wife weren't together 

I asked what she was you thinking i said you always hated home wreckers and that's what your doing and he has a special needs son? She says I know I don't know why

Does his wife know? No she doesn't but she suspects something

Do you even want to be with me or love me? She says I just want you and I do love you.

After this goes on still asking her questions and i do forgive her because that's the man I am I forgive but I don't forget. And this is where things gets interesting. 

I asked her I want you to stop talking to him and she looks and me and says why?! He my friend and honestly this might sound weird but I want to be there for him and his son because they are hurting and there's where I lose it I start cussing saying you want me and love me but want to be there for a man you like and has a child you can't do that to me. And she starts crying so I get some of my clothes and walk out and tell her let me know what you want to do but I'm not being apart of that shit if that's what you want. 

I head to my parents apartment because i dont really have friends to vent to for that matter and just pour man tears. I tell them what happens and they said to stay with them and give it time and I should really let her dad know what has been going on. So I agree and say we'll I have to go back for clothes so I do while in m and confront her again. I grab my clothes and she tells me.

Her: your leaving just like that? 

Me: what did you decide on doing with that man?

 (My phone vibrates and it's jessicas dad calling and I let it go to voicemail) 

Her: no response

Me: you think he is gonna up and leave his wife for you? He has a child, a home, a wife! If he would think it's that easy he's a dumb as because there would be a divorce the child will go either the wife and you will be known as the home wrecker. Imagine if we had our son here. (Jessicas phones rings it's her dad aswell she doesn't answer it he knows something is up probably because my parents told him we were arguing)  

Her: starts crying and says It wasn't even that serious!

Me: talking about getting hotels and leaving each other SO seems pretty serious to me and I really want to know what other kind of texts you guys were sending since you got defensive when I said I was getting a copy

Her: they were bad and you wouldn't want to hear them (Jessicas dad keeps calling and calling and calling both of us) 

Me: yeah not serious huh?! 

Her: crying and frustrated with her dad keeps calling she decides to text him what happened very vaguely 

Jessica dad responds and says you know he was planning on asking me for your hand it marriage? He was perfect for you and I hope you guys can work this out.


After awhile I grew weak seeing her crying so I comforted her (I'm an idiot) and say I want to work it out but I need time and she says she wants to work it out and doesn't want me to leave. So I tell her I'll be back tommorow evening and want you to tell me your plans. 



I leave back to my parents and just start thinking what all these things what if she's sleeping with him right now? Or texting him? And I knock out from crying my eyes out. 


I'm sorry if it's all very disorganized but it's too much to write on a phone. I just need some advice on this redditors. 

TL;DR my girlfriend cheated on me by kissing another guy we recently lost a child about a year a ago and was planning on proposing."
3f6z5s,7,2015-07-30,What seems to have been my life just fell apart and I feel alone and stranded,DrKenshin,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/3f6z5s/what_seems_to_have_been_my_life_just_fell_apart/,"So, I guess I have no idea of how to put things, specially how I feel but I will try to explain my current situation with as few words as I can.

I am a student living abroad, I had a scholarship but it ran out last semester. Unfortunately the program I am enrolled it is/was mostly foreign students as well so basically everybody I know has already left (I am still here doing my thesis plus I stayed for other reasons). 

I stayed because I met a girl, we have been together for almost four years now I guess, we were, until yesterday afternoon. We live together and since I am a foreigner when we rented a place together everything is in her name, including the adoption papers of our 10 month and a half old dog. 

So now I am in a foreign country during August where the city is basically empty and everyone has holidays for the whole month (mostly because it gets incredibly hot), I have to move out in 2 weeks ideally although she agreed to at least try and make it work so I can stay the next month 2 more weeks so I can move because we pay rent on the 15th which is weird since most people do on the 1st, I have practically no friends here, no family here either and I don't have money to pay for a deposit anywhere. 

Of course I have reached out to my family for help but their help is limited, the only way I could afford living here was because of the scholarship, I use to live in the school's residence before, and now because with my now ex-girlfriend we would do some work ( I can work something like less than part time legally on the student permit so no one really hires you ) and so I would make a bit of extra money to afford my half of the rent and some food. 

Her parents helped us out, or her, with the dog's food and would sometimes buy us some things to fill the fridge which I was and still am very grateful for. Mostly because they understood my situation and even they then allowed for their daughter to move in with me. 

We were doing great, we had plans and dreams of course but now she doesn't want a thing to do with me, we are not in awful terms or nothing, we once broke up before and it got ugly but we fixed things and so we stayed together for another year now, so now it feels like I guess I don't want to go through all that again, and I guess also her. 

She wants to rebuild her life, go out with friends and all those things one should do. I should too but I am here in an empty city with no friends and no one really to talk to or go out with. 

Going back home is not an option because the price of flying plus I could use any money I could get on a deposit for a room somewhere instead of trying to escape back home. I think it would only make coming back that much harder. 

I understand things come to an end and I am very, very sad about it but what makes it worse is this feeling of being alone, not having even enough money to fix my living situation or even being able to phone home. 

This feeling is eating my alive and I have no idea how to deal with it. I know things will eventually get better, I have faith and I don't want to cry myself to sleep or anything, also not in front of her. But I feel I am in a position where I have no options, no one around me who cares about me and unfortunately in a bad economical situation to help myself. 

I want to convince myself that I am making things sound worse than they are so to have some drive in me to move and try to fix my life but at the same time I know even if I found a place to move I can't afford a deposit. Last semester I sold the one expensive thing I owned to pay for school and so now that is not an option either. 

I am missing one semester, maybe two depending on my internship and I don't want to go back home feeling like I failed to get this done. And I also don't know where to start to rebuild my life without what I thought was already a solid foundation; I had a girl, a flat we shared, a dog and many dreams together... 

Just sharing this hopefully will get some feelings off my chest, sorry for the wall of text and thank you for listening (reading)."

3f7466,137,2015-07-30,My (21M) adopted sister (27F) has disabilities and her current behavior is tearing my family apart,xgeua,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3f7466/my_21m_adopted_sister_27f_has_disabilities_and/,"This was a bit longer then I was planning, sorry

TL;DR: My adopted sister has a physical disability and is starting to display some pretty paranoid behavior that is causing extreme tension and screaming in my house every night. We have tried everything that we know of to help her but nothing is working.


So my parents adopted my sister when she was 3 (before I was born) because she has pretty sever disabilities (physical and mental) and her birth mom did not have the resources or motivation to support her at all. So she became my parents first child and everything seemed like a fairy tale. My parents are great parents and she was always very grateful for their compassion and for the opportunities that they had given her. This ended during her senior year of high school. 

This might be a good point to explain what kind of disabilities she has. So she has cerebral palsy that was caused by her biological mother's drinking and drug abuse while she was pregnant. So she needs crutches to get around and has a slightly lower intelligence but can easily take care of herself (cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc.) but has an extremely low social intelligence. She has the biggest problem talking to strangers and has never really had any friends at school. But she was always generally a quiet girl until her senior year of high school. In my state, there are assessment tests that everyone needs to pass in order to graduate high school and my sister just could not pass these tests. My parents and her teachers tried everything they could to help her, such as hiring tutors or going through example questions at night, but after trying for 2 years she gave up and left high school without a diploma. She took this extremely hard and started having the assumption that she was mentally challenged because of it and starting calling herself ""retarded"" as an excuse for everything.

So since she did not have a high school diploma and was limited in traveling because she could not drive, she spent the next couple years at home. She would listen to music all day in her room and would refuse to leave her room except for coming out to eat dinner. This went on quietly until I went off to college. My brother and I both go to different out of state schools, and my sister started to yell at my parents that they hated her for letting us go to college and not letting her go also. Which started to lead to arguments almost every night about how she thought my parents taking advantage of her intellectual disability and treating her like a ""retarded"" kid. So my parents tried to get her several volunteer jobs but every single one would tell her to not come back after a couple days because of her horrible attitude and because she would just yell about how everyone is taking advantage of her and accused everyone of talking about her behind her back. So eventually she stopped going to volunteer jobs and went back to listening to music all day in her room. 

Fast forward to the start of this summer. I was back home because I had an internship in the area.  The first night that I was home I was on the phone with my girlfriend talking about nothing important and I hear a banging on my wall (I share a wall with my sisters room). So I walk over to her room and ask if everything is alright and she just starts screaming at me things like ""I know you are fucking talking about me and just to let you know I am not retarded, I just think a little bit slower"". I tried to explain to her that I would never call her retarded and that I wasn't even talking about her. So that kind of paranoid delusional behavior started to get worse and worse. She started yelling out the window  stuff like ""stop calling me retarded"" and ""stop looking at me"" but there wasn't anyone there, so my parents start taking her to the doctor and a psychologist and since she is over 18 my parents were not present when she talked to the doctors. During one of the visits the doctor asked her if she would like to voluntary sign into the hospital because he thought she was displaying some really troubling behavior . The next day the police show up to our house and tell us that at the hospital she had claimed that we were trying to kill her and that we refused to give her food (which is obviously not true) and police realized that and ended up leaving with out incident but that was still really troubling to us that she would tell people that. So the next day she is released from the hospital and ever since that day she has screamed at my parents every night that she has not slept in 10 months and that we are trying to kill her. She screams that she hopes that my parents die of cancer, and that they are both alcoholics and drug addicts. And even called the police on me because she can hear me ""smoking heroin"" in my room. Since she left the hospital she has seen 3-4 different psychologists that all refuse to see her now because she just yells the entire time and claims that they are trying to poison her when the give her medicine. 

My parents are very loving and caring people and they are both extremely stressed all the time by the abuse and attitude that my sister exhibits every single day. I am not really sure what options are available but it destroys me to see my family that was picture perfect and carefree, come down to screaming matches  and anxiety every day. 

I feel bad for saying this but she just seems so ungrateful and has no concept of the value of money and constantly breaks valuable things. I really think the only option is for her to move out into a facility that can help her but I also do not want to give her the impression that we are trying to abandon her. 

I mean, I am not sure what I am looking for by posting this... I guess, does anyone have any insight or advice or guidance?"
3f7crb,2,2015-07-30,Questions about Cisco NAC agent?,corehazard,ECU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECU/comments/3f7crb/questions_about_cisco_nac_agent/,"I'll be going to ECU this fall and have a few questions the Cisco NAC they require you to install to use a Windows PC on the network. 

1. Does the Cisco NAC require you to have Symantec Antivirus or some other expensive AV to be installed and updated, or will just using MSE and keeping up to date work? Do you need to install any AV software if you're running Windows 8 or 10 as they have it built in. 

2. Does the NAC ever cause major annoyances? Does slow down performance when gaming? Does it ever cause important software such as Java to not run properly? 

3. Does it cause any problems for Linux or Chromebooks? Has anyone used Windows 10 and had issues connecting to the network? 

I'll be majoring in Information and Computer Technology and did  it ever cause issues with the remote access software that is needed to do some of the assignments for the IT classes? Overall I guess it isn't really needed, the PCs at my community college which run Windows 7 don't have any AV software installed.  My sister goes to ASU and they don't require AV Software to be installed or Windows kept up to date. The NAC requirement might exist to keep the IT interns at ECU's help desk busy.

3f7f81,3,2015-07-30,[F4M] The Intern,intheofficefun,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3f7f81/f4m_the_intern/,"I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom). 

There will be a fair amount of build-up here, lots of flirting and what not, but make sure your character doesn't come off too strong. I expect a lot of detail, and I will tell you if you do not provide enough. I would like consistency with that detail as well.

3f7p73,2,2015-07-30,[For Hire] Experienced Atmospheric Scientist and GIS programmer Looking for a New Position,jlynnr28,gisjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/gisjobs/comments/3f7p73/for_hire_experienced_atmospheric_scientist_and/,"All,

I'm a meteorologist who has several years of experience with GIS and programming that is currently looking for a new position within the GIS industry after being laid off in June. I have over 3 years of GIS experience that has involved several sectors including, but are not limited to agriculture, insurance, and public sector work (I worked on the National Climate Assessment when I was a GIS intern at University). My work has included both open source and proprietary platforms (ArcGIS Desktop, QGIS, PostGIS, GDAL and OGR) and I have specific experience in data wrangling within GIS and preparing domain specific GIS data for ESRI map services and web APIs (this involved mostly ingesting data into geodatabases and remote hosts, not actual API or map service development). Alongside this I have several years of experience with GIS Python development, and entry level knowledge of JavaScript and web development after I completed a developer Bootcamp in Oklahoma City back in early June before my layoff. Finally in academia I completed an undergraduate research poster presentation for GIS as a part of my internship, appear as a co-author in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate, graduated with distinction in Atmospheric Sciences, and was admitted to the Omicron Delta Kappa National Leadership Honor Society senior year. My final overall GPA was 3.44 after finishing my degree in less than 4 years with 135 credit hours.

Just like so many others in plenty of industries, after my layoff it's hard to find job opportunities after the economic troubles in 2008. Even after securing a good job for a while I'm still facing a tough job market that require skills that I simply do not have (C#.NET, ArcGIS and Leaflet JavaScript libraries, Visual Basic, Photoshop, Smallworld GIS etc.). I have looked on sites such as the GJC and even Indeed and Monster and still I feel like I'm facing a brick wall in the GIS postings I'm finding. I've even tried networking with several people within the GIS industry in both the public and private sectors and still no strong bites. So any leads or tips that anyone here can provide would be greatly appreciated as one of my colleagues (for meteorology though not GIS) got a job through Reddit under the /r/meteorology Subreddit.

Thank you all for the time and I can provide my full résumé if requested.

3f83lj,3,2015-07-30,I [21F] have struggled to have a productive conversation with my boyfriend [20 M] of 9 months about jealousy and his close friend [20F],throwaway_pertater,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3f83lj/i_21f_have_struggled_to_have_a_productive/,"We'll say my boyfriend is Steve and his friend is Jessica.


Steve and I met through a club at our university last fall and I kinda...went for it. It was a big deal because I've struggled with social anxiety and hadn't made any friends since going away to school. Early on he was always telling me about his friends and roommates. I'm usually the kind of person who sincerely doesn't give two shits if someone doesn't like me, but Steve talked about these guys like they were brothers and it suddenly mattered. It scared the shit out of me to meet them but I buckled down and  endured because Steve was and is so worth it. 


I'm so glad for it because for the first time in three years I found myself adopted into a group of people with my sense of humor and interests. I never cared for parties or drinking, which they do spontaneously, but it didn't make me the odd man out like I'd feared. They have always made me feel so loved and welcome in their homes.


Some insight into his group of friends : Most of them know each other from their freshman year dorm; they lived on the same LLC floor. Apparently this was a batshit crazy floor full of pranks and parties and liquor. Steve's sophomore year he moved into a townhouse with two floormates. Because they have the biggest space, this is where they usually have big parties. 


Now onto Jessica's role. When I realized Steve had liked her before we met I asked him about it and it seemed pretty simple. He liked her, she friendzoned him, he moved on. That's understandable. He didn't exist in a vacuum until he met me. I figured if I liked her half as much as I liked the rest of them, we'd get along fine.


For months I'd been told stories and shown pictures with her. No one ever said she was nice, sarcastic, funny, smart, or an asshole. Every time her name was mentioned, someone would have to tell me about how ""on-her-ass drunk"" she gets. 


I am absolutely NOT judging her for her drinking - I drink at their parties as well. What sticks out to me is that that seems to be the only thing about her anyone can say. This girl seems to have no personality otherwise. Every story about her involves throwing up, blacking out, crashing at Steve's place (up to 3 weeks), and forcing Steve out onto the futon because she passed out on his bed. Some of these stories come from Steve, some told to me by his friends with Steve present, so he's not denying them. But I do think these stories are reasonable cause for feeling jealous.


When she and I actually got to meet it was lackluster at best. We went out to eat with a group and she dismissed every effort I made to talk. She only gave polite, minimal responses and it stirred up a lot of stress for me. Afterward we all ended up back at Steve's and it turned into a low key party which is how they ended up playing a strip drinking game. This caused some stress and I hid in Steve's room for a while due to a panic attack. Later I came down and joined the rest, quietly watching another story about her getting drunk and sloppy unfold. By the end of the night she was in her skivvies making out with another girl for attention. It was not a pleasant evening for me overall.


Since that night, I've tried bringing it up a few times to Steve that I feel jealous...but it doesn't develop into an actual discussion. I don't know how to bring up the subject other than to say ""Hey...so I'm kind of jealous of Jessica."" To which he replies ""Uh, okay."" I want the conversation to go somewhere but I don't know where. There is nothing comforting about ""Uh, okay."" And for my part, just stating that doesn't give him much to go on. The reason this discussion got dropped for a while is that shortly after that night she went out of state for an internship. So she was gone for half of the spring, the summer, and she'll be coming back to campus this fall. They're still close friends and I think they still talk regularly. And I'm still adamant that I should at least try to make an effort with someone who matters to Steve.


So I guess it boils down to a few things. First of all, how can I initiate and carry out a more productive conversation regarding my jealousy? No matter how I broach the subject I feel like I sound unreasonably paranoid. I trust Steve, and to be fair I don't know her well enough to say I will never trust her, but if he just validated my feelings it would be a huge comfort. And moving on from that, this girl is going to become a regular part of his life again and subsequently mine. How can I try to reach out to her so we get along? I know it's not obligatory, but I think it's a step in the right direction.


TLDR: My boyfriend is still close friends with a girl he liked for a year. I've only had a few chances to get to know her but a combination of their aloofness and what I've gathered about her personality has me concerned and jealous. I've tried talking to him about this but the conversation has never gone anywhere."

I apologize if I have broken the rules, I don't think I did from what I read.

To preface I've spent way too long in College. I graduated HS in 2006, then with a general associate in 2009. Finally I just graduated with general BS in Physics this past May. Now I am entering my Senior year in ME.

I spent the last three years applying to many different places for internship position to no avail. I never even got an interview for any position.

So going into my final year as a ME student, should I be focusing on trying to get an internship or should I be focusing on getting a full time entry level position?

Also anything I can do to improve my chances? I've tried going to career fair and networking, I don't seem to have any luck with those. I know a major weakness of mine is I am terrible at writing cover letters.

With the huge variety of engineering positions is there any particular recommendation for a type of position that is an even mixture of field and office work.

If anyone want any more information feel free to ask. Thanks for reading.

Also I have sent an email to try and setup an appointment with my campus career counselor but no response "
3f8f0m,2,2015-07-30,My anxiety is ruining my chance of finding a job,TheCrimsonBird,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3f8f0m/my_anxiety_is_ruining_my_chance_of_finding_a_job/,"I recently graduated with a bachelors from a big state university. I didn't do much while I was there, only a few organizations here and there and couldn't land an internship, admittedly to lack of motivation. I didn't get amazing grades and I don't have much on my resume at all, it was hard to even fill out a whole page. 

I've been applying to jobs every day religiously for a couple months, but I haven't found any that will let me use my major (a science). I only got offered a couple interviews with not so good results, I totally tensed up BAD.

About a week ago, I go on my university's page that helps with job searching and came across a position as a research scientist at a nearby ivy league medical school. I apply randomly because I was out of things to apply for. Bam, got an email for an interview. I am NO WHERE near qualified, even though they viewed my resume.

I was freaking out before the interview, I was really gagging/dry heaving in my car because I thought they were going to laugh at me for my lack of experience. I went into the interview, was in and out in 30 minutes. I kind of blacked out during the interview because I barely remember anything I said. I know I said a couple questionable things that made the interviewer stop and think and these points stuck with me. She laughed when I said I had no experience in some specific laboratory technique and opened her eyes large. On my 40 minute drive home, I was breathing heavy and screamed at myself for being stupid the whole ride. Got really stuck in my head and couldn't stop thinking about how much of a fool I made myself, or if I even did.

Fast forward a day, she actually emails me back, I can't open it for about an hour, she asked for my transcript and academic references. My transcript sucks (I failed a class), and I didn't make any amazing academic references really, just friendly with professors/TAs in lab. I scribble together a list of people who probably didn't know me (always 250+ people in my classes) but I considered them the ""closest"" and just sent it. Felt really down about myself because it just makes me feel not good enough.

Fast forward to today, she emails me and says ""do you have time next week to meet with dr. blah"". Dr blah is the fucking director/president of the whole section of the medical school/is the manager of the 10+ floor laboratory building. I'm on the verge of cancelling the interview because I'm so nervous of being thought to be stupid.

I know I'm supposed to always apply to positions you want because you never know, but I'm getting physically ill from this process. I know that even in some miracle if they offered me the position, I would feel on edge every day and not good enough. It's all I think about and it's making me terrible, sweating, going to the bathroom so often, blurting out words like 'fuck' randomly, just not good. I don't want to ruin my chances, but this whole thing is breaking me down."

Will that change?,skeletorator,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/3f8qj6/network_engineers_i_dont_feel_creative_will_that/,"I have been interning for a network engineer at my university for the whole of this summer providing infrastructure support for the CS college. It's been an invaluable experience for me, no doubt. I now have a strong foundation in Unix commands, use of ssh (GNU screen and the dos/dont's), Cisco switch practices/commands galore, and I've been ingrained with what's important in large network infrastructures (clear documentation of what nodes are communicating with one another, making hardware installation decisions based on what you think is going to happen with the things your connecting in the future, and not what will get you going the fastest right now, etc.)

All of this aside, I haven't really felt very creative at all during the
internship. Most of what I do is patch ports in a student lab for the fall, register servers on the DNS, jump cables from panel to panel, configure new switches, etc. What I'd like to do is design infrastructure and map out the way that the network should behave. My boss definitely does more advanced work, and even does some mapping for anticipated additions to the infrastructure, but mostly they just keep the network alive and well.

My question is: am I in a place that will prepare me for designing the kind of infrastructure that I'm currently supporting? Does any of the information I'm learning help for that kind of work, or is the kind of thing I'm talking about fall more along the lines of theory?

And for any of the network engineers on this sub, do you get to be creative at your job? Should I be looking at a different job?

I'm a 22 year old male, 5'11, and 160 lbs. I've been having left side abdominal pain for six months and have been diagnosed multiple times with no success at a cure. 

I've lost my sense of appetite and can go days without eating without feeling hunger. It hurts to pee quite often, and I have a lot of different types of irregular stools (ranging from skinny/goopy, hard ball shaped, and sometimes pale/grey in color [this happened when I took probiotics for a week or so at an attempt to feel better]). The pain can be dull but is mostly strong and my abdominal always feels bloated. 

First I was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and was given enzyme pills that did nothing but upset my stomach even more. I went in to get a CT scan as well as an endoscopy about a month ago. Doctors thought it was my gallbladder but it looked normal as well as the rest of my organs. My blood has also been checked for hepatitis and it came back negative. Also no gallstones or kidney stones were seen on the CT.

The only thing that doesn't look normal are my high levels of bilirubin and that I am producing fatty stools. I'm away on internship and have been trying to get another appointment but to no avail and have no one to turn to. 

Will this long period of time of high bilirubin levels and loss of hunger cause permanent damage on my body? Does anyone have a clue of what it could be with my symptoms and my history of procedures?

I belch to relieve pain sometimes so maybe gas is getting trapped in there??

The faint smell of burnt spaghetti is in the air. 

My sweat slick body stumbles out from the rafters toward the bathroom and I vomit last nights 3 day old pizza from the break room. I begin to dress in clothes that haven't been washed in weeks, it doesn't matter. Not like I have any human co-workers to bother. 

I check my phone. 

35 missed calls. 

*oh no... please god no!*

I run down corridor after corridor, down and down. 

My callused bare feet slapping the linoleum floor, it's 3 A.M. and no one is back to work on chroma skins. 

I finally hit the lowest floor. 

I slam my arm into the DNA registrar, and the first door hisses open to the airlock. 

I step inside after leaving my clothes on the basement floor outside. 

I am deloused and receive a radiation scrub, destroying any and all germs and particles on my body. The intense heat begins to make me dizzy, thankfully there is nothing left in my digestive system. 

The second airlock hisses open. 

I step inside and immediately notice slowly bubbling marina sauce everywhere, *oh god the server is overloaded! Shit!* I begin to wade through the sauce. 

I can barely see through the haze, but as I penetrate deeper into the programming chamber I notice the breathing isn't as even as it should be. It sounds labored, as though constricted. 

The heat is unbearable! *Did the power go out while I slept?! How is the coolant system off!? We could have our meltdown on our hands!*

""Hay buddy? Everything Okay?"" 

""HUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTSSSSSSSSS!"" yelled the sentient spaghetti code. 

""I know it hurts, I know. Can you tell me where it hurts?"" I ask tentatively. 

""I DON' KNOW!  HURTS! HURTS!"" 

""Okay buddy, I'm going to check the server room and see if everything is okay, I'll be right back okay?"" 

The spaghetti began to whimper,""No go! NO GO! HELP!"" 

""I'm trying to help you but I have to check to see if the servers are hurting you, will you let me go?"" 

It whimpered out it's affirmation and I pushed through the fog to the server room. 

I find the door at the very back and immediately notice something wrong, the smell is all wrong. 

It's always putrid, but this seems just a different kind of putrid. 

I crank the lever to open the solid iron gate and I hear the worst sound I could possibly hear in my line of work. 

*Silence.* 

I pull the torch off the wall and strike it with a reserve match and look into the server rooms. 

I descend into the stinking darkness and as my eyes adjust I check the cages. 

All the cages are empty or are filled with skeletal corpses on their running wheels. 

*Did those idiots upstairs fire my intern and not tell me?! HE FED THE SEVERS!* 

I climb on top of a row of cages and scan across the room and am met with nothing but the smell of rotted flesh of millions of hamsters from millions of cages and a deafening silence. 

""Oh no... oh no..."" 

I run to the back room to the emergency phone and dial Tech Support.

""THE SERVERS ARE DEAD!""

""Would I be calling you right now if they were anything but corpses?! We need damage control! Please make some shit up to the bosses while I try to get some new hamsters. I think I can restart the cloning tanks but it will take at least a day to be back to half our operational status, maybe less if I tap into the CLG fines for fuel."" 

As I hear affirmation in my ear I see a trail of dried blood and I see the interns eviscerated corpse, days old now propped against the CLG fine pile. 

I follow the trail and above him, written in 27 different languages says 

""VOLDEMORT HAS RETURNED"" 

I hang up on tech support and dial one of the /r/Leagueoflegends mods. 

""Do you know where Rich- 

""YOU MUSN'T SPEAKETH THE NAME! SPEAKETH THE NAME GIVETH POWER!"" it screamed, agony detectable in it's plea. 

""Do you know where *it* is?"" I ask. 

""Of course! It remains in the RIOT Toxicity camp with XJ9 and now Xaoweixao, it has proven quite resilient..."" 

""Would you mind checking for me? I have a bad feeling."" 

""That's just your anxiety pills wearing off, but I'll humor you."" and a slight hiss was all that kept me company in the dank underbelly of RIOT games. 

A few minutes later. 

""We don't know how he got out! Lyte said the chamber could contain literally Hitler!"" 

""Oh my god..."" 

I hear the sound of chains and the sudden sound of the iron door slamming down on the server room. 

""EH HE HE HE HEEE!"" 

No... it couldn't be! I know that mocking laughter anywhere! 

I scream into the phone ""IT'S A SETUP! GET SECURITY IN HERE NOW!""  

The phone has been dead in my hands since the door closed, severing outside connection, this place will be my tomb. 

I hear through the spaghetti clogged vents,

""Who is in control now Regi?"" 

Screams echo through the vents and I collapse by the intern and Nick Allens legacy, hopeless. 

""So who this is how League of Legends dies... an insane bearded ginger eating the spaghetti code and I'm going to starve here while he does it."" 

Hot tears mist my vision as I rest my malnourished frame on the interns body. 

""I was going to release the Custom Game Singularity Engine today... I was so close. I was almost free."" "
3f98qf,1,2015-07-31,I [19/F] had a fight with my mom [41/F] and she flashed me her underwear. Is this harassment?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3f98qf/i_19f_had_a_fight_with_my_mom_41f_and_she_flashed/,"So about 2 days, I told my mom that I was hungry, and asked if she could make me something to eat (very nicely).

She was laying down in her bed and she said, ""Okay, I'll be down in 15 mins."" I said alright and I went back to prepping for my internship, which was starting the next day.

So about an hour later, I realized that she didn't get me any food, so I go back to her room, and I asked when she was going to make me food.

She started getting angry, and screaming at me for no reason, so I ask her what happened, and she told me, and I quote, ""Make your own damn food, you filthy whore."" 

Then she starts going on about how I probably slept with my boss to get this internship. Now at this point, I'm crying. My mom never said anything like this to me before, and I'm wondering where this is coming from.

So I said to her, ""What? Did you get fired from your deadbeat job today?"" I knew I shouldn't have said that, and I still regret it, but anyway, she took the blanket that was covering her up to her waist, and threw it down, exposing me to her see-through underwear.

I am obviously shocked and disgusted at her, and I just say to her with a disgusted face, ""You need help."" And I walk away.

This was not the reaction she expected (I don't know what she expected, to be honest), and she yelled (while I was walking out), ""You have no shame, do you?"" 

And I say, ""How ironic, coming from *you*.""

So I'm wondering if the way she basically just flashed her vagina at me was harassment? Is it even legal? I don't want to get her arrested, I'm just wondering.

P.S: I would've made my own food if I knew this was going to happen, I usually do. It's just that I was prepping for my internship, and I didn't want to be bothered making a sandwich or something.



   
**tl;dr** my mom and I had a fight about food, and she flashed me her sheer underwear. I'm wondering if this is harassment or even legal."

3f9k1h,2,2015-07-31,Fantastic Fest 2015 - First Wave Announced,neganebulous,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3f9k1h/fantastic_fest_2015_first_wave_announced/,"Fantastic Fest announces the first wave programming lineup for its 11th annual celebration of exciting genre-bending films, including the World premiere of BONE TOMAHAWK with Kurt Russell and Matthew Fox in attendance, a retrospective of Turkish Genre Cinema, and a special Mondo Gallery event and programming series curated by filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn to celebrate the release of his new book Nicolas Winding Refn: The Act of Seeing, which profiles Refn's collection of vintage exploitation-era American movie posters. ""We're very excited about this year's mix of premieres, unique events and a retrospective theme unlike any other featuring audacious and otherworldly Turkish remakes of classic Hollywood films,"" said Fantastic Fest founder Tim League.

See the full list of first wave films below and stay tuned for news on more films and events in the weeks to come. Fantastic Fest takes place September 24 - October 1 in Austin, TX at the Alamo Drafthouse South Lamar.

S. Craig Zahler's existential horror western BONE TOMAHAWK closes out what guarantees to be another furious week of chaos with the director and film's ensemble cast descending on Austin. ""Bringing Kurt Russell back to the Alamo is something we've been trying to do for a long time"" said League, ""And to do it with BONE TOMAHAWK, a quintessential Fantastic Fest film, means we're in for one hell of a closer. Huge thanks to Caliber Media for making it all happen.""

Turkish genre cinema is at the heart of this year's Fantastic Fest, inspiring both feature programming and the festival theme. This relatively unknown school of '70s renegade filmmaking is explored in REMIX, REMAKE, RIP-OFF, which will be receiving its U.S. Premiere with director Cem Kaya in attendance. ''We are delighted to be digging deep into Turkish cinema for a journey of discovery,"" said Fantastic Fest Head Programmer, Evrim Ersoy. ""With its 'filmmaking-at-any-cost' mentality, the sheer insanity of Turkish cinema is a perfect match for Fantastic Fest.""

As part of the Turkish celebration, Fantastic Fest will be screening three seminal films, DÜNYAYI KURTARAN ADAM (aka THE MAN WHO SAVES THE WORLD, aka TURKISH STAR WARS) , YILMAYAN ŞEYTAN (aka THE DEATHLESS DEVIL) and TARKAN VİKİNG KANI (aka TARKAN VS THE VIKINGS). The screenings will be complemented by the attendance of iconic Turkish filmmaker Çetin İnanç and moviestar Kunt Tulgar. ""Due to the high cost of exhibiting American movies, Turkish filmmakers created their own versions of these classics, and with it a new universe of madcap cinema was born. I'm proud to say we've selected some of their wildest rides,"" said Ersoy. In keeping with the Turkish spirit, this year's poster is comprised exclusively of elements from classic Turkish movie art, of which there will be over 60 original movie posters on display at the festival.

Filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn shares his unique collection of rare American exploitation movie posters in the lush new hardcover book Nicolas Winding Refn: The Act of Seeing. Three of the films featured in the book - FAREWELL UNCLE TOM, THE X-RATED SUPERMARKET and MY BODY HUNGERS - were selected by Refn to screen during the opening weekend of Fantastic Fest, followed by a Q&amp;A and book signing.

The Mondo Gallery, located at 4115 Guadalupe Street, will be hosting a special exhibit showcasing 15 of the original posters featured in Nicolas Winding Refn: The Act of Seeing, plus a brand new limited edition poster by artist Jay Shaw inspired by the book and created specifically for the gallery show. Refn will be on hand to sign copies of the book at the gallery during the opening reception, Friday September 25th. The exhibit will run September 25th - September 27th.

""Being a massive fan of Austin, Texas, I consider it a great privilege to join forces with Fantastic Fest and the Mondo gallery to host the exclusive U.S. debut of Nicolas Winding Refn: The Act of Seeing"", said filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. ""I'm excited to show the world this odyssey of rare and exclusive poster art at the festival alongside screenings of some of the films that inspired it.""

I graduate in a year and I feel like this experience is just gonna be the same for my job search. I know lots of other students who get them and it just makes me depressed to know I'm not up there with them. Writing this now because I got declined from yet another position that I got further into than any other before. I just don't see how I can enjoy my senior year when I won't have a job or will probably have a similar experience when I graduate. I have a good GPA and lots of academic project experience and am in a STEM field which is high in demand right now so I just don't know what it is that is holding me back. I've made every effort through networking and self improvement and every failure just makes me more negative. I'm passionate for the field I'm in but I just feel like giving up. However I can't because I have like 90k in student debt to pay off when I graduate. 

Senior year may just be the last happy year I have before true depressing adulthood. "
3f9v59,3,2015-07-31,Having an extremely rough year,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/3f9v59/having_an_extremely_rough_year/,"I graduated college in December and had an internship that lasted until June. I live with my parents and disabled grandma. She is a handful and needs help getting to the bathroom. We are all close though and I've been helping take care of her since I was 17. In January, she had a TIA (mini stroke). It was really scary and threw me off for a while. I missed a part of my internship because of it, but my supervisor was understanding.

In April, I started having difficulty walking and I lost vision in my left eye. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and I've been in a relapse, having new symptoms every 2 weeks, since April. I went to an MS specialist and she let me know that it's much more aggressive than the first neurologist lead on. She wants to switch me to the strongest drug, which has a chance of developing a viral brain infection called PML that will severely disable or kill you.

Following the diagnosis, I let the ball completely drop on my internship. I finished on okay terms but I will not be able to use my supervisor as a reference, making the year long unpaid internship pretty much a waste. I only have one other reference (spent most of college depressed and stayed home a lot).

My sense of balance is very off, so I haven't been able to help my grandma much at all and I really haven't been spending that much time with her. Last week she went to the doctor and had very low sodium levels in her blood. Her legs were very swollen so we brought her back to the doctor. They said to go to the ER. It took 7 hours to be admitted to the hospital. She had congestive heart failure and was treated with a diuretic. She was discharged on Monday.

About 5 minutes after being home, she went unconscious while on the toilet. Back to the ER, waited another 7 hours to be admitted. Now they decided to do all kinds of tests to find out why her sodium level is low. It seems like they are doing every test in the book without really knowing what's going on. Now she keeps saying she isn't on a rush to go home because she doesn't want us to find her unconscious again, but she is obviously miserable there and hasn't been able to sleep. It's very hard to see her so sad and helpless.

I feel very bad for her and I feel very guilty for not taking care of her recently in the months since I was diagnosed. She is going to be 80 tomorrow and had no health problems until now. Once she gets home, it's going to be much harder with the bathroom situation since she is on diuretics and can't always tell when she has to go now. We are going to get a home health aide to help but nobody is crazy about the idea of having a stranger in the house. I'm worried they won't treat her kindly or will try to steal.

To top it all off, the MS medication I'm on now makes me extremely depressed. 

I just wanted to vent because nobody I know seems to understand how hard this is. I've been told to move away and forget about my family so I can enjoy my life while I'm young. I think that's horrible. "
3f9x17,5,2015-07-31,"My [22F] BF [23M] hid his girlfriend for half our relationship, and might be cheating again. Need advice!",throwaway938829,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3f9x17/my_22f_bf_23m_hid_his_girlfriend_for_half_our/,"Hello guys! This may be a bit long, but I hope you can take your time to read because I really need your advice!

I have been together with my boyfriend for 1 and a half year now, it started as a normal relationship but became long distance after he moved back to his country when his internship in my university came to an end. The relationship has been wonderful for the most part, seriously head over heels for this guy and I never actually thought you could love someone so deeply. Since the beginning of our long distance it has usually been me who has been going over there to visit (every month for 2 weeks minimum, or sometimes for shorter periods of time when i just couldnt stand being without him so i chose to surprise him and spend ridiculous amounts of money to go and see him). Our first real issue started roughly 7 months into the relationship, when I found out that he had been hiding the fact that he was still with his previous girlfriend, never broke up with her. During the start of our relationship i jokingly asked her about this girl that he texted so much with, thinking nothing bad of it. And he just said that it was a good friend of his, and that was that. Later on he revealed that it was actually his ex-girlfriend, to which I expressed that I do not feel very comfortable with him talking to his ex. He understood and we agreed that he wouldnt talk to her anymore. I am aware that perhaps this was too much to ask and was a bit bitchy, but bare with me, i had my gut feeling. So 7 months later I feel that something is wrong, as I have done for a long time and I decide to look through his facebook (1 week before that he actually told me that if i was feeling any worry i was welcome to look through his facebook because he had nothing to hide). He left his computer at home one day when he left for work, because he didnt want me to be bored and he said I could use it. So, I read through his facebook messages and saw her name. I instantly reacted since their last conversation had been about 1 month ago, and he claimed that he had stopped talking to her 6 months prior. I read through their messages and it became very clear to me that he actually never broke up with her, he just left for his internship to my country, and let her believe that they were still together. Which means that ever since the  beginning of our relationship, he was still dating someone else. This obviously broke my heart, not only had he lied but it was also kind of cheating. I confronted him about this, also apologizing about the fact that i intruded on his privacy. And he told me that he was truly sorry and he nevermeant for me to find out this way, that he never told me in the beginning because he never actually thought that he would meet someone that he would fall for, and when he had fallen for me he didnt want to ruin it by telling me that he hadnt broken up with his previous girlfriend. He told me that to him the relationship was over a long time ago, that before him leaving for his internship abroad he barely had any physical contact with her and that to him it was truly, truly over. He just didnt want to hurt her feelings because he was scared that she could hurt herself if he did break up with her, so he just did it subtly over a long period of time thinking that she would just get tired of speaking to him without getting much of an answer (his answer in the messages were pretty cold and short) and eventually just get the hint and go away. I chose to forgive him for this, mainly because he claimed that he hadnt met her since he left and that nothing was going on, and because I read the messages myself and could see that he was being very cold to her, so I thought that perhaps it was nothing to worry about. But I was still very hurt about the fact that he lied to me for 7 months. So, all was forgiven but I was quite hurt for several months, and very paranoid. Everytime he took up his phone I thought that he was talking to some girl, cheating, whatever. 

So time went by, and the whole situation was just getting better. I started to trust him again, and everything was great. But the paranoia was still there, I know that he has a past with cheating on his previous girlfriends, he has told me that himself. And its nothing that he feels guilty about, he doesnt regret it, which is something that worries me. He just says that ”I cheated because I obviously didnt feel satisfied in the relationship, there is always a reason to why you cheat”. 


Fastforward to, today. I have been feeling that things have been a bit off so as the paranoid girlfriend I am I decide to go through is phone. Now, he had some plans this weekend to go visit his friend that he hasnt seen in a while. He has been very  hesitant about it, saying that he didnt really want to leave me alone for the weekend and that he didnt really feel like going since its a long way. I encouraged him to go, thinking that its good friend of his that he hasnt seen in a while and that I do not want to prevent him from having fun, thats just the start of an unhealthy relationship and I wanted us to be happy. So, he decided to go. But today, when I looked through his phone, I saw that he is making these weekendplans with, a girl, not his friend that he told me about. I was obviously really upset about this, and did not know how to react. So I took out my luggage to pack my things and go back home (Im staying at his place during August until I start university again in september). After this I just started crying, and his reaction to that was just saying that he thinks I might seriously be Bipolar, because i always do things like that (packing my bags and threatening to leave when im really upset) and that I always go from perfectly okay to really sad. I explained to him that I’m really not being bipolar, I’m just really upset. He obviously wanted to know why I was upset and I said that I have been feeling that things have been a bit off lately, that he doesnt really look at me with love and that I feel like he might need some space (this is obviously not what it was about, but its also true and something i wanted to let him know). He just said that ”its just a feeling you have” and then left for work. On his way to work he just texted me random stuff like the bus being late, or things like that, not really adressing the issue. So I decided to confront him about the messages I saw, and sent him a really long message saying that I had seen his messaging with this girl, and clearly making these weekendplans with her and not with the friend he had told me about. I also said that if he thinks that the relationship has reached its end, that he should really be honest about it and not let it die out and date other people before he breaks up, because I think he should atleast show me some respect. He replied shortly after, and was quite pissed about the fact that I had gone through his messages, but claimed that this girl was actually his friend that he had told me about. I dont really understand how that makes sense, I do know his friend has a girlfriend but she’s not supposed to be there with him. That is the main reason hes not bringing me along, because his friend lives alone in a small room and I couldnt stay over because my boyfriend thought it would be an awkward experience for his friend. Nothing makes sense and I honestly dont know how to react anymore. I really dont know what to do. I do not want to end the relationship because I really do love him and I guess i may be blinded by love or something.

   
TLDR: My boyfriend hid his girlfriend from me for 7 months and has a long history of cheating and now hes going to meet his friend which turns out to be a girl but he claims this girl is actually his male friend that he told me about from the beginning. Does not make sense to me. "

3fb32c,1,2015-07-31,"Macbook Pro 2015: more RAM, flash storage or faster processor?",luvlettr,applehelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/3fb32c/macbook_pro_2015_more_ram_flash_storage_or_faster/,"Hi /r/applehelp

I'm currently planning on getting a new 13"" MBP. I've been slowly integrating Apple products into my life (iTouch and now the iPhone). Having been a Windows user and my current laptop on the fritz I think its high-time to upgrade. The thing is I have no idea which parts to upgrade to better suit my needs.

I'm currently going in my 3rd year undergrad for Biology, and I am anticipating internships and in-school activities that might require editing software/lab work. Besides the standard music/video streaming and web surfing, I plan on potential light gaming on top of finding enough storage for my music/files (but I think I can remedy that with a 1TB external hard drive, no?) Additionally, I want to consider the costs so the cheaper but more optimized the MBP the better!

The question at hand: which specs should I upgrade to better suit my needs and essentially futureproof my laptop? Any advice would be appreciated!"

Making sure my ram is running at full speed

Overclocking the GPU

3fbb0q,4,2015-07-31,Need tips for October!,Torrenturox,VisitingIceland,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/3fbb0q/need_tips_for_october/,"Hey everyone!
After finishing my internship in Germany I'd like to take advantage of being in Europe and hopping over to explore Iceland! The goal is to explore the entire country with an itinerary following the Ring Road like this one:

http://www.hostel.is/SampleItineraries/IcelandComplete/

And hopefully staying under 3000 USD, but I can be a little flexible there.

I would be arriving mid October and leaving around the very end of October or early November. The idea of renting a campervan sounds really exciting so I would like to take that path.

I know how to drive manual and I've had some experience with snow. But, does it really snow much in October? I know the weather can be quite unpredictable. I've been looking at the basic rentals from HappyCampers and KuKu, but KuKu has me worried for I don't see heating for their vehicles and I don't want to freeze at night while sleeping. I'm not planning on going into the interior, so I'm not opting for a 4x4. Is this okay for the whole road?

I'm planning on making most of my food, so would a total food budget of about 250 cover me for the two weeks?

How much would most activities cost? Things such as diving, hot springs, parks, museums, etc. What's a decent budget for this?

One final concern is that my flight would be arriving at about 1 am. What could I do in Iceland in the meantime?

Thanks for the help and any other suggestions would be incredibly appreciated!"
3fbr2d,2,2015-07-31,Words can't describe how tired I am of waiting to start my life.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3fbr2d/words_cant_describe_how_tired_i_am_of_waiting_to/,"I'm going into my senior year of high school so of course I've been meeting with guidance counselors about planning my post primary education and all that jazz. About 3 months ago after much thought and consideration I decided EXACTLY what I want to do and the steps necessary to put that plan in motion. 

I'm a great student going to a great school in great city for a major in something I love and with great career prospects along with so many awesome clubs and internships. I'm able to do this without the burden of tuition too through their ROTC program so I can also proudly serve my country as an officer in the U.S. Army like I've always wanted and see somewhere other than my bum-fuck town and meet amazing and diverse new people like I've only imagined and have the tools and skills to build a future to provide for my family.

I'm so excited for this, I literally wake up yearning for this life I want so badly so I can escape the one I have now and never come back.

I'm tired of struggling financially  living with my alcoholic-ass father and near absent, condescending and unsupportive mother, neither of whom have EVER taken the initiative to better their lives or try to be a proper role model. I'm tired of going to school with and seeing the same people for my whole life knowing I've never fit in or belonged. I'm tired of shit friends who feel less like real friends, instead just acquaintances. 

I'm so tired of being the black sheep with so much charisma, compassion, or ambition when I feel like it's all bottled up because there isn't anyone I can share it with.

It's the end of July, and since school let out in early June, this summer has taken for-god-damned-ever. To think I have another year of waiting when one month seems to stretch forever is EXCRUCIATING, knowing I get to have what I want but I have to wait for it.

Sorry if this sounds like a pity party or looking for sympathy. I intended to convey how pumped and anxious I am to begin anew and actually do something with my life but its exhausting having to wait."

I grew up and still live in the upper mid-west where people still live by the saying ""it's good to be down to earth."" In my early days  I attended k through 8th grade in a school that averaged around 40 students total which meant I only had 2 or 3 in my actual grade. Aside from having so few fellow students, they usually came from families much wealthier than I which made it hard to fit in. I feel my parents meant well by sending me to this school but I can't help but feel it's part of the reason I lack social skill. Moving on to high school I changed schools and joined a class of around 300 students in my grade which was a nice change but I feel it was too little too late. I managed to survive and graduate but struggled to have any meaningful friendships. I still struggle with having social skill but I feel it contributes to the next area in my life that I feel stuck in which is having any sort of career path. I feel if I were better at building friendships or articulating my thoughts I could get advice from friends on what to do or be more capable of moving around in a company.

Moving on to the next thing that is weighing me down is not having any sort of ""career path."" I've grown up around residential construction but after graduating high school I wanted to work on cars. I found a job at a body shop but made the stupid mistake of being late too many times and got canned. After that I did some more body work along with working in the usual after high school places like retail and motels but in an attempt to gain some painting knowledge that would carry over to cars I got a job in the paint department in a factory. I did my best to learn anything I could but was never given the chance to gain any knowledge in painting. This along with the slow down in 2008/2009 I was faced with the choice of either get laid off or go back to school, which I chose to go back to school.

I decided to try and find a ""career path"" that wasn't centered around manual labor and decided to get an associates that works with distributive control systems, an operator of an ethanol plant is the easiest example to give. Looking back it was a terrible decision to pick a program that wasn't proven and I didn't know much about but there was so much hype surrounding the program. I was told by many people that I could get a job as a dispatcher for a power marketing administrator or operate a power plant when in reality my diploma holds no merit and I'm surprised the program hasn't been shut down. When people try and defend the program I took I just bring up their job placement record. In the first 4 graduating classes with a maximum enrollment of 25 students they could of graduated 100 students. Instead only 12 students graduated and only 4 of us got jobs related to the program and one student only got a job after continuing his education elsewhere. When it comes down to it, the jobs I can get with this so called degree I don't need a degree for and the jobs I want I don't come near qualifying for. I would have been better off self learning electrical and becoming NERC certified myself rather than paying thousands of dollars for this useless degree. Since it was required to graduate I got an internship operating an e-coat system which was nice because it meant I could graduate but the internship turned into the most miserable job I've ever had for 4 years. The automated system I ran was pretty reliable and required very little babysitting which meant I was expected to  spend about 80% of my time cleaning or doing repetitive paperwork. I freaking hate both of these duties. On top of that my hours constantly changed, I was guilt tripped into working 6 days a week and almost every paid holiday. The final straw was when I was on an afternoon shift and wanted to be on days, a day shift opened up and they gave it to somebody else. I started to look for a different job. I could have tried looking for something related but many of the places I toured seemed similar, hours that weren't steady, babysitting an automated system, cleaning and boring paperwork. I completely understand that some people love this type of work but I learned two things from operating an automated system; I'm much happier when I get to build things and when my job has steady hours. I ended up getting a job building a certain type of truck. I'm far happier than in my previous job but it's still mediocre and I feel I have no future here. I work next to guys that have been there 30 years and we build the same trucks so to me it feels like a dead end job instead of a career. Along with this there have been some management changes which means my hours won't be steady and the trucks we build will be pre made parts ready for assembly instead of fabricating parts ourselves. On the bright side I have learned to be on time. I'd never admit it to anyone in person but I'm pretty proud of having perfect attendance for almost 2 years.

I'm at the point where I would love to have a career where I could learn a skill and continue to build on that skill. I have basic knowledge of mechanical things, machining, g-code, automation, welding, CAD etc. I'd love to have a job that mixed machining, fabrication and design but I have no idea where to go from here. I also feel that my lack of social skill means I don't interview well and would have a hard time moving up in a company. The companies I have worked for hard work only gets you more hard work, but if you work hard and are a smooth talker you can move up. I'm not against some kind of schooling but have no idea what it would be. Along with that I feel my two previous attempts at a ""career"" were total flops so yes, I'm scared I'll attempt to have a career and be worse off than I already am.  

The other area in my l feel stuck in is... I despise the cold and I live in a region where it's cold nine months of the year. Sure I can handle the cold but it's definitely not my preference. On top of that my dad is entering his second battle with cancer and I would feel like an asshat if I moved away. It would be awesome to solve the location and career problem at the same time but I've gone over different scenarios in my head many times and I have no idea what to do next. 

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this and may offer some advice. I know I'm not the greatest at grammar an formatting so I hope it's pretty close."

I'm a grad with a few internships under my built in ad agency account handling, marketing and production. 

I've been interviewing at some ad agencies with no big break just yet, with a few more on a slow burn. However, I just got a job offer to work at a media agency on a short term contract until December.  My end goal is to move into account handling at a creative agency but I need some work to earn money now. 

I was wondering if this job would alter my chances at getting an account executive role down the line or be something I could spin as a selling point. Also scared of looking like a job hopper.

3fc9cu,0,2015-07-31,Read this post about a stranger(1),valcavia,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3fc9cu/read_this_post_about_a_stranger1/,"It's me, I'm the stranger. I'm gonna write about myself. Consider it a public diary. Don't get mad. 

I just turned 19. I'm a girl. I go to MIT. Well I did. Before I got kicked out for at least a year for academic leave. I never did my homework. Didn't think I was smart enough. Well now I know that smart wasn't the issue. It was my work ethic. I'm going to try and improve that. I'll re-apply to MIT in the spring, so wish me luck. It's always been my dream school.

I'm a computer programmer or at least I like to think I am. I'm alright at Python and Java and C# right now. I'm making games in Unity right now. They're really fun to make. I wanna get more involved in programming projects because that's the best way to learn. My summer internship is almost over but it was 11 weeks of making apps. It was pretty fun. I was the Lead Programmer of my app. I love programming, but I wish I didn't have to listen to other people's game ideas. My game was fun to program but the end result was not so great because I had no say over the actual game design. I had an idea I was really excited about and I pitched it, but the head of the internship put me on a different team because he said I was ""too passionate"" about my idea. I guess passion is a bad thing in the video-game world?

That's why I look up to Notch. Making minecraft (in the beginning) all by himself. That's really cool. I want to make a game that popular. I don't know where to start. I have a pretty obsessive personality. I had a runescape phase and a skyrim phase and an assassin's creed phase. I'd like to make an MMO, or any RPG, but I guess I'll start out with apps. Right now I'm programming a sci-fi temple-run-type game (you can run up walls though!) so that's really fun.

I want to be great when I grow up. I was always told I was really gifted growing up. That's not the best thing to tell your kid. But the fact that I'm lazy is my fault, and no one else's. Maybe I'll start working out all the time to cause some cognitive dissonance. How could I be lazy if I'm always working out?

I'm pretty fit. Or at least pretty skinny. I'd say I'm pretty healthy too, I ran track and cross country in high school and did crew for the first semester of college. People think I'm attractive. A lot of boys do at least. It's conceited and arrogant to think you're attractive but it's okay, I can tell my diary. I have a lot of specific things I find wrong with my appearance. I try and wear makeup to look better but sometimes I don't wear makeup and it feels just fine.

I seem to not do super-well with guys. I push people away when they start liking me. Today I'm a bit sad because I was broken-up with. I was dating this guy I suppose, and he's really religious. His parents always told him to break up with me because I'm not the right religion, by blood or by belief(I'm an atheist). I don't know why I liked him so much. When I first met him I didn't think he was very attractive and there were other guys going after me. I guess I just wanted him because of the forbidden-fruit aspect though.

We argued a lot. He broke up with me at least 4 other times. We always got back together. We might get back together this time too. I don't know. I sort of want to, but I guess I'm pretty clingy. I hope this entry doesn't make me look really bad. I'm trying to distract myself right now. I can't code as well when I'm sad so I've been trying to watch netflix to distract myself.

I know boys shouldn't be such a distraction. It's hard enough for me to concentrate on coding and I absolutely love coding. When it's school-time again, it's gonna be pretty hard to study and stuff if we're always fighting. I don't know what the solution to that is. Do I just abstain from boys until I'm done with school? Do I get less attached? Do I date more than 1 person so I always have a backup?

I don't really want to date a lot of people. I just want someone I can always talk to. I share everything with my SO's. I'm a serial monogamist, so they're like second brains to me. See how much I've typed about this? One day I want to start a company. I want to make awesome video games or do something amazing with tech. I want to get back into my dream school. I want to change the world! But I'm just talking about a boy who doesn't like me. I wish human emotions weren't so hard to control.

My emotions are also largely dictated by food. I'm hungry now, so maybe that's why I'm not in as good of a mood. Maybe I'm writing this entry because I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to anymore? Maybe I go on my computer too much. My work is computer related. My leisure activities are computer-related (reddit and netflix) and my social communication is computer-related.

I'm going camping this weekend. So that's good, right? It's not really camping, we're gonna be in a cabin. But it's still by a lake. It'll still be really fun. I went there last weekend with just two boys. They both tried to kiss me in the past few weeks. One of them has a long-distance girlfriend. I refused both of them. I usually do, but this thing happens sort of often when I make friends I guess. (I really hope I don't sound bad or conceited, I'm just stating things.)

I kept hanging out with them because they were my only friends in the program. And I like having them as friends. They're also roommates. Which is weird. But they both know about the other. And we get along pretty well. Maybe I get along better with guys because they have the capacity to be attracted to me. I like having girl friends. They seem more real. And they don't try and kiss me usually.

I didn't kiss either of them and I don't want to. And when I'm single I don't kiss people either. I usually have to be in some sort of longer-term thing. Maybe I take kissing too seriously. I just realized I'm talking about boys again. Okay back to other stuff.

I think I have the capacity for doing something amazing. I'm still figuring things out. I've gotta stop procrastinating so much on things. There's something I ought to be doing right now but I haven't done it. I know how to skateboard. My skateboard is red. Red is my favorite color because it's so exciting.

Is this too long? Is anyone going to actually read this much text? Why would I write so much? The religious guy started crying a lot when he broke up with me so I made myself cry too. I didn't really feel like crying though. He bottles his emotions up too much I think.

Do Bill Gates' exes regret breaking up with him? What about the girl in the Social Network movie. Does she wish she kept dating Mark Zuckerberg? Why do I need that sort of motivation to feel good reason for being successful? What if no matter how successful I am, the boys I want to like me never will?

Okay, I typed a lot. I think I included enough information about me. I might see Mission Impossible tonight. Let me know if you guys have any questions about my life. I have some interesting stories. Maybe I'll write more about those some other time. Goodbye Diary."

3fcl3c,1,2015-07-31,The 2 Year Unemployee + Suspected Asperger's,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3fcl3c/the_2_year_unemployee_suspected_aspergers/,"I debated which one to write about since I have several problems. I warn any readers that these are very long and depressing. I wrote this under a friend's throwaway.

I just turned 22 in April. I call Los Angeles County my home. I see a LCSW and psychiatrist ATM.

However, these issues are currently bugging me the most:

* I graduated from college a bit early almost 20 months ago. Yep, you read correctly. **20 months**, as in nearly two full years.  Ever since then, I have not been able to find a job. I definitely tried pretty much everything I can think of (freelance writing, professional career counselors, talking to my old teachers from previous schools, McDonald's, and even the military but I don't qualify due to a recent cyst surgery and see below). It seems as though I have applied everywhere, but I can't find a job. A dozen places offered me interviews. I didn't pass them. I did volunteer at several places but they were temporary or I got laid off due to the last bullet point. A friend of mine mentions I should have at least tried for an internship while in school. It's too late for that now. It also doesn't help that I majored in the liberal arts, as back then I only wanted to read and write literature. No solid career path. I finally signed up for JobCorps but even they can't start me for at least three more weeks.
* All this stress from not being able to find a job led to severe health problems. I was always bored, and passed my days only at museums, libraries, gyms, psychologist/LCSW offices, malls and restaurants. Constantly, I rushed to the doctor's office or ER complaining of near-suicidal state. I was so bored out of my mind, I had to start texting or calling my friends and family all the time. It doesn't help that I'm very open so I tended to overshare. I feel bad about this. Everyone knows of the situation. The doctors have me on some medicine to reduce such stress.
* I am the type who always needs to keep busy.
* I do have an older sister and she keeps telling me something like, ""I don't understand that. You can't work forever. What about when you retire? A lot of people our age are in the same boat. You are still lucky to have finished school early. ... Work is stressful too, and most people do it only because they need to get money. I would be so happy to relax. You're still young. You have time to figure it out."" My cousins also agreed with her. However, I guess I was just so used to being ahead. The first three weeks were great, then I got really tired of it. Not surprisingly, this is way too different from where I was before. I live with my family. My dad and aunts are pressuring for me to find a job, any job.
* My sister knows everything and she has tried to bring me to several private docs. I also endured a couple hospitalizations. The environment wasn't exactly what I needed, though, since most of them focus more on low-income people or druggies. Our neighbors once eavesdropped on and mocked us, which led to me hearing voices for weeks on end. Probably that is why I was sent to the first psych hospital.
* I start a bunch of tasks and can't finish them. People usually notice I don't want to be where I am, and therefore don't finish the job. Only last year did I pass my written test. I started taking lessons with a driving instructor, but he told me I am a ""slow learner."" I have always been this way, unless it is a subject which interests me. Everyone else was able to start tasks and finish them. I just couldn't stay in. Now I'm worried because I know that I have to start somewhere. One psychologist I saw mentioned that I have such difficulty finding and keeping a job because my body language is rather awkward. My eyes dart around the room, and I generally appear nervous. I've heard the same thing from many people. While I was in school, people did suspect that I had Asperger's. This was dismissed by an IEP, which only showed a slight problem with advanced math. A psychiatrist I saw too noted that while I did have some Asperger's symptoms, it was inconclusive. My friends don't have much to offer either. They think that this is all stuff they have very little experience with. Everyone else we know moved away, got a job, or at least married and had one kid by now.

Usually when people hear about these problems, they say only one of three things: ""Ouch"", ""Wow"", or ""Too bad."" I mean, it is. But I'm working on it. I feel as though time is passing me by, and I'm no longer doing anything productive with it. 

Any thoughts? Suggestions? I really needed to vent.


tl;dr: Well, there isn't a shorter version of this. It's very stressful and I'm not sure where to go from here."

I'm a 22 years old Belgian webdeveloper + graphic designer at Hello Monday. Currently I live in NYC as an intern, but I got hired by Hello Monday to work in the Aarhus office for 1 year.

As I already said, I'm from Belgium so I can't speak Danish, but I really would love to know more about Aarhus because it seems a very cool city to me. 

I'll be there at the end of September, but I heard finding a place can be a hassle, so that's why I'm sending you guys this. 

Thanks anyway!

3fcmvr,1,2015-07-31,Desperately seeking career advice!,armadillo321,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/3fcmvr/desperately_seeking_career_advice/,"Hello Reddit,

I just graduated with a Bachelors in Civil Engineering, and I have a full time position as a staff engineer at a Transportation Engineering firm in New England. Unfortunately, I am not really enjoying the office work style, and I think that I am more interested in working in the construction field. 

I have experience working as an intern at my states DOT doing inspections under a Resident Engineer, and I think that this is the type of work I want to do.

 I recently applied to Jacobs Engineering who has a contract with the state DOT supplying them with construction inspectors. Unfortunately, these positions are only for night work, which I don't see myself enjoying. The interviewer told me that if I accept the position, I would spend the first 1-2 months doing these night DOT inspections on bridge construction, and would then focus on getting a bunch of online certifications over the winter months. He also told me that there are a lot of opportunities to work rail construction and become a field engineer, and eventually a resident engineer. 

My question is, do you think I would really be done with night shifts at a company like this after a few months? If so, I would definitely accept this position. 

I was also thinking that since I am more interested in daytime work, vertical construction might be the best bet for me. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you Reddit!"
